Sometimes our journeys may require us to take the road less traveled , but some passengers may be better off left behind .
They may never forgive you for the harrowing experience that you put them though .
Commonly referred to as “ Death Road ” , the only route western route into La Paz , Bolivia , the road gets its name from its extreme nature .
Narrowing to only five or six feet in certain areas with a total elevation drop of 3000 m in only 80 km , Death Road has certainly earned its reputation .
Fatalities can exceed over 100 annually .
The road is frighteningly tight , slippery and extremely bumpy thanks to a scattering of rocks on its surface .
Despite all of the danger , the scenery is breathtaking .
The beautiful waterfalls easily draw the driver ’s attention away from the 400 m drops over the edge .
Surprisingly , the majority of the traffic fatalities are a result of head - on collisions rather than falls .
At the height of its infamy , Death Road averaged 400 deaths per year .
Death Road has some very interesting history to its credit , with ties to the Nazi regime .
The ride starts in snow capped mountains over 3600 m high and traverses 65 km , ending up at the humid jungle at Coroico .
An animal refuge is located at the end of the road with a wide variety of animals to see and relax with .
Interaction with the animals is encouraged , as long as you are willing to let a monkey crawl on your lap , birds to perch on your shoulder and Coatis to climb all over you !
The road is a haven for mountain biking enthusiasts , although their presence contributes heavily to the death toll .
Most bikers succumb to falls down the near - vertical slopes .
Some accidents are marked with tragedy .
A young girl lost her life after choosing to get off her bike as a car approached .
She stepped too far back to let the car by and tumbled to her death .
One man was far luckier though , escaping his fall with only a concussion and short term memory loss .
Some of the challenges that face bikers on Death Road are the loose gravel , large rocks , waterfalls , jagged cliffs and the tantalizing desire to inch towards the each for a better view down .
Those wishing to tour the road by bike would do well to seek a guide and travel in a group .
Numerous checkpoints exist along the route to check for narcotics such as cocaine as well as equipment that may be used in the manufacturing of various drugs .
A list of banned ingredients and equipment is proudly displayed on a billboard as you pass through the checkpoint .
One wonders whether displaying the necessary components of cocaine is a smart move .
One section of Death Road involves a difficult 20 km uphill climb .
If you have spent your life around sea level and are not in peak cardiovascular health , you may quickly wear out from the thin air .
To add another level of psychological strain , local guides will often pause the trip to explain exactly where and how a biker fell from the road to their death .
With a name like Death Road , it seems almost unnecessary to remind the group to keep a slow pace and remain cautious .
Unfortunately , the only alternate route that was built and paid for by the local government has been closed after only a year due to poor construction .
It can be fun to challenge yourself and leave your comfort zone once in a while .
However , calling Death Road a challenge is a severe understatement .
When battling the slippery road , through rain and fog , the trip can be anything but comfortable .
As you ride down Death Road , the rush of adrenaline is intense .
You may not be able to describe the thrilling experience until you have safely reached your destination .
Some even go so far as to call riding it a death wish .
However , with a careful approach and a little bit of luck , one can enjoy what it has to offer and end up with an amazing life experience .

It is definitely a trip that stands out amongst the typical adventure vacation and is an incredible escape from everyday life .
The intense physical challenge , though brutal and sometimes miserable , often has people clamoring for more .
Just do n’t get too cocky , as an overestimation of your skills and an underestimation of the mountains ’ power is a recipe for disaster .
I have no surname .
In 1979 I made a Statutory Declaration , that henceforth I would be known by only the first two names my parents gave me .
Thus I dispensed with my ex-husband 's family name , and rejected too the option of returning to my father 's name ( I loved him dearly , but I felt sure he would have supported me if he'd been alive ) .
I thought at the time that I was doing something quite simple .
I thought I was proving my independence from men , that as a woman I could stand alone .
Now , 28 years later , at the age of 64 , I am feeling under pressure .
Computers , I am told , just cannot cope .
I have to have a surname - " the computer will not accept a blank " .
As a young woman growing up in the 1950s in north - west London , feminism was unknown to me .
I was Margaret Chalker , and quite happy to be identified by my father 's surname .
Similarly I felt no pang when I married , in 1968 , and swapped Chalker for O'Connor .
But my pleasure at being a " Mrs " was severely undermined early on when I went to buy a spin dryer on hire purchase .
The department store assistant refused to process the sale until my soon - to - be - ex husband had signed the form .
As the main wage earner and previously trusted customer I was enraged , and incandescent later when my husband refused to give his signature .
It was a trivial incident , but it coincided with the growth of the women 's movement - and my growing involvement in it .
The marriage did n't last and we got divorced in 1975 .
For the next few years I continued to use my married name .
But after a while this began to feel absurd .
By the time I divorced I was active in various women 's groups .
I demonstrated at Greenham Common ; marched on " Reclaim the Night " and read feminist literature , from Spare Rib to The Women 's Press and Virago .
I buried myself in my work as an English teacher .
My social life was lived entirely through politics .
It was a stimulating time and , influenced by the American feminist magazine by the same name , I started using " Ms " as my form of address .
It is amusing now to recall how much resistance this caused .
One insurance salesman went so far as to say it was essential to know if a woman was married as divorced women 's cars sustained more damage - caused by their ex-husbands .
These experiences began to coalesce into a wish to be identified not as a wife , nor as a daughter , but simply me .
Naming seemed important globally , too .
I saw Southern Rhodesia pass through several names before the " new " country emerged as independent of colonial power .
For myself , I did consider reverting to my mother 's " maiden " name but this simply led back to my grandfather .
Taking another name at random could lead to another male family tree .
I considered possible neutral options such as " Window Cill " or " Door Jam " but knew I could not take the flak .
Simply dropping both my " daughter " name and my ex-married name seemed the best option .
Besides , my parents had chosen my first two names and it felt respectful to acknowledge their wishes .
Fearing dissuasion , I did not consult my family or friends as I embarked on this very serious , and at times ridiculous , journey around my name .
The headteacher of my south London comprehensive school was supportive ; colleagues adapted and if they had views , I was not informed .
My pupils were curious , respectful and gleeful at the prospect of addressing their teacher by her two first names instead of the more formal Ms O'Connor .
For many of them , family names were already an issue , albeit not overt .
In one school , a third of my year eight pupils had already changed all or part of their names due to their parents ' divorce , remarriage or adoption .
Many from other ethnic backgrounds had anglicised their family names .
So in February 1979 I became Margaret Sandra .
" ( Please use my name in full ) , " I would add in correspondence .
It says a lot about my confidence at that time that I thought I need only ask for the change for it to be easily accepted .
Family and friends have been no problem , though I still get a few Christmas cards addressed to M Sandra .
But banks , utility companies and the like have responded variously , particularly as their levels of computerisation increase .
Getting my name under " M " in the phone book was no problem , though I know of friends who search for me under " S " .
I treasure my passport that recorded my " prenom " as " XXXX " and family names as Margaret Sandra .
At the time I changed my name , I had also largely given up on meeting a permanent partner .
I had liaisons that lasted several years as well as shorter interludes , and in 1986 made a final decision to give up on men .
That was when I re-met Iain .
We were both attending an English teachers ' conference and although we had known each other for more than 20 years , we had never talked at length .
I discovered a kind , perceptive personality .
From the beginning he was an invaluable supporter of my name .
We are still together .
I love him dearly .
Registering as a voter I found myself facing the local chief registrar himself on my doorstep , who blurted out as I opened the door , " Oh , you look quite normal ! "
Actually , I looked normal enough to be elected as a local councillor for 11 years and my electoral window posters had to be extra long to accommodate my name .
The problem is I have begun to feel rather defensive about my name .
I perceive myself as a feminist and I expect others to recognise it .
As a result , I find myself in increasing conflict with companies because their computer systems are unable to process my name .
I have been turned down as a saver by a building society because its computer required me to have both a " Christian name " and a surname .
Less powerful but more irritating is receiving two mail order catalogues , one to Margaret , the other to Sandra , amusing though it is to be perceived as a dynamic duo .
I do n't regret what I did nearly 30 years ago , but I have been explaining myself for so long I 'm almost bored .
Would I have lived a different life if I had n't made this choice in 1979 ?
By 28 I had already had two family names .
Perhaps I needed to draw a line under my marital past and this was a way of starting afresh .
I have been asked if I expected other women to follow my path , and what about their children 's names ?
The only woman I knew who tried giving up her surname - an American called Vada who named her child Vada I - gave up , though I know there are others who have changed their name in different ways , and once knew a man called simply Bean .
I do feel I have achieved my intention - to challenge the custom of classifying all women by their relationships to men - but I never saw myself as a pioneer leading a movement .
Naively , I thought my logic would gently spread and a new generation would be born , named temporarily as in Marge Piercy 's novel Woman on the Edge of Time , until they were able to choose a name for themselves .
A glorious fantasy thoroughly punctured by the progress of technology and its programmers .
As for myself , I learned a long time ago that I was unable to have children , so I have n't had to deal with the question of what my own legacy or ongoing lineage would be .
I 'm not sure what I would have done if I had had a child .
I do worry , though , about what will happen when I die .
The registrar of my mother 's death seemed more concerned to record whose wife she was - Mrs Sydney Frank Chalker .
When I go , will some bureaucrat , aided and abetted by software programmers , demand that I acquire a surname or they will not be able to register my passing ?
Whatever happens , I 'll probably vanish from the genealogical tree , as has been the fate of significant numbers of women whose names are lost or forgotten in the sturdy march of male surnames .

" Well , a 16 - minute discussion on health care is certainly a start , " dapper anchorman and occasional debate moderator Brian Williams said in Cleveland last night , cutting off Clinton and Obama 's long back - and - forth on their health care plans .
Given yesterday 's report that federal spending on health care is likely to double in the next decade , we'd have loved to hear some real nitty gritty about what the candidates are going to do to control costs .
But given that the obvious ways to rein them in are politically toxic -- " As ...
Early next year , the writer Gordon Burn will publish a book called Born Yesterday : The News as a Novel , which , according to the publisher 's come-on , will weave recent headline events , including " the disappearances of Madeleine McCann and Tony Blair " , into fiction .
Burn , a notable cultural observer , has , not for the first time , spotted a shift in how the world works - because most consumers of the media in recent months must have done nervous double - takes , checking that the big , thin sheets of newsprint in their hands are not , in fact , fat hardback thrillers .
The news has become a kind of super - fiction , in which one unlikely and inexplicable yarn after another - The Portugal Child , The Perugia Murder , The Deadly Teddy Bear , The Secret Donor , The Panamanian Canoeist - play out across newspaper pages .
The suggestion that journalism has become more like fiction is a pretty ancient insult but , in the past , was used to accuse reporters of fabrication .
Now , though , something deeper and weirder frequently occurs in which , even when facts are accurately reported , they seem , in the proper sense of the word , fabulous .
Whereas most news stories follow a grimly recognisable narrative - the sex murder , the drive - by shooting , the inflated expenses claim - recent real - life plots are dense , messy and seemingly insoluble in a way that usually requires the manipulations of a novelist .
This sense of events feeling invented is not entirely new .
For several decades , writers have toyed with the idea that , whether or not truth is stranger than fiction , it is sometimes indistinguishable from it .
Norman Mailer alluded to this blurring in a 1960s phrase about " the novel as history , history as a novel " , while the French thinker Jean Baudrillard , with his theory of " hyper- reality " , argued that humans , unable to make sense of the complexities of the modern world , experienced real events as if they were fantasy .
Yet such ideas - as the concept of Burn 's novel acknowledges - have now truly found their time .
The obvious temptation is to blame journalism , and it 's certainly true that these blockbuster news stories are partly shaped by the fact that today 's journalists ( in print and television ) have much more space and much less fear of legal censure than did their predecessors .
But I think the news increasingly feels like a novel or screenplay because so many people now live like figures in fiction , defining themselves as " characters " within what artistic criticism calls a " structured narrative " .
This is a result of the new technology of self - expression .
Both Amanda Knox , who is a suspect in the murder in Perugia of Meredith Kircher , and Anne Darwin , the wife of the canoeist who vanished for five years , helpfully had Facebook or MySpace entries , full of useful narrative details that , in previous such cases , would not have reached the public until the publication of a memoir or a trial .
The Perugia suspect even , in a self - novelistic flourish , provided herself with a pejorative nickname - " Foxy Knoxy " .
Anne Darwin also seems to have been located by the media and police through her internet exhibitionism , as was another suspect in the Italian killing .
This vivid jet trail , which so many people now willingly leave behind them , clearly assists anyone who has the desire to read the news like a book .
Lord Lucan , a 70s news sensation , could not plausibly have been the subject of his hyper - real reporting for the practical reason that , at the end of chapter one , the storytellers could n't answer the simple question of where he went next .
These days , even an aristocrat who had murdered his children 's nanny and done a bunk would probably have left behind a helpful blog outlining the plot and a telltale weblink to ferry timetables and high tides .
Now , however , it has become good form to tell your own tale all the time .
Though of different generations , Amanda Knox and Anne Darwin are both true products of their age - enthusiastically , through journalists and surrogates , putting out " stories " that , because they contain tantalising holes and contradictions , have the effect that skilful novelists achieve by complicating the possibilities and concealing the solution .
It 's also striking that , as happened in the history of the novel and the play , the range of people likely to be the subject of such stories has democratised .
Whereas OJ Simpson , who probably started this phenomenon , was already famous before becoming notorious , the McCanns , Darwins and Knoxes were all unknown until they became involved in cataclysmic happenings .
These stories encourage personal identification : what if it had been a child or a partner of ours ?
The risk of experiencing reality in this way is that we forget that human beings are involved ; but it also seems possible that some of these actuality protagonists - the Darwins , for example , or Knox - have themselves failed at times to realise that they were living in a life rather than a story .
But however it has happened , Gordon Burn is right .
The news is now a novel or a movie .

There is a widespread feeling among donors and some advisers , though , that a comeback this time may be improbable .
Her advisers said internal polls showed a very tough race to win the Texas primary  a contest that no less than Mr. Clinton has said is a “ must win . ”
And while advisers are drawing some hope from Mrs. Clinton ’s indefatigable nature , some are burning out .
Morale is low .
After 13 months of dawn - to - dark seven - day weeks , the staff is exhausted .
Some have taken to going home early  9 p.m.  turning off their BlackBerrys , and polishing off bottles of wine , several senior staff members said .
Some advisers have been heard yelling at close friends and colleagues .
In a much - reported incident , Mr. Penn and the campaign advertising chief , Mandy Grunwald , had a screaming match over strategy recently that prompted another senior aide , Guy Cecil , to leave the room .
“ I have work to do  you ’re acting like kids , ” Mr. Cecil said , according to three people in the room .
Others have taken several days off , despite it being crunch time .
Some have grown depressed , be it over Mr. Obama ’s momentum , the attacks on the campaign ’s management from outside critics or their view that the news media has been much rougher on Mrs. Clinton than on Mr. Obama .
And some of her major fund - raisers have begun playing down their roles , asking reporters to refer to them simply as “ donors , ” to try to rein in their image as unfailingly loyal to the Clintons .
And yet , advisers say , the mood was even grimmer in early February , when the campaign was running out of money and the possibility of losing some major Feb.
5 primaries , like California and New Jersey , was unsettling Mrs. Clinton , of New York , and her aides .
( She ended up winning those states . )
The turbulence this time , some advisers say , has turned into greater focus and determination toward clear targets : the Ohio and Texas primaries .
In interviews with 15 aides and advisers to Mrs. Clinton , not a single one expressed any regrets that they were not working for Mr. Obama .
Indeed , some aides said they were baffled that a candidate who had been in the United States Senate for only three years and was a state lawmaker in Illinois before that was now outpacing a seasoned figure like Mrs. Clinton .
And to a person , these aides and advisers praised Mrs. Clinton and said that she had been a better candidate than her campaign strategy and operation reflected .
Want to cook like a pro ?
Lesson one : do n’t listen to TV chefs ...
Recipes do n't work .
We do n't need them .
There , I 've said it .
Someone had to .
I 've been wanting to for years , but never had the courage .
I thought it was just me , you see .
I thought I had some kind of blind spot when it came to cooking , or had somehow always missed something in the dozens of TV chefs ' cookbooks that I had spent years religiously , slavishly cooking my way through .
There was obviously a reason my sauces tasted like creosote and my soufflés imploded , and the reason was me .
I just assumed that I did n't have the cooking gene .
After all , surely the 10,000 or so people a week currently paying £ 25 each for Nigella Express to learn how to drizzle honey over cocktail sausages , and other recipes of our time , and the billions who will buy Delia 's latest , which features instant mash and ready - made sauces , can't all be wrong , can they ?
Well , not wrong as such .
It 's more that we 're all suffering from some kind of collective culinary lobotomy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
These days , the media 's cooking coverage has polarised into two camps : the megalomaniacal Michelin - starred chefs with their impossible - to - recreate recipes that we admire from afar with fearful awe ; and the super - simple , " on the table in seconds " TV cooks with their recipes based – in the case of Delia 's latest – on McCain Crispy Bites , instant mash and Sainsbury 's cheese sauce ( et tu , Delia ! ) .
There has to be a middle way – and there is , although it is a little drastic .
A while back , fed up with life as a foodie - by - numbers , addicted to " rip it up and shove it down your gob " recipes ( why are all cooking shows aimed at people who want to spend as little time as possible cooking ? ) ; annoyed as hell with cooking with one eye on a page ; and tired of all the same old recipes for " quick salads with fig , mozzarella and Parma ham " , I took all my recipe books , along with the reams of recipes I 'd torn from the Sunday supplements and downloaded from the internet , I took all my beloved Jamie Olivers , my precious Delias and Keith Floyds , my Two Fat Ladies , Rick Steins and my Gordon Ramsays , all that glossy , seductive , lavishly photographed food porn , out of the kitchen and into the garden , and burnt the lot .
It was the start of a journey – told in my new book , Sacré Cordon Bleu – What the French Know About Cooking , a rip- roaring roller coaster of emotion , wit and searing culinary insight , since you ask – that took me and my family to live in Paris , where I enrolled at the world - famous Cordon Bleu cookery school .
After a year , I graduated top of my class and went on to test my skills in two Michelin - starred restaurants , one of them belonging to Joël Robuchon ( which is where things started to go wrong , although that 's another story ) .
****
At the school , I learnt the myriad , often arcane , but essential ways of classic French cuisine .
Above all , what I learnt was that , for all their step - by - step promises , recipes are doomed to failure .
In fact , when you stop and think of how many factors militate against their success , it is a wonder that we ever trusted them in the first place .
The first reason they fail is plain old human error : recipes can be badly written , obliquely explained , or not properly tested ; mistakes may have been made with measurements , temperatures or the order you do things ; or there are simply typos in the text .
Then there are the missing ingredients or missing steps – I 've experienced them all , and I bet you have , too .
Spend some time on the internet and you 'll find a whole army of people who would like a quick word in a dark alley with Nigella and a stiff spatula , about her " freewheeling " approach to recipes .
" Can ANYONE cook Nigella 's recipes ? " asked the Daily Mail recently .
Quite .
Yet even the most respected food writers get it wrong from time to time .
Have you ever tried to follow an Elizabeth David recipe ?
It 's like deciphering the wisdom of an ancient Sufi prophet .
My mother has banished Nigel Slater – one of the best food writers of his generation –from her kitchen , on the grounds of a chocolate - brownie recipe that has twice failed her .
There are just too many unpredictable variables involved in preparing food .
How can Delia know how ripe your tomatoes are when she advises that , in order to remove their skins , you put them in boiling water for exactly one minute ?
In my experience , that 'll turn most tomatoes to mush .
How can Jamie know how thick the base of your frying pan is , and so what level of heat you should use ?
Or Gary Rhodes know how hot your grill can get , the temperature of your ingredients before you start to cook , or , for that matter , the temperature of your kitchen itself ?
They can never know how tough your piece of meat is , or the moisture levels in your fruit ; they can never know the depth and width of your pan , to give accurate times for reducing sauces ; and one thing no recipe writer can assess is how efficient your oven is .
Innumerable are the occasions on which I have held frustrated vigil by my oven door waiting for something to be done beyond the recipe time ; or worse , been summoned by the egg timer to find that a cremation has taken place .
I suspect most recipe writers are fortunate to have state - of - the - art ovens , but the rest of us make do with whatever was on special offer at John Lewis .
( Which is why one of the most important lessons the chefs taught me at school was " Get to know your oven " . )
Meanwhile , rubbing your failure in your face are the glossy , art - directed photographs that make up half the pages in food books these days .
If they were honest , the first line of most recipes would be : " First , take your food stylist and renowned studio photographer ... "
And , I do n't know about you , but I never have all the right ingredients .
You do n't need a licence to write a recipe book .
There is no Recipe Monitoring Board , and no legislation to invoke when things go wrong .
Where is Antony Worrall Thompson when you are slumped , sobbing over the kitchen table ?
But imagine , if we could be free from the tyranny of the TV chef and learn to cook by ourselves without their help .
We could skip gaily through our local farmers ' market or supermarket , choosing whatever is in season , on special offer or just takes our fancy and , once at home , create our own meals .
I realise that not everyone is able – or stupid enough – to throw their lives up in the air , uproot their families and move to Paris to attend a cookery school , but I do believe that anyone can learn the essentials of cooking , the whys and the hows , the basic techniques , and if they do , their culinary lives will be enriched beyond the dreams of Escoffier .
Imagine the wonders it would do for our kitchen confidence .
If we just learnt a few cooking basics , then we could : 1 ) shop more economically , because we decide what to buy , not the recipe – out go all those costly recipe - book favourites like lobster , foie gras , exotic fruits , smoked salmon and scallops ; 2 ) shop more healthily – again , you control what you cook ; if you do n't want to eat mascarpone , bacon , cheese , butter or cream , you do n't have to ( although , you will be utterly miserable , and still probably die ) ; and 3 ) shop for locally grown produce , instead of wandering up and down the aisles with Pukka Tukka , trying to find tamarind paste .
There would be far less waste because you would n't be lumbered with those special ingredients – African tsire powder , miso paste , or whatever – that you bought for a particular recipe and that sit festering in your cupboards for months afterwards .
And a proper cook knows how to use every scrap – parsley stalks , for instance , are prized in professional kitchens for adding an aromatic background flavour to stocks and sauces .
And if a vegetable does n't look nice , how – it's not difficult – to turn it into a purée or a soufflé .
And let 's not forget : if you learn how to cook for yourself , you need never be worried about those food scare stories that appear in the media daily , which are invariably concerned with processed foods .
I call it Common Sense Cooking .
****
So , where do we begin on our road to empowerment ?
Recipes usually only refer to seasoning vaguely , in passing , but it is the single most important part of cooking , and the most difficult .
Most TV chefs use Maldon sea-salt flakes indiscriminately , but it is an awfully expensive way to salt water , and there are other salts out there .
Sometimes you need a fine salt – if you want to distribute it more evenly over the surface of meat , for instance , or dissolve it in a dressing .
Meanwhile , when you add the salt can be as important as how much .
Do n't add salt to boiling potatoes or dried pulses at the start of cooking , but halfway through – too early and you can toughen their outer layer – but with green vegetables , like broccoli or beans , you want the salt there right from the start to keep them green .
If you are braising vegetables like fennel or spinach , hold off the salting until halfway , when the cell structures have collapsed a little and the volume has reduced .
That way you 'll find it easier to judge how much salt you really need .
You should salt meat as soon as you get it home , even if you are n't going to cook it for a couple of days .
I mean it .
You may think it will dry it out , but the latest research shows that salting meat early makes it taste better and keeps the moisture in because it changes the cell structure in the meat .
It also reduces bacteria on the surface .
Just rinse it off and dry the meat before cooking .
I am not advocating that you burn your recipe books .
Frankly , I was a bit drunk when I did it and underestimated the enthusiasm of the assembled friends and family .
I hoped they'd hold me back in a " Do n't do it , Michael , they 're not worth it ! " kind of way .
So my bonfire has to go under the heading , " Stretching a point to make a point " .
Recipes can be useful ( and there are some in my book – if they do n't work , do n't say I did n't warn you ) , mainly for inspiration , as a starting point , for you to adapt according to what 's in season or in your larder .
Or , in the case of the ones you know you can trust , as a useful reminder of ratios and measurements .
But it would n't hurt to equip yourself with a little knowledge .
Just think , if you could kick your recipe dependence , you 'd never again need to listen to an unfathomably rich ad executive 's wife , sitting in her fake home in some Chiswick warehouse studio , telling you how to jazz up your cocktail sausages .

Lesson two : how to use a frying pan
Something really simple that I never seemed to get right at home was browning things in a pan – whether it was a steak , pork chop , scallops or noodles .
No book I had read had explained the simple principles behind this ; they 'd all just assumed I knew .
First , you have to ensure that whatever you are frying is totally dry .
Pat meat dry with kitchen paper ; leave scallops standing on paper for an hour ; let noodles drain for the same time .
Second , do n't try to fry too much at once – crowding the pan cools it , which means your food will steam , not fry .
Third , resist the urge to toss and poke your food in a flamboyant TV - chef manner .
Leave it be – again , the food will cool and it wo n't brown .
Fourth , get rid of your non -stick pan .
You want stick !
Leave the Teflon for cooking eggs ( although , in fact , used properly , a steel pan with a thick bottom will cover all eventualities ) .
And finally , leave the olive oil for dressings .
The post - Jamie 's Italy home - cooking revolution has brainwashed us into believing olive oil is good , all other oils are bad , but it has a much lower burning point than peanut or sunflower oil , so it is harder to brown things with – and besides , it has too dominant a flavour for most dishes .
This browning is called the Maillard reaction , after the French physician , Louis Camille Maillard , who discovered it .
It is not a " sealing " of the meat ( as even the usually irreproachable Rowley Leigh still insists on calling it ) , and anyway , juices do n't leak out of meat when you cook it , they retreat to the centre , which is why resting the meat after cooking to let the juices redistribute is so important .
Browning can only happen at high temperatures , way above the boiling point of water ( if your food is wet , it wo n't brown ) .
It is the second most important flavour element of cooking , after seasoning .
You can use browning as the basis for a stunning sauce worthy of the greatest restaurant on earth .
It is a basic principle you can employ for virtually any meat or poultry .
Here 's how :
Get the pan hot , add the oil , turn the heat down slightly and add the meat .
Leave the meat be for a while so that the surface in contact with the oil has time to build up a good brown crust .
When that surface is nicely browned , turn the meat and move it to another part of the pan .
You will notice that it will have left brown bits on the surface of the pan .
It looks like a washing - up nightmare , but this is manna to a cook .
By the time you 've browned the meat on all sides , you want the entire surface of the pan to be covered with brown sticky bits .
If you do n't have enough meat to build up a good crust , throw in some trimmings , bones , or , if it 's chicken , some chopped wings .
Next , degrease by tipping the trimmings or bones into a sieve and dabbing excess oil from the pan gently with kitchen paper , being careful not to dislodge the brownings ( I always imagine I am restoring an old master ) .
Add a mirepoix of chopped celery , carrot , onion and garlic – around 20 per cent of the volume of meat ; fry gently so it softens and browns too ; add the trimmings again and deglaze with wine or the alcohol of your choice ( perhaps not Baileys ) , or even just water .
From there , you can make a simple jus by adding just an inch or so of water then reducing it ; or add the same amount of stock and reduce as the first stage for dozens of classic sauces .
Whichever course you choose ( for every day , I just use water , then swirl in a little chilled , cubed butter ) , you will have a sensational sauce that will politely introduce the flavours of the vegetables to those of the meat to create a wondrously harmonious plate .

ON a cold January afternoon in this tiny village near the German border , the garden designer Piet Oudolf put on a heavy coat and led the way out of the 1850s farmhouse he shares with his wife , Anja , and into his garden .
After a few steps he stopped and pointed with pride at a stalk of dead fennel standing in a bed of moribund , wheat - colored joe - pye weed .
“ Normally , people who garden would have cut this back by now , ” he said .
“ The skeletons of the plants are for me as important as the flowers . ”
For Mr. Oudolf , in fact , the real test of a well - composed garden is not how nicely it blooms but how beautifully it decomposes .
“ It ’s not about life or death , ” he said , admiring the dark , twisting lines of the fennel .
“ It ’s about looking good . ”
Over three decades , Mr. Oudolf ’s sometimes unconventional ideas about what looks good have helped make him a star in Europe  where his work has inspired an “ ecology meets design ” gardening movement called New Wave Planting by its followers  and have also begun to win him fans and jobs in the United States .
He has done the planting design for important new gardens in Millennium Park in Chicago and the Battery in New York , and for the park that will cover the elevated High Line rail bed in Lower Manhattan when it opens in September .
These landscapes , like all his projects , embody and advertise his fundamental aesthetic doctrine : that a plant ’s structure and form are more important than its color .
“ He ’s gotten away from the soft pornography of the flower , ” said Charles Waldheim , the director of the landscape architecture program at the University of Toronto .
“ He ’s interested in the life cycle , how plant material ages over the course of the year , ” and how it relates to the plants around it .
Like a good marriage , his compositions must work well together as its members age .
AUSTIN , Texas ---
I 'd like to make it clear to the people who run the Democratic Party that I will not support Hillary Clinton for president .
Enough .
Enough triangulation , calculation and equivocation .
Enough clever straddling , enough not offending anyone
This is not a Dick Morris election .
Sen .
Clinton is apparently incapable of taking a clear stand on the war in Iraq , and that alone is enough to disqualify her .
Her failure to speak out on Terri Schiavo , not to mention that gross pandering on flag - burning , are just contemptible little dodges .
The recent death of Gene McCarthy reminded me of a lesson I spent a long , long time unlearning , so now I have to re-learn it .
It 's about political courage and heroes , and when a country is desperate for leadership .
There are times when regular politics will not do , and this is one of those times .
There are times a country is so tired of bull that only the truth can provide relief .
If no one in conventional - wisdom politics has the courage to speak up and say what needs to be said , then you go out and find some obscure junior senator from Minnesota with the guts to do it .
In 1968 , Gene McCarthy was the little boy who said out loud , " Look , the emperor is n't wearing any clothes . "
Bobby Kennedy -- rough , tough Bobby Kennedy -- did n't do it .
Just this quiet man trained by Benedictines who liked to quote poetry .
What kind of courage does it take , for mercy 's sake ?
Theof the American people ( 55 percent ) think the war in Iraq is a mistake and that we should get out .
The ( 65 percent ) of the American people want single - payer health care and are willing to pay more taxes to get it .
The ( 86 percent ) of the American people favor raising the minimum wage .
Theof the American people ( 60 percent ) favor repealing Bush 's tax cuts , or at least those that go only to the rich .
The ( 66 percent ) wants to reduce the deficit not by cutting domestic spending , but by reducing Pentagon spending or raising taxes .
The ( 77 percent ) thinks we should do " whatever it takes " to protect the environment .
The ( 87 percent ) thinks big oil companies are gouging consumers and would support a windfall profits tax .
That is the center , you fools .
WHO ARE YOU AFRAID OF ?
I listen to people like Rahm Emanuel superciliously explaining elementary politics to us clueless naifs outside the Beltway ( " First , you have to win elections " ) .
Ca n't you even read the damn polls ?
Here 's a prize example by someone named Barry Casselman , who writes , " There is an invisible civil war in the Democratic Party , and it is between those who are attempting to satisfy the defeatist and pacifist left base of the party and those who are attempting to prepare the party for successful elections in 2006 and 2008 .
" This supposedly pits Howard Dean , Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi , emboldened by " a string of bad news from the Middle East ... into calling for premature retreat from Iraq , " versus those pragmatic folk like Steny Hoyer , Rahm Emanuel , Hillary Clinton , Joe Biden and Joe Lieberman .
Oh come on , people -- get a grip on the concept of leadership .
Look at this war -- from the lies that led us into it , to the lies they continue to dump on us daily .
You sit there in Washington so frightened of the big , bad Republican machine you have no idea what people are thinking .
I 'm telling you right now , Tom DeLay is going to lose in his district .
If Democrats in Washington have n't got enough sense to OWN the issue of political reform , I give up on them entirely .
Do it all , go long , go for public campaign financing for Congress .
I 'm serious as a stroke about this -- that is the only reform that will work , and you know it , as well as everyone else who 's ever studied this .
Do all the goo - goo stuff everybody has made fun of all these years : embrace redistricting reform , electoral reform , House rules changes , the whole package .
Put up , or shut up .
Own this issue , or let Jack Abramoff politics continue to run your town .
Bush , Cheney and Co. will continue to play the patriotic bully card just as long as you let them .
I 've said it before : War brings out the patriotic bullies .
In World War I , they went around kicking dachshunds on the grounds that dachshunds were " German dogs . "
They did not , however , go around kicking German shepherds .
The MINUTE someone impugns your patriotism for opposing this war , turn on them like a snarling dog and explain what loving your country really means .
That , or you could just piss on them elegantly , as Rep. John Murtha did .
Or eviscerate them with wit ( look up Mark Twain on the war in the Philippines ) .
Or point out the latest in the endless " string of bad news .
" Do not sit there cowering and pretending the only way to win is as Republican - lite .
If the Washington - based party can't get up and fight , we 'll find someone who can .

Israel has stepped up military action against Gaza 's Hamas rulers
Witnesses said Israeli troops backed by tanks and aircraft launched an incursion near Jabaliya sparking clashes with gunmen .
The teacher , 38 , was killed when a surface - to - surface missile hit a school in Beit Hanoun in a separate raid .
There are no reports of Israeli casualties in the engagements .
Israel has stepped up military action against Hamas since it claimed responsibility for Monday 's suicide bombing in Dimona - its first in Israel since 2004 .
Hamas said an armed member of Islamic Jihad was killed along with its five members in fighting with the Israeli troops .
" What was the fault of a teacher , an emissary on a sacred mission ? " the ministry said in a statement .
An Israeli military spokeswoman said troops had not targeted the school but had fired on a Palestinian rocket crew .
The army is checking whether the building was hit by a stray missile , she said .
Hamas says it has fired 40 rockets and 60 mortars at southern Israel since the new upsurge in fighting began with a deadly Israeli airstrike on Tuesday afternoon which killed seven Hamas security force members .
Correspondents say the violence threatens to overwhelm renewed peacemaking efforts spearheaded by the leader of Hamas 's factional rival Fatah , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Hamas , does not recognise Israel and opposes the peace process .
It ousted Mr Abbas 's forces from Gaza in June , but he remains in control of Palestinian - administered parts of the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
Such arrogance led directly to the idea that Clinton could simply project an air of inevitability and be assured her party ’s nomination .
If she wins — as she very well might — it will be in spite of her original approach .
As one former Clinton staffer put it to me last spring : “ There was an assumption that if you were a major donor and wanted to be an ambassador , go to state dinners with the queen — unless you were an outright fool , you were going to go with Hillary , whether you liked her or not .
The attitude was ‘ Where else are they going to go ? ’ ”
It ’s important to emphasize that Solis Doyle was not the architect of the Clinton strategy .
It was devised and agreed to by many of the campaign ’s top staffers , and the candidate herself signed off on it .
But in all my reporting and personal experience with the campaign , Solis Doyle probably embodied it more than anyone else .
It ’s not unfair that she lost her job ; but it is unfair that no other senior staffers appear to be in danger of losing theirs .
No one could have predicted Barack Obama ’s sudden rise , though the Clinton campaign was slower to recognize it than most .
Solis Doyle ’s failure is another matter .
As much as Clinton touts her own “ executive experience ” and judgment , she made Solis Doyle her campaign manager because of Solis Doyle ’s loyalty , rather than her skill , despite a trail of available evidence suggesting she was unsuited for the role .
To understand how this happened , it ’s helpful to know a bit about the history of rivalry and factionalism in Hillaryland .
The self - mythologizing tale most often told by its inhabitants is that during Bill Clinton ’s administration , while his advisers were leaking left and right as they jockeyed for primacy and influence , Hillary ’s were fiercely loyal .
“ My staff prided themselves on discretion , loyalty , and camaraderie , and we had our own special ethos , ” Clinton wrote in her memoir , Living History .
“ While the West Wing had a tendency to leak , Hillaryland never did . ”
But when Clinton ran for a New York Senate seat in 2000 , that began to change .
Without the drama of Bill Clinton ’s administration to occupy the media , the spotlight fell squarely on Hillary ’s advisers , who now included not just the loyal White House cadre , but others who had been added to her team , like Penn and Dwight Jewson , an advertising consultant specializing in branding who had helped sell Doritos , Red Wolf Beer , and the Taco Bell Value Menu .
The arrival of these outsiders complicated the ever - shifting pecking order in Hillaryland , suddenly putting it on full display and making it more consequential than ever .
As Clinton stagnated in the polls that year , a turbulent divide opened up within her own camp over how to respond to her image problem .
Tensions flared between advisers such as Penn and Mandy Grunwald , her media consultant , who wanted her to stick to the issues , and others , such as Jewson and Harold Ickes , who thought she should confront her chief shortcoming — the notion that she was power - hungry and calculating .
As Michael Tomasky revealed in his fine memoir about the campaign , Hillary ’s Turn , Jewson conducted a series of focus groups to see why Hillary was n’t selling and learned that women saw her as “ savvy , pushy , cold … back - stabbing … self - centered . ”
One woman compared Hillary to her mother - in - law .
The battle between the camps intensified to the point that it began to go public , most notably when someone leaked Penn ’s internal polling data to The New York Times Magazine .
Penn and Ickes regularly erupted into shouting matches and eventually stopped speaking to each other , communicating instead through an intermediary .
ith MySpace.com bulletins and a handful of homemade flyers , two teens have struck a blow against the American Warfare State , Lindale , Georgia Division .
On a Friday afternoon the 17th of November , 17 - year - old high school seniors Robert Day and Samuel Parker decided to act after Day overheard some teachers at Pepperell High School saying that first thing Monday morning the school ’s juniors would be made to take the ASVAB military aptitude test .
Often administered under the guise of a career aptitude test , the ASVAB ’s purpose is to better equip the State to prey on young people tricked or pressured into taking the test .
According to Debbie Hopper of Mothers Against the Draft , it is often given under the pretext of being a " career placement " test .
( In some cases it has in fact been used that way , no doubt in an attempt to legitimize what many Americans regard as not legitimate : the use of government schools as military recruiting grounds . )
The school board answered a concerned email from Parker ’s mother with a suggestion that the test is not mandatory but " customary . "
Sane Americans might ask , " Where , in Prussia ? "
As a senior , he would not be made to take the test , but Day confronted the high school principal , Phil Ray , in defense of students younger than himself , and was told that the test was mandated by federal law .
Day says he already believed that to be false , since he remembered the test being given only to the kids actually trying to join the military the year before .
Regardless , the principal dismissed his objections .
The juniors who were to be tested for their military " aptitude " were not to be told before the weekend .
Principal Ray did not return repeated calls to his office .
Not easily deterred , Day and Parker decided they would do what they could to " warn " the juniors themselves .
They talked to a few kids at the end of school Friday afternoon , and over the weekend sent out more than 20 messages to MySpace bulletin boards discouraging cooperation .
Arriving early Monday morning , Day and Parker picked out spots soon to be populated with kids waiting for the bell to ring , and with the help of some others who quickly volunteered , rapidly distributed their 200 homemade fliers to some and also spoke to many others , encouraging all to refuse to report to the cafeteria or to sabotage the test  either by ripping it up or filling in false information .
One of the military recruiters present attempted to snub their efforts , claiming the No Child Left Behind
Act allows access to all of their information anyway , and so they might as well take the test .
Journalist and author James Bovard says the NCLB does indeed " roll out a red carpet " in terms of empowering the military to demand school records , but says that the ASVAB is far beyond what even it allows .
The pushing of this military aptitude test , Bovard says , is " typical of how government guides kids  to an early funeral . "
Despite the recruiter ’s interruption , Parker says that he , Day and their volunteers made sure every junior who may not have wanted to take the test had a chance to hear them explain its purpose and to understand that it was not mandatory .
They estimate that about half of the school ’s juniors refused to even leave their regular classes to report to the testing site in the school ’s cafeteria .
Some of the teachers , apparently learning about this at the last minute like most everyone else , and confused as to the nature of the proceedings , insisted that their students at least go to the cafeteria even if they did not mean to cooperate with the military .
Once they were there , the kids were informed that anyone who showed up in the cafeteria would be made to take the test .
The old lunch room Catch - 22 .
Some of the students decided to deliberately fill in faulty information .
Perhaps that will go on their permanent record instead .
" Listen kid , we ’re looking for test - refusers just like yourself .
Do you have what it takes ? "
The soldiers told the students that if anyone ripped up their test , then all the tests , including those belonging to the one - third or so of the kids who actually wanted to take it and receive their scores , would be thrown out .
This bit of blackmail apparently worked on the kids who had reluctantly taken it , as no one physically destroyed their tests .
Day and Parker estimate that less than a third of Pepperell ’s juniors went along with their government ’s scheme .
The high school counselor , Ms. Nixon , made it clear to the juniors that she was very disappointed in them for embarrassing principal Ray , but so far , no punishments have been handed down .
All in all , Parker and Day said they were pleasantly surprised by the help and encouragement of kids who they thought would not have cared at all .
We could all learn from their example .
WASHINGTON
Lenny and Squiggy were nowhere in sight .
But Hillary was doing her best to come across as a “ Laverne & Shirley ” factory girl as she headed away from not - a- chance Wisconsin and on to gotta - have Ohio .
She was drinking red wine and talking up the virtues of imported Blue Moon beer with a slice of citrus on her plane and putting up an ad in Ohio about how she works the night shift , too , just like the waitresses , hairdressers , hospital workers and other blue - collar constituents that she ’s hoping to attract .
And she does n’t mean that being married to Bill Clinton is what keeps her up all hours .
She ’s talking about burning the midnight oil in her Senate office .
At any minute , she might break out into the “ schlemiel , schlemazel ” “ Laverne & Shirley ” theme : “ Give us any chance , we ’ll take it .

In 1962 , photographer Bert Stern shot a series of photos of Marilyn Monroe that have collectively come to be known as “ The Last Sitting . ”
Taken during several boozy sessions at the Hotel Bel - Air , the photographs are arguably the most famous images ever captured of America ’s most famous actress :
Monroe , sleepy - eyed and naked , sips from a Champagne glass , enacts a fan dance of sorts with various diaphanous scarves , romps with erotic playfulness on a bed of white linens .
Six weeks after she had posed , Monroe was found dead of an apparent barbiturate overdose .
The photos endure partly as artifacts — as the last visible evidence of the living woman ( a legacy reinforced by Stern ’s decision to publish the contact sheets Monroe herself had crossed out in red marker ) .
But the pictures are also remarkable for the raw truths they seem to reveal .
In them , we see an actress whose comedic talents were overshadowed by her sex appeal , a woman who is cannily aware of her pinup status , yet is also beginning to show her 36 years .
In many shots , she is obviously drunk .
This was an unhappy time for Monroe .
Notorious for her on - set antics , she had been publicly lambasted by Billy Wilder after Some Like It Hot , then fired from the production of Something ’s Got to Give ; she ’d endured two recent divorces and , in 1961 , a brief stint in a psychiatric ward .
Stern excavated and preserved the poignant humanity of the real woman — beautiful , but also fragile , needy , flawed — from the monumental sex symbol .
In our armored , airbrushed age , his achievement feels almost revolutionary .
Forty - six years later , Stern has revisited his classic shots with Lindsay Lohan , another actress whose prodigious fame is not quite commensurate with her professional achievements .
Stern , who shot the photos on film rather than digitally , told me he was interested in Lohan because he suspected “ she had a lot more depth to her ” than one might assume from “ those teenage movies . ”
Indeed , many in the film industry believe that Lohan has yet to pursue projects equal to her gifts .
Without putting too fine a point on it , you might say Lohan has , like Monroe , a knack for courting the tabloids and tripping up her career .
( Readers will remember that Lohan had her own Billy Wilder moment two summers ago on the set of Georgia Rule . )
Stern said the project also grew out of his interest in “ controversial women , ” or “ bad girls , ” like “ Britney , Paris , and Lindsay . ”
Monroe was , in a sense , the original tabloid queen .
Though Lohan ’s willingness to reprise the photos might seem a sly nod to her scandalous past , the actress offered a straightforward explanation .
“ I did n’t have to put much thought into it .
I mean , Bert Stern ?
Doing a Marilyn shoot ?
When is that ever going to come up ?
It ’s really an honor . ”
During a break in the daylong shoot , Lohan sat cross -legged on a bed in the four - room suite and spoke to me , in that familiar throaty voice with its staccato rhythms , about her abiding obsession with Monroe .
Her interest took root a decade ago with multiple viewings of Niagara during the London filming of The Parent Trap .
She has even purchased an apartment where Marilyn once lived .
“ If you saw my house … I have a lot of Marilyn stuff , ” she told me , including a huge painting of Monroe .
“ It ’s eerie , ” Lohan said of the painting , a Christmas gift , “ because it ’s this picture of her , and it ’s kind of cartoony , and there ’s a big bottle of pills next to her , and they ’ve fallen over . ”
Lohan called Monroe ’s suicide “ tragic , ” and then added , elliptically , “ You know , it ’s also tragic what just recently happened to someone else . ”
I asked whether she was referring to Heath Ledger .
She nodded : “ They are both prime examples of what this industry can do to someone . ”
Why some and not others , I asked , since it has often seemed that the thrice - rehabbed Lohan might meet a similar fate .
Lohan replied with a flicker of annoyance : “ I do n’t know .
I ’m not them .
But I sure as hell would n’t let it happen to me . ”
Still , one wonders whether Lohan ’s participation in this project , given all the spooky parallels , is n’t the photographic equivalent of moving into a haunted house .
( Which , in fact , she may have already done . )
Lohan viewed the shoot as a theatrical performance , as a chance to inhabit the role of an idol .
“ I wanted to portray the book and get it point - on as much as I could , to bring it back to life , ” she said .
Hence the strict mimesis : scarves , nudity , and all .
“ Not more than fifteen minutes had passed since she ’d arrived , and already she had agreed to take her clothes off ! ”
Stern writes of Monroe in his swaggering introduction to The Complete Last Sitting , the book in which all 2,571 photos have been collected .
He might have said the same about Lohan .
“ I was comfortable with it , ” the actress remarked of the nudity ( though she did confess to doing “ 250 crunches ” the previous night ) .
All made up , in winged eyeliner and shellacked blonde wig , Lohan , who has returned to her former voluptuousness , at times appeared more Marilyn than the thin , somewhat diminished woman of the original Marilyn photos .
“ It was very similar , déjà vu you might say , like revisiting an old street , ” said Stern .
The original photos , however , were distinguished by an almost claustrophobic intimacy between photographer and muse .
In the first session , Stern persuaded the entourage of stylists to leave him alone with Monroe .
The shoot thus took on the symbolic ( if not the actual ) contours of a liaison .
The rise of the celebrity industrial complex has rendered this sort of tense pas de deux all but impossible .
At the Lohan shoot , the crowd included Lohan ’s manager , her security guard , and her younger sister , Ali ; a makeup artist and assistant , a hairstylist and assistant , a stylist , a manicurist , a sentry to watch the borrowed diamonds ;
Stern , his manager , and two photo assistants .
Lohan and Stern worked in an adjoining room , while the rest of us hovered outside like groupies at a backstage entrance .
“ Here is a woman who is giving herself to the public , ” Lohan said , about the Monroe photos , when we spoke the next day by phone .
“ She ’s saying , ‘ Look , you ’ve taken a lot from me , so why do n’t I give it to you myself . ’
She ’s taking control back . ”
Like any tabloid veteran , Lohan understands the potency of a photograph , and that the best way to respond to a society that views you only as an image might just be on its own terms .

The world of germs and microbes has received much attention in recent years .
But where do microbes fit into the creation account ?
Were they created along with the rest of the plants and animals in the first week of creation , or were they created later , after the Fall ?
These are some questions that creation microbiologists have been asking in recent years .
Ongoing research , based on the creation paradigm , appears to provide some answers to these puzzling questions .
The answers to these questions are not explicit in Scripture , so the answers can not be dogmatic .
However , a reasonable extrapolation from biological data and Scripture can be made about the nature of microbes in a fully mature creation .
This article attempts to provide reasonable answers to when microbes were created and is meant to stimulate discussion and further research in this area .
Very little has been written in Bible commentaries or in creation literature on the subject of when microbes were created .
Some have postulated that microbes were created on a single day of Creation , such as Day Three — when the plants were made .
This is partially due to the “ seed - like ” characteristics that bacteria and fungi have — therefore classifying microbes as plants .
In addition , we observe microbes ( such as Escherichia coli ) isolated in the lab and we tend to think of microbes as individual entities much like birds or fish or animals and , therefore , created on a single day .
However , in nature , the vast majority of microbes live in biological partnerships , not in total isolation .
The natural symbiosis of microbes with other creatures is the norm .
Therefore , we postulate that microbes were created as “ biological systems ” with plants , animals , and humans on multiple days , as supporting systems in mature plants , animals , and humans .
This idea is further supported by the work of Francis ( 2003 ) .
Francis calls microbial symbiotic systems a biomatrix , or organosubstrate .
He proposes that microbes were created as a link between macroorganisms and a chemically rich but inert physical environment , providing a surface ( i.e. , substrate ) upon which multicellular creatures can thrive and persist in intricately designed ecosystems .
From the beginning , God made
His creation fully mature , and complex forms fully formed .
This would ensure continuity and stability for the times to come .
Although we cannot be certain as to specifically when the Creator made microbes , it is within
His character to make entire interwoven , “ packaged ” systems to sustain and maintain life .
Keywords : microbes , days of creation , symbiosis , biological partnerships , organosubstrate , packaged systems .
The world of germs and microbes has received much attention in recent years — and for good reason .
We frequently hear the term microbe associated with organisms such as Escherichia coli , Salmonella , anthrax bacteria , antibiotic - resistant tuberculosis , MRSA , HIV , malaria , Stachybotrys , and other microscopic creatures .
But where do microbes fit into the creation account ?
Were they created along with the rest of the plants and animals in the first week of creation , or were they created later , after the Fall ?
Are microbes a result of the Curse ?
These and other questions are some that a group of professional creation microbiologists have been asking , and their answers may surprise you .
Ongoing research based on the creation paradigm appears to provide some answers to these puzzling questions .
Although I cannot be dogmatic ( beyond the biblical text ) about the details of microbe origin during Creation Week , I believe that a reasonable extrapolation from biological data and Scripture can be made about the nature of microbes in a fully mature creation .
Past creation scientists such as Leeuwenhoek , Pasteur , and Lister were blessed by God as He revealed ( Psalm 139:17a ) to them critical insight into His creation .
So , where do these microbes fit into the very good days of creation ?
Before answering this question , three terms , microbe , germ , and symbiosis , need to be defined .
These are relatively new or “ modern ” terms .
First , the Bible does not use these specific terms .
These terms were not commonly used until the end of the nineteenth century .
The term microbe was first used in 1878 to describe “ extremely minute living beings . ”
Before 1878 , scientists including Louis Pasteur used a variety of terms rather loosely to label the very small organisms that had interested them .
It was not clear whether microbes belonged to the animal or plant kingdom , or to a completely different one .
The term microbe was given by Charles E. Sedillot to describe bacteria ( Bulloch 1938 ) .
Later , it would also be used of eukaryotic cells , including algae , fungi , protozoans , and slime molds .
Some people refer to viruses as microbes , but others do not because viruses are not cells .
Viruses have nonliving as well as living characteristics .
Today , the term germ refers to disease - causing microbes , or pathogens .
All germs would have originated after the Fall ( Genesis 3 ) .
The Edenic Curse would have profoundly influenced all creation , including viruses , bacteria , fungi , and protozoans that would later become pathogens or parasites .
The origin of infectious disease is complex and multifaceted .
This topic is further explored in the book The Genesis of Germs ( Gillen 2007 ) .
It provides some understanding into the origin of infectious diseases .
From a biblical worldview , infectious diseases and pathogenesis are a secondary state in nature .
It is not the way the Creator intended for man and nature .
Most microbes are beneficial to man and nature .
Only about 5 – 10 % of all bacteria are pathogenic .
Many microbes live in a mutualistic relationship with plants , animals , humans , and other microbes .
Mutualism is a type of symbiosis ( Greek sym , meaning “ together ” , and bios , meaning “ life ” ) .
The term symbiosis is used to describe an intimate association between organisms of different species .
Some symbiotic relationships between microbes and plants , animals , and humans are essential for life on earth .
For this reason most microbiologists maintain that bacteria , fungi , protists , and other microbes have been maligned in the news media .
Without our intestinal flora , we would not digest food nor acquire vitamins and minerals very efficiently .
Without fungi , bacteria , algae , and protozoans , life on earth could not last .
This is because microbes provide essential “ services ” ( e.g. , nitrogen fixation , nitrification , and denitrification ) in nutrient cycles .
The Days of Creation
On each day of creation , God wrought a plethora of wonders , and each day ’s work perfectly complemented the other ( MacArthur 2001 ) .
God created the earth with its untold living marvels out of nothing .
Three days out of six , He made living ( biologically speaking ) things .
You may recall the creation of life in three distinct days from the Genesis account ( table 1 ) .
Creation Week Life - forms Day Three Plants and seed - bearing life Day Five Sea animals and flying animals Day Six Creeping things , land animals , and humans
I once believed that all microbes were simply created on Day Three — with all the plants ( and seed - bearing life ) .
The Bible says ,
And God said ,
Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good ( Genesis 1:11 – 12 ) .
Some Bible commentaries have implied their creation on this day because bacteria and fungi were long classified in the plant kingdom .
Upon further reflection on the origin of microbes , I realized that not all microbes could be classified as “ seed - bearing ” life , like plants , cyanobacteria , or photosynthetic bacteria .
This led me to the conclusion that the Creator probably created animal - like ( nonphotosynthetic ) microbes on Days Five and Six .
In this model , God created individual microbes in discrete packages on several days ( i.e. , the plant - like microbes on Day Three , the animal - like microbes with the animals , etc. , on Days Five and Six ) .
Each bacteria , fungi , and protozoan “ kind ” was made individually on Days Three , Five , and Six , just like plants , animals , and humans .
In June 2007 , a group of professional creation microbiologists assembled at the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum to meet and discuss ideas and papers at the first Microbe Forum ( Purdom and Francis 2008 ) .
After several sessions presented by scientists , I further appreciated the natural symbiosis of microbes and other creatures , because it occurred to me that seldom are microbes living in total isolation .
Upon further reflection , I concluded that it is much more likely that God created the microbes as “ biological systems ” on multiple days of creation ( table 2 ) .
It is less likely that a single day in creation would explain the vast diversity of microbes ( i.e. , viruses , bacteria , fungi , algae , protozoans , etc. ) — although He certainly could have .
In fact , this “ new conception ” of when microbes were created is a change in my thinking that has taken place over the past few years .
My “ new ” understanding of microbes and the days of creation is further explained below .

Francis ( 2003 ) calls microbial symbiotic systems a biomatrix , or organosubstrate .
Francis proposes that microbes and viruses were created as a link between macroorganisms and a chemically rich , but inert , physical environment , providing a surface ( i.e. , substrate ) upon which multicellular creatures can thrive and persist in intricately designed ecosystems .
Microbes are designed for symbiotic relationships with both macroorganisms and other microbes and viruses .
They extract inorganic minerals from the earth ; participate in the cycling of all elements and compounds important in macroorganismal biology ; and effect bioremediation .
Microbes and man , plants and fungi , invertebrates and protozoans are intricately connected with one another — all designed by the Master Weaver ( Gillen 2007 ) .
At God ’s command ,
He made trees , flowers , shrubs , and grasses on Day Three .
The Master Craftsman wove diverse life - forms together .
When God created the plants ( Day Three ) , He likely created a biomatrix of bacteria and fungi with them at the same time to sustain them ( table 2 ) .
This symbiotic model for the origin of microbes does not preclude free - living forms .
The natural ecosystems that God created — land , sea , and air — would also need microbes for nutrient cycling , decomposing waste , and photosynthesis for oxygen for all creatures .
The soil surrounding the plants most likely accommodated the need to recycle elements from fallen leaves and make them useful for regeneration .
By Day Five of creation , earth ’s environment and the heavenly realm were complete .
From here on the creative work of God consisted primarily in filling the earth with “ moving ” creatures .
On this breath - taking day ( Day Five ) the Master Creator made sea animals , including coral , squid , fish , and whales .
He also created the birds , bats , and other winged creatures .
God populated the seas and skies with animals that would need the ability to acquire nutrients , utilize energy efficiently , and reproduce .
In His provision , God made microscopic creatures that could live in mutualism with “ everything ” that moves .
The Sustainer of all life created symbiotic microbes like bacteria , fungi , algae , and protozoans to uphold and maintain these marvelous ocean and atmospheric creatures ( table 2 ) .
They would also have to communicate with one another .
For example , in the deep oceans , squid and flashlight fish have luminescent symbiotic bacteria living inside their bodies to light their way and communicate with other creatures .
Living corals have dinoflagellate algae living inside them to provide food ( from photosynthesis ) , and the coral body , in turn , provides a stable home for the algae , as ocean currents sway the small animals on the atoll ( an oceanic , reef formation by corals ) .
Birds digest ( cellulose ) food better with bacteria living inside their caecum stomach .
When
He created the “ creeping things ” like termites on Day Six , He created the protozoans and bacteria interwoven in their gut to ensure their survival .
Very few animals can digest wood and hard cellulose .
Termites have mutualistic , flagellated protozoans called Trichonympha ( even the Trichonympha have symbiotic bacteria inside them ) living inside their guts .
We see this pattern of mutualistic bacteria living inside larger animals as well .
When
He created cattle ( ruminants ) ,
He created the methanogenic bacteria inside their rumen to digest food .
Finally , in His most brilliant stroke ,
He wove together man with microbes ( table 2 ) .
Most land animals have billions of symbiotic bacteria or fungi living inside them to uphold their life .
Just like an embroidered quilt ,
He made humans with bacteria on their skin and in their intestines .
When
He created man , He also created E. coli in their intestines to help them digest food , etc .
Located on his skin , Staphylococcus epidermidis helps protect his skin .
Man is “ covered ” inside and outside his body with millions of microbiotic organisms ( i.e. , normal flora ) to maintain normal body functions and sustain life in changing environments .
Where Do Viruses Fit into Creation ?
The determination of virus origin is uncertain .
It may be that viruses ( as we classify them today ) have multiple origins .
Some may be degenerate parts from cells after the Curse ; still others may have their origin during the days of creation .
Today , we think of viruses ( Latin for “ poison ” ) only in the context of disease .
However , some viruses ( or at least virus - like genes ) are involved in a positive function in nature .
Some groups of viruses , like bacteriophages , play a positive role in controlling bacteria in ecosystems and may play a role in diversity .
Another group of viruses play a role in turning off the immune system during pregnancy in mammals and humans ( Liu 2007 ) .
This is a group referred to as endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ) .
ERVs are among a kind of repetitious genetic elements called “ retrotransposons ” .
Research has shown that the ERV design prohibits the mother ’s immune system from damaging the child ’s body .
These retroviruses cannot fully replicate , only expressed in local immune cells ( such as macrophages ) of the placenta , thereby preventing them from initiating a full - blown immune response ( Gillen and Sherwin 2005 ; Liu 2007 ) .
Thus , the mother ’s immune system remains competent to respond to other infections but is specifically prevented from mounting an immune response to the developing embryo ( Gillen and Sherwin 2005 ; Liu 2007 ) .
So in creation , the selective ability to turn off the immune system for protection would be a “ good ” design .
Other ERVs also play a positive role in animal and human reproduction .
However , since the corruption of creation , the corrupted retrovirus , HIV , and various leukemia viruses turn off the entire immune system , leaving the body open to devastating infections .
These examples may provide clues to the origin of viruses and how some may have been created during Creation Week by design and how some have been corrupted as a result of the Fall .
The Master Craftsman
The Almighty did some of His most awesome work in the first six days of the planet ’s existence .
Although
He created the starry host with galaxies , planets , moons , the sun , and other large objects , He also created microorganisms demonstrating His care for detail in the minutest part of life .
God built into all living things the need to sustain , repair , and reproduce .
In many cases , microbes are essential for these three processes to take place in plants , animals , and humans .
From the beginning , God made
His creation fully mature and complex forms fully formed .
This would ensure continuity and stability for the times to come .
Although we cannot be certain as to how and specifically when the Creator made viruses and microbes , it is within
His character to make entire “ packaged ” systems to sustain and maintain life .
If you think about God as an artist who paints an oil canvas , He does it with entire strokes :
He does not paint by numbers .
Notes
The genesis of germs comes after the Creation and the Curse .
Pathogens ( i.e. , germs ) cannot be explained from the Creation account of Genesis 1 and 2 .
The origin of infectious disease does not come until after the Curse recorded in Genesis 3 .
You can read more about this topic in the book The Genesis of Germs ( Gillen 2007 ) .

In all the furor over primaries , polls and presidential candidates , I wanted to call your attention to a very important set of hearings going on right now and where you can get more information on it .
Daily Kos :
Even as the attention of most Americans — and a large part of the rest of the world — is focused on tomorrow 's presidential primaries and the countdown to the end of the Bush administration , the administration continues to stubbornly defend the latest in a serious of ignominious decisions and illegal practices today in Guantánamo .
I'm at the U.S. naval base this week as a human rights observer at the military commission hearings in the cases against Canadian national Omar Khadr , and Yemeni citizen Salim Ahmed Hamdan .
Khadr 's hearing begins today ; Hamdan 's hearing starts Thursday .
Over the next few days , I 'll be blogging about developments from the proceedings .
First , a little perspective :
More than 770 men have been held at Guantánamo ; the population is now down to 275 .
That 's progress , of course , but even as the numbers go down , the costs continue to skyrocket .
During the military flight to the base this Saturday , I asked a Department of Defense official how many people are now stationed there .
He told me approximately 7,000 : 2,500 are U.S. service personnel and the rest include what he referred to as third - party nationals — mostly Filipinos and Jamaicans — who provide the labor to keep the facilities going .
How is it a wise policy choice to create an infrastructure that requires 7,000 people to imprison 275 men ?
Of course , the costs to the United States are much more than financial : more significant are the moral , legal , diplomatic and political consequences of holding hundreds of prisoners in arbitrary and indefinite detention .
At the heart of American values is the principle of habeas corpus , which demands due process and fair trials before an independent judiciary .
The United States ' system of detention and trial at Guantánamo has , for the past six years , betrayed that principle and undermined this country 's historical position as an international champion of human rights and civil liberties .

The people of the Tibetan Plateau survive and thrive on the roof of the world , a region averaging 14,763 feet ( 4,500 meters ) , or nearly three miles , above sea level .
The air at that elevation is not the rich soup of oxygen that humans enjoy at lower elevations .
Instead , as many would - be mountain climbers have discovered to their chagrin , it is difficult to get enough of the life - enabling element into their lungs and blood as they ascend , which often results in debilitating symptoms including nausea and dizziness , and can even be fatal .
According to new research , Tibetans avoid altitude sickness because they have broader arteries and capillaries delivering oxygen to their muscles and organs .
" At the same time that [ Tibetans ] are extremely hypoxic at high altitude , they consume the same amount of oxygen that we do at sea level , " says anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland .
" One of the ways they do that is to have very high blood flow — delivering blood to tissue at twice the rate that we are . "
The Tibetans increase their blood flow by producing prodigious amounts of nitric oxide in the linings of the blood vessels .
This gas diffuses into the blood and forms nitrite and nitrate , which cause the arteries and capillaries to expand and deliver oxygen - bearing blood to the rest of the body more rapidly than normal .
By measuring blood flow in the forearm , Beall and her colleagues report today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that 88 Tibetan men and women move twice as much blood as 50 Clevelanders , the latter of whom reside a mere 675 feet ( 205 meters ) above sea level .
Also , the nitric oxide by - products circulating in Tibetan blood are 10 times greater .
In fact , the Tibetan levels of these nitrites and nitrates are higher than those in patients suffering from a bacterial blood infection — septic shock — and the blood flows are typical of people suffering from high blood pressure .
Yet , they have no ill effects in Tibetans .
" We do n't see an increase in vascular resistance , " Beall says .
The Tibetans also appear to have higher levels of antioxidants in their bodies , perhaps to help reduce the risk of putting so much nitric oxide — a free radical — into their bloodstreams .
Tibetans breathe a lot , too , averaging more breaths per minute than lowlanders or even their peers in other highland regions , such as the Andes of South America , the latter of whom boast larger lungs than the average human .
Also , giving Tibetans pure oxygen actually slows their heart rates by 16 percent .
But these scientists say that Tibetans ' ability to produce higher levels of nitric oxide is the key to their ability to thrive among the world 's tallest peaks .
That raises the question of whether this is evidence of evolutionary functional adaptation in humans .
" You have to identify the gene and identify the gene variants that are different , " Beall notes .
" But it sure seems like a reasonable hypothesis at the moment . "
The Tibetans have lived for an estimated 20,000 years on the plateau that bears their name and , in addition to conquering Mount Everest — along with other mountains that number among the planet 's highest peaks — on a regular basis , they have managed to build and sustain great societies under challenging conditions .
The secret to that success may be encoded in their genes .
" This is an example of adaptation to high - altitude hypoxia , " Beall says .
" Tibetans know they are special because they live at high altitude without getting sick . "

Not long ago , attorneys across the United States organized to protest Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf ’s move to dissolve that country ’s Supreme Court .
In city after city , black - clad lawyers ostentatiously assembled in public to send a message halfway around the world about the importance of the rule of law .
For sure , there ’s bad stuff happening in Pakistan .
So good for my fellow attorneys for objecting , even though something tells me President Musharraf is n’t much moved by the views of a bunch of American lawyers , if he even got wind of their protests at all .
But where were all those American attorneys over the past six years , as the Bush administration and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have shredded our own Constitution and Bill of Rights ?
Apparently doing the same thing as most everyone else : going along , sheep - like , as our leaders take us down the path toward the total state .
Fortunately , at least one lawyer — Judge Andrew P. Napolitano — has taken notice of all that ’s been going on right here at home .
His new book , A Nation of Sheep , documents just some of the many assaults upon our basic liberties that government at all levels has launched since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
For example , he describes how FBI agents can now write their own search warrants , called National Security Letters , and demand that businesses hand over your personal information .
The FBI need n’t go through a judge and need n’t tell you that it even went looking for your information .
In fact , under the USA Patriot Act , the person who received a National Security Letter is prohibited from telling you or anyone else that the FBI either sought or obtained information from them .
So much for the Fourth and First Amendments .
Then there ’s the Bush administration ’s wiretapping of Americans without a warrant or probable cause .
A federal judge struck down the program for its obvious unconstitutionality .
But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision , upholding the program .
Why ?
Because the plaintiffs could not prove they were victims of wiretaps .
And why could n’t they prove it ?
Because the records of who the NSA wiretaps are classified for " national security " reasons .
( Judge Ronald Lee Gilman heroically dissented from this decision , to no avail . )
So much for the courts as the last - resort defenders of our liberties !
When the judicial branch teams up with the executive branch to tell us that the government can essentially do anything it wants in the name of national security , regardless of what the Constitution says , then it ’s time for the kind of outrage that makes lawyers and everyone else take to the streets and demand their rights .
Indeed , to the founders of our country , it meant doing a lot more than that .
Sadly , today , people in all walks of life are mostly content to just suffer the endless abuses of their freedom and privacy , distracting themselves with celebrity gossip and the latest consumer goods made possible in part by the easy credit the government also facilitates .
Is there hope for change ?
Judge Napolitano does n’t see much , the masses of sheep being what they are .
But there is some cause for hope .
Judge Napolitano points out that there is one ( but only one ! ) presidential candidate who would respect the Constitution and undo all the damage that ’s been done by George W. Bush and his predecessors : Congressman Ron Paul .
Then there ’s the inflation and economic crisis that will likely result from all that easy credit .
Maybe that will inspire the masses to reconsider their government ’s benevolence — or , maybe it will make them flee into the arms of full - on fascism , as in Nazi Germany .
In the meantime , whatever they do , the most important thing you and I can do — assuming you are n’t content to be a sheep — is to educate ourselves about what our government ’s up to , what it ’s proper role should be , and how to protect ourselves .
Reading Judge Napolitano ’s book is a good step toward those ends .

Harry Potter may not have talked much about plasmonics in J. K.
Rowling 's fantasy series , but University of Maryland researchers are using this emerging technology to develop an invisibility cloak that exists beyond the world of bespectacled teenage wizards .
A research team at Maryland 's A. James Clark School of Engineering comprised of Professor Christopher Davis , Research Scientist Igor Smolyaninov , and graduate student Yu- Ju Hung , has used plasmon technology to create the world 's first invisibility cloak for visible light .
The engineers have applied the same technology to build a revolutionary superlens microscope that allows scientists to see details of previously undetectable nanoscale objects .
Generally speaking , when we see an object , we see the visible light that strikes the object and is reflected .
The Clark School team 's invisibility cloak refracts ( or bends ) the light that strikes it , so that the light moves around and past the cloak , reflecting nothing , leaving the cloak and its contents " invisible . "
The invisibility cloak device is a two - dimensional pattern of concentric rings created in a thin , transparent acrylic plastic layer on a gold film .
The plastic and gold each have different refractive properties .
The structured plastic on gold in different areas of the cloak creates " negative refraction " effects , which bend plasmons — electron waves generated when light strikes a metallic surface under precise circumstances — around the cloaked region .
This manipulation causes the plasmon waves to appear to have moved in a straight line .
In reality they have been guided around the cloak much as water in a stream flows around a rock , and released on the other side , concealing the cloak and the object inside from visible light .
The invisibility that this phenomenon creates is not absolutely perfect because of energy loss in the gold film .
The team achieved this invisibility under very specialized conditions .
The researchers ' cloak is just 10 micrometers in diameter ; by comparison , a human hair is between 50 to 100 micrometers wide .
Also , the cloak uses a limited range of the visible spectrum , in two dimensions .
It would be a significant challenge to extend the cloak to three dimensions because researchers would need to control light waves both magnetically and electronically to steer them around the hidden object .
The technology initially may work only for small objects of specific controlled shape .
The team also has used plasmonics to develop superlens microscopy technology , which can be integrated into a conventional optical microscope to view nanoscale details of objects that were previously undetectable .
The superlens microscope could one day image living cells , viruses , proteins , DNA molecules , and other samples , operating much like a point - and - shoot camera .
This new technology could revolutionize the capability to view nanoscale objects at a crucial stage of their development .
The team believes they can improve the resolution of their microscope images down to about 10 nanometers — one ten thousandth of the width of a human hair .
A large reason for the success of the group 's innovations in both invisibility and microscopy is that surface plasmons have very short wave lengths , and can therefore move data around using much smaller - scale guiding structures than in existing devices .
These small , rapid waves are generated at optical frequencies , and can transport large amounts of data .
The group also has made use of the unique properties of metamaterials , artificially structured composites that help control electromagnetic waves in unusual ways using plasmonic phenomena .
The diverse applications the group has derived from their plasmonics research is an example of the ingenuity of researchers approaching new and dynamic technologies that offer broad and unprecedented capabilities .
The research has attracted a great deal of attention within the scientific community , industry and government agencies .
Related plasmonics research offers applications for military and computer chip technologies , which could benefit from the higher frequencies and rapid data transfer rates that plasmons offer .
The team 's research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and Clark School Corporate Partner BAE Systems .
Smolyaninov and Davis have published an article in the journal Science about their superlens microscope technology , titled " Magnifying Superlens in the Visible Frequency Range . "
The group and their colleagues from Purdue University will also soon publish a paper about their invisibility cloak research .

Click to viewBitTorrent is the go - to resource for downloading everything from music and movies to software and operating systems , but as its popularity continues to grow , so do the number of tools available for making the most of it .
Some are must - haves , while others are a waste of time .
Climb aboard for a look at 10 of the best BitTorrent utilities , tools , and resources for finding and managing your BitTorrent downloads quickly and efficiently .

Of course BitTorrent is a great place to go looking for files , but you can actually take advantage of BitTorrent 's distributed download protocol to share your own files .
This guide details how to create your own torrent to distribute a file on your computer .
The guide covers creating the torrent with the popular , Windows - only uTorrent , but the feature is available in almost any BitTorrent client .
Advertisement
Using IM applications like Pidgin or the Mac- only Adium , you can set up your IM client to automatically accept downloads from specific users ( namely , you ) and then save the file to a folder that your BitTorrent client watches for new torrent files ( in Pidgin you 'll need to go to Tools -> Plugins and enable the Autoaccept plugin ) .
Most clients like uTorrent ( Windows ) and Transmission ( * nix ) support folder monitoring , so if your BitTorrent client is running it'll detect the file you 've sent yourself and automatically start downloading the torrent .
This method does n't allow for very advanced remote management ( like # 5 below ) , but if all you want is a quick method for starting a new download , it 's quick and easy .
I 'd always recommend using a dedicated BitTorrent client whenever you can , but sometimes installing or running another app just is n't an option .
In those cases , web application BitLet is a perfect solution .
It runs BitTorrent downloads through an applet directly in your web browser ; all you have to do is point it to the torrent file .

You 're gaga for BitTorrent , and these two tools let you control and manage all of your BitTorrent downloads from the comfort of your web browser — no matter where you are .
Both applications can handle almost any feature of the desktop version ( and both look very similar , as well ) .
Just find the one that fits the operating system you 're using and get started with your remote access .
uTorrent even has a special web interface for the iPhone .

Rather than get into an argument over the best torrent tracker / search engine , might I instead submit YouTorrent , a meta search engine that scours some of the best BitTorrent trackers for downloads and sorts the results by number of seeds .
I know it 's new , and who knows if it'll last ( it does n't even have ads yet ) , but — god willing — YouTorrent is currently the easiest place to look for a new , healthy torrent ( barring some really good private tracker that most of us are not members of ) .

Vt. Senate advances marijuana bill
Posted Thursday , February 14 , 2008 1:29 am
Thursday , February 14
MONTPELIER --
The Vermont Senate on Wednesday voted to scrap jail terms for first - or second - time offenders caught with up to an ounce of marijuana , giving initial approval to a bill that would give those people fines or send them to court diversion .
Debate on whether to give the bill initial approval -- which the Senate ended up doing on a 22 - 7 roll call vote -- prompted a wide - ranging discussion of marijuana policy , about the message the legislation would send to young people , and about whether laws against marijuana were causing more harm than the drug itself .
Sen .
Dick McCormack , D - Windsor , introduced his comments on the topic with a bit of humor .
" I 'm not so naive as to think that marijuana is a completely harmless drug , " he said .
" It 's responsible for some of the worst poetry every written .
And as a musician , I can tell you it wreaks havoc on the drummer 's ability to keep the tempo . "
But he added , " The harm that is done to actual people 's lives because they 're pot smokers is not done by pot-smoking .
The harm that comes to people 's lives because they 're pot smokers comes from the state .
The problems in their lives do not come from lighting up a joint .
It comes from getting caught . "

Critics of the bill said it would send the wrong message at a time when the state is grappling with a growing problem with use and abuse of harder drugs .

Sen . Hull Maynard , R - Rutland , noted that his home county , and Rutland City in particular , had been plagued by a recent spate of drug - related violence and other crime .
" I feel that we would be better off not passing anything on this subject right now , " Maynard said .
He urged that the state " try to get down to the business and clear up a problem that may be worse in Rutland County than other places and may not . "
Current Vermont law calls for those caught with up to two ounces of marijuana to be given up to six months in jail and up to a $ 1,000 fine .
Article Continues After Advertisement
The bill before the Senate Wednesday would give those caught with up to one ounce a choice :
They could either pay a $ 500 fine -- $ 750 on a second offense -- and have a criminal record , or they could go to a court diversion program , which would result in no criminal record but likely would require counseling and community service .
An initial version of the bill would have decriminalized possession or sale of up to four ounces , but the Senate Judiciary Committee scaled that back , said its chairman , Sen. Richard Sears , D - Bennington .
" No one is condoning the use of marijuana , and it 's offensive to suggest that anyone is , " Sears said .

While other five - year - olds are learning to spell their names and tie up shoelaces , infants at one school are debating life 's great mysteries - in philosophy lessons .
Staff say that instead of " thumping each other " in the playground , pupils now challenge each other 's ideas when they disagree .
The Philosophy for Children course encourages pupils to grapple with conundrums such as free will , religion and the nature of luck .

And the classes at tough London primary Gallions have been so successful at improving results and behaviour that it has sold its own teaching kits and DVDs to 150 schools in Britain and abroad .
Paul Jackson , one of the school 's two head teachers , said : " Gallions opened in 1999 on a new estate in the East End , with all the problems that an inner-London estate brings .
" Virtually everyone that came here had some kind of emotional or behavioural difficulty . "
The school , in Beckton , East London , brought in a consultant to instigate philosophical discussions six years ago and the youngsters immediately took to it .
Formal lessons in philosophy begin at five , but preparation starts even earlier , in the school 's own nursery .
Three - year - olds are introduced to the concept of justification through simple exercises , such as getting them to sit on a " magic carpet " and then asking where they plan to travel on it and why .
Five - year - olds are challenged to consider why music sounds harmonious and people are more likely to shout outside .
Philosophy is taught across the board in place of citizenship lessons and the school has hired a dedicated " philosophy for children " teacher , Lisa Naylor .

She said : " I have witnessed children who barely spoke English and children who had very little self - confidence debating fervently whether the sound of rain on the window was or was n't music . "
At first , she had difficulties getting the children involved without being aggressive towards their classmates .
But soon pupils were able to " challenge each other 's ideas in an assertive and non-aggressive way " , leading to better behaviour and greater respect for one another .
Raising awareness of HIV / Aids in PNG is a difficult task
Margaret Marabe said families were taking the extreme action because they could no longer look after sufferers or feared catching the disease themselves .
Ms Marabe said she saw the " live burials " with her own eyes during a five - month trip to PNG 's remote Southern Highlands .
PNG is in the grip of an HIV / Aids epidemic - the worst in the region .
Officials estimate that 2 % of the six million population are infected , but campaigners believe the figure is much higher .
HIV diagnoses have been rising by around 30 % each year since 1997 , according to a UN Aids report .
Ignorance
Margaret Marabe , a known local activist in PNG , carried out an awareness campaign in the Tari area of the Southern Highlands earlier this year .
" I saw three people with my own eyes .
When they got very sick and people could not look after them , they buried them , " she told reporters .
She described how one person called out " mama , mama " as the soil was being shovelled over their head .
Villagers told her that such action was common , she said .
HIV / Aids is mostly spread in the country through heterosexual intercourse , and polygamy , rape and sexual violence are widespread .
Those caught up in the epidemic are often thought to be the victims of witchcraft .
Women accused of being witches have been tortured and murdered by mobs holding them responsible for the epidemic , according to officials and researchers .
Church leaders have described Aids patients being thrown off bridges or left to starve in back gardens in the past , the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney reports .
Ms Marabe , who works for the Igat Hope organisation in the capital , Port Moresby , said people in remote parts of the country remained ignorant about HIV / Aids and urged the government to take action .
" There are no voluntary counselling training centres in Tari .
There are also no training programmes on HIV , " she was quoted by PNG's Post - Courier newspaper as saying .
PNG 's Secretary for Health Dr Nicholas Mann admitted to the BBC in an interview last year that the multitude of cultures and languages in the country made it difficult to get the HIV / Aids message across .
But he said Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare had brought the issue under his remit , and the government was working with agencies on a co-ordinated approach to tackling the crisis .

I have eaten it raw - small squares of the skin and the flesh served as sashimi with soy sauce and spicy wasabi on the side .
And I have eaten it cooked - stir - fried with vegetables in a sweet and sour sauce .
I suspect there will be some people reading who are outraged - disgusted that I would eat whale meat .
Indeed , that is one reason why I have never mentioned it before .
There are risks involved in such an admission .
Is it evidence that I have " gone native " after nearly two years of trying to make sense of this story from the Japanese point of view ?
Well , no , the reality was that I felt I had no choice but to taste the whale .
' What about lambs ?
I was in a diner in Tokyo owned by Michio Kono , a small man who has been in the restaurant business 30 years .
When we first arrived he was quite quiet , but when I began to talk to him about the rights and wrongs of whaling this diminutive chef exploded .
Now I do not speak much Japanese .
My colleague was translating for me , but I did not need to be fluent to understand the extent of Mr Kono 's anger and frustration at those who try to stop the Japanese whaling .
Japan 's point of view
He ranted and raged , on and on , chopping his outstretched hand through the air vigorously as he made his points .
" What about lambs ? " he asked .
" You people eat lambs , we think lambs are cute but we do n't try to stop you eating them . "
Once the interview was over he insisted I try some whale myself .
The look I got from my Japanese colleague suggested that " no " was not an option .
In truth I was curious .
I chewed the raw whale .
It was not great , but it was not awful either .
The stir - fried whale was better , but not something I would want to eat again in a hurry - not because of any ethical objections , more because of its very strong flavour which was only somewhat disguised by the sweet and sour sauce .
Those Japanese who support whaling believe that all western journalists are out to get them .
That means you have to do whatever you can to try to counter that impression if you are to have any chance of conveying their point of view to the wider world .
It was clear that eating Mr Kono 's whale had the effect of mollifying him .
Perhaps I was not out to stitch him up after all .
Diplomatic harm
The whaling industry here is backed by a small minority of Japanese , a part of the establishment which shouts loud and likes to frame this as an issue of sovereignty : " What right have other nations to tell us what we can and can't eat ? "
The campaigners have powerful friends in politics and in the media .
Australian officials had to return two activists who boarded a whaler
The debate over the rights and wrongs of whaling gets little coverage in the papers here .
The boarding of a Japanese whaler by two environmental activists did make it onto the news bulletins but many Japanese journalists chose to brand the two men environmental terrorists .
And , as far as I am aware , no politician has yet been brave enough to stand up and question whether or not preserving the whaling industry is worth the damage it does to Japan 's reputation overseas .
The unfortunate bureaucrats in the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo who are required to defend whaling on our channels and those of other broadcasters often admit quietly , once the camera is switched off and the microphone unplugged , that this is not a subject they warm to .
Their frustration is not directed at the interviewers , who all too often give them a roasting , demanding they defend what to many is indefensible .
It is their fellow pen-pushers at the Fisheries Ministry who are making life difficult for them by continuing to prop up a whaling industry that sullies the reputation of Japan around the world .
War of words
Over the next few months the diplomats are likely to find it will only get worse .
A senior official from the Fisheries Ministry told me over lunch recently - fish but not whale this time - that Japan is serious about its threat to leave the International Whaling Commission unless it is reformed .
The Japanese are tired of the arguments between pro and anti-whaling nations .
They will do all they can he told me to try to reform the IWC from within , but if that does not work , perhaps within months , his officials will start planning a new body - a breakaway group for pro-whaling nations who want to return to the commercial hunting of whales .
The boarding of the Japanese whaling vessel by the environmental activists in the waters off Antarctica was just a skirmish .
The war of words about whaling here , there , on land and at sea , is likely only to get worse .

Before Mitt Romney takes such a hard line against undocumented workers , he might try to find an American citizen willing to cut the grass at his suburban Boston home .
For the second time in a year , the candidate has been caught employing undocumented immigrants by way of a landscaping company , which he has now fired .
AP :
MEREDITH , N.H. — Republican Mitt Romney , ridiculed by rival Rudy Giuliani for employing illegal immigrants at his “ sanctuary mansion , ” said he had fired the landscaper for his suburban Boston home after learning for a second time about undocumented workers laboring on the property .
[ …] The former Massachusetts governor has made combatting illegal immigration a core theme of his White House run .
His three - point plan includes building fences along the U.S. - Mexico border ; developing a tamperproof ID card so only legal immigrants can work and cutting off federal money to “ sanctuary cities ” providing safe haven to illegal immigrants .
During a debate last week in St. Petersburg , Fla. , Romney chastised Giuliani for continuing sanctuary status for New York while he served as the city ’s mayor .
That prompted Giuliani to accuse Romney of owning a “ sanctuary mansion ” after The Boston Globe reported last year his landscaper employed illegal workers .

Jenna Parry was from Cefn Cribwr
A friend reflects Another body of a young person has been found in the Bridgend area .
South Wales Police named her as 16 - year - old Jenna Parry , who was from the village of Cefn Cribwr , around five miles from Bridgend .
Her body was found early this morning in a woodland area by a man walking his dog across the village common .
Police said there was no link between a number of suicides in the area and no suggestion of a pact , saying they " were all young people with big issues " .
The death in Cefn Cribwr is the 17th suspected suicide of a young person in the Bridgend county area in just over a year .
Last week , two cousins , aged 15 and 20 , both from Bridgend , died within two days of each other .
ADVICE NUMBERS Samaritans 08457 909090 Childline 0800 1111 Papyrus , specialists in preventing young suicide 01978 367333 South Wales Police , who have been conducting a review of other suspected suicides in the area , held a briefing .
Assistant Chief Constable Dave Morris said : " A number had access to social networking sites but there 's no suggestion that anybody used these sites as a means to take their lives .
" They were all young people with big issues .
There are a constellation of factors influencing these young people .
Young people tell us that the media coverage is starting to contribute to those pressures . "
The parents of Nathaniel Pritchard , 15 , who died in hospital last week , were present to read a statement .
His cousin Kelly Stephenson , 20 , also from Cefn Glas in Bridgend , was found dead while on holiday the following day .
Sharon Pritchard and husband Vincent appealed to the media to stop high profile coverage .
They said : " We have lost a son , and media coverage made a difficult time unbearable .
We did not wish to speak to the media .
Not just for ourselves but for other families .
" We feel the media coverage could trigger other people who are already feeling low - to take their own lives .
" We feel that Nathaniel might have thought it was a way of getting attention without fully thinking through the consequences . "
They said they never believed there was any ' internet pact ' .
The cousins died within hours of each other Local assembly member Carwyn Jones , last weekend said the suspected suicides were spread county - wide , across a 130,000 population and seemed to be unrelated .
Today he welcomed the launch of a suicide prevention strategy for the Bridgend area .
Mr Jones said it had " taken a great deal of hard work and effort to prepare , will be of tremendous value and support to professionals in Bridgend " .
Latest statistics available from the Office for National Statistics show that there were three suicides in 2004 - 2005 in the Bridgend area for those aged between 15 and 30 , and three in 2006 .
All were male .
Meanwhile , Welsh health minister Edwina Hart has just written to all AMs saying that she is accelerating work already underway for a suicide prevention action plan for Wales .
She said that the recent sad deaths from suicide in young people in South Wales highlighted the need to pull together the significant amounts of suicide prevention policy and initiatives in place into a single action plan .

Environment Minister John Gormley and Tony Killeen TD present the country 's first ' Carbon Budget ' yesterday in Government Buildings
Ireland yesterday became the first country in the world to ban the traditional lightbulb .
Householders will be forced to switch to new long - life low - energy bulbs in 12 months ' time .
New legislation is being introduced banning the sale of the normal incandescent lightbulb from January , 2009 .
As the normal lightbulb expires , householders will have to replace them with the more environmentally friendly long - life bulb which uses far less energy .
Consumers will save € 185 m in electricity costs every year as a result of the measure .
The National Climate Change Strategy proposed a levy on low - efficiency bulbs .
However , Environment Minister John Gormley , in his Carbon Budget , announced an all - out ban on the old - style lightbulb .
Mr Gormley said the minimum energy efficiency standards for lighting will be introduced from 2009 .
These standards will result in an effective ban on the sale of traditional lightbulbs .
According to the minister the aim of the measure was to completely end the use of these lightbulbs across the country .
" These bulbs use technology invented during the age of the steam engine , " said Mr Gormley .
" By getting rid of these bulbs we will save 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year , " he added .
" Their replacement with low - energy alternatives will save householders in the region of € 185 m a year in lower electricity bills , " said the minister .
Admitting there would be teething problems in the run up to the ban , the minister said that as part of the preparation of the legislation there would be full consultation with all stakeholders .
Greenpeace congratulated the Government on its decision " to lead the world in this simple but essential step in tackling climate change " .
Eoin Dubsky , Greenpeace campaigner said : " Today Ireland has taken a lead in banning energy - wasting lightbulbs by as early as January 2009 .
Greenpeace hopes that Ireland 's decision will light the way for the EU and the rest of the world . "
Devotees of the West Wing have been talking about it for weeks : the uncanny similarity between the fictional presidential contest that dominated the final seasons of the acclaimed TV show and the real - life drama of this year 's election .
Both the real and imagined campaigns have centred on a young , charismatic candidate from an ethnic minority , daring to take on an establishment workhorse with a promise to transcend race and heal America 's partisan divide .
But there 's a twist .
For what those West Wing fans stunned by the similarity between the fictitious Matthew Santos and the real - life Barack Obama have not known is that the resemblance is no coincidence .
When the West Wing scriptwriters first devised their fictitious presidential candidate in the late summer of 2004 , they modelled him in part on a young Illinois politician - not yet even a US senator - by the name of Barack Obama .
" I drew inspiration from him in drawing this character , " West Wing writer and producer Eli Attie told the Guardian .
" When I had to write , Obama was just appearing on the national scene .
He had done a great speech at the convention [ which nominated John Kerry ] and people were beginning to talk about him . "
Attie , who served as chief speechwriter to Al Gore during the ill - fated 2000 campaign and who wrote many of the key Santos episodes of the West Wing , put in a call to Obama aide David Axelrod .
" I said , ' Tell me about this guy Barack Obama . ' "
With the Latino actor Jimmy Smits already cast for the show , Attie was especially keen to know how rising star Obama approached the question of his race .
Axelrod 's answers helped inform Santos 's approach to his own Hispanic identity .
" Some of Santos 's insistence on not being defined by his race , his pride in it even as he rises above it , came from that , " Attie said .
The scriptwriter also borrowed from Obama 's life the notion of a superstar candidate .
" After that convention speech , Obama 's life changed .
He was mobbed wherever he went .
He was more than a candidate seeking votes : people were seeking him .
Some of Santos 's celebrity aura came from that . "
The result is a bizarre case of art imitating life - only for life to imitate art back again .
In the TV show , Santos begins as the rank outsider up against a national figure famous for standing at the side of a popular Democratic president .
There are doubts about Santos 's inexperience , having served just a few years in Congress , and about his ability to persuade voters to back an ethnic minority candidate - even as his own ethnic group harbour suspicions that he might not identify with them sufficiently .
But the soaring power of his rhetoric , his declaration that the old divisions belong in the past and his sheer magnetism , ensure that he comes from behind in a fiercely close primary campaign and draws level with his once all - commanding opponent .
Every aspect of that storyline has come true for Barack Obama .
Axelrod , now chief strategist for the Obama campaign , recently joked in an email to Attie : " We 're living your scripts ! "
What 's more , the West Wing had the Republicans choose between a Christian preacher - a pre-echo of Mike Huckabee - and an older , maverick senator from the American west whose liberal positions on some issues had earned the distrust of the party 's conservative base : a dead ringer for John McCain .
In the West Wing , the McCain figure emerges comfortably as the party 's choice .
Apparently the character was not based on the current Republican frontrunner , but was simply a function of the casting of Alan Alda .
" It was always an inside joke on the West Wing that the show had a prophetic quality , " recalls Attie , now a writer and producer of House , starring Hugh Laurie .
Various political scenarios sketched out on the programme would often materialise within weeks of airing .
But the 2008 campaign , Attie concedes , is in an entirely different league .
There are small differences of course .
Santos had a white wife - stressing , says Attie , Santos 's standing as a " post- racial figure " - while Michelle Obama is African - American .
Ms Obama is the more outspoken , but with two young children each , both are equally photogenic .
Obama aides will be hoping that the West Wing 's prophetic streak holds : Santos eventually emerged as the Democratic nominee from a brokered convention - and went on to win the presidency .

DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) -
The colorful topics -- whether Oprah or immigration -- steal the media attention on the U.S. campaign trail , but voters never take long to get to their household budget when asked what really matters .

“ Health care .
Right now , I get it through my company and it ’s worthless .
It ’s almost $ 300 a month and you get nothing , ” said Morgan Hall , a psychologist who came out to hear Democrat Hillary Clinton at a recent Des Moines campaign stop .
“( U.S. President George W. )
Bush said the economy is good , but I think he ’s pulling our leg , ” retired sheet metal worker Marvin Hohneke , 69 , said .
“ Food prices are getting pretty darn high .
Milk is pretty near $ 3 a gallon . ”
Across the capital city of Iowa , the state that holds the first contests in the process to nominate parties ’ presidential candidates on January 3 , the same worries surfaced at a campaign stop for Republican former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
“ Keeping the tax cuts permanent -- I ’m middle class and we ’re the ones that benefit from the tax cuts .
I ’m afraid of a president who will put those taxes back up , ” said pastor Chris Magnell , 34 .
“ Fiscal issues are probably number one for me . ”
While the endorsement of Democrat Barack Obama by TV star Oprah Winfrey was competing for media attention with questions about Romney ’s Mormonism and immigrant gardeners in recent days , economists say the November 2008 presidential election could come down to voter pocketbooks .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp poll released on Tuesday showed 29 percent of voters said the economy was their top issue in the presidential campaign , compared with 23 percent who listed the Iraq war .
For the first time in four years , a majority of Americans , 57 percent , believe the country is in a recession .
ECONOMIC WORRIES
Fears of an economic slowdown coupled with a continued housing crisis , rising energy costs and wildly fluctuating stock markets have helped push pocketbook concerns up the priority list .
At the same time , fewer troop deaths in Iraq have eased concerns about the war .
“ If conditions in Iraq remain stable , I think the economy will be at the top of the political agenda through the spring and summer of next year and in the teeth of the election , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
The shift in focus to domestic issues from what might have been expected to be a referendum on the Iraq war could be a boon for Democrats , who were attacked as being weak on national security in 2004 but traditionally poll stronger on homefront matters like health care , education or retirement benefits .
The fact that Americans feel less financially secure than they did before Republican Bush took office eight years ago also makes it harder for Republicans to run on their record .
Since 2001 , health insurance premiums have increased 78 percent , while wages have risen just 19 percent , according to the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation .
“ People place blame for a bad economy not on one party or another , but on who is in power , ” said Zandi .
“ Incumbents generally suffer ....
In the general election , the Republicans will be penalized . ”
Still , each party appeals to worried voters in a different way .
Democrats have promised health - care reform to bring coverage to more Americans -- a pledge that has convinced Iowa health - care worker Chris Kirschbaum , 22 , to support Clinton , a New York senator .
“ I see people who are n’t covered as well as they need to be , because it ’s an out - of - pocket cost , their employer does n’t give enough , or they think they wo n’t need it , ” he said .
Retired businesswoman Kay Levitt , 72 , likes the former first lady for another close - to - home issue .
“ I heard her talk about loans for college students , she ’s just very smart and has the experience to do it , ” Levitt said .
But the Republican candidates have promised to make Bush ’s tax cuts permanent , and Levitt ’s husband is considering voting for a Republican for fiscal reasons .
While the federal deficit ballooned under Bush , Allen Levitt , 73 , thinks that could change under a new Republican president .
“ I like Romney for what he did in Massachusetts , he pulled that deficit way down and did some good things , ” said Levitt , a retired salesman .
He ’s also considering Clinton .
“ I ’m still working on him , ” his wife said .
• Eggs Benedict :
• Chicken Wings :
• The Cuban Burger :
• Poutine :
• Stuffed Crust Double - Cheeseburger Pizza :
It is often said that breakfast is the fuel for your whole day .
If you order an Eggs Benedict breakfast , that " fuel " will mostly go toward powering trips to diabetes doctors and a heart specialist .
Do n’t be fooled by the smarty - pants - sounding name -- Eggs Benedict is purely for us stupid folk , still governing our meals by taste rather than calorie count .
Let 's take you inside the dish : buttered English muffin halves are topped with poached eggs , bacon or ham and then doused in hollandaise sauce ; sure it looks like somebody jerked off all over your Denny ’s Grand Slam , but in reality , the only thing orgasmic about this morning heart - clogger is the taste .
While the eggs , bread and cured meat are typical breakfast staples , it ’s the egg yolk and butter - based hollandaise sauce that truly sets this dish apart in both the taste and death ( via cholesterol ) department .
So the next time you ’re skulking around a strip joint at 9 a.m. , take a pass on the “ eggs & legs ” special for once , and let Eggs Benny dance on your tongue .
Outside of the internet and pornography , beer and chicken wings are without question the greatest combination in the history of the universe .
Often referred to as mortal man ’s kryptonite , the lure of the chicken wing lies in its beautiful simplicity .
Cut off chicken ’s appendage , cover with breading , throw in a deep fryer , bathe in your favorite spicy flavoring , dip in ranch or dill sauce , stuff into mouth , inhale and repeat .
With martinis , the common refrain is “ one is not enough , and three is too many ” , but with the chicken wing , I would suggest , “ one is not enough , 25 , eeeh , still probably not enough . "
The appeal may also be rooted in the primitive nature of tearing an animal ’s flesh off the bone , or perhaps just being served by large - busted women clad in tight orange , ham - wallet exposing shorts .
Either way , in all their deep - fried goodness , chicken wings provide an exceptional heart - stopping friend to your beer and your cardiologist .
Although I ’ve never actually seen the burger served in Cuba ( a place I 've been to many a time ) , this temptress of taste is still amazing , be it traditional fare or not .
I was completely snapped on tequila & lime when a close friend handed me a sandwich oozing with deliciousness .
The next afternoon when I woke up , the past day / night was a blur except for one thing .
That glorious concoction of cheese and meat was stuffed down my gullet in record time .
I soon learned I had eaten my first Cuban burger and I can honestly say I have n’t had a better ( or more dangerous ) sandwich since .
Here ’s the blueprint , although I should add the following disclaimer : there is a good chance you will get fatter just by reading it .
Start with two pieces of buttered bread , add a few pieces of ham , a ¾ cooked hamburger patty , pickles , mayonnaise and two layers of cheese .
Combine , wrap in foil , throw on a grill and then cover with a heavy rock or brick .
The weight of the rock flattens the sandwich so it actually fits in your mouth , and it comes out a few minutes later dripping with cheese , grease , mayo and tastes so heavenly you ’d swear Chris Farley made it .
Your first instinct will be to eat another one immediately but unless you live within vomiting distance of a hospital , I would strongly , strongly suggest you stop at one .
Despite popular opinion , the French are not completely devoid of worth .
You have French - kissing , the French - cut Bikini , and last but certainly not least , Poutine .
For the uninitiated , Poutine can be roughly translated to mean , “ damn mess , " and consists of French fries , cheese curds and hot brown gravy .
I have my own translation for it , “ de- fuckin- licious . "
The steaming hot fries and gravy melt the cheese and what you ’re left with is gooey gobs of delectable cuisine that will forever have you mumbling “ merci beaucoup .
" True , eating deep - fried potatoes with congealed cheese and hot lard will momentarily slow your heart rate down to a crawl ( and then forever quicken it , especially when stairs are involved ) , but it ’s worth every agonizing minute .
You really have to ask yourself how something that tastes so delectable can be so detrimental to your health , but much like an anal exam and watching Oprah , you feel much better if you do n’t actually think about it .
Otherwise known as the “ fat - bastard special , " this coronary in a cardboard box should probably come with a parental warning .
“ Letting your child order this pizza will probably lead to him being air - lifted out of bed on a future episode of Jerry Springer . "
Pizza the Hutt himself would have had a hard time choking down one of these hot and greasy pies but I guess North America had to develop something for fat people who ca n’t make decisions .
Even bulimics wo n’t touch this offering because the weight gain is so rapid they do n’t have time to heave it back up .
If you conform to the notion that pizza is like sex ( never bad , just varying degrees of good ) , than this pizza would be a harem of sex - starved 19 year - old swimsuit models stricken with syphilis .
Thinking of it and looking upon it makes you drool worse than Pavlov ’s puppies , but bathe in its ocean of greasy pleasure and that sound you hear will be the instantaneous blocking of your aortal valve .
I ’ve always suffered from a horrendous grease - tooth but this monstrosity offends even my scarce sensibilities .
Just a thought but it should be a pretty good indication that you ’ve gone over the line when the only pizza that could possibly be worse for you would be a “ deep dish cancer - lovers , " but hey , who am I to judge ?
Enjoy the morbid obesity while it lasts and say hello to Elvis when you see him in hell .
Jonathan Mayhew , a third - generation fisherman from Martha 's Vineyard , Mass. , knows firsthand that a school of northern Atlantic bluefin tuna is a marvel to behold .
A former spotter pilot , Mr. Mayhew used to routinely gaze down on schools of 60 , 80 , and sometimes 200 of these torpedo - shaped fish , each weighing many hundreds of pounds .
He also knows that schools of giant tuna are a rare sight these days .
" The stocks are not there , " Mayhew says .
" The biomass of bluefin that comes into the Gulf of Maine is either nonexistent , or it 's going elsewhere . "
Scientists concur .
" Our giant fishery has disappeared , " says Molly Lutcavage , director of the Large Pelagics Research Center at the University of New Hampshire , Durham .
" The overfishing has gone on too long and it 's finally taken down what was once a big fishery . "
So far this year , fishermen have pulled in only 12 percent of the 1,533 - ton US quota , the worst of several years of steeply declining catches .
For US fishermen , the apparent collapse of a fishery once valued $ 19 million ( it was valued at $ 3.3 million in 2006 ) is only the latest in a series of setbacks that make it tougher to make a living .
New information on just how far this migratory fish travels has scientists thinking that overfishing in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic may be depleting bluefin numbers closer to the US .
Others think that , perhaps due to human - driven climate change , shifting conditions in the North Atlantic are further stressing already weakened stocks .
Warning of collapse , many are calling for a moratorium on bluefin harvesting , both to allow stocks to rebound and to give scientists a chance to figure out what 's happening .
" We had all these complicated regulations to control the fishery [ that ] seem to have largely failed , " says Clay Porch , a research fishery biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) in Miami .
" Drastic measures need to be taken to put us back on track . "
At stake is not just the continued existence of a remarkable fish , but a favorable resolution to a greater conundrum :
Will humankind figure out how to sustainably manage nature 's bounty before there 's not much left to manage ?
The answer , so far , seems to be no .
Despite calls by US lawmakers and scientists for a moratorium on bluefin harvesting , the International Commission of the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) , which decides bluefin quotas , did not meaningfully lower quotas when it convened in November .
( Acknowledging overfishing , the European Commission did ban bluefin fishing for the rest of 2007 . )
As in past cases where regulators did n't act in time , a multitude of competing interests – in this case the 42 countries that participate in ICCAT – forestalled greater , but necessary cuts , experts say .
With the fate of bluefin hanging in the balance , scientists are now calling for a more comprehensive and , presumably , effective " systems " approach , one that takes the entire ecosystem into account when setting fishing quotas .
" Nobody 's really done it , " says Don Perkins , president of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute ( GMRI ) in Portland .
" And the regulatory system is not set up to consider an individual species from a multispecies perspective . "
But , he says , by necessity , that 's where fishery management is headed .
Fisherman face an Atlantic divide
The warm - blooded bluefin , the largest of the tuna species , travels vast distances during its life .
Living up to 30 years , adults fatten up in highly productive northern waters , like , historically , those in the Gulf of Maine , and then spawn in the warmer waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean .
Since the early 1980s , managers have treated North Atlantic bluefin as two separate populations : eastern and western .
A north - south line that bisects the Atlantic divides the two stocks .
Many scientists assumed a mere 4 - to - 5 percent exchange between eastern and western tuna .
But " no fisherman that I know of ever believed for a second that the two - stock theory was viable , " says Mayhew .
Enabled by new tagging technology , studies conducted during the past decade substantiate Mayhew 's hunch .
" Since the late '90s , we 've confirmed that the mixing is much greater than assumed , " says Dr. Lutcavage – up to 30 percent .
The new evidence has US scientists worried about what 's happening in the East , particularly in the Mediterranean .
Even by European scientists ' account , bluefin catches there are currently at unsustainable levels .
The Standing Committee on Research and Statistics ( SCRS ) recommended a quota of 15,000 tons in 2007 .
But the ICCAT set the allowable catch at 29,500 tons .
Worse , studies put the actual catch somewhere around 50,000 tons .
And , says Lutcavage , while 73 inches ( about 250 pounds ) is the minimum harvest size in US waters , it was only 10 kgs ( 22 lbs. ) in European waters until recently .
In late November , ICCAT raised the minimum catch size there to 30 kgs ( 66 lbs . ) .
" If you 're taking 70,000 metric tons [ 77,000 tons ] and it's much smaller fish , the number of fish you 're taking is much greater , " she says .
For each 250 - pounder caught here , up to 10 were potentially removed there .
Presumably , these fish never came west .
The Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean leave distinct chemical signatures on fish that swim their waters .
A laboratory at Texas A&M University in College Station , Texas , is currently analyzing bluefin ear bones to better determine their origin , the results of which should be available early next year , says Dr. Porch .
Calls for a moratorium ignored
In October , meanwhile , Bill Hogarth , director of NMFS , called for a three - to - five year moratorium on bluefin fishing .
In November , the US Senate unanimously passed a resolution calling for the same .
But despite warnings from both sides of the Atlantic that collapse was imminent , ICCAT implemented only a small reduction .
By 2010 , the eastern quota will drop to 25,000 tons yearly .
The World Wildlife Foundation called the decision the " final blow for Mediterranean tuna . "
Rich Ruais , executive director of the Blue Water Fishermen 's Association in Salem , N.H. , and an adviser to the American delegation to ICCAT , characterizes it as " an utterly preposterous inadequate response to the crisis at hand ....
The European Community has just totally refused to address the issue . "
The fault , he and others say , lies with tuna - farming interests in the Mediterranean .
The recent boom in capturing and fattening tuna in mobile sea pens has created a powerful lobby worried about recouping its investment .
" There 's nowhere else to point the finger , " Mr. Ruais says .
But other ocean anomalies have some thinking that eastern fishing fleets are n't the only stress on western tuna .
The few tuna that still swim the western Atlantic are showing up quite lean .
" The quality of the fish that I 've seen has definitely declined over the last few years , " says Bob Campbell , manager of the Yankee Fisherman 's Cooperative in Seabrook , N.H .
After analyzing 14 years ' worth of Mr. Campbell 's logbooks , Walter Golet , a PhD candidate in Lutcavage 's lab , agreed .
Bluefin " come here for one reason – they come here to feed , " says Mr. Golet , who recently published his findings in the journal Fishery Bulletin .
But " they do n't seem to be obtaining the forage that they were getting 10 to 15 years ago . "
( This year , which was not included in the study , has seen a slight rebound in tuna quality , says Campbell . )
This thinning has some wondering about what bluefin eat , particularly herring , a keystone species in the northern Atlantic .
Herring biomass seems high , similar to the way it was before the advent of modern industrial fishing fleets in the 1960s .
But both fishermen and conservationists consider this five - inch - long fish important enough that they 've formed an alliance devoted to its protection .
Known as CHOIR , the Coalition for the Atlantic Herring Fishery 's Orderly , Informed , and Responsible Long - Term Development , has repeatedly called for large herring trawlers to leave New England waters .
The coalition fears that if herring numbers greatly diminish , everything that feeds on them , from tuna to cod , will suffer .
Indeed , while herring biomass seems healthy , scientists have noted that an individual four - year - old herring is smaller than in the past .
" The size at that age has decreased over the last decade or so , " says Bill Overholtz , a senior scientist with NMFS in Woods Hole , Mass .
The most obvious cause is the " density effect , " he says :
There are so many herring that each one eats less , making them smaller .
And smaller herring could mean that feeding tuna have to work harder for each meal .
Climate change may shrink stocks
But some think that changing oceanic conditions driven , perhaps , by global warming , may be responsible for the tuna 's woes .
Warmer temperatures explain the abundance of young tuna in the Gulf of Maine .
" These are fish normally found off the mid-Atlantic states , " says Lutcavage .
" Are these fish shifting north because of ocean warming ? "
( Mayhew says they 've always been abundant , but they never return as adults . )
Climate change could also explain why Canadian fishermen continue to catch bluefin while their US counterparts do n't .
" It may be that since herring and bluefin are associated with cooler water … those conditions are better farther north than they used to be , " says Dr. Overholtz .
A warming Arctic could also be having a more direct effect on the food chain .
In the late 1990s , the western North Atlantic saw an increased inflow of low - salinity water from , scientists think , melting ice and permafrost .
( The influx seems to have tapered off more recently . )
Andrew Pershing and Jeff Runge , two marine scientists who divide their time between the University of Maine in Orono and GMRI , suspect that the meltwater caused an algal bloom .
Weighing less than the surrounding ocean , the low - salinity water formed a distinct layer at the ocean 's surface .
Usually limited by churning water , the algae had increased access to sunlight in this relatively still layer .
Small shrimp - like creatures called copepods then gorged on the algae , and grew in number .
Herring fed on the copious copepods , and multiplied as well .
But a decade later , " there are so many adult [ herring ] now that they 're reducing their own food , " says Dr. Pershing .
Another possibility : More arctic meltwater knocked the herring - copepod feeding cycle out of synch .
Copepods have several stages of development .
Not coincidentally , herring spawn when copepods are most fatty – or at least they used to .
The freshwater pulses , and perhaps changing wind patterns , may have reduced the number of fat copepods when the herring arrive to feed .
" In the past few years , the abundance of these [ fatty ] copepods has been low , " says Runge .
" It may be [ that ] the numbers ... that are present when the herring need them is changing . "
Runge has begun higher frequency plankton sampling from a greater number of sites in the hope of better gauging the climate - plankton link .
He 's also looking at how copepod and herring abundance relate .
Pershing hopes to determine if the changes observed in the Gulf of Maine hold across a greater area .
And Golet plans to analyze herring logs the way he did for tuna .
Results indicating a decline in herring quality that jibes with other changes in the North Atlantic would greatly solidify these hypotheses .
But the greater story is one of what Perkins calls " a transition to a more systems approach to ecosystem management . "
Take everything , from shifting currents and plankton blooms to tuna , sharks , and humans , into account when setting quotas , he says .
Otherwise , " When you look at a species in isolation , you miss really important factors , " he says .
" You could miss the problem or construct a solution that hurts rather than helps . "
Without irony , Fox commentators blast MSNBC 's ' liberal slant ' David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Wednesday November 7 , 2007

Print This Email This Tuesday morning , Fox & Friends decided to report on the purported liberal bias of MSNBC , based on reports that the NBC - owned channel had set out to hire left - leaning commentators for the sake of ratings and that the outspoken Rosie O'Donnell was being considered for a possible prime time show on MSNBC .
" Call me crazy , I majored in journalism , it 's why I got into this business in the first point , and no news organization should have a political bent , " opined guest Deborah Norville , a former news anchor for NBC News who currently hosts a syndicated news and entertainment show , and at one time hosted a program on MSNBC in the same time slot O'Donnell may soon take over .
" Sure , " co-host Steve Doocy said in agreement .
Norville added , " It should be , ' just the facts ma'am ' and let the viewers decide . "
Some observers might find such an earnest discussion of journalism ethics curious on a network known for its outspoken conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity .
Similarly , Fox News president Roger Ailes ran communications for Republican presidents Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush , while encouraging what has been called a conservative interpretation of the news .
Still , the Fox & Friends team pulled no punches .
Kilmeade and Doocy both referred continually to an article that ran earlier this week in the New York Times .
The Times used MSNBC 's talks with O'Donnell to explore the network 's recent turn to the left in its commentary .
" Lest there be any doubt that the cable channel believes there is ratings gold in shows that criticize the administration with the same vigor with which Fox Newss hosts often champion it , two NBC executives acknowledged yesterday that they were talking to Rosie ODonnell about a prime - time show on MSNBC , " the story reads .
Two NBC executives confirmed in the piece that the leftward turn followed recent ratings success .
" [ MSNBC ] saw the success of one of their hosts , and now they realize ' that 's our audience , ' being ultra - left and being very critical of the country , " co-host Brian Kilmeade observed at one point in the broadcast , referring to Keith Olbermann , the liberal commentator whose program Countdown has been a ratings boon for MSNBC in recent months .
This was again echoed by Doocy later in the broadcast .
" You know , they 've decided , whenever that guy at eight o'clock complains about the White House they do very well , " Doocy said , again to Olbermann without naming him on the air .
" Now they 've decided , ' let 's just go for it . ' "
Norville , who replaced Bill O'Reilly as host of the syndicated tabloid entertainment show Inside Edition in 1995 while still employed by CBS as a news correspondent , again said " call me crazy , " as she slammed MSNBC for , in her view , steering away from news .
" If you 're a news organization , call me crazy , but I think you need to stick to the news stuff .
But the reality is , Rosie is a magnet for controversy , for headlines , " Norville , who once gave $ 1,000 to Republican Steve Forbes ' presidential campaign , said .
O'Donnell does at least appear to be a magnet for the attention of Fox News staple O'Reilly , who recently sent a camera crew to disrupt an O'Donnell book signing , according to the NBC program Access Hollywood .
During the Fox & Friends broadcast , footage from that incident was used without any mention of its provenance .
The full New York Times article about O'Donnell 's negotiations with MSNBC is available at this link .

The following video clips are from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on November 6 , 2007 .
It ’s only natural that citizens of foreign nations should take an interest in who aspires to the White House : after all , we ’ve announced our " right " to launch a preemptive attack anywhere , under any circumstances , in order to prevent a perceived threat to our " national security , " vaguely defined .
It helps to know if you should start digging a bomb shelter or not .
Fortunately for the people of Iran , and the entire Middle East , it looks like Rudy Giuliani ‘s strategy of simply proclaiming himself the front - runner , without deigning to actually compete in any of the primaries until Florida , has succeeded only in letting Ron Paul stomp all over him , much to the unrestrained glee of the Paulistas .
Unfortunately , the new media - anointed front - runner is John " Boots on the Ground " McCain , who has managed to consistently project the most militaristic agenda through every U.S. intervention , whether launched by a Republican or a Democrat , from Kosovo to the second Iraq war .
Furthermore , it ’s all too plausible that the war - weary American people are going to be presented with a distinctly unpalatable " choice " come November between the two most hawkish presidential aspirants of their respective parties : McCain and Hillary .
But that is n’t enough for some people .
The mere presence , in the primaries , of candidates who espouse a foreign policy based on cooperation rather than conquest is an affront to some .
And there is a well - orchestrated campaign to knock them out of the running , to discredit and smear them by any means necessary .
The Smear Bund would much rather argue about their latest calumny than debate the pros and cons of our interventionist folly in the Middle East and around the world .
Divert the conversation , control the narrative , and fling as much mud as possible as quickly as you can in hopes that at least some of it will stick  that is the methodology of the War Party in dealing with a threat to their hegemony on the electoral front .
As I said , foreigners take an understandable interest in our presidential elections , and that ’s because they ’re under threat of attack .
Yet that is n’t the only reason the rest of the world watches  and even participates in , albeit only journalistically  the race for the White House with as much focus as the average American voter , if not more .
One such case is that of Caroline Glick , a well - known Israeli rightist whose column for the Jerusalem Post is a veritable bellwether of Likudnik opinion , and who takes occasional jabs at America for what she views as slights or even betrayals .
In this instance , she ’s miffed that we ’ve even allowed the race to get this far without a front - runner , while including " candidates and policies that would have previously never made it out of the starting gate . "
Those candidates deemed substandard by Glick all have one thing in common : the perception , on her part , that Israel would be worse off if they ever made it to the White House .
What ’s more , it is n’t good for Israel that they ’re even being allowed to discuss their foreign policy views in a public forum , such as the presidential debates .
Number one on Glick ’s list of undesirables is , of course , Ron Paul , the Texas country doctor and 10 - term Republican congressman whose anti-interventionist views have made him the War Party ’s favored target  and a hero to a growing constituency on the Right as well as the Left , as Glick sourly acknowledges .
Bringing out the knives , she writes , " At the same time , his campaign ’s quest for mainstream respectability has been stymied repeatedly by the fact that neo - Nazi Web sites have embraced Paul ’s candidacy . "
Yes , but has he embraced them ?
Glick does n’t say and does n’t care , nor does she identify the Web site in question .
Like her neoconservative soul - mates in America , Glick is focused like a laser on the issue of " respectability " : it ’s important that she and her ideological confreres get to determine who ’s " legitimate , " and who  to put it in Bill Kristol ’s terms  is " a crank . "
This latter category includes anyone who , like Paul , wants to abandon as futile the Bushian project of " transforming " the Middle East into nascent " democracies " while taking out Israel ’s enemies one by one .
Glick is worried by Paul , who , she thinks , should have been taken out by Jamie Kirchick ’s crude hatchet job in The New Republic , yet " Paul ’s showing in Nevada was particularly impressive . "
Why , just a week previously , Kirchick ’s " in - depth " attack " showed that the neo - Nazis ’ support for him is not unjustified . "
According to Glick ,
" Paul has spoken in warm support for the slave - owning Confederacy and the militia men who believe they must defend themselves against the Federal government and a web of global governance conspirators .
He has also praised former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke . "
As I showed here , all of these statements are lies : rather than endorse slave - owning , Paul raised the idea of decentralism as a central principle of the pro-freedom philosophy he espouses and pointed out that Lincoln was no civil libertarian .
His newsletter addressed the concerns of anti-government " militias , " whose support for the Second Amendment and belief that the federal government has become too overbearing reflect mainstream conservative themes .
Nor did the newsletter have any " warm words " for racist ideologue and sometime politician David Duke : the newsletter writer merely reported Duke ’s electoral success in Louisiana and discussed ways to address the issues he raised in his campaign  affirmative action , crime , etc.  in a manner consistent with the freedom philosophy and the concept of individual rights , rather than letting Duke and his racist confreres exploit them .
The " warm words " Glick heard were only the echoes of her own twisted mind , which espies " fascists , " " racists , " and numerous " anti-Semites " under every American bed .
Pushed along by the " cosmopolitan " faux libertarians at Reason magazine and the Cato Institute , the Paul - is - a - Nazi meme has circulated among those for whom Fox News is the fountainhead of political wisdom : indeed , one of the supposedly libertarian perpetrators , Radley Balko , has a gig with Fox News writing a column .
Now the Jerusalem Post has taken up the same smears , with little regard for either accuracy or nuance , and the New Republic / Reason libels go international .
" Before Kirchick ’s report , " wails Glick , " Paul outpolled Giuliani threefold in the early primary states .
And after the report , he had his best showing to date in Nevada . "
What are the Thought Police ( Foreign Division ) to do ?
( And when are they going to realize that few read the New Republic , and even fewer take it seriously ? )
It ’s particularly grating for the pro-Israel crowd that their preferred candidate , Giuliani , is being humiliated by Paul at the polls : time to get out the smear brushes and get to work !
But it is n’t just Paul who raises Glick ’s ire .
Mike Huckabee , surprisingly enough , also gets the same treatment .
According to Glick :
" Huckabee targets evangelicals by calling for the strengthening of America ’s Christian identity .
Interestingly , in his bid for Christian support , Huckabee has not embraced evangelical advocacy of hawkish foreign policies and defense of Christian communities in the Muslim world .
To the contrary , like former president Jimmy Carter , Huckabee advocates an emasculated foreign policy based on being nice to other countries .
He likens disputes with foreign countries to family squabbles that can be solved by better communications .
Following from this , Huckabee claims that America ’s problems with Iran are the result of America ’s lack of diplomatic relations with Iran . "
I do n’t know where Glick gets her information .
You ’ll note there are no citations , no links , nada  just her arbitrary assertions , backed up by zilch .
The reality is that Huckabee is as hawkish as any of the Republicans , as I pointed out recently .
It seems that it ’s a matter of the degree of intensity with which one wishes and works for war that impresses the Glicks of this world , and nothing short of Giuliani - esque grotesqueries , such as his formulation that he would n’t rule out using nuclear weapons against Iran , will appease her and her co-thinkers .
Glick hints that Huckabee just might be a bigot  after all , what ’s all this " Christian identity " business ?
 but gets explicit when it comes to her real bête noire , Barack Obama .
Here she employs all the dirty tricks we have come to expect from American neoconservatives and the Israel lobby : guilt - by - association and false charges of " racism " and " anti-Semitism , " all in the service of what people like Glick consider to be Israel ’s best interests .
After reiterating the Clinton / right - wing mantra that Obama was " educated in Muslim schools in Indonesia " and noting that his " father and stepfather were Muslims "  falling just short of referring to him as " Barack Hussein Obama " 
Glick points to Obama ’s alleged " spiritual adviser , " one Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. , as a " bigot , " a " black supremacist , " and an " anti-Semite . "
These are serious charges .
What is her evidence ?
A report by the same obscure Web site  the " American Thinker "  that early on played up the phony charges against Ron Paul .
What a coincidence !
And what , exactly , is the American Thinker ?
It ’s a place where the war in Iraq is a holy crusade , where President Bush is given the same status the Daily Worker , circa 1930 , gave to Uncle Joe Stalin , and where any slight to Israel is immediately denounced as a vile act of anti-Semitism , whether it is committed by the American government or by private citizens .
Their " proof " that Rev. Wright is a black Nazi is as follows : " Wright has called for divestment from Israel and refers to Israel as a ‘ racist ’ state .
Theologically , he believes that the true ‘ Chosen People ’ are the blacks . "
Not very convincing : after all , Jimmy Carter has called Israel an " apartheid state "  is he a Nazi ?
The president himself is calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state , much to Glick ’s outraged chagrin .
And as for who , exactly , has the rightful claim to being the Chosen People , does n’t every people believe it is specially chosen by God to carry out some mission ?
Israel is a state , not a religion : to support divestment of public funds , or to exert any other form of economic or social pressure on the Israeli government to moderate its policies  to stop the IDF from killing civilians in Gaza or halt the building of new settlements , for example  is the only way for U.S. citizens to peacefully protest morally reprehensible actions unconditionally supported by Washington .
Glick marshals her " evidence " that Obama is an anti-Semite by identifying his foreign policy adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , as " one of Israel ’s greatest foes in Washington . "
No reason is given , but one assumes it ’s Zbig ’s endorsement of the thesis advanced by professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt that unconditional support for Israel harms both the U.S. and Israel .
The two distinguished professors , one the dean of the " realist " school of international relations and the other the former academic dean of Harvard ’s John F. Kennedy School of Government , join the growing ranks of " anti-Semites "  including Obama , Paul , Carter , Huckabee , and anyone else who looks cross-eyed at Israel or its American lobby .
This is the " new " anti-Semitism , one that has nothing to do with advocating legal sanctions or violence against Jews , and everything to do with opposing the foreign and domestic policies of whatever government happens to be in power in Jerusalem .
There is something unseemly about a foreign observer trying to stir up racial and religious resentments in America , turning Christians against Muslims and " pro-Arab " policymakers while accusing both of anti-Jewish bigotry .
Such accusations come tripping off Glick ’s lips with promiscuous regularity : she has accused the U.S. Justice Department of conducting an anti-Semitic pogrom in prosecuting the AIPAC defendants and convicted spy - for - Israel Larry Franklin , a former top Pentagon analyst who worked at the DoD ’s Iran desk .
Franklin was caught red - handed stealing U.S. secrets and handing them over to Israeli officials and AIPAC employees .
Yet Glick characterizes the arrest and prosecution of the AIPAC defendants as anti-Semitic " persecution . "
They should only do to Franklin , Steve Rosen , and Keith Weissman what the Israelis did to Mordechai Vanunu .
I have to add that the Smear Bund has reached a new low with the Glick piece , especially with regard to the whole Kenyan issue .
Glick takes Obama to task for his support of Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga , who recently had an election stolen from him by incumbent President Mwai Kibaki .
Every international organization of note , including the European Union , has condemned the brazen election fraud that took place in Kenya , and Odinga has called for protests , which have been met with savage repression .
Ah , but according to Glick , Odinga  who claims to be a cousin of Obama ’s  is " an ally of Islamic extremists . "
Kibaki , on the other hand , " is a close ally of the U.S. in the war against Islamic terror . "
Gee , that ’s funny , it sure does n’t look like Kibaki is all that pro-American , but then again , what does the Voice of America know ?
From Glick we get unsourced allegations that Odinga would impose Sharia law , although we are told in the same breath that he ’s an Anglican .
Oh , and he also " scorned Christians as ‘ worshippers of the cross . ’ "
That ’s clear as mud , now is n’t it ?
The Israel lobby in America is well - acquainted with the methods utilized by Glick : smearing , guilt - by - association , seeing " bigotry " under every rock , and maximizing racial and religious tensions and divisions are key tactics of the War Party , and always have been .
The antiwar movement is a " fifth column " in the service of terrorism  it ’s " anti-Semitic " because it opposes a crusade to " transform " the Middle East and occupy the region for decades .
So - and - so is a " friend " or is known to have associated with a known " white nationalist " ( or , in Obama ’s case , a " black supremacist , " whatever that is ) .
And did n’t you know that David Duke opposes the Iraq war ?
The alleged links , however tenuous , with marginal bigots are emphasized and " connections " are made .
The Thought Police , both foreign and domestic , are always on the job , cleansing American politics of the " taint " of anti-interventionism or the merest suggestion of a more evenhanded approach to the Israeli - Arab conflict .
The War Party  and it ’s indispensable ally , the Israel lobby  seek desperately to change the subject whenever anyone introduces a new element into the bipartisan imperialist consensus that dominates the scene in Washington .
Obama , Ron Paul , former President Carter , foreign policy maven Brzezinski , professors Mearsheimer and Walt , Tony Judt , anyone with the slightest insight into the debilitating effects of the Lobby ’s baleful influence on policymaking and public debate is going to be smeared .
What the smear artists do n’t seem to realize , however , is that their attentions are increasingly considered a badge of honor .

Concerned over libellous flaming and the ease with which children can access pornography online , Japan 's communications ministry is suggesting the government starts regulating the internet by 2010 .
A new bill seeks to govern " influential widely read news - related sites as newspapers and broadcasting are now regulated " .
Popular blogs and other sites such as YouTube would come under more vague " minimum regulations " to guard against illegal and harmful content .
What these regulations will entail is ambiguously outlined in a government " Final Report on a Comprehensive Legal System for Communications and Broadcasting " , which does unequivocally suggest " there is a need for an active effort from the government ... as it is difficult for ISPs to individually make judgments regarding concrete harmfulness " .
Experts in the art of Japanese government circumlocution interpret this to foreshadow the introduction of filtering software to control what appears on the Japanese internet .
Despite having freedom of information laws similar to the US , Japan 's media is already heavily regulated and subject to much self - censorship .
Given this traditional state of affairs , Japanese citizens , newly freed to publish comment on an unregulated internet , have been indulging in a riot of libellous slurs posted on forums .
In a society generally aghast at confrontation , the anonymity of the internet is proving a potent draw .
Some sites have caused so much uproar they have been forcibly closed and listed among those the government report labels " unacceptable and a harm to society . "
Chris Salzberg , editor of a Japanese blog - watch for Global Voices , explains how this has come about .
" In contrast to popular depictions of Japanese as the ' humble giants of the web ' , posters in these forums are known for being ruthless in the extent to which they will chase people down for their perceived wrongdoing .
Just a few weeks ago , a site [ 2 ch , an anonymous board ] created to allow users to pick out sites to flame and comment on them was shut down two days after going online , due to complaints from site owners flamed by an estimated 200,000 users . "
Japanese law is proving ineffectual against such sites .
" Current laws have had only a limited effect on harmful postings on 2 ch , " says blogger Adam Richards .
" One of the most popular websites in Japan and its founder has barely even responded to the many lawsuits against him . "
However , some in the Japanese blogosphere view the ministry 's move to censorship as " outrageous " .
Critics of the proposed filtering note that such censorship would be in hands of the government alone , and that Tokyo does not intend to appoint an independent watchdog .
Add Japan 's traditional media , generally in favour of self - censorship , to an apathetic and apolitical population and it seems likely the bureaucrats will get their way .
Man With Tumor for Face Braves Surgery Despite a second surgery , surgeons say their patient will never look normal .
Jan. 11 , 2008  --
To see the face of 32 - year - old Huang Chuancai is to witness a rare genetic condition in its most terrible form .
Chinese doctors say Huang , of China 's southern Hunan province , suffers from a disease known as neurofibromatosis , a genetic disorder of the nervous system that primarily affects the development and growth of neural cell tissues .
For many of its sufferers , the disease means abnormal growth of these tissues and , as a result , facial disfigurement .
But Huang 's case could well be the most extreme case of such disfigurement in the world today .
Before surgical intervention , 50 pounds of tumor tissue had pulled and twisted Huang 's face into a distorted form , nearly unrecognizable as human .
According to wire reports , doctors found that the heavy mass that droops from his head and face had deformed his backbone , stunting his growth .
The tumor had totally covered his left eye , while his left ear hung down to his shoulder , and his right ear and jaw were completely engulfed .
Now , after more than two decades of suffering the horrific advance of his tumor , Huang is recovering from a second round of surgery on Monday to remove the massive growth .
The initial operation , which took place last July , was a risky one - and - a - half - hour procedure that removed the largest of Huang 's tumors , which weighed about 33 pounds .
While many more operations will be needed to remove all the excess tissue , Huang is reportedly hopeful that the treatments will allow him to lead a more normal life .
" I hope that when my illness is cured , I can go back home and have a nice spring festival with my family , " he told Reuters .
Unfortunately , plastic and cosmetic surgeons say , it is highly unlikely that the surgeries will result in a normal appearance .
There is " zero chance of [ Huang ] looking normal , since the muscles , nerves , eye , bone and sometimes brain can be involved , " notes Dr. Henry Kawamoto , clinical professor of plastic surgery at UCLA and director of the university 's craniofacial clinic .
" I doubt that this patient will look ' normal ' as suggested by [ past media coverage ] , " agrees Park Avenue plastic surgeon Dr. Darrick Antell .
" The patient would certainly be substantially better , but the degree of the problem is so large that ' normal ' is unlikely in my opinion . "
But doctors say the surgeries -- albeit risky -- could represent Huang 's one best chance at leading as normal a life as possible .
" What he will get is a much more normal appearance , " says Dr. Thomas Gampper , vice chair of plastic surgery at the University of Virginia .
" Considering where he starts , the improvement will be dramatic , in that he will be recognizably human . "
A Challenging Series of Surgeries
Though it only affects about one out of 4,000 people in the United States , neurofibromatosis is the most common genetic neurological disorder that is caused by a single faulty gene -- a mutation on chromosome 17 .
In total , it affects more than 100,000 people in the United States .
But few of those with the condition suffer the same degree of disfigurement that Huang experienced -- nor would many be forced to endure the same level of treatment .
A major concern when dealing with surgery of this magnitude , surgeons say , is the bleeding that can accompany the removal procedure .
One mistake could cause Huang to bleed to death .
" This would be as challenging as the face transplant cases from last year , " says Dr. Brendan Stack , chief of head and neck surgery at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences .
" The main challenges here will be blood loss , blood loss , blood loss , and underlying skeletal deformities . "
Dr. David Song , chief of plastic surgery at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine -- who himself was part of a team that removed a 200 - pound neurofibroma from a patient , agrees that there are many characteristics of such tumors that make them particularly difficult to work with .
" Massive bleeding is a major concern , " he says .
" Blood vessels from within and around a giant neurofibroma can be fibrotic ( or hard ) , dilated and numerous .
Any attempt to remove a giant neurofribroma must be taken with great care and planning , including the preparation and anticipation of major blood volume replacement , especially in the face . "
But , Song adds , " When performed by the right team with experience , some of this difficulty can be mitigated . "
And surgeons at the Fuda Hospital in China appear to be dealing well with the complexities of the surgeries thus far .
Chief surgeon at Fuda Hospital Dr. Liu Lizhi told Reuters that Monday 's operation , which aimed to remove 10 pounds of the tumor tissue , was not as risky as the larger July operation .
But , he said , it was still a challenge .
" Compared to his first operation , the second one has some new issues , " he told Reuters .
" The main problem is the tumor is close to his ear , and his ear has already been invaded and extended by it ...
So we will try to cut the tumor while keeping his ear and reconstruct it after the operation . "
But considering the extent of Huang 's deformities , surgeons will likely have to address the problem step by step -- and hope for the best .
" The biggest problem in reconstruction occurs when normal structures -- the mouth , ears , eyelids , nose , et cetera -- are stretched out of shape by the weight of a tumor this large , " says Dr. Ricky Clay , plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
" They have to be reshaped and repositioned to match the remainder of the face .
There is no set method .
It 's a combination of anatomy , geometry , and imagination , " he says .
" He has massive deformity .
The challenge is to remove the tumor and leave normal tissue , " says Dr. Brian Maloney , director of The Maloney Center for Facial Plastic Surgery in Atlanta .
" He will need multiple surgeries and hopefully not have the huge flaps of tissue but will not look ' normal ' ...
If the bones of the face are involved he could even lose one of his eyes . "
And as with any surgery , scarring will be an issue .
" This type of surgery would require multiple procedures and result in a significant potential scar , " notes Dr. Julius Few , associate professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago .
" People of Asian and African background have a higher risk for bad scars , such as keloids . "
Surgery Will Not Be Last Challenge for Huang
And even after what promises to be an extensive battery of plastic and reconstructive surgery procedures , Huang will likely face continuing difficulties from his condition .
" There will be much tumor left behind , " says Dr. Garry Brody , professor emeritus of plastic surgery at the University of Southern California 's Keck School of Medicine .
" His entire jaw structure appears to be involved , with much or all of the bone being replaced by tumor .
Bone grafts could not survive in that environment , " he says .
" Even after resection , the residual tumor will continue to grow and as there is elasticity in that type of skin it will sag again and require periodic redoing . "
Brody adds that Huang will face a significant risk of any residual tumor tissue becoming malignant , potentially leading to life - threatening cancer .
But considering the profound impact that the tumors have already had on Huang 's life , these additional challenges may seem par for the course .
The growth caused him to isolate himself from society .
According to wire reports , the condition brought about bullying from his classmates early on , forcing him to leave school at the age of 10 -- and as his condition worsened , even the simple act of speaking became difficult .
Huang reportedly told Reuters that he was even approached several years ago by someone who wished to buy him and display him as part of a circus freak show .
It is a set of challenges that those with the condition in the United States will not likely have to face .
Still , Kawamoto says even milder cases of the condition pose significant challenges for sufferers .
" Early treatment will decrease the amount of deformation but will not cure the disease , " he says .
" There is no cure .
I am currently actively treating three children now .
I wish the number was zero . "

Well , I have seen a lot of photos of abandoned places in Russia , but this one is something special .
It looks like some unknown lifeforms have invaded the area after people abandoned it , or did they abandon because of the invasion has started ?

A Russian schoolteacher who became a popular hero after he was put on trial for using pirated Microsoft programmes has launched a campaign against the software giant 's global domination .
During his trial , Russian media portrayed Alexander Ponosov as a hero in a David - and - Goliath battle against big corporations .
Russian President Vladimir Putin and ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev spoke out in his support .
Ponosov announced on Tuesday he is founding a lobby group whose aim is to reduce Russia 's dependence on software produced by firms like Microsoft and instead promote so - called open - source software .

It permits to play with a real club and a ball which is projected onto the track by a video projector mounted on a 2 m ( 6 ft ) high tripod .
The club is marked by an infrared LED , and detected by a webcam next to the video projector .
An image recognition algorithm in the quantum minigolf software computes the club position and feeds back hits into the simulation .
To play quantum minigolf , download the game in the download section .
It is a GPLed C++ program , which has been tested under Windows and Linux .
It features a simple user interface .
You can add your own tracks by editing them in any image editing software and saving them in bmp format .
The game quantum minigolf is nearly the same as the game minigolf - except that the ball obeys the laws of quantum mechanics .
Such a ball can be at several places at once .
It can diffract around obstacles and interfere with itself .
Apart from that , the rules are the same :
You can play on various tracks involving various obstacles .
You hit the ball with a club and try to kick it into a hole on the other side of the track .
The rules of the game
What you see in the game - Visualization scheme
On the left of each track , you see a yellow ring .
This is the hole .
When the ball is inside this region at the end of the game , you win .
Otherwise you lose .
The obstacles are white .
Their " whiteness " shows their height .
A white spot is thus a pillar standing out of the playing field .
A white area is a block standing out .
A grey area is a block standing out , but not as high as a white area .
The quantum ball appears as a blob colored in all rainbow colors .
Quantum mechanics tells us that the ball is everywhere inside the blob at once .
But it is a bit more where the blob is very intense than where it is barely visible .
For the experts :
The ball is visualized by mapping the complex wavefunction to the color circle .
The modulus of the wavefunction is thus intensity - coded , the phase is color - coded .
See e.g. the books Visual quantum mechanics for a more thorough analysis .
The Hit - Initializing the wavepacket
At the beginning of each quantum minigolf game , the ball rests at the drive position ( on the right ) .
When you hit it with the club , it will start to move .
For the experts :
Hitting the ball , you define an initial momentum .
The ball is then initialized as a Gaussian wavepacket of hard - coded width , centered around the driving position in position space and around the initial momentum in momentum space .
Crossing the obstacle course - Propagation
Once it moves , the ball will cross the track nearly like a classical ball .
However you will note peculiar things , such that it tends to spread itself everywhere and that it can flow around obstacles , which shows its quantum - mechanical nature .
Getting into the hole - The Position measurement
Since a quantum mechanical ball is most of the time at several places at once , it is impossible to say , whether it is in the hole or not .
It is just " at once inside and outside " the hole .
However , there is a trick : Quantum mechanics allows to make a " position measurement " which will let the ball collapse at a certain position .
Think of this as taking a photo of the ball .
A quantum particle can be at several places at once - but on a photo it will always appear on one and only one positon .
At the end of each game you take thus a virtual photo of the track .
If the ball appears in the hole , you win .
Otherwise you lose .

Colin Powell made his Iraq presentation at the UN five years ago , on February 5 , 2003 .
As much criticism as Powell has received for it ” ” he calls it “ painful ” and something that will “ always be a part of my record ” ” ” it has n’t been close to what ’s justified .
Powell was far more than just embarrassingly mistaken ; the evidence is conclusive that he fabricated evidence and ignored repeated warnings that what he was saying was false .
Unfortunately , Congress has never investigated Powell ’s use of the intelligence he was given .
Even so , what ’s already in the public record is extremely damning .
So while the corporate media has never taken a close look at this record , we can go through Powell ’s presentation line by line to demonstrate the chasm between what he knew , and what he told the world .
As you ’ll see , there ’s quite a lot to say about it .

The Clinton campaign has made it clear that it is looking ahead to the March 4 primaries in Ohio and Texas .
Even before it lost Louisiana , Washington , and Nebraska on Saturday , campaign officials were telling the press that they are effectively conceding everything between Super Tuesday and March 4 .
This is a smart move in at least one respect : expectations .
The press has a bad habit of not making much of victories unless they are unexpected — if Obama wins by 20 points in three states he was “ supposed ” to win , there ’s little talk of momentum even a day and a half later .
So Clinton wo n’t be hurt if she loses all of the remaining states before March 4 – Maryland , Virginia , D.C. , Hawaii , and Wisconsin–but she will receive a lot of positive press if she somehow wins one of them .
( She lost the Maine caucus on Sunday . )
As a side note , it ’s worth pointing out that the Obama campaign does n’t really play this game .
It does n’t try to manage expectations in the way the Clinton campaign does , which means that Obama is often in a disadvantageous position in the media narrative ( a situation mitigated by the fact that the media seems to like him more than it likes Clinton ) .
But to the Obama campaign ’s credit , it seemed to have realized that expectations do n’t really matter to everyday voters .
With the exception of New Hampshire , where voters grew tired of the media ’s attempts to bury the Clintons and the Clinton era , voters do n’t seem to care what happened in the states before them and how that fits into some grand story being told by Tim Russert and Chris Matthews .
They just want a chance to evaluate the candidates and make their own decisions .
Back on point .
Is the Clinton strategy of waiting until Texas and Ohio a smart one ?
I doubt it .
It too closely mirrors Rudy Giuliani ’s Florida strategy .
Giuliani could shake as many hands as he wanted in Florida , but the media coverage about the campaign had him losing state after state after state .
He was like a boxer who took blows to the head for four rounds and expected to score a knockout in the fifth .
It did n’t happen .
If Obama sweeps everything between Feb 5 and March 4 , he ’ll have won LA , NE , WA , ME , MD , VA , DC , HI , and WI .
Does n’t that reduce Clinton to Rudy 2.0 ?
I would n’t want to be president .
I worry enough about being assassinated for what I write on this blog .
There ’s no point in making it worse .
But that does n’t stop me from thinking about how I would run my campaign .
If I ran for president , I ’d have to get past the country ’s distaste for atheists .
That ’s a big problem .
I would handle it by manipulating the media with a sound bite so catchy the pundits would have no choice but to repeat it until it started to sound sensible .
I ’d hold a press conference and say that ONLY an atheist should be president , in the same way you want a eunuch to guard your harem .
( That ’s the sound bite .
It ’s like catnip for pundits . )
I would suggest that a truly religious president might try to convert your children to his religion , either overtly or by example .
In this election alone , you have a Mormon , a Baptist or two , and if Bloomberg enters , a Jew .
Moreover , a scary percentage of the South believes Obama is a Muslim .
I ’d play the fear card .
After my eunuch sound bite got everyone ’s attention , I would soften the message to “ Only an atheist can guarantee religious freedom for all by favoring none . ”
That argument makes no sense whatsoever , but it would be persuasive nonetheless .
Next , I would promise to maintain all social benefits for anyone who is already over sixty .
That would guarantee me the senior citizen vote .
Obviously it is not a campaign promise I would have much chance of keeping , but that ’s a problem for later .
And I would portray all the other candidates as a risk to senior citizens .
Younger voters might have a problem with my complete lack of political experience .
I would deal with that by announcing in advance my picks for cabinet , Vice President , Chief of Staff , and other key positions .
I would simply pick the most popular and / or qualified people in the world , such as Oprah , Colin Powell , and Warren Buffet .
All of those people would immediately denounce me and deny interest in the jobs , obviously .
But I would tell the voters they are only saying that because I am not yet the president .
When the president asks someone to serve the country , they tend to say yes .
And if any of them do eventually say no , for now they are a good example of who I would pick for those sorts of jobs .
I would point out that the other candidates will be appointing worthless political cronies , as always .
I would promise that my approach to social issues would mirror the majority opinion .
Unlike the other candidates , I would not try to hold your family hostage to my personal views .
I would argue that a president ’s role in social issues is to guarantee the minority does n’t oppress the majority , not to impose my own biases .
If someone has a pet social issue , I would tell them to convince the majority of the country , not me .
For international issues , I would promise to follow the advice of the most qualified experts in each field .
And I would dismiss any specific policy questions as “ hypothetical questions ” that only an idiot would answer .
I would portray the other candidates as either liars or reckless for not naming their future advisors in advance , and not committing to listening to people who know more than they do .
Do I have your vote ?
Zheng Xiaoyu was accused of accepting some $ 850,000 in bribes
Zheng Xiaoyu was convicted on charges of taking bribes and of dereliction of duty , Xinhua news agency reported .
The sentence is unusually harsh for a senior figure , but Zheng could have his sentence reduced to life on appeal .
The verdict came as the government announced plans for the first ever recall system of unsafe food products .
Beijing has been under pressure to act over increasing concern both at home and abroad about the poor standards of Chinese - produced food and medicines .
Name poisoned
State television showed footage of a grey - haired Zheng - who was expelled from the Communist Party earlier this year - appearing in court in Beijing flanked by police officers .
He had been accused by an official investigation last month of accepting more than 6.5 m yuan ( $ 850,000 ) in bribes to approve hundreds of drugs .
One company , Kongliyuan Group , allegedly paid Zheng bribes in return for approving 277 drugs , mostly antibiotics .
Zheng 's former secretary , Cao Wenzhuang , also faced trial , accused of accepting bribes .
Thirty - one other people were also alleged to have been involved in the scandal , including Zheng 's wife , Liu Naixue , and his son , Zheng Hairong .
Following Zheng 's sacking in 2005 , the Chinese government announced a review of about 170,000 medical licences that were awarded during his tenure at the agency .
Dozens of people have died in China because of poor quality or fake drugs .
Last year , a sub - standard antibiotic , Xinfu , which was not properly sterilised , caused the deaths of 11 people .
Thirteen babies died of malnutrition in 2005 after being fed powdered milk that contained no nutritional value .
The Chinese government recently announced an urgent review of industry food standards after public alarm over a recent spate of cases .
US inspectors blamed exported Chinese pet food ingredients , contaminated with melamine , for the deaths of cats and dogs in North America .
And they recently halted shipments of toothpaste from China to investigate reports that they may be contaminated with toxic chemicals .
On Tuesday , as Zheng was sentenced , the government said a new recall process targeting " potentially dangerous and unapproved food products " would be brought in by the end of the year .
" All domestic and foreign food producers and distributors will be obliged to follow the system , " Wu Jianping , of the General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine , was quoted as saying .
In the Matter of the Nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States of America
A Brief on the Use of Water Torture by American Officials in the War on Terrorism
WHEREAS President George W. Bush has nominated Michael B. Mukasey to serve as the Attorney General of the United States , a cabinet position established by law , and has requested the advice and consent of the United States Senate to the appointment pursuant to Article II , Section 2 , Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States of America ; and
WHEREAS the Committee on the Judiciary is preparing to vote on the nomination ; and
WHEREAS the nominee was asked by members of the Committee whether the use of " waterboarding , " an interrogation technique that simulates drowning , by American officials on prisoners taken into custody in the war on terrorism amounts to torture ; and
WHEREAS the nominee has stated that his legal opinion on waterboarding would depend on the facts and circumstances of the program and that he has not been briefed on the government ’s program and techniques ;
THEREFORE the following brief is submitted for his enlightenment and for such other use as the Committee may find appropriate .
DESCRIPTION OF WATER TORTURE
During water torture , the body and head of a victim is typically strapped to an inclined board with the head lower than the feet .
The victim ’s jaws are forced open and a cloth is forced deep into the mouth and over the nose .
Water is continuously poured over and into the cloth forcing the victim to stop breathing until forced to either swallow water and / or aspirate it into the lungs , triggering the gag reflex .
Water torture results in controlled drowning , the degree of which depends upon the ability of an individual to resist and the will of the torturer .
The punishment ranges from psychological torment and physical suffocation to death .
At the least , water torture represents a mock execution .
The primeval fear of asphyxiation leads to overwhelming panic in even the most disciplined individuals who may be trained and psychologically conditioned to die rather than submit .
Water torture can lead to serious injury to the victim .
A lack of oxygen can quickly result in permanent brain damage , and the aspiration of even small amounts of water can lead to lung disease , including pneumonia .
Struggles by the victim against the restraints can produce severe sprains and broken bones .
Significantly , the intense fear of imminent death and the victim ’s helplessness to prevent it produces devastating and long lasting psychological damage .
HISTORY OF WATER TORTURE
The use of water to simulate drowning has been used as a torture device since at least the Middle Ages .
It was known as the tortura del agua during the Spanish Inquisition and was used by agents of the Dutch East India Company during the Amboyna massacre in 1623 .
Water torture has been acknowledged by the United States to be illegal since at least 1901 when an Army officer was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for using it to torture a Philippine rebel .
In 1947 , a Japanese officer was prosecuted by the United States for strapping a U.S. civilian to a tilted stretcher and pouring water over his face until he agreed to talk .
The officer was convicted of a Violation of the Laws and Customs of War and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor .
In 1957 , French forces in Algeria tortured Henri Alleg , a journalist , by strapping him to a plank and wrapping his head in a cloth placed under a running water tap .
Alleg later talked about his torture in The Question : " The rag was soaked rapidly .
Water flowed everywhere : in my mouth , in my nose , all over my face .
But for a while I could still breathe in some small gulps of air .
I tried , by contracting my throat , to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could .
But I could n’t hold on for more than a few moments .
I had the impression of drowning , and a terrible agony , that of death itself , took possession of me .
In spite of myself , all the muscles of my body struggled uselessly to save me from suffocation .
In spite of myself , the fingers of both my hands shook uncontrollably . "

Nintendo nearly doubled its
Wii output , but the humble console remains in short supply . *
Photo : Lucy Nicholson / Corbis * Brace yourself for another cranky Christmas , when hopeful children get up early only to discover there 's no Wii under the tree .
The Nintendo console 's broad appeal – and a maxed - out supply chain that can't be ramped up to meet holiday demands – is making it almost impossible to snag a Wii at normal retail outlets .
With eBay scalpers selling them for hundreds of dollars over the console 's $ 250 list price , it 's easy to envision fistfights in store aisles as desperate shoppers compete for the few units on the shelves .
" I 've never seen anything like this , " says Michael Pachter , a videogame industry analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities , about the overwhelming demand for Wiis .
" Nintendo could not have expected this level of popularity . "
So , why does n't Nintendo just make more and cash in ?
It 's not that the company is n't trying .
It 's bumped up production from about 1 million to 1.8 million a month , says Nintendo Senior Vice President George Harrison , with roughly a third of them earmarked for North America .
Last week was Nintendo's best since the Wii's launch , with 350,000 sold in the United States alone .
In comparison , Microsoft sold about that many Xbox 360s last month .
It 's a remarkable triumph for a console focused on the kind of simple games skeptics originally wrote off as " thumb candy for dummies . "
Since its launch a year ago , Nintendo 's diminutive console has been perpetually sold out in North American stores .
By the time you see Wiis advertised in the Sunday paper , they 're already gone .
Yet the company insists it 's not creating artificial shortages , instead saying that demand – from gamers young and old , and from eBay sellers looking to earn quick profits – keeps increasing .
" Although we 've made efforts over the year to increase the monthly production rate , we have n't been able to catch up with demand , " admits Harrison .
The shortage stems from this unprecedented demand , and from the fact that Nintendo had to make its final production decisions for the holidays early this year , Harrison says .
The company planned on being able to stockpile Wiis through the summer , when demand for videogames typically slackens .
But Wii , Nintendo has since found out , is n't like any other videogame system .
Unceasing demand throughout the year has thrown the game industry veterans for a loop , disrupting what had been a " very seasonal business . "
" Typically , we'd have begun stockpiling console hardware back in August " for the holiday season , Harrison says .
" But this year , we were selling all the Wii we could get , and we got all the way through the summer with basically no inventory in our warehouse . "
Demand for Wii is so high , says analyst Pachter , because of all the different types of consumers competing for the units .
" Wii is the must - have gift for anyone with a kid between five and ten years old , " he says .
But it 's not just kids who crave Wii.
Grown - ups also want to get their hands on the console , which uses a motion - sensing controller to make gameplay much more realistic than standard joysticks , so they can play Wii 's tennis and bowling games .
( The latter is an especially big hit at retirement homes . )
Hard - core gamers , who initially spurned the Wii's lower graphic power compared to the Xbox and PlayStation 3 , have changed their tune on the console , thanks to brilliant software like the first - person shooter Metroid Prime 3 .
And eBay scalpers ?
They really want Wii. EBay currently lists more than 8,000 auctions for brand - new Wii systems , which sell for between $ 400 and $ 600 each .
On Wednesday , you could find the auctions easily by clicking the giant picture of a Wii on eBay 's front page .
Ultimately , Wii production numbers – and the United States ' allocation of consoles – are determined by Nintendo's home office in Kyoto , Japan .
Harrison says the company will continue producing 1.8 million
Wiis every month until demand subsides .
That should happen next spring .
But with many high - profile game releases coming after Christmas , like Super Smash Bros.
Brawl and Mario Kart , Wiis could be hard to find well into 2008 .
And if you want to put a Wii under the tree , without going to one of those eBay scalpers ?
" It 's going to take some luck , " says Harrison , who notes that retailers sometimes hold Wiis off store shelves until Sunday mornings , when the advertisements go out in the paper .
" I do n't want to say , ' Stalk the UPS driver , ' but figure out when the shipments are arriving in the store , " he says .

The European Union is n't the only entity that 's growing concerned about the privacy implications of RFID tags .
Two states that have substantial tech economies , Washington and California , have bills advancing through their state legislatures that would punish those that enable or engage in the surreptitious reading of personal information through RFID technology .
There are very significant differences , however , between the focuses of the two pieces of legislation , raising the possibility that those who produce or market RFID equipment may wind up having to navigate a confusing patchwork of state regulations .
First up is California , which previously outlawed compulsory implantation of RFID devices as a condition of employment .
There , the state senate recently passed a bill that focuses on the use of personal identification information stored in RFID tags that might simply be carried by citizens .
Here , the bill covers a lot of ground , including student and employee IDs , insurance cards , library cards , and various government documents .
Anyone reading information from those devices without their owner 's knowledge and consent will be liable for some combination of a year in jail and a $ 1,500 fine .
Various law enforcement and medical personnel are explicitly exempted .
Anyone else operating RFID equipment that accidentally reads the wrong tag is directed to destroy the data as soon as the mistake is recognized .
Washington 's bill ( PDF ) has passed the House and been sent on to the Senate .
It 's far broader in scope , and essentially spells out a bill of rights for the RFID age .
It is the further intent of the legislature that all consumers have the following fundamental rights with respect to the sale or issuance of electronic communications devices :
(1) The right to receive notice prior to a person selling or issuing an electronic communication device ;
(2) The right to expect that a person selling or issuing an electronic communication device will label the device in a clear and conspicuous manner ;
(3) The right to expect that a person selling or issuing an electronic communication device will implement security measures to ensure that any personal information stored about their consumers is secure ; and
(4) The right to seek private remedies if a person fails to comply with any of the principles outlined in subsections ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of this section .
Should the bill be enacted , consumers would be notified whenever they receive any RFID - containing device , and the seller would be responsible for following best security practices .
After the sale , scanning the devices would be permitted only following owner consent .
The bill backs up these rights with some serious financial teeth .
Anyone guilty of breaking the law would be liable for $ 10,000 per violation , and judges are given the option of tripling damages if a pattern of abuse is in evidence .
Fees for attorneys and other costs are also the responsibility of the losing side in these cases .
About the only people who are in the clear are those who resell used electronics .
It 's hard not to be enthused about the pro-privacy aspects of the legislation .
Still , the fact that radically different visions of RFID are being contemplated in different states must be causing migraines within the electronics industry .
After all , a device sold in Oregon , which does n't appear to have laws governing RFID , may face completely different issues depending on whether it 's moved north or south .
Fox hypes terror of ' White Al Qaeda Army ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The hosts of Fox & Friends are all worked up over a claim in the British press that al Qaeda may be recruiting Caucasian members to infiltrate Western societies .
" Have you heard about this new thing going on in Great Britain , " asked host Gretchen Carlson , " [ where ] Al Qaeda [ is ] rooting up all these Britons , essentially , 1400 strong , apparently , in a new , what 's being called a new ' White al Qaeda Army . '
Tougher to detect , potentially ... "
" Yeah , because they 're not Muslims , " co-host Steve Doocy commented .
" They look just like regular British people . "
" This is what we 've always talked about , " Carlson went on , " That if you have people in one country transplanting to another religion and they maybe are n't exactly what you think they are , that can be more difficult to fight .
" Yeah .
They 're converting them in prison , to , uh ... "
" To kill us ! " " Yeah , great , " said co-hosts Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy in turn .
Brian Kilmeade then brought on Mike Baker , a former CIA agent and professional counter - terrorism expert .
" Mike Baker 's here -- this word that al Qaeda 's building up a white terror army of up to 1500 operatives in the UK : " said Kilmeade .
" How soon could they strike us here , and would they be trying to do something similar using convicted criminals ? "
Baker told Kilmeade that al Qaeda looks for operatives who can fit in , just as the CIA does , saying , " If they can recruit a Scandinavian , that 's the holy grail for them . "
He added , " They need people who can move around freely and do their bidding , " apparently implying that blue - eyed blondes are the people who blend most seamlessly into Western society .
However , Baker dismissed Kilmeade 's suggestion that al Qaeda would be particularly interested in recruiting in US prisons .
" To go into a prison and try to recruit individuals -- that person 's already tainted .
What they really need , they need people who have n't run afoul of law enforcement in the past .
...
Their problems are extreme in trying to recruit someone who can go out there and carry out their business . "
Baker also commented on the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , saying , " You 're not going to sway the conspiracy theorists , and there are a lot of them , who exist on the anti-Musharraf side .
...
They just will not be convinced that the government was not involved in this . "

WASHINGTON – The first public meeting of a Bush administration " civil liberties protection panel " had a surreal quality to it , as the five - member board refused to answer any questions from the press , and stonewalled privacy advocates and academics on key questions about domestic spying .
The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board , which met Tuesday , was created by Congress in 2004 on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission , but is part of the White House , which handpicked all the members .
Though mandated by law in late 2004 , the board was not sworn in until March 2006 , due to inaction on the part of the White House and Congress .
The three - hour meeting , held at Georgetown University , quickly established that the panel would be something less than a fierce watchdog of civil liberties .
Instead , members all but said they view their job as helping Americans learn to relax and love warrantless surveillance .
" The question is , how much can the board share with the public about the protections incorporated in both the development and implementation of those policies ? " said Alan Raul , a Washington D.C. lawyer who serves as vice chairman .
" On the public side , I believe the board can help advance national security and the rights of American by helping explain how the government safeguards U.S. personal information . "
Board members were briefed on the government 's NSA - run warrantless wiretapping program last week , and said they were impressed by how the program handled information collected from American citizens ' private phone calls and e-mail .
But the ACLU 's Caroline Fredrickson was quick to ridicule the board 's response to the administration 's anti-terrorism policies , charging that the panel 's private meetings to date largely consisted of phone calls with government insiders and agencies .
" When our government is torturing innocent people and spying on Americans without a warrant , the PCLOB should act – indeed , should have acted long ago , " Fredrickson said .
" Clearly you 've been fiddling while Rome burns .
This board needs to bring a little sunshine .
So far America is kept in the dark – and this is the first public meeting you have had . "
Lisa Graves , the deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies , asked the board two simple questions :
Did they know how many Americans had been eavesdropped on by the warrantless wiretapping program , and , if so , how many ?
Raul acknowledged in a roundabout way that the data existed , but said it was too sensitive to release .
Graves then asked if the board had pushed to have that data made public , as the Justice Department is required to do with typical spy wiretaps .
Raul declined to say .
" It is important for us to retain confidentiality on what recommendations we have and have n't made , " he said .
Graves tried to push the issue of whether the board was going to be public or private , but chairwoman Carol Dinkins politely cut her off and ended the question - and - answer session .
Board member Lanny Davis , who had introduced himself by saying he grew up in a household where the ACLU was considered a " heroic organization , " jumped in to explain why the nation 's most prominent privacy board wo n't be transparent about whether it is urging more transparency .
" Congress put us in the office of the president , we did n't , " Davis said .
" Had Congress wanted us to be an incensement agency , it would have made us independent . "
The sparsely attended meeting shaped up as a mostly one - way conversation , with attendees offering suggestions on how the board could transform itself into an effective organization by building on the work of earlier government privacy panels .
Fred Cate , a cybersecurity professor at Indiana University , stressed that anti-terrorism programs that collect and sift through data on Americans – such as the no-fly list and the recently announced Automated Targeting Center that has been computing terrorism quotients for those flying in and out of the country for more than five years – need to have a robust way for people to contest the scores and underlying data .
" Redress seems to be the foundation of any system , " Cate said .
" The only certainty in this entire field is that there will be false positives . "
The committee members largely kept their views to themselves , and the press was barred from posing questions during the two short public question periods .
Dinkins , the board 's chairwoman , who is a partner at the same law firm where Attorney General Alberto Gonzales once worked , offered little beyond pleasantries .
Another board member , Francis Taylor , never spoke .
DVD Jon is growing up .
He 's no longer helping geeks free their media from DRM — he wants to make it easy enough for our parents to use , too .
Through a new venture called doubleTwist , DVD Jon ( Jon Lech Johansen ) and partner Monique Farantzos have already released a desktop and web application that makes stripping DRM from some of the world 's most popular formats — including Windows Media DRM and iTunes ' FairPlay — as easy as drag - and - drop .
" When you receive an e-mail , you can read it on your Blackberry , web mail , or Outlook .
E-mail just works , " said Farantzos in a statement .
" With digital media such as video from a friend ’s cell phone or your own iTunes playlists , it ’s a jungle out there .
It can be an hour - long exercise in futility to convert files to the correct format and transfer them to your Sony PSP or your phone . [...]
Our goal is to provide a simple and well integrated solution that the average consumer can use to eliminate the headaches associated with their expanding digital universe . "
The two new offerings start with a beta of doubleTwist desktop , a Windows Vista / XP client ( a Mac version is planned for the second quarter of the year ) .
With the desktop app , you will be able to plug in supported devices and have the software automatically recognize the media files stored on them , then transfer them to the computer and automatically convert the files ( if necessary ) to something without DRM .
From here , you can either sync up doubleTwist with your iTunes library ( there is full integration ) or share files with other friends who use doubleTwist — there is no file limit , but double Twist says that shared video files must be under 10 minutes and audio files under 20 minutes apiece .
This means that , if you plug in your device to a Windows XP machine running doubleTwist , it will see any files ( DRMed or not ) , convert them to an DRM - free format if necessary , and allow you to sync those files with another device .
And for those who still like iTunes for media management , double Twist can directly integrate with it so that you can continue managing your music there .
Supported devices so far include Sony PSP , Nokia N Series , Sony Ericsson , Walkman , and Cybershot phones , LG Viewty , some Windows Mobile smartphones , and the Amazon Kindle .
Curiously , Apple 's iPod is not listed yet , although double Twist pledges eventual iPhone compatibility .
( Even without direct plug - and - play with the iPod , doubleTwist can still read iTunes playlists and decode protected AAC files for syncing with other devices . )
doubleTwist 's Facebook widget
The second offering is " Twist me ! , " a Facebook application that lets users share files with their friends on the popular social network .
Users can select any number of music or video files ( up to 10 MB ) and upload them through the widget , which will convert them to a sharing - friendly format and send them to selected friends .
When I tried to use the app , however , it threw me an error ( presumably because of heavy traffic ) .
Again , doubleTwist promises compatibility with other social networks soon .
Convenience aside , the legality of doubleTwist 's venture is questionable .
DRM circumvention is not looked upon kindly by the law — specifically , the DMCA prohibits it except in specific cases .
Also , there 's the 800 lb.
gorilla in the corner called " file - sharing " that will surely come under legal fire within weeks , if not days .
This is why it 's even more curious that doubleTwist has already received venture funding , albeit from a European - backed venture capital firm .
Index Ventures , which has funded other startups like Skype and last .fm , appears to be thrilled about the partnership , citing double Twist as a " simple yet powerful solution for a growing consumer issue . "
Actually , we would n't exactly say that DRM is a " growing " issue — especially with the looming death of DRM in the music industry .
All four major labels and a significant number of independent music labels have already ditched DRM , and any remnants of it left on various online distributors ( including iTunes ) are sure to make their way out of the system throughout the year .
DRM is still alive and well , however , when it comes to video , so perhaps double Twist still has a healthy future if the company is able to stay on top of new DRM schemes .
Users are encouraged to submit feedback to doubleTwist with any beta issues and requests for specific device support .
Cheney lives , and he wants more war .
According to former CIA officer Phil Giraldi , Cheney remains hard at work fomenting some kind of attack or even war with Iran — and beyond that , he and George W. Bush do n’t believe their own CIA ’s latest intelligence assessment on Iran , indicating , in short that when it comes to Iran , we have little to fear but fear itself .
It may not matter what George W. Bush believes , or thinks .
He defers to Dick on national security matters .
But Dick Cheney is apparently determined to make his mark before the election of the next American president , who , if Ron Paul , will immediately work to end our foreign policy fiascos , and if it is one of the remaining Democratic contenders , will slowly and more slowly , hesitantly and more hesitantly , try to begin to withdraw from the Bush wars .
Any new president is bad news for Cheney , who operates without legal , political or moral constraints , and wishes to continue to fight everyone he can in the Middle East and beyond .
But the world community and hometown America wo n’t stomach the selling of yet another unnecessary war in the Middle East so soon .
War by accident , to quote a phrase used by Phil Giraldi in his Antiwar.com interview on January 24th , seems to be Cheney ’s preferred pathway towards destruction in Iran .
Our government in Washington , D.C. has a serious appetite , and a million dead Iraqis and thousands more dead Afghanis cannot quench it .
This appetite cannot be for democracy , as neither Afghanistan nor Iraq exist in any condition resembling democracy , and Iran already has a working democracy , with multiple constraints on executive power through a complex balance of political and religious governmental systems .
It ca n’t be an appetite for revenge — because as George W. Bush famously said years ago , he is n’t that worried about Bin Laden , and we long ago set up our own Unocal - friendly puppet in Kabul , presumably eliminating any need for revenge against the Taliban for 9/11 .
As we all know , Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 ; even the President has admitted this .
And we ’ve already hanged our errant former ally Saddam Hussein , ostensibly closing that case .
Surely , it is not an appetite for either justice or national security .
The reasons given for the ongoing wars — namely that Afghanistan ’s government and later Iraq posed a threat to us directly — was always laughable .
That superficial reason upon which " everyone could agree " today seems ancient history .
Yet still we find echoes of this lifeless rationale in the administration ’s public and private statements on Iran , most recently in the latest " state of the union " address , and in recent Bush and Rice harangues to our remaining Middle Eastern allies .
So what is it all about ?
What other appetites consume our nation ?
What other hunger seizes our Congress ?
What does Cheney and the American Enterprise Institute crave ?
Why does Washington threaten countries like Iraq , Iran , and behave despicably towards non-threatening small countries like Russia and Venezuela ?
Why do we obsess about Turkey and worry about Saudi Arabia ?
Why do we subsidize both rich and poor nuclear - capable states in the Middle East , while occupying and harassing poor non-nuclear states ?
I certainly do n’t know the answers .
But the New Testament offers an explanation worth considering , with " For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . "
Saddam Hussein may have sealed his death warrant in November 2000 , when he announced Iraq would cease oil sales in dollars and deal exclusively in euros .
It was a business decision , as Saddam sold most Iraqi oil to EU countries ; yet it must have been satisfying for the bombed out and politically castrated Hussein to show his contempt for the almighty dollar .
Iran — even as we collaborate with and oblige Iranian - influenced Shia leaders in Iraq , trying at one point to emplace an Iranian - influenced Shia leader named Chalabi as next Iraqi dictator — has endured Washington ’s shrillest complaints concurrent with Iran ’s intentions and actions to leave the dollar for other world currencies .
Turkey is in the news today , because the highest levels of the Bush administration casually committed treason in revealing nuclear intelligence secrets to the Turkish government , for both fun and profit .
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds , instead of being called into the White House to share what she knows about spies and security leaks that endanger American lives during a " war on terror , " was instead judicially gagged by this administration from speaking to anyone about anything she knows .
But Turkey should also be in the news today as a launching pad for more U.S. - desired war , and as a recent target of American anger for its material support of financial transactions by the dollar - rejecting Iranian government .
Why does the Bush - Cheney administration , with a congressional chorus in full - throated cheer , threaten oil producers Venezuela and Russia ?
And come to think of it , what happened to communications cables in the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf last week ?
Cheney apparently hopes for an accidental war , an engineered provocation that would rise above the level of Borat on a radio , and so avoid public complaint about lame duck crazies and murder most foul .
But to think that any of the wars of the Bush administration have been accidental would be naïve .
The new network of U.S. military bases — intended from the beginning to be permanent — has been no accident .
The timing of verbal and physical attacks on Afghanistan , Iraq and possibly in the future , Iran , were not and will not be accidental .
Instead , these wars are the result of a clear vision on the part of the Washington , D.C. establishment — facilitated by popular neoconservative rhetoric on democracy , global values , evil axes , and the defense of Israel .
This vision — remarkably crass and ridiculous even as it is compelling and dangerous — is that the dollar , and Washington ’s ability to keep printing it without anyone noticing the inflation , the lack of faith , and the criminality of it all , must be supported by the rest of the world .
World faith in the dollar no longer rests on substantive reality , but on an illusion that most of the world ’s inhabitants , and all of its bankers , now see through .
Unfortunately , it is an illusion that the Washington establishment , secretly applauding the Bush / Cheney crusade against uppity oil producers , intends to enforce militarily .

With colourful make - up of bright yellows , startling whites and rich earth - reds , flamboyant accessories and extraordinarily elaborate decorations , you'd be forgiven for thinking that the designs in these images originated in the fevered mind of some leading fashionista .
Yet far from the catwalks of New York , London or Paris , these looks are the sole creation of the Surma and Mursi tribes of East Africa 's Omo Valley .
Inspired by the wild trees , exotic flowers and lush vegetation of the area bordering Ethiopia , Kenya and Sudan , these tribal people have created looks that put the most outlandish creations of Western catwalk couturiers to shame .
Scroll down for more ...
Here , a leaf or root is transformed into an accessory .
Instead of a scarf , a necklace of banana leaves is draped around a neck .
In place of a hat , a tuft of grass is jauntily positioned .
A garland of flowers , a veil of seed - pods , buffalo horn , a crown of melons , feathers , stems and storks - Mother Nature has provided a fully stocked wardrobe .
Like a dressing - up chest brimming over with costumes and make - up ( paint created with pigments from powdered stone ) , the natural environment is the source for this glorious jungle pantomime .
Scroll down for more ...
Although the origins of this astonishing tradition have been lost over the years - the Surma and Mursi spend much of their time involved in tribal and guerilla warfare - their homeland is a hotbed of the arms and ivory trades .
Fifteen tribes have lived in this region since time immemorial , and many use zebra skins for leggings , snail shells for necklaces and clay to stick their wonderful designs to their heads .
As they paint each other 's bodies and make bold decisions about their outfits ( all without the aid of mirrors ) , it seems that the only thing that motivates them is the sheer fun of creating their looks , and showing them off to other members of the tribe .
As a celebration of themselves and of their stunning environment , this is truly an African fashion parade like no other .
• Pictures by Hans Silvester ( Rapho / Camera Press ) from the book Natural Fashion : Tribal Decoration from Africa by Hans Silvester , published by Thames and Hudson , £ 19.95 .
The 15 - year - old has attracted interest from several clubs but has joined the Gunners after a fee - reported to be around £ 200,000 - was agreed .
Freeman , who turns 16 in March , has signed a two - year deal to become part of Arsenal 's youth set - up on their schoolboy / scholar scheme .
" This is a great opportunity for me , " he said .
Freeman became the youngest player ever to feature in the FA Cup in November and added : " I thank Gillingham for everything they did but I am now hoping to be a success with Arsenal . "
West Ham and Newcastle were among the other clubs to have targeted him .
Gillingham chairman Paul Scally said : " It is a shame for Gillingham to lose a special talent such as Luke but we cannot stand in the way of such a fantastic opportunity .
" Arsenal have gone about their business in a fair and commendable way so it was a pleasure to do the deal with them .
" They are a fantastic club and I know that they are the right ones to take Luke on and make him into a Premiership player . "
One of these might be fake .
Can you guess which ?
My apologies .
Apparently quite a few people did n't realize I was being sarcastic when I said " one of these might be fake . "
I thought it was pretty obvious both of them were fake .
( Note that I did n't say ' only one is fake ' . )
To make up for it , here 's a third view from an airplane window , and this one is definitely real .
This photo was taken on July 13 , 2004 aboard an AirTran flight from Atlanta to Orlando with 110 people on board .
The left engine cowling came off soon after take off , but the plane managed to turn around and land safely .
President Bush , in proposing a fiscal 2009 budget with a near - record deficit , insisted the government will run a surplus by 2012 .
But that outlook is based on scenarios considered unlikely by budget experts , congressional Democrats and even some Republicans .
War spending would have to drop to a fraction of its current level .
Congress would have to make steep cuts in a raft of domestic programs , while cracking down on the growth of Medicare and Medicaid .
And the economy , now slowing sharply , would have to rebound quickly to ...
Video : Ron Paul joins anti-abortion protesters for Roe v. Wade anniversary
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul joined a Tuesday Washington , DC protest of the Supreme Court decision that paved the way for legal abortions in the United States .
The anti-war and pro-liberty candidate showed that pro-life positions were also a central part of his political agenda in an address before the 2008 " March For Life . "
" The Constitution protects all life , " Paul declared at the rally , as shown in a video posted at the website YouTube .
" Unless we resolve this tremendous moral dilemma , just think , today , a baby , one minute before life , deserves protection , and one minute after life , we still pretend it 's called murder . "
As thousands marched in Washington , the candidate also picked up an endorsement from Norma McCorvey , also known as Jane Roe from the Roe v. Wade decision .
" I support Ron Paul for president because we share the same goal , that of overturning Roe v. Wade , " McCorvey said in a statement .
" He has never wavered on the issue of being pro-life and has a voting record to prove it . "
The endorsement picked up mix reactions from Paul 's supporters , many of whom have been drawn to the candidate because of his positions against the Iraq War and in favor of civil liberties .
" What 's so great about this endorsement ?
She a ** up person , " wrote a commenter at the Ron Paul Forums .
But other Paul supporters embraced the endorsement head on .
" Let 's hope this brings us lots of votes from the pro-life movement ! " wrote another participant on the same website .
A partial video of Paul 's campaign appearance is included below .
Next month , Masdar ( which means " the source " in Arabic ) near Abu Dhabi , the capital of the United Arab Emirates will host the ground breaking of a six - square - kilometer city that its developers say will be the first zero-pollution , zero - waste city .
The city will be capable of housing 47,500 people , who are scheduled to start moving there in 2009 .
Construction is expected to take 10 years . "
The vision of the city , designed by Foster and Partners , is to be a model for sustainable architecture .
It will feature a solar - photovoltaic power plant , solar canopies that provide shade , an electric light - rail system , a series of automated transport pods ( instead of cars ) , a desalination facility and wastewater recovery system to grow plants that could be used for biofuels

j Query UI and beyond :
The jQuery - Liferay partnership
Posted on by
j Query UI is growing , and I ’m already seeing quite a few sites using it exclusively to support their interface .
As a matter of fact , it ’s growing so well , that a LA - based open - source company decided to hire a person to exclusively work on jQuery UI full - time .
I ’m very happy to announce that I , Paul Bakaus , lead of jQuery UI , was hired by Liferay Inc. , the company behind the world ’s most popular open source java portal , to focus solely on bringing jQuery UI to a next level .
This has an enormous effect to the whole project – I can now invest almost three times the amount of time and power , and I ’m helping to deploy jQuery and jQuery UI in mission critical projects , which makes a huge difference .
Liferay ’s plans are to standardize all their products to use jQuery and its plugins for the future ( you ’ll still be able to use other libraries at the same time ) – it ’s therefore in their very interest to see jQuery UI enjoying a long life , growing to meet expectations of all kinds of clients and beyond .
To reach this goal , hiring me was the most logical decision : I now have no excuse not - to - focus on jQuery UI for a while – after all , it ’s my day job !
But the cooperation with Liferay is even more than that : Liferay will be the first company starting from today to offer business critical support services for both jQuery and jQuery UI .
Not only we ’ll have a open source company backing us , but it ’s the best publicity a project can have : j Query UI will run in huge intranets , on every copy of Liferay .
This will have a strong effect on both the distribution of the project and the level of quality that is being provided .
I myself am extremely excited about the change – there are countless positive side effects and products coming up – new products featuring jQuery , sponsored themes for UI , a new website , and of course – a new version of jQuery UI ( the release date of the new , polished version with all the long - awaited bugfixes will be announced in the next couple of days ) .
Though iTunes blazed a trail in encouraging fans to pay for music online , record executives now complain that Steven P. Jobs , Apple ’s chief executive , wields too much clout in setting prices and other terms .
At issue now is whether the labels can help popularize a more industry - friendly service and accelerate the pace of digital sales .
Behind this strategy is a growing desperation : sales of digital albums and songs are rising far too slowly to offset the rapid decline of the CD , the industry ’s mainstay product .
CD sales slid 19 percent last year ; after adding in the 50 million digital albums sold last year and counting every 10 digital songs sold as an album , overall music sales were still down 9.5 percent , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
In trying to nurture Amazon ’s service , the four major record companies have offered it one potential edge .
One by one , they have agreed to offer their music catalogs for sale on the service in the MP3 format , without the digital locks that restrict users from making copies of the songs .
( Sony BMG Music Entertainment , the second - biggest company and the last holdout , signed on last week .
Sony BMG is a joint venture of Sony and Bertelsmann ) .
All of the companies except the EMI Group still require Apple to sell their music wrapped in digital rights management software , or D.R.M. , which is intended to discourage rampant copying .
Some consumers say D.R.M. creates confusing problems , like a lack of compatibility between most songs and the devices sold by Apple and Microsoft .
In fact , it was Mr. Jobs who , in February , called on the industry to drop its longstanding insistence on the use of the software , saying it had failed to rein in piracy .
In any case , the industry is waiting to see whether  and how quickly 
Amazon can grow into a credible alternative to iTunes , and whether Mr. Jobs will stand by as his service , which commands as much as 80 percent of digital download sales , is challenged .
Costa Rica : Ridiculously Picturesque
Distance driven : 743 km
Traffic signals seen : about 5
Rainbows seen : about 10
Monkeys seen by us : 0
Monkeys seen by everyone else : like a million
Weather forecast : rainy with a chance of sun , or sunny with a chance of rain .
Winds gusting to infinity .
Overview Costa Rica is a tropical and mountainous little strip between the Caribbean and the Pacific .
The country voluntarily abolished its military in 1948 — a move unprecedented by any nation , let alone one bordered by Nicaragua and Panama — and as any Tico would be proud to tell you , the money saved was spent on social services and ecological preservation .
( They 'll also remind you that Jurassic Park was filmed here . )
The whole country is a lush green paradise .
At one point we honestly saw butterflies fluttering over a mountain spring with a rainbow in the background .
Not in a national park , either — this was while driving one of the main roads !
If there 's an ugly part of Costa Rica , we did n't find it .
On a perhaps related note , we can't remember seeing anyone at all who was in a bad mood .
How could anyone be grumpy when there are rainbows everywhere ?
The food
We ate like the locals whenever we could — comida tipica generally consists of rice and beans , plantains , triangles of crumbly salty cheese , and terrific meats that taste like they went from the farm to your plate in less than a day : grass - fed beef , fatty pork , free - range chicken ...
Our first hotel actually had chickens roaming the grounds ; needless to say , we ordered a lot of chicken and a lot of eggs .
Arroz con pollo , which we tried just about everywhere , always came with french fries .
The condiments were slightly different from what we were used to : the ketchup was much sweeter —
Mike insisted it tasted like plums — and I 'm sure there was lime juice in the mayonnaise .
Naturally , there were native sauces as well .
The two ubiquitous ones are both made by Linzano ( a wholly - owned subsidiary of Unilever ) : Salsa , smooth and green and used by the locals like ketchup ; and Tobasco , thicker than the American product of the same name ... more like Sriracha chile sauce , but without the Asian spices .
Lodging Costa Rica has the full spectrum of hotel options ( we even saw a Best Western ) , but the " collection of tiny cabins " variety seemed to be the most common , at least in our price range .
This allows plenty of space for landscaping , and there were bright , healthy - looking flowers all over the place .
One hotel even did some towel origami with fresh orchids .
I do n't know why they even bother painting lines on the road .
Driving Driving in Costa Rica is an adventure in itself .
The best ( and most mundane ) conditions can be found on the Pan - American Highway , a 30,000 - mile multicontinental route than runs all the way up to Alaska and , except for one impassable marsh , all the way down to Tierra del Fuego .
The secondary roads never have more than one lane in each direction — and sometimes less than that .
A country this wet and hilly requires many bridges , and they 're all the width of a single car .
The side marked " CEDA " has to yield to oncoming traffic .
The rest of the roads , however , are unpaved .
Wait , I do n't think that really drives the point home ; if you 're envisioning a bucolic , dusty country road you 're way off .
You know how the health food store sells that really chunky peanut butter , where they basically just broke each peanut in half and put it in a jar ?
That 's the texture I 'm talking about .
But wait , there 's more .
Who needs guardrails ?
You know those guardrails they have up in the mountains ?
Yeah , not in Costa Rica .
You know what they have instead ?
Impenetrable fog .
Also cows .
And let 's not forget the frequent bouts of torrential rain .
But do n't let all this discourage you ; just as the Norwegians say there 's no such thing as bad weather ( only insufficient attire ) , the key to driving these parts is to have un coche fuerte .
We were in a Mitsubishi Nativa , the local version of the Montero .
Not to sound like a car commercial , but such a beefy ride makes these roads downright fun — like riding a wild beast across the badlands .
Just turn on the four - wheel drive , perhaps shift into a low gear , and Bob 's your uncle .
It was as rough as a wooden roller coaster , but I never doubted that we 'd reach our destination safely .
The catch is that you have to keep it around 30 kph ( 20 mph ) , but it 's a small country so you 'll get where you 're going by dinnertime .
Speaking of which , do n't expect your destination to have a street address .
The streets have no names — or if they do , they 're not marked and the people who live there do n't know 'em .
If you ask for an address , you 'll get something like " 50 meters southwest of the church . "
We asked for directions at one point and were told to make a left , then a right , then a down .
You might think all these problems would make Costa Rican drivers aggressive , but nothing could be further from the truth .
There 's a casual we 're - all - in - this - togetherness that permeates their driving culture .
If there 's a family walking down the road , just wait for them to move over .
If both sides of the road are covered in rocks , go right down the middle ; when you eventually see an oncoming vehicle , he wo n't honk or get angry because he 's almost certainly been doing the same thing .
There was one point where we thought they were taking this go - with - the - flow thing a bit too far .
After a long stretch where we had n't seen any cars for a while , we suddenly came upon a whole bunch of them all stopped for something in the road .
What was going on ?
An accident ?
A fallen tree ?
No , it was a family of coatis crossing the street .
Now , there 's nothing wrong with that , we waited our turn ... but just as we were reaching the front of the line , the fellow coming the other way got out of his car , chopped up a banana and fed them — IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD !
I tell you , when you drop banana chunks in front of a few coatis , a dozen more come out of the woodwork and they swarm and fight and run underneath your car .
We waited a full minute — nobody behind us honked — and then slowly pulled forward .
Thankfully , the banana - crazed furballs got out of our way .
But enough about driving .
Hilary 's going to tell you about some of the sights .
Arenal Volcano and Baldi Hot Springs
We signed up for a guided hike up Arenal Volcano ( known as Arenal Mountain until a big surprise in 1968 ) and the tour company picked us up in the afternoon .
There were about 20 of us , but unlike the group at Antelope Canyon , nobody was annoying .
The sun was shining when we reached Arenal National Park , but that was the last we 'd see of it for the next 24 hours .
Secondary rainforest Arenal is still an active volcano that throws out rocks and noxious gases on a regular basis .
For this reason , visitors are only allowed partway up the mountain , and there are signs warning hikers to turn back quickly if there 's an eruption .
Our guide explained the sights as we went .
We first walked through the fields where the lava had flowed during the 1968 eruption , killing all the plants in its way .
This ecosystem is known as the " secondary rainforest , " because all the growth is recent .
Plants grow fast in the tropics , though , so the trees were nonetheless tall and host to countless bromeliads .
The most unusual plant we saw was probably the " touch - me - not , " a tiny flower with fernlike leaves that fold up at even the slightest touch , whether by human hands or cow tongues .
This keeps the plants from getting eaten , because the folded leaves make it look dead .
It also provided a good 10 minutes of entertainment to our group .
Before After
As for animals , we saw vultures , a toucan , and two interesting species of ant .
The so - called leafcutters chomp off bits of leaf and march them back to the nest , where the leaves decompose and mushrooms grow in their place .
Then the ants eat the mushrooms .
They travel along a sort of ant highway stripped of anything green , the line of ants streaming from the nest to the plant and back again .
The other kind , the acacia ant , is named after a hollow , bamboo - like tree with which they have a symbiotic relationship .
Whenever anything threatens their home , they pour out to defend it .
Our guide knocked on a seemingly empty tree , and within seconds the exterior was swarming with hundreds of them .
Primary rainforest
As we made our way up the volcano we reached the surviving old - growth , " primary rainforest . "
It suddenly started to rain heavily , and never stopped .
Despite our raingear , our clothes were soaked through .
The guide offered the opportunity to turn back , but the group elected to continue on — even a man who was wearing a medical boot and a couple with a 9 - month - old baby .
Soon we were surrounded by tall mahogany trees draped with vines .
It looked like Pitfall .
We even saw a coffee plant , which is not indigenous to the region and must have been a remnant of a farm that predated the eruption .
The terrain grew steeper until topping off at a rocky black plain , the limit of where we could safely hike .
We saw Lake Arenal in the distance , but the thick rainclouds completely obscured the volcano 's cone .
You 'll have to go to Wikipedia for pictures .
The tour concluded with a visit to Baldi Hot Springs , where our soggy group warmed up in the naturally hot pools .
It was there that we finally encountered annoying tourists , like the people who were too shy to change clothes in the changing area and instead used one of the few toilet stalls , ensuring long lines all night in both restrooms .
We still had a good time , jumping between adjacent frigid and piping - hot pools , standing under scalding waterfalls , and partaking of that most glorious of man 's achievements , the swim - up bar .
Monteverde Cloud Forest After Arenal , we headed to Monteverde for a few days in the cloud forest , a high - altitude rainforest full of extremely tall trees .
We were signed up to spend a morning with SkyTrek , which operates a series of trails and ziplines in a privately - owned section of the forest .
SkyTrek has set up 11 lines that crisscross over the treetops , some more than a half - mile long and 400 feet high .
When we arrived , we were given helmets , harnesses , gloves , and pulleys , and marched through the forest to the base of a metal tower .
I was shaking in terror as we climbed the tight spiral staircase and crossed a narrow catwalk , both of which were swaying in the ever - present Costa Rican wind .
This was the worst part , hiking to the first zipline and listening to the safety demonstration .
Unlike the ziplines Batman uses , the SkyTrek cables are nearly horizontal , like a giant clothesline .
You can twist the pulley to create friction and slow down , but since the lowest part is in the middle , you need to have enough speed to reach the end or else you 'll start sliding backwards , buffeted by the crosswinds while you dangle and spin hundreds of feet above the ground .
Yikes .
One of the towers Looking down at the treetops
Luckily none of that actually happened to us , and after riding the first line , I was so hooked that I forget all about being scared .
I absolutely could n't get enough ; I can't remember the last time I 'd had so much fun .
Some lines were fast ( they claimed 45 mph ) , some were long ( " Pleasepleaseplease let me make it to the other end " ) , some went over the trees , and some went through them — these were the most fun , as we zoomed through leafy tunnels with branches whizzing by just out of injury range .
Mike arrives ( part 1 ) Mike arrives ( part 2 ) Proof that we both made it out alive
You can see more pictures of ziplining fun ( and Costa Rica in general ) in our Flickr album , and we also uploaded three videos to YouTube .

The " Canadians "
At dinner one night , we overheard the chatty waiter asking the couple at the next table where they were from .
" Canada , " they replied .
Now , I know Canada is a diverse place and all , but based on earlier eavesdropping we were pretty sure they were Americans .
It 's not that we were listening for " aboot " and " eh ? " or the topics of hockey and maple syrup ; we just think we have pretty good Canaydar .
Hil and I spent the rest of dinner coming up with questions we could challenge them with .
Winners include :
Who 's the president of Canada ?
Oops , I mean who 's the prime minister of Canada ?
What 's the capital of Nunavut ?
What is Nunavut ?
Who 's not Canadian : William Shatner , Jason Priestly , Jane Curtin , or Pamela Anderson ?
I wanted to actually try these on the impostors , but Hilary demanded I not cause an international incident .
Bull soccer Later , we were flipping through the local channels and came upon a Costa Rican bullfight .
As you might expect in such a peaceful and nature - loving country , this was not your normal bullfight .
For starters , nobody seemed to be trying to hurt the bull .
Also , instead of a solitary matador dressed in a fancy costume , there were dozens of apparent amateurs running around in street clothes .
One even had a backpack .
After puzzling over this spectacle for 20 minutes , we surmised that a Costa Rican bullfight is like a soccer match , except the ball weighs hundreds of pounds and is alive and violent .
The competitors seemed to be trying to lure the bull across the ring , presumably to their respective goals .
Bulls , of course , are not really known for their tractability , so the process went something like this :
Annoy bull Run for your life ( ideally towards the goal ) Jump into the stands
Let some other idiot take over Pepsi was a major sponsor .
Oh , and there was no evidence that anyone was keeping score .
Note : after writing the above , we looked it up .
You can compare our observations to this Frommer 's article .
Credit hassles
Around this time we had a bit of trouble with our credit card and posted about it here .
Everything eventually turned out okay , but while it was going on a bunch of social news sites picked up the story and for 24 hours we were kind of a big deal .
Happy New Year !
On the afternoon of December 31 we arrived in Tamarindo , a perfectly nice little beach community that was nonetheless not all that different from every other little beach community in the world .
Still , what better place to ring in the new year ?

February 21 2008 : Zhou Youguang is the inventor of Pinyin , a romanisation of the Chinese lexicon used by millions to learn the language
Representative Ron Paul , Republican of Texas , has not let an overall distant finish in his party ’s primaries and caucuses on Tuesday put a dent in his presidential aspirations .
In fact , his campaign says he walked away with a prize .
“ We ’re confident that we ’ve secured at least 24 delegates , ” a Paul campaign spokesman , Jesse Benton , said on Wednesday .
Some Republican Party officials have declined to confirm the campaign ’s projections .
The Paul campaign said it won nine delegates in Minnesota , but Mark Drake , a spokesman for that state ’s Republican Party , chuckled after hearing the suggestion .
While it is “ theoretically possible ” that Mr. Paul could pick up delegates , Mr. Drake said , they have not yet been awarded .
In West Virginia , the campaign says , Mr. Paul won three delegates .
But the chief executive of the West Virginia Republican Presidential Convention , Bob Fish , said that his state had a “ winner - take - all ” format and that Mike Huckabee of Arkansas “ won the 18 delegates . ”
Mr. Fish noted that delegates were not “ legally bound ” to support Mr. Huckabee .
Mr. Benton acknowledged that there was “ some confusion . ”
Still , after the official delegate counts have been determined , Mr. Paul is likely to come away with some .
North Dakota party officials , for instance , said Mr. Paul won 21 percent of the vote in that state ’s caucus and five delegates .
The Paul campaign said it was looking ahead to the Texas primary on March 4 . Mr. Paul will appear on Sunday at a campaign rally in his hometown , Lake Jackson , Tex .
JANUARY 15 -- Disgraced and disbarred , Mike Nifong is now bankrupt .
The former North Carolina prosecutor , whose career imploded with his botched handling of the Duke University rape case , today filed for bankruptcy , listing liabilities in excess of $ 180 million .
A summary schedule from Nifong 's Chapter 7 petition can be found here .
Almost all of that sum represents legal claims filed against the former Durham County district attorney by members of Duke 's 2006 lacrosse team , including the three players who were accused of raping a stripper at a team party .
Included among Nifong 's assets are a 2003 Honda Accord , about $ 9000 in personal property , and his $ 235,000 home .
He lists nearly $ 5000 monthly in pension or retirement income and describes himself , charitably , as retired .

It has been three months since the popular ( semi ) private BitTorrent tracker Demonoid went offline .
Since then , there has been a lot of speculation about its future , and many feared that the site would never return .
Totally out of the blue , however , the tracker is now responding again .
The frontend of Demonoid is still hosted in the US , together with the popular Subdemon forums .
Interestingly , the tracker – which has been offline for months – is now hosted in Malaysia , and has started to respond again , approximately 30 hours ago .
It is of course not clear what this all means , but without an official message from the Demonoid team , speculation has started .
Could it be that the site has found a new host , and preparing a return ?
Many former Demonoid members are secretly hoping that this is indeed the case .
Last December , Deimos , the founder and main admin of what used to be one of the most popular BitTorrent trackers , posted a message on the Subdemon forums on the possibility of a return .
At the time he wrote : “ Money is an issue , but the real problem at the moment is finding a suitable place to host the website .
There has been no luck there .
And there ’s some personal stuff I need to take care of that takes most of my time at the moment , and that does not help . ”
For those who forgot , here is a recap of what has happened so far .
The trouble for Demonoid started back in June , when the Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN started to put pressure on Demonoid and their ISP , Leaseweb .
Deimos decided that the Netherlands was n’t the safe haven it used to be and he to moved the site to Canada , which resulted in a few days of downtime .
Deimos never really told the administrators or members of the site exactly what was happening .
Initially , most members assumed that there was some hardware failure , but after a few days it became clear that Demonoid was more or less forced to move .
Maybe there could have been hardware failures too , who knows , but the outcome was the same – Canada here we come .
Relocating the servers to Canada initially solved the problems , but , by the end of September Deimos took Demonoid offline for the second time .
Again , nobody knew what was going on until we found out that the CRIA was responsible for the downtime , which was later confirmed by Deimos .
It turned out that Canada was n’t the best choice after all .
After 5 days of downtime the site returned , now blocking all traffic from Canadian users in an attempt to calm down the CRIA .
At first it looked like the storm was finally over , but on November 9th Demonoid ’s users were welcomed by a disappointing message on the frontpage explaining that the CRIA was indeed responsible for the downtime .
So will Demonoid ever return ?
The fact that the tracker is back online , in a different location seems to suggest that there is something happening .
Update : February 20 , tracker offline again after 3 days uptime .

All the publicity that the Don Siegelman case has brought in the last couple of days has made the rats in the Alabama Republican party scurrying to find the safety of darkness again .
Led by chief rat Karl Rove , the modus operandi is to deny , deny , deny .
The only problem ?
You have 52 Attorneys General , Republican and Democrat alike , who say that this case just does n't pass the smell test .
The case rests on the testimony of Dana Jill Simpson who has come forward to say that Karl Rove asked her to dig up compromising sexual photographs of Siegelman .
Classy guy , that Turdblossom .
Besides denying that they know Simpson ( which as she points out in the clip is a simple matter of explaining away phone records ) , things took a decidedly more sinister tone , as Larisa Alexandrovna documents :
As 60 Minutes was putting its show together , the White House put pressure on CBS -- the parent company -- to kill the show .
Over the last few days , as word got out that the 60 Minutes show would air tonight , Karl Rove 's associates began planting defamatory stories about journalists working on this story ( see example here ) and attacking the whistle - blower who came forward , Dana Jill Simpson .
If you recall , Ms. Simpson testified , under oath , to Congress about Karl Rove 's involvement in politicizing the DOJ .
What you may not know , however , is that her house mysteriously caught fire and she was run off the road in the weeks leading up to her testimony .
What you may also not know is that Governor Siegelman 's house was broken into twice during his trial as was his attorney 's office .
Yesterday , the attacks on Simpson and journalists increased with a series of emails from the Alabama GOP .
See Here .
I 'm not trying to be overly dramatic , but as the layers get pulled away in this case , I 'm having a harder and harder time believing that this is America and not some third world dictatorship .

My Statement Before the Judge
By John Dear
It 's a powerful experience to stand before a judge and be sentenced to jail for saying
No to war , injustice and nuclear weapons , something I highly recommend for all followers of the nonviolent Jesus .
It really helps clarify one 's discipleship , one 's citizenship in God 's reign of peace , one 's faith , hope and love .
In these days of war , genocide , nuclear weapons , poverty , executions , abortion , torture , global warming , and violence of every description , it 's a great grace to be in trouble with the empire for practicing nonviolence , for daring to offer a word of peace , for serving the God of peace .
On Thursday morning , January 24th , I 'll stand in Federal Court in Albuquerque , New Mexico and be sentenced for our effort , nearly a year and a half ago now , to visit the office of our Senator .
Judge Donald
Svet asked us to write letters to him about ourselves , and allowed my co-defendants each to make a statement at their sentencing last November .
Here below are excerpts from my notes of what I will say in court on Thursday , if allowed .
Regardless of the outcome for me , my prayer is that more and more people will speak out against this evil , ongoing U.S. war on Iraq and in the process , we might all reclaim our fidelity to the nonviolent Jesus .
In 1999 , I led a delegation of Nobel Peace Prize winners to Iraq and met with thousands of Iraqis , including Vice Premier Tarik Aziz , the United Nation 's leading officials , the director of every non-governmental organization ( including Margaret Hassan , head of CARE , who was assassinated several years ago ) , the nation 's leading imams and the Papal Nuncio , and doctors who explained the effects of the U.S. sanctions which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children during the 1990s .
I remember visiting the girls ' high school in Baghdad , and hearing hundreds of girls cry out with tears , " Why are you trying to kill us ? "
It was painful to witness so much suffering .
Since then , I 've been trying to tell the world that we must stop killing Iraqis , including children .
I went to the Federal Building in Santa Fe , NM on September 26th , 2006 to present Senator Domenici 's office a copy of the " Declaration of Peace , " calling upon citizens everywhere , including Senators and Congressional Representatives , to speak out against the U.S. war and occupation on Iraq , to work to stop the war and pursue nonviolent solutions for the people of Iraq and the Middle East .
I wanted the staff of Senator Domenici to fax the statement to him and ask him to sign it .
Some of us had already mailed a copy to him , but had not received a response .
As a Christian and a priest who walks in the tradition of Martin Luther King , Jr. , Dorothy Day and Mahatma Gandhi , I believe no Christian can support this war and still claim to follow the nonviolent Jesus because Jesus commands us to " put down the sword " and " love our enemies . "
Jesus blesses peacemakers , not warmakers .
Christians and all religious people are called to obey a higher law , God 's eternal law of nonviolence .
I wanted to explain to the Senator and his staff , that this war is a complete disaster for the U.S. , Iraq , and the world .
From the start , it was a complete fabrication .
The President and the Pentagon claimed they were searching for weapons of mass destruction , even though many people around the world knew there were none in Iraq , and claimed that Iraq was involved in the September 11th attacks , which many also knew was impossible .
The U.S. government used these lies to steal Iraq 's oil and further establish U.S. military control in the region .
This war is illegal ( in violation of international law and the Nuremberg Principles ) , totally unjust and immoral , downright impractical and mortally sinful .
In light of September 11th , this war has turned the entire world against our country , and sowed the seeds for future terrorist attacks against us .
It does not promote security but instead threatens everyone 's security .
It wreaks havoc on the people of Iraq and the Middle East , as well as our country and the people of New Mexico .
It is also a complete waste of money .
Those billions of dollars spent killing Iraqi children should be used instead to house the homeless , feed the hungry , provide universal healthcare and better schools , heal the returning veterans , and cleanup the environment , here in New Mexico , in Iraq , and throughout the world .
I want the Senator and the New Mexico government and the Federal courts and all government leaders to stop this war because it is killing thousands of U.S. soldiers , including New Mexicans , and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , mainly civilians .
No one deserves to die so that U.S. oil corporations can get richer , or for any reason .
Our message is : the killing must stop now .
That day , I carried the names of every U.S. soldier killed , and some ten thousand Iraqi civilians killed , and read them aloud to remind myself and others of this reality .
Although many people are now against this war , unfortunately , the killing still goes on , and still needs to stop .
So I hope that Senator Domenici , his staff , New Mexico 's government and the U.S. government will reverse its stand , stop the killing , end this evil war , make massive reparations to the people of Iraq , and seek new nonviolent , non-military policies for the people of Iraq , the United States and the world .
I also hope that you , Judge Svet , will join us by working to end this evil war and pursuing God 's reign of nonviolence .
This morning , I think of Mahatma Gandhi as he stood before a judge on March 18 , 1922 .
" Non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good , " he said .
I think this war is evil , and every effort to legalize this war and our weapons of mass destruction is evil , so I will continue to resist this evil war in a spirit of Christian nonviolence , love and truth .
Accordingly , I will not pay any fine , nor will I undertake any community service ; my whole life is community service .
I can not cooperate with this unjust system which continues to kill sisters and brothers in Iraq and elsewhere .
As Gandhi said to his judge , I think you have two options : either renounce your guilty verdict upon me and join our campaign to end this war by upholding international law and the Nuremberg principles and supporting those who work nonviolently to end this war ; or if you really support this unjust system which makes war , maintains weapons of mass destruction here in New Mexico , and kills people in Iraq and Afghanistan , then give me maximum sentence .
The whole world knows this war is a disaster .
History will judge us all for where we stood , what we did , what we said at this kairos moment .
I urge you to choose life , take a stand for peace , and call upon the whole country to speak out against this war and be converted to the truth of nonviolence .
But I take my case to a higher court , and plead before the ultimate judge , the God of peace , for us all : " Give us a new world without war , poverty or nuclear weapons , a new world where one and all live by your eternal law of nonviolence .
Help us to end this war and abolish war forever .
Thank you ,
God of peace , for hearing my plea .
Amen . "

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. embassy in Iraq is investigating another deadly shooting incident involving its Blackwater bodyguards -- this time of the New York Times ’s dog .
Staff at the newspaper ’s Baghdad bureau said Blackwater bodyguards shot Hentish dead last week before a visit by a U.S. diplomat to the Times compound .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said the dog had attacked one of Blackwater ’s bomb - sniffer dogs while a security team was sweeping the compound for explosives .
“ The K - 9 handler made several unsuccessful attempts to get the dog to retreat , including placing himself between the dogs .
When those efforts failed , the K - 9 handler unfortunately was forced to use a pistol to protect the company ’s K - 9 and himself , ” she said in an e-mail to Reuters .
The U.S. embassy employs about 1,000 armed Blackwater staff to protect American diplomats in Baghdad .
The firm ’s role became a serious issue in Iraqi- U.S. relations when its guards opened fire on a Baghdad street in September , killing 17 people .
Blackwater says its employees acted lawfully in that incident , which is under investigation .
State Department investigators have made two follow - up visits to the Times compound to investigate the shooting of Hentish , correspondent Alissa Rubin said .
“ They were very solicitous and I thought took the incident very seriously , ” Rubin said .
“ It ’s not a dog that everyone ’s close to in the compound .
“ But it ’s a dog that ’s been around a long time .
It lived its whole life there . ”

UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari has met Myanmar junta supremo Than Shwe today , to try to persuade him to end a crackdown on the biggest democracy protests in 20 years .
The two met in the junta 's remote new capital , Naypyitaw , two foreign diplomats said .
Also present were Than Shwe 's no .
2 , General Maung Aye , no .
3 , General Thura Shwe Mann , and acting Prime Minister Thein Sein , who 's fourth in the hierarchy .
The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity , citing protocol .
Scroll down for more ...
While Gambari was trying to broker peace , the junta 's security forces lightened their presence in Yangon , the country 's main city , which remained quiet after troops and police brutally quelled mass protests last week .
The 9 pm - to - 5 am curfew was scaled back to 10 pm to 4 am .
Kept off the streets , many residents launched a new form of protest Monday evening by switching off their lights and turning off television sets from 8 pm - 8.15 pm during the nightly government newscast .
Dissident groups say up to 200 protesters were killed and 6,000 detained in the crackdown , compared to the regime 's report of 10 deaths .
" Normalcy has now returned in Myanmar , " Foreign Minister Nyan Win told the UN General Assembly in New York , adding that security forces acted with restraint for a month but had to " take action to restore the situation . "
Nyan
Win made no reference to the deaths .
Instead , he blamed foreigners for the violence .
" Recent events make clear that there are elements within and outside the country who wish to derail the ongoing process ( toward democracy ) so that they can take advantage of the chaos that would follow , " Nyan Win said .

" They have become more and more emboldened and have stepped up their campaign to confront the government , " he said .
" The destiny of each and every country can only be determined by its government and people , " he said .
" It can not be imposed from outside . "
Nyan
Win 's comments indicated that the junta would not give up its hardline position and is willing to thumb its nose at international demands to restore democracy and free pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
In Rangoon , despite agreeing to see Gambari , the generals continued posting troops and police across the city and dispatching pro-junta gangs to raid homes in search of monks and dissidents on the run .
" They are going from apartment to apartment , shaking things inside , threatening the people .
You have a climate of terror all over the city , " a Bangkok - based Myanmar expert said .
US charge d'affaires Shari Villarosa said arrests continued unabated .
Scroll down for more ...
" We have heard that arrests are continuing at night , like at two o'clock in the morning .
We 've heard it 's the military .
" I do n't who is doing it , but people are going around in the middle of the night and taking people away , " she said .
" People are terrified .
This government keeps power through fear and intimidation and they are trying to intimidate people to stay off the streets . "
Gambari flew to the former Burma 's new jungle capital to convey international outrage at last week 's crushing of monk - led protests against decades of military rule and deepening poverty .
After three days in the country , during which he met three minister - generals and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who remains under house arrest , Gambari was told he would be able to meet Senior General Than Shwe .
The UN Security Council , which endorsed the former Nigerian foreign minister 's emergency visit , is hoping the mission will kickstart some sort of dialogue between the junta - the latest face of 45 years of military rule - and Suu Kyi .
After Than Shwe , Gambari was expected to have a second meeting with the 62 - year - old Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi , kindling hopes of some sort of " shuttle diplomacy " .
But as attempts at talks continue , it was revealed that thousands of monks detained in Burma 's biggest city will be sent to prisons in the far north .
About 4,000 monks have been rounded up in the past week as the military government has tried to stamp out pro-democracy protests .

The detained monks have been disrobed and shackled , according to sources quoted by BBC Radio 's Burmese service .
The reports follow claims from a former intelligence officer in Burma 's ruling junta that thousands of protesters have been killed and the bodies of
hundreds of executed monks have been dumped in the jungle .
Public anger ignited on August 19 after the government increased fuel prices , then shifted into protests led by Buddhist monks against 45 years of military dictatorship .
Soldiers responded last week by opening fire on unarmed demonstrators .
The demonstrations have now died down .
Burma 's junta leader Than Shwe yesterday stalled a UN envoy , putting off hearing international demands for an end to the crackdown on democracy advocates .
News of the jailings comes after a former intelligence officer for Burma 's ruling junta revealed the true extent of killings to clamp down on protests .
Scroll down for more ...
The most senior official to defect so far , Hla Win , said : " Many more people have been killed in recent days than you 've heard about .
The bodies can be counted in several thousand . "
Mr Win said he fled when he was ordered to take part in a massacre of holy men .
His defection will raise a faint hope among tens of thousands of Burmese who have fled to villages along the Thai border .
They will feel others in the army may follow him and turn on their ageing leaders , Senior General Than Shwe and his deputy , Vice Senior General Maung Aye .

( Updates arrests , adds detail )
PANAMA CITY , Feb 15 ( Reuters ) - Nearly 300 protesters were arrested in Panama on Friday as construction workers clashed with police for the third day running over the shooting death of a fellow worker earlier this week .
A dozen police were injured in Friday 's protest , which kept much of the capital paralyzed , with piles of tires burning on busy roads and highways across the city .
Police reported 286 arrests , bringing the number of people detained since Tuesday to around 780 , police said .
Protesters also threw stones at riot police in the affluent Paitilla area of the city , home to many of Panama 's glass - covered skyscrapers , local television images showed .
It was the latest in a series of clashes since the fatal shooting of a construction worker from the SUNTRACS union during a demonstration on Tuesday over safety conditions .
A construction boom has boosted the country 's economy and created a shimmering skyline in Panama City , but union members have been protesting at they say are lax safety standards at the city 's many building sites .
SUNTRACS leaders accuse the police of killing Airomi Smith , a union leader , during Tuesday 's confrontation as part of an orchestrated campaign .
The government says it will investigate .
Speaking to RPC TV on Friday , Panama City Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro called for calm and for the union to return to the negotiating table .
Hundreds of workers marched to the presidential palace late on Thursday to present a series of demands to the government .
They called for new laws governing building - site safety and the resignation of the minister of justice and the head of the national police force .
( Reporting by Andrew Beatty )
The prisoner , described by his lawyer as an Algerian held for six years , required several stitches and spent a week under psychiatric observation .
US officials characterised the incident as an act of " self - harm " rather than a suicide attempt .
There are just over 300 prisoners still being held in the base in Cuba .
Detention ruling
The latest incident reportedly took place last month in a shower .
US Navy Cmdr Andrew Haynes said there was " an impressive effusion of blood " but the prisoner was treated by guards and taken to the prison clinic .
Officials would give no details of the man but lawyer Zachary Katznelson said the inmate had been held without charge for nearly six years .
Cmdr Haynes said " self - harm " incidents were a tactic to discredit US forces .
There have been four suicides at the camp .
Two Saudis and a Yemeni prisoner were found hanged in June last year .
This May another Saudi was found not breathing in his cell and attempts to revive him failed .
Co-ordinated suicide attempts last May involving hoarded medicine led to tighter rules on the dispensation of pills .
On Wednesday the US Supreme Court is to hold a hearing on whether the inmates at Guantanamo Bay have the right to contest their detention in US civilian courts .
The Washington Post has a detailed article this morning about the government ’s efforts to steal private property to build a fence along the Mexican border :
EL CALABOZ , Tex . —
In the 240 years since the Spanish Crown granted Eloisa Tamez ’s colonial ancestors title to this flat , grassy expanse along the Rio Grande ’s northern bank , her family has steadily lost its holdings to the Mexican War of Independence , the U.S. annexation of Texas and the Great Depression .
Now Tamez faces what could prove the final blow :
The Department of Homeland Security has proposed building a section of the U.S - Mexico border fence mandated by Congress directly through the last three acres of the family ’s original 12,000 - acre tract .
But the 72 - year - old nursing professor has a message for any government officials who expect her to leave quietly .
“ I ’m not going down without a fight , ” Tamez said , her dark eyes narrowing as she gazed beyond her back yard toward a field where she used to pick tomatoes as a child .
“ My father , my grandfather and my great - grandfather farmed this land .
This is the land that gave me my life and my spirit .
. . .
I will fight this all the way . ”
And Tamez is n’t the only one who stands to have her property stolen :
Over the past several weeks , U.S. attorneys acting on behalf of the Homeland Security Department have been filing lawsuits against the holdouts .
Already , federal district judges have ordered one landowner in California , 11 in Arizona and 11 in Texas — including the small city of Eagle Pass — to temporarily surrender their properties .
The mayor of Eagle Pass , which is located about 100 miles southwest of San Antonio and stands to lose 233 acres of city - owned land , said the city is planning to appeal .
Suits are also pending against 14 landowners in California and 44 in South Texas , including Tamez .
News of the lawsuits has sent a chill through the chain of tiny centuries - old South Texas settlements that dot the Rio Grande like beads on a necklace .
Like Tamez , many residents of these hamlets are descendants of the Spanish settlers who colonized the region in the late 1700s .
But significant numbers of them are now impoverished , and even those who have become middle - class professionals , such as Tamez , lack deep pockets for a legal battle .
But here ’s the particularly galling part , in many cases the border fence is n’t even being built on the border :
According to preliminary maps , large stretches of the proposed fence would be located more than a mile inland from the river , cutting off substantial swaths of land .
In other words , the fence would be cutting people off from several square miles of property that actually lies within the United States to begin with .
Though I find the idea of a border fence in the middle of the desert to be of dubious value , there are , as the article points out , other solutions .
Vehicle barriers have been used in parts of Arizona .
In other places , the levees along the Rio Grande are being built as high as 18 feet — an unscalable length — and border patrol reconnaissance is being increased .
In other words , there are ways to secure the border that do n’t involve outright property theft .
Here ’s hoping the Feds do n’t get away with it .
Sabia Rani was subjected to sustained abuse
Sabia Rani , 19 , was killed by Shazad Khan .
He was jailed for life for her murder in January 2007 .
A jury at Leeds Crown Court heard Ms Rani suffered serious tissue damage after being beaten over several weeks .
Four of Khan 's relatives , including his mother , were found guilty of allowing the death of a vulnerable adult .
It is the first such case in West Yorkshire .
The relatives are Khan 's mother Phullan Bibi , 52 , two of his sisters , Uzma Khan , 23 , and Nazia Naureen , 28 , and her husband Majid Hussain , also 28 .
The family all lived in the same house as the couple in Oakwood Grange , Roundhay .
' Evil spirits '
As the verdicts were delivered , the sisters started wailing and hugged each other before screaming : " Not guilty !
Not guilty ! "
The jury of five men and seven women heard Ms Rani had been in severe pain and very ill in the weeks before her death in May 2006 .
Prosecutor Simon Myerson QC said the defendants blamed her injuries on evil spirits and curses .
Khan was jailed for a minimum of 15 years
Ms Rani had been brought up in rural Pakistan and did not speak English .
She came to England five months before she died and was not allowed out of the house without a member of her husband 's family .
After her death , pathologist Christopher Milroy described her injuries as being similar to those suffered by someone in a serious road accident .
Mr Myerson told the jury each defendant must have known Ms Rani was in pain and that Khan must have been the cause of this pain .
Warning to others
Judge James Stewart QC will decide later when to sentence the four defendants .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) said the defendants were the first in West Yorkshire to be convicted of allowing the death of a vulnerable adult and among the first in the country .
Malcolm Taylor , of CPS West Yorkshire 's Complex Casework Unit , said : " Sabia Rani was the victim of horrific violence at the hands of her husband whilst her family , as the jury found , chose to do nothing to help her .
" The message must be that if families or other people with a duty to look after those who need protection deliberately choose not to do so , their neglect will not be ignored by the law enforcement agencies , and prosecution will follow . "
Det Supt Steve Fear said : " Sabia came to this country to join her husband and his family .
As a young woman in a new country , Sabia should have had the support of the people that have today been convicted .
" As the evidence has shown , the people Sabia should have been able to depend on knew her husband was inflicting continuous pain on her . "
Dark Ages Redux ?
Dr. Judith A. Klinghoffer is a senior research associate in the department of Political Science at Rutgers University , Camden .
She was a senior Fulbright fellow in Denmark and is the co-author of International Citizens ' Tribunals : Mobilizing Public Opinion to Advance Human Rights and the author of Vietnam , Jews and the Middle East : Unintended Consequences .
She runs the HNN blog , Deja vu .
It would be , oh , so comforting to assume that civilization is destined to march on regardless of the best efforts of its opponents .
I watch Islamist anti-democratic , anti-freedom forces threaten novelists like Salman Rushdie , Danish Cartoonists and even the Pope .
I recognize the strategic manner in which Muslim states help intimidate “ infidels ” and their governments .
I am alarmed by the appeasement - dominated responses of the intellectual elites , the free media , democratic governments and international organizations .
Still , it all seems so passé .
It seems much more reasonable to heed Bill Kristol ’s advice to stop agonizing and be happy for ultimately civilizations prevail .
Have n't they so far ?
No .
Not in cases in which they were defeated militarily .
History is written not only by the winners but also by surviving civilizations .
A lost civilization hardly leaves any traces .
It is usually followed by a Dark Age .
Consider the drastic consequences of the end of the Bronze period in the Eastern Mediterranean also known as the Greek Dark Ages .
Recent scholarship attributes it to the military defeat of “ high tech chariot ” armies by “ low tech ” barbarian foot soldiers of uncertain origin .
Egypt alone escaped the devastation though it also suffered decline .
That Dark Age lasted 400 years and included the loss of written language .
Consequently , the era has no history , only archeology :
The great palaces and cities of the Mycenaean were destroyed or abandoned .
The Hittite civilization collapsed .
Cities from Troy to Gaza were destroyed .
The Greek language largely ceased to be written .
. . .
The Greeks of the Dark Age lived in fewer and smaller settlements , suggesting famine and depopulation , and foreign goods have not been found at archaeological sites , suggesting minimal international trade .
The Roman Civilizations similarly ended with a barbarian conquest ushering in the Dark Age with which we are most familiar .
It , too , lasted hundreds of years and persisted in some parts of Europe for longer than generally assumed .
And yet , as Edward Deering Mansfield ( writing under the pseudonym “ A Veteran Observer ” ) noted in a New York Times article on July 3 , 1863 , to ask " Shall the Dark Ages Return ? " as he himself did , seemed audacious :
What an audacity !
Ask wonderful Europe , in this wonderful age of wonderful things , whether it may not return to the Dark Ages ?
Ask an American , in this best , greatest and most glorious country which ever floated on the tide of time , whether it may not go back to the Dark Ages ?
The very question startles us with its audacity .
Still , should it have then , or now ?
Not if we understand that a Dark Age does not mean a return “ to the days of cowled priest , belted knights and feudal barons . ”
Instead , it means a return to an era when people “ were straitened by the limitation of thought ” ; when “ the thought and feelings of men worked in the same groove , and everything outside was ignored . ”
The groove to which he refers was set by the Catholic church whose claims to universal superiority were backed by the state .
Hence , the Dark Ages were not all dark but the light was constricted .
Consequently , Mansfield points out , “ the Latin Church , the Latin law and scholastics were well enough , to be believed and confided – while outside of them was a wilderness of heresy and barbarism . ”
Think inquisition then ; Communists , Fascist and Islamist ideological / religious police yesterday and today .
Dark
Ages do not end abruptly or peacefully .
Thought police periodically expand and contract but once entrenched may take decades , indeed , centuries to eradicate .
Military victory often precedes their demise .
The powers that be in Italy or Spain ( which had wide ranging colonies ) did not decide that the Inquisition has outlived its usefulness .
It was Napoleon ’s soldiers who finally opened its Spanish prisons .
A look at Goya ’s drawings or a glance at the testimony of Colonel Lehmanowsky should convince doubters that the dreaded institution had not become a kinder , gentler one by 1809 :
These cells were places of solitary confinement , where the wretched objects of Inquisitorial hate were confined year after year , till death released them from their sufferings , and there their bodies remained until they were completely decayed , and their rooms had become fit for others to occupy .
Flues or tubes , extending to the open air , carried off the effluvia .
In these cells we found the remains of those who paid the debt of nature : some of them had been dead apparently but a short time , while of others nothing remained but their bones , still chained to the floor of the dungeon .
. . .
In other cells we found living sufferers , of both sexes and of every age , from three score years down to fourteen or fifteen years , all naked as when born into the world , and all in chains !
Here were old men and aged women who had been shut up for many years .
Here , too , were the middle aged and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old ! "
The Colonel goes on to describe the liberation :
In the meantime it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the Inquisition were broken open , and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot .
And , oh , what a meeting was there - it was like a resurrection !
About a hundred , who had been buried for many years , were now restored to life .
There were fathers who had found their long - lost daughters , wives were restored to their husbands , sisters to their brothers , and parents to their children ; and there was some who could recognize no friend among the multitude .
The scene was such as no tongue can describe .
If any of this sounds familiar .
It should .
The scene is recreated in Milos Forman ’s movie , Goya ’s Ghost .
Apparently , Forman was thinking about the Prague spring which like the Spanish one was followed by another “ winter . ”
The only difference was that the inquisitors returned to Prague with the help of Soviet tanks and to Madrid with the help of British guns .
They also returned to Italy where as late as 1858 , Italian police kidnapped a Jewish six year old on the order of the grand inquisitor .
Oh , yes , his parents like other Jews lived in a Ghetto .
The defeat of Napoleon and the French revolution also meant that Jews who were let out of the Ghettoes by Napoleon were returned to them by the “ Holy Alliance . ”
They were freed by the new unified Italian army in 1870 though returned to it and " liquidated " by the Fascists and Nazis .
One can only speculate of the effect these centuries of living under thought police had on Catholic populations around the world .
The Museum of the Inquisition Lima is the most popular in Peru .
History books may not dwell on the subject but Western thinkers living in the middle of the 19th century knew all too well the sorry state of freedom in Europe and , hence understood just how important the survival of real democracy in America was .
And real democracy cannot have slavery of any kind as a basis of its institutions .
Mansfield writes :
In America we have no philosophy but the philosophy of politics ; but in that , we are superior to all the world ; and it is that which keeps the American mind alive .
But we are going back in time .
This rebellion is a consequence of the reaction against freedom .
If it were confined to the mere masters of Negroes , and to an attempt to secure them where they are , it would not be unnatural , nor would it necessarily react upon free thought in the North .
But this is not the fact .
It is an attempt to make Slavery ( whether of white of black ) the foundation of political institutions .
It is , therefore , a direct and positive reaction against the principles of the American Revolution .
Nor is it confined to Slave States .
Every man in the Free States , of any intelligence , who engages in the peace party and sympathizes with Southern institutions , is a reactionist against American institutions .
It is a reaction against real Democracy .
The Roman Emperors were formally elected as Roman Consuls , keeping the name of the old Roman magistracy , when the thing itself had ceased to exist and only Emperors ruled .
Such is the exact fact with those who , under the name of Democracy , are seeking the overthrow of Democracy by the overthrow of Freedom .
This is the undisguised fact .
Do you wonder , then , that men ask :
Are we to have a return of the dark Ages ?
No . I am not surprised .
The Dark Age did not return because Abraham Lincoln did not flinch .
He won the ideological battle in the only way it can often be won , militarily .
Since then astute observers have asked the question when they contemplated Communist and Fascist victories and they may as well be asking the question now .
For liberty , hence , civilization is currently under a three prong attack .
One prong consists of Islamist barbarians , Al Qaeda types , who , like barbarians from time immemorial , excel in exploiting the military and institutional weakness of civilized democracies .
The second prong consists of Fascist / Communist / Islamist tyrannies such as China , North Korea or Iran who feel threatened by the success of democracies .
They enjoy sitting back , watching the barbarians soften up the democracies despite knowing that they are bound to be the barbarians ' next victims .
The third prong consists of transnational elites who assume that the Islamist barbarians do not pose a real threat .
Their goal is to bring about a world run by international institutions not directly accountable to the “ uninformed masses . ”
Indeed , as they consider powerful civilized democracies , most especially the US , to be their most formidable opponent , these transnational elites do not shy from cooperating with Islamists and tyrannies by legitimizing their demands that free speech , i.e. , thought be circumscribed .
It should not be forgotten that previous dark ages were limited geographically , a future one may not be .
In the past , enlightenment in one part of the world helped end a dark ages in another .
But in the age of globalization this may prove much more difficult .
Hence , the stakes today are higher than they have ever been .
So , following Mansfield one may ask , shall we go backwards ?
Shall free institutions fall ?
Shall the world and its hopes fall with us ?
In other words , will the Dark ages return ?
In 2004 , I would have answered the question similarly to the way Dean Acheson answered it in 1951 :
It seems to me ... that we are better off than we were a year ago . . .
But there are no grounds for complacency . . .
The outcome in the contest between a better future and a return to the Dark Ages is still undetermined .
Unfortunately , in 2007 we are worse off than we were three years ago .
I still hold on to the belief that the American people love liberty too much to give it up and , as they have done before , they will snatch victory from the jaws of current defeats .
So , why can't I be happy ?
Because with each and every passing day the price for defeating the forces of darkness is getting higher and higher and ultimate victory less and less certain .

It is totally within the realm of the expected , and the " deja vu " , for all those that are familiar with Klinghoffer , and what she stands for , that her essay , seemingly , on the dark ages shall , from its very first sentences , define the prime enemy , the motive force towards the Dark Ages as the :
" .... Islamist anti-democratic , anti-freedom forces "
whose major effort towards this retrogression is that they :
" ... threaten novelists like Salman Rushdie , Danish Cartoonists and even the Pope . "
In an era that has witnessed Mai Lai massacre , the ferocious , and ongoing , battle of the African American to achieve equality after centuries of slavery , Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , the glorification of the Zionist neo colonialist onslaught on Palestine and the wanton aggression , and willful , conscious destruction , of Iraq starting with the intentional dismantlement of the Iraqi state ...
In such an era threatening a novelist , a cartoonist and responding to an openly hostile principal of a major Christian Church hell bent on reviving a major inter religious conflict seem to be , by any objective criterion , the mild symptoms of a revivalist malaise when contrasted with Some of the doings of an other country .. the presumed leader of the “ free world ” and the major advocate of western “ democracy ” !
BUT , patently , the whole and sole objective of Professor Klinghoffer is the demonization of Islam , the nemesis of her aggressive , racist and neocolonialist Zionist doctrine and movement and the deepening and the further intensification of the eagerly sought after , by Klinghoffer & Co , alienation between the Moslem World and the West , starting with the USA !
A genuine , honest , objective and less self / doctrine serving effort into the feared retrogression into the Dark Ages would have found other starting points .
But it is Klinghoffer and that would have been asking for the impossible .
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
It is more than “ birds of a feather … ” it is unity in complicity that brings Aaron Green to cheer on the dubious , and racially imbued , scholarship of the unabashed propagandist of the racist / neocolonialist Zionist cause ; Professor Klinghoffer !
What we have here are two eminent advocates of the doctrine which springs from a deep seated sense of racial / racist exclusiveness , and prerogatives , the implementation of which led to the “ dislocate , dispossess , subjugate , an indigenous population , and replace with , racially screened and filtered , colons ” nation building model in the twentieth century , AD .
Both these proponents seriously pretend to be concerned about the threat of mankind ’s retrogression into the Dark Ages without , first , honestly appraising what they stand for and ceaselessly warmly applaud .
Their failure to note that their ideal ; the Zionist / Jewish racial / racist colonization of Palestine and their cherished model for nation building that led to the establishment of the super racist state of Israel are , by any objective standard , the most telling portents of such a retrogression tells us a great deal about their intellectual honesty and the selfless “ objectivity ” of their scholarship !
Zionism has not only blinded its adherents (? ) to the crimes committed by its implementation but has equally managed to conceal its innate racist / retrogressive nature , the truly telling portent of such a retrogression into the Dark Ages , to the extent that embolden both Klinghoffer and Green to shamelessly assert their contrived concern to an unknowing , but generally well meaning , Western audience .
Herein lays the tragic comedy of the whole situation !
omar ibrahim baker - 10/19/2007
What Green has to say boils down to :
” You ( Arabs / Moslems ) did worst " !
Which , coming from Green and his ilk , is only to be expected and , as such , does not bother me in least ( what else to expect from Irgun / Stern / Likudnik " scholarship " and morality ? ) .
The interesting point here though is that he neither denies nor apologizes for the Zionist / Israeli model , that he implicitly concedes , of nation building of :
DISLOCATE , DISPOSSESS , SUBJUGATE and SUPPLANT an indigenous , native population ( who has dwell ed in Palestine for a minimum of 14 centuries ) and replace by an amalgam of , his racially screened and selected coreligionists … in the 20th century AD
That these supplanting usurping colons have the " divinely promised right / prerogative / privilege " , according to Green &ilk , to dwell , uninvited and unwelcome , in others ' homes , till others ' lands and farmlands etc and establish their own nation / state while denying the native population the right to return to their homes and regain their properties ...
That all that does not seem to bother Green ( and Klinghoffer ) who feigns concern about human progress , nor is perceived and acknowledged by him as the gravest portent of human retrogression into the DARK AGES is as much an indication of his " intellectual honesty " , moral / ethical standards as it is of the genuinety of his concern .
Arnold Shcherban - 7/20/2007
It used to be , agreed , but hardly anymore .
A system is only a tyranny if the majority of a native populus and of the political observers AMONG THEM consider it a tyranny , not ' cause the ideologues with different cultural and historical heritage ( or their proxies ) define it as one .
Further , if it is deserved ( based on a statistical evidence ) to be called a tyranny along with North Korea and Iran , then any objective observer has to throw into the same list such dear US allies , as Turkey , Pakistan , Egypt , Indonesia , Philipinnes , US satellite governments in Kabul , and Bahgdad , and many others .
Chinese people experience now much more economic and social freedoms than ever in their long history .
These acquired freedoms are fruits
of their own struggles and historico - cultural heritage and ever evolving economic and technological
climate of the world at large .
If the great majority of China 's population considered their system a tyranny they would get rid of it years ago ( as it happenned recently in the former USSR and other , so - called , " socialist " countries ) , since the Army and security apparatus consists of the same people ( not taken from Mars ) , as well .
The Chinese system has a long way to go towards truly democratic society , if it ever reaches that state , and perhaps it looks quite tyrannic from the Western point of view , but any one who writes on the issues of tyranny and democracy , should remember the elementary truth / fact that the views on those issues differs even from nation to nation , not speaking of race to race .
Let Chinese populus decide what 's good for them .
Arnold Shcherban - 7/16/2007
What real , not corporate - bribed , Western civilization and general populace would say :
Oh , Holy Spirit !
Protect me from such friends as Ms .
Klinghoffer and Mr. Green ; Muslim and all other enemies I 'm quite capable to easily manage myself .
Andrew D. Todd - 7/13/2007
One point to be kept in mind is that the Eurasian barbarians had the use of millions of square miles of grasslands and forests .
In short , they had very considerable ecological - economic power .
When they did not invade the civilized lands , they traded with them instead .
Here is an old reading note about a book dealing with the cross - frontier trade at one place and time , China during the Ming Dynasty .
-----------------------------------------
Henry Serruys , Trade Relations : The Horse Fairs , ( 1400 - 1600 ) , Sino - Mongol Relations During the Ming , Melanges Chinois et Buddiques , XVII , Institute Belge Des Hautes Etudes Chinoises , Brussels , 1975
The Sino -Mongol trade was highly political in the sense that one key , player , the Chinese government viewed it only as a political enterprise .
The Ming officials viewed trade as a means of buying off the threat of border raids by the Mongols .
Conversely , cutting off of the trade could be a punishment for raids .
On the other hand , the failure of the Chinese government to permit trade could be a cause of raids , as the nomads did need certain manufactures , which they had to get one way or another .
On at least one occasion , the nomads made war as a means of forcing open the trade , and compelling the Chinese to set up a market .
The trade was a mixture of official trade , consisting of the purchase of horses for the Chinese army , and unofficial trade conducted by merchants .
In the original form the trade took the form of tribute missions .
The representatives of a nomad ruler would bring a gift of horses to the capital .
They would then be given a reciprocal gift , consisting of such things as silk clothing for their master .
That was the theory , according to the Chinese .
But in practice , things were somewhat different .
The ambassador 's entourage would contain a number of frankly professional merchants , and would take its time traveling to and from the capital .
On the inbound trip , they would trade many of their goods to ordinary Chinese .
Once at the capital , they would trade with merchants , who were supposed to be brought into the envoys ' lodging to trade , a rule more honored in the breach that in the observance .
Finally , on the outbound leg of their journey , they might trade , to the Chinese , some of the gifts they had been given by the emperor .
Under the circumstances , the gifts , such as silk clothing , might beconsidered as a form of money .
It will be seen that the tribute was really government to government trade , with a side operation going on that was not even governmental .
Diplomacy was a mere pretext for trade , and , as the trade apparently grew exponentially due to comparative advantage , it was an increasingly flimsy pretext .
Chinese officialdom was deeply concerned at the numbers of barbarian traders flowing through large sections of the empire .
There was a pervasive distrust of the Mongols , who were feared to be spies , or worse .
Officials wanted to isolate the Mongols , to prevent any unnecessary contact between them and Chinese .
The horse fairs were a means of localizing trade at a few points on the frontier where it could be controlled .
Most of the traders would stop at the fair site , where the Chinese government would buy horses , and only a handful of genuine envoys would go on to the capital .
This desire to isolate barbarians from Chinese probably accounts for why the government discouraged proposals for continuous ( weekly ar monthly ) , rather than annual markets .
Continuous markets had been proposed as a means of limiting the disorder attendant on an annual market .
One infers that the government found a risk of riot more acceptable than a situation in which contact with barbarians merged into daily life .
A thousand barbarians stay in the market ground .
One barbarian gets invited into someone 's house to incalculable ends .
There is nothing to stop his Chinese host selling him anything : weapons , even military intelligence .
Officials tended to belittle the desire of ordinary Chinese to trade .
This is reflected in the items traded .
The Chinese officials insisted on trading in horses , which meant dealing with the mongol upper classes and were reluctant to conduct the trade along lines suited to the lower classes , which would have meant china buying sheep , goats , etc , in exchange for grain and beans .
There was a prohibition on selling metals , farming implements , war materiel etc to the nomads , but it is probable that there was widespread evasion .
Other items traded included skins of various kinds on the Mongol side , cloth , finished leather , and similar manufactures on the Chinese side .
It seems that the price of mongol horses tended to be much lower than that of Chinese horses .
Given that it was the Mongols who took the initiative in trade , and had recourse to violence to keep the trade flowing , this suggests that the price of horses was comparative advantage , rather than net payment either way .
The Mongols would hardly have invaded china for the privilege of being taxed .
Nancy REYES - 7/13/2007
The cycles of civilization and fall are something for philosophers to discuss , but you need to remember that many ancient empires with high civilizations were static tyrannies as to thought , whether it be China or Egypt .
The inquisition was a lot less evil to the freedom of thought than the Chinese emperor killing all intellectuals , Stalin 's purges or the jailing of Chinese intellectuals in the " thousand flowers " purges .
Second ,
By concentrating on the Latin church , which was responsible for keeping Roman wisdom alive when civilization fell , you are mistaking the effect with the cause .
Thought was not constricted by the church , but by poverty .
People used up all their energy just staying alive .
The monasteries , by keeping the classics alive , by schools , and by sponsoring art , actually kept civilization alive .
When things got rich enough , the dogmatic stuff was discarded , but the ideas were allowed to bloom .
Three : malaria and Justinian 's plague have as much to do with the depopulation of Europe and fall of Rome as anything else .
Four :
The barbarian migration , like today 's Islamic immigrants , wanted to live comfortably .
Islamofascism is not compatible with peace , and will fall just like athiestic communism , and probably be replaced by a more benign version within a hundred years .
Andrew D. Todd - 7/11/2007
Well , the view of the classicists seems to be that Robert Drews is rather forcing his evidence .
http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1994/94.01.09.html
Occam's Razor , as applied to prehistory or " eo-history " is that one should not postulate economic , technological , or social revolutions which do not turn up in unequivocal form later on .
Now , the big long - term military change in the middle east as a whole at the general time was the emergence of the horse archer .
That is , train your horse to the point that he relates to you like a dog , ride on his back , use your knees to tell him where you want to go , and let him worry about the details of getting there .
That leaves your hands free to handle a bow and arrow .
From an archer 's point of view , fifty yards or so is point - blank range ( the Asiatic composite bow can reach out to five hundred yards in high trajectory ) .
By 500 BC , Persian horse archers were very definitely in evidence .
The classic horse archer tactic was to sort of swirl around the edges of enemy formations , popping in arrows .
When horse archers were systematically organized , the way the Mongols did , they could carry out deep envelopments , and annihilate whole armies .
I think what Robert Drews is trying to do is to anachronistically apply the Macedonian " peltast revolution " of the fourth century BC to the Iron Age .
By the fourth century , Greek warfare was conducted by " hoplites , " what one might call " foot - knights , " heavily armored men charging on foot in neat ranks with long spears , but no archery .
A peltast was a kind of light infantryman , with much the same armament as a Roman legionary , who could move inside the hoplite 's turning circle , and get inside his defenses .
In the first place , this is dubious as applied to the Iron Age because there is no very credible evidence that peltasts could have defeated mobile archers .
A mobile archer simply backs off to a safe distance and pops in arrows .
In the hands of an expert , a composite bow is approximately as good a weapon as a Winchester 45 - 70 rifle .
Certainly , the Roman performance in the Parthian Wars was broadly mediocre .
To the extent that the Romans succeeded in Gaul and Germany , they did so mostly by a kind of evolution of siege warfare , building large numbers of forts as they moved , so that it was very difficult for an enemy to impose a decisive battle on open ground .
The legions won their battles with the shovel , not the sword .
Another point is that the population density and ecological conditions of Classic Greece were obviously rather different from those of Iron - Age Greece .
Elliott Aron Green - 7/11/2007 Addendum :
I wrote above that the dhimma system practiced in Arab / Muslim states " was based . . . more on religion than on biological race . "
I did not exclude the existence of color and biological race prejudice in the Arab / Muslim domains .
Bernard Lewis has covered this area with two books , Race and Color in Islam [ NY 1971 ; also published in French ] and Race and Slavery in the Middle East [ New York 1990 ] .
Oppression of non-Muslim peoples in Arab lands continues , particularly Christian Copts in " moderate " Egypt and Assyrians in Iraq .
Judeophobia in Arab lands today is fanatic , blatant , extreme .
It pervades mosque preaching , school instruction , TV , radio , newspapers , etc. Hitler 's Mein Kampf and the forgery - cum - plagiarism called The Protocols of the Elders of Zion are perennial best - sellers in Arab countries .
At the same , traditional Muslim Judeophobia is commonplace .
The Hamas charter [ Norway , heir to the Quislings , is already fawning over Hamas ] contains the old Muslim fable that at Judgement Day the Muslims will fight the Jews .
Jews will hide behind rocks and trees .
The rocks and trees will cry out : O Muslim , a Jew is hiding behind me .
Come kill him [ Hamas charter , Article 7 ] .
It is fitting to point out that the Arab nationalist movement collaborated with the frankly racist Nazis [ inc.
Anwar Sadat ] and that the chief leader of the Palestinian Arabs , Haj Amin el - Husseini , collaborated in the Holocaust , working to have Jewish children murdered in Poland , inter alia .
Elliott Aron Green - 7/11/2007 Shukrun , ` Umar .
Ana b'hebik kaman .
What ` Umar should start doing is to acknowledge that traditional Arab / Muslim society has been very similar to the South African apartheid society , although group oppression was based , to be sure , more on religion than on biological race .
Jews , Christian nations , and other subject peoples in Arab / Muslim domains lived under a regime of legislated oppression , pecuniary exploitation , humiliation , social inferiority and inequality [ for example , the lesser weight of a dhimmi's testimony in court ] , prohibitions , etc. Bat Ye'or , Norman Stillman , Andrew Bostom , and other scholars have assembled documents on the oppression of dhimmis in the Arab - Muslim state throughout the ages .
Perhaps ` Umar could stop projecting the oppression [ call it " racism " if you like ] practiced by Arab - Muslim societies onto Israel for long enough to read some of Bat Ye'or , Stillman , and Bostom 's books .
By the way , Moshe Gil and Jacob Barna'i , two Israeli historians , have uncovered documents [ from the Cairo Geniza , in Gil 's case ] that illustrate pecuniary exploitation of Jews going beyond the jizya & kharaj prescribed by Muslim law .
The documents studied by Gil and Barna 'i illustrate this extra-legal [ that is , beyond shari`ah ] exploitation of Jews precisely in Jerusalem by Arab - Muslim officials for periods both before and after the Crusades .
Judith Apter Klinghoffer - 7/10/2007
A few weeks ago I watched a program on the subject on on of the History channels but I cannot find it .
I did add a link to a recent book by Robert Drews .
Andrew D. Todd - 7/10/2007 How Much of a Step Backwards Was The Volkswanderung ?
Well , here 's a doubtless uninformed speculation from a nonmedievalist .
During the Volkswanderung , the church seems to have re-established itself in most areas within a hundred years or less , mostly because it had been achieving the voluntary conversion of barbarians at a rate greater than the barbarians could invade .
That worked out to someone like St. Patrick going out and talking to the barbarians .
I was looking through an encyclopedia of the saints , trying to find missionaries who had gotten eaten during the Volkswanderung period , but they seem to be far and few between , far fewer than the martyrs of the secret church period in the first to third centuries .
For what it is worth , historians of the organization of the Roman Army in the imperial period are forced to rely heavily on archaeological evidence , for want of anything better .
For practical purposes , the latter Roman Army seems to have been a nearly illiterate institution .
I think there is one surviving chit which a recruiting sergeant got for delivering a draft of men , and a hopelessly theoretical manual written by the armchair general Vegetius at the time when the Western Roman Empire was collapsing .
Take a look at Leslie Alcock 's _ Arthur 's Britain : History and Archeology , AD 367-634_ ( 1971 ) .
A couple of things come across .
First is the extremely fragmentary and conjectural character of the evidence .
The second is the extremely meager character of Roman civilization as it existed north of the Alps .
These are related .
It is not possible to say with any confidence whether a place - name is Saxon or not if the place was too small to figure in the Antonine Itiniary .
There is apparently no surviving Roman - British document comparable to the Domesday book , which the historian could use as a base for determining what happened .
What this would indicate , of course , is that the Roman administration never succeeded in taxing land or income per se ( too many chances to ambush tax gatherers ) , but was forced to collect taxes in customs houses at ports , bridges , markets , etc .
That is a well - known phenomena in the third world today .
The consequence , of course , is that no one buys anything which he can make at home , and trade is effectively confined to a narrow range of luxury goods .
Most of what you would probably recognize as Roman Civilization was only found in the Mediterranean Littoral .
It continued there with no great interruption , at least no more than had resulted from the periodic Roman civil wars .
The Franks and the Goths , and the Vandals and the Lombards and the Burgundians were more or less rapidly assimilated , to the point of losing their German .

Not merely looked down upon Jonathan - sent to the historiographical dustbin , and well before my graduate work in early medieval history in the 1990s .
Literacy ?
Odd that I have so many sources to read .
Law ?
Odd that law codes are one of the most important sources I utilize .
Economic cohesion ?
Odd that there is so much numismatic evidence to utilize .
Social cohesion ?
Is empire really necessary to have that ?
Or do you mean something else here ?
Cheers ,

Elliott Aron Green - 7/10/2007 Bravo , Judith !
Yes , civilization is heading downhill .
Worst of all , it 's being pushed by politicians , sometimes masquerading as " statesmen " & " peacemakers . "
Hence , it 's appropriate to have Omar Bakr here with us .
The Arab - Muslim invasions , that he fondly looks back to , did much to wreck the ancient East and its civilizations , submerging peoples , languages , cultures , religions , etc. Marhaba , ya ` Umar la Habibna !!
When I mentioned civilization being pushed down the stairs , I had in mind the State Dept as well .
Condi Rice is winding herself up for another Middle Eastern " peace mission . "
The yo yo State Dept spokesman , MacCormack , declared that now is just a swell time for making pieces between Israel and those Arabs called " palestinians . "
It seems that Rice & Co. have a tenuous hold on reality , on the conditions really needed for lasting peace .
Condi called Hamas " a resistance movement " just a few weeks ago .
No doubt Hamas is just like the French Maquis , only a little bloodier .
But maybe the fellows and gals at State figure :
What 's a little blood , just as long as it's Jewish .
I would disagree with you , Judith , on only one point : the historicity of the Dark Age of Greece .
Among other difficulties raised by this notion is when and if there was a Trojan War , some assigning that war to before the so - called Dark Age , and others assigning it shortly afterwards .
It seems odd that there was a well documented period followed by one with no documentation , and then another fairly well documented period .
The archeological dating too leaves something to be desired .
Louis N Proyect - 7/9/2007
I would say that given a choice between George W. Bush and Attila the Hun , I 'd go with the Hun .
Jonathan Dresner - 7/9/2007
I know that the term " dark ages " is looked down upon by many medievalists , but there really is something to it : a loss of literacy , a loss of law , a loss of economic and social cohesion .
Human societies do not just advance : the progressive fallacy needs to be abjured .
That said , it 's also worth noting that the old theories about Rome 's fall being due to " cultural aridity " etc , are just that : old theories , supplanted by lots of new evidence and thought about political structures , disease , invasion , trade and religion .
And the old theories about the end of medievalism in Europe are also out of date : the simplistic equation of political violence with reform ( when it's not associated with barbarism ) overstates the historical position of Napoleon considerably .
Andrew D. Todd - 7/9/2007
It is worth looking at Hans Georg Wunderlich , _ The Secret of Crete_ ( Wohin der Stier Europa Trug ) , 1972 ( English translation , 1974 - 75 ) .
Wunderlich , who was professor of geology and paleontology at the University of Stuttgart , analyzed the Minoan ruins from the point of view of a civil engineer , and found that all kinds of things did not make sense in terms of the conventional narrative .
The builders used types of materials which were not suitable for the stated uses .
The fires which were supposed to have destroyed the buildings had not produced the effects on the stones which an actual fire would produce .
And so on and so forth .
Wunderlich pointed out that Sir Arthur Evans had done a lot of " imaginative reconstruction " on the palace of Knossos , to the point that it was very largely a late Victorian artifact .
Wunderlich 's conclusion was that the buildings were not habitations at all , but necropolises , of substantially the same type as those found in Egypt at the time , and that they had simply fallen out of use after Greece had outgrown them , as a child outgrows dolls and similar toys .
As Wunderlich argues , the Greeks began cremating their dead and then telling stories about them ( " let us now praise famous men " ) .
Instead of playing undertaker 's games with the decaying bodies of Heracles or Achilles , they told stories about the things Heracles and Achilles were supposed to have done .
These stories , and the custom of reciting them , became a form of rhetorical education which enabled Greece to break out of a sterile near - eastern death - cult .
Eventually , a " second generation " of authors consolidated the stories into epics .
Someone like Homer , or Geoffrey of Monmouth ( Arthurian literature ) , or Snorri Sturluson ( Icelandic Sagas and Norse Mythology ) could not produce a finished work unless he had grown up in an oral culture resonating with a couple of hundred years worth of raw tales , in much the same way that it took a hundred years of printing to produce a man like William Shakespeare .
Fahrettin Tahir - 7/9/2007
To all this must be added the dark age for European Moslems which began with the demise of the Ottoman Empire , cost 5 Million European Moslems their lives and continues with events like the genocide against cypriot Moslems in the 1960ies and the Bosnian Moslems in the 1990ies .
The European Union , descendants of the inquisition , today supports the Turkish Islamists , who wand to end European Islam by turning Turkey into a virtual Arab country .
A new study out of Texas State University reports that people with tattoos and body piercings are unpopular at the office .
Folks surveyed said that they would rather not work alongside people with lip rings and tramp stamps -- that would be the tattoo above the lower back that many Hollywood starlets favor .
Even worse , the people with tattoos and body piercings did n't trust their own .
A survey of more than 150 people revealed that even those adorned would think twice before buying business insurance from someone with tattoos and piercings .
FYI : I have a tattoo and I welcome any tattooed freak to try and sell me some business insurance .
This discrimination reminds me of the daft women who wo n't vote for Hillary Clinton solely because she is a woman .
Should n't the inked and pierced support their own ?
Reuters reports more here , including the fact that 30 years ago , only one percent of the population had a tattoo .
In 2006 , 24 % of America had gotten inked .
But the real question is : Would you vote for someone tattooed for President ?

This picture is too gorgeous not to share it .
A new Chandra X - ray telescope image shows a beautiful , dense region of massive stars in the Centaurus constellation .
It almost appears as though someone threw a handful of colored candies out into space .
Known as Westerlund 2 , this star cluster has been a mysterious region of our galaxy , filled with dust and gas that have obscured our vision of what lies inside .
But new X - ray observations with Chandra have revealed some of the hottest , brightest and most massive known stars , and this is now regarded as one of the most interesting star clusters in the Milky Way galaxy .
About 20,000 light years from Earth , Westerlund 2 is a young star cluster with an estimated age of about one or two million years .
An extremely massive double star system called WR20a is visible in the image , the bright yellow point just below and to the right of the cluster ’s center .
This system contains stars with whopping masses of 82 and 83 times that of the Sun .
The dense streams of matter steadily ejected by these two massive stars , called stellar winds , collide with each other and produce large amounts of X - ray emissions .
But alas , no chocolate candies .
This collision is seen at different angles as the stars orbit around each other every 3.7 days .
Several other bright X - ray sources may also show evidence for collisions between winds in massive binary systems .
The Chandra image of Westerlund 2 shows low energy X - rays in red , intermediate energy X - rays in green and high energy X - rays in blue .
This is an area that is incredibly dense with massive stars , and bright with X - rays .
Image is 8.4 arc minutes across and was taken by the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer , which can study temperature variations from x-ray sources .

BANJA LUKA , Bosnia , Feb 22 ( Reuters ) - Bosnian Serb lawmakers have threatened to hold a referendum on secession from Bosnia if a majority of U.N. member states and the European Union recognise Kosovo 's independence .
The parliament of the Serb Republic adopted a resolution late on Thursday branding Kosovo 's declaration of independence an illegal act that violated Serbia 's territorial integrity .
It warned that Kosovo 's recognition by major powers was setting a new international precedent .
" The People 's Assembly of Republika Srpska therefore considers that it has the right to determine its stance about its state and legal status through a direct vote by a referendum , " it said in the resolution .
Bosnia is made up of the Serb Republic and the Muslim - Croat federation , a dual - entity state created by the Dayton accords that ended the 1992 - 95 war among Bosnian Serbs , Croats and Muslims .
Bosnian Serbs want to keep a high degree of autonomy and have closer links with Serbia .
Muslims and Croats want a stronger state able to lead the country towards European Union membership .
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Milorad Dodik told parliament there was no rush to break up the country .
" We are not adventurers and we do not plan to broach a decision about independence now , " he said .
" The referendum can be used only once , if we decide and when we decide it .
It is no game . "
But U.S. ambassador Charles English said there was no way any region could secede from the country whose " structures of self - determination " were defined by the Dayton accords .
" Talk about sovereignty of one entity is talk about something that does not exist .
It is an irresponsible and unconstitutional concept , " English told reporters in Sarajevo .
The resolution , adopted solely by the Serb MPs , warned that unless Bosnia 's state institutions confirmed the Serb Republic 's autonomy , as laid out in the 1995 Dayton peace accords , the Serb Republic would reconsider its status in the country .
Dodik called on the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to accept the Serb Republic as reality so that they all can live together .
" If there is no response , it will be a clear signal how they see us and we shall have to define a different policy , " he said .
At a Belgrade protest rally against Kosovo 's independence on Thursday , Dodik said : " We live in Bosnia but we look at Serbia . "
The rally turned violent when several hundred protestors stormed the U.S. embassy , setting part of the building on fire .
The U.S. office in the Serb Republic capital Banja Luka was closed following violence on Thursday , when three policemen were seriously wounded trying to prevent protesters from breaking in .
Nearly 30 protesters were detained , most of them minors .

As of this weekend , Yahoo started to filter some of Pirate Bay 's pages .
For some mysterious reason , several pages from the tracker disappeared from Yahoo's index .
Unintentionally or not , a search for " The Pirate Bay " does n't show a link to the homepage of the popular BitTorrent tracker .
Filtering or blocking the Pirate Bay is beginning to become a trend .
Little over a week ago , a Danish court ordered the ISP “ Tele 2 â €³ to block its customers access to The Pirate Bay .
Soon after that the Kuwait government decided to do the same , and now Yahoo is also censoring the Internet .
In response to the news , Pirate Bay co-founder Brokep told TorrentFreak : “ It ’s dangerous to trust a company like Yahoo ! when they filter the searches .
It ’s a new China , but this time Yahoo is the dictator .
Yahoo should let the governments decide , not themselves .
It ’s dangerous when companies take the law into their own hands . ”
It seems like The Pirate Bay is the only BitTorrent site that is filtered at the moment .
Searches for Mininova and Isohunt are still working fine , Yahoo !
even suggests you should try “ mininova torrents ” , “ mininova downloads ” and “ mininova today downloads ” , and more related searches .
It is not clear why Yahoo decided to filter The Pirate Bay , but seems unlikely that they did it because the site is often associated with copyright infringement .
Perhaps Yahoo ’s index is just screwed up ?
If we dig a little deeper , it turns out that not all Pirate Bay ’s pages are gone .
Interestingly , Yahoo ! was found guilty of infringing copyright themselves two months ago .
During December last year , Yahoo China ’s music search was confirmed illegal in a Beijing court ruling which stated that under new copyright laws it facilitates mass copyright infringement .
Update : February 21 , Yahoo links to The Pirate Bay again …

The Executive Branch has one power : Executive Power .

The coming financial collapse of the U.S. government :
Fed papers reveal what 's in store for Americans
Until now , that is .
In a remarkable paper posted by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis , and authored by a Boston University teacher named Prof Kotlikoff , it is revealed in blunt , powerful language that the era of borrowing and spending without consequence may soon come to a close .
The paper , entitled , Is the United States Bankrupt ? , may not remain posted for very long once the public gets word of what it actually says .
And what , exactly , does it say ?
For starters , Kotlikoff explains , " Unless the United States moves quickly to fundamentally change and restrain its fiscal behavior , its bankruptcy will become a foregone conclusion . "
The country is bankrupt
Failure to engage in these massive reforms will inevitably result in the financial demise of the United States , Kotlikoff says : " [ W ]e have a country at the end of its resources .
It ’s exhausted , stripped bear , destitute , bereft , wanting in property , and wrecked ( at least in terms of its consumption and borrowing capacity ) in consequence of failure to pay its creditors .
In short , the country is bankrupt and is forced to reorganize its operations by paying its creditors ( the oldsters ) less than they were promised . "
We might possibly be saved , he explains , if the nation engages in massive , radical reform in three areas : 1 ) Eliminating the current income tax system and moving to a national retail sales tax of 33 percent .
2 ) Privatizing social security so that workers own their savings accounts and the federal government can no longer swipe funds from Social Security .
3 ) Launching a national health insurance program that covers everyone and relies on a system of government - issued vouchers that citizens can spend with health insurance companies .
These radical reforms are necessary because the future gap between what the government owes and what it stands to receive in revenues is already monstrously large , and it 's growing by the minute .
This gap , called the Gokhale and Smetters measure , currently stands at an astonishing $ 65.9 trillion .
( Yes , with a " T " . )
As Kotlikoff explains , " This figure is more than five times U.S. GDP and almost twice the size of national wealth .
One way to wrap one ’s head around $ 65.9 trillion is to ask what fiscal adjustments are needed to eliminate this red hole .
The answers are terrifying .
One solution is an immediate and permanent doubling of personal and corporate income taxes .
Another is an immediate and permanent two - thirds cut in Social Security and Medicare benefits .
A third alternative , were it feasible , would be to immediately and permanently cut all federal discretionary spending by 143 percent . "
If you read that last paragraph with any presence of mind , you now begin to understand the magnitude of the fiscal problem facing the United States .
It could be solved , as explained above , by doubling all personal and corporate income taxes .
But then what 's the point in working ?
It could also be solved by slashing promised benefits in Social Security and Medicare .
But what about the inevitable street riots ?
None of these solutions are likely to occur .
And that leaves the Ace up the sleeve .
It 's the Ace that all government eventually play on their way to bankruptcy and collapse , and it's the Ace that the United States will ultimately be forced to play , too : hyperinflation .
The U.S. will have to print more money to escape the financial consequences of its unbridled spending .
Hyperinflation is inevitable
" Given the reluctance of our politicians to raise taxes , cut benefits , or even limit the growth in benefits , the most likely scenario is that the government will start printing money to pay its bills .
This could arise in the context of the Federal Reserve “ being forced ” to buy Treasury bills and bonds to reduce interest rates .
Specifically , once the financial markets begin to understand the depth and extent of the country ’s financial insolvency , they will start worrying about inflation and about being paid back in watered - down dollars .
This concern will lead them to start dumping their holdings of U.S. Treasuries .
In so doing , they ’ll drive up interest rates , which will lead the Fed to print money to buy up those bonds .
The consequence will be more money creation — exactly what the bond traders will have come to fear .
This could lead to spiraling expectations of higher inflation , with the process eventuating in hyperinflation . "
It 's not like it has n't happened before .
Hyperinflation is actually the norm , not the exception , and it's the escape route taken by virtually every country suffering under the burden of payment promises is cannot possibly keep .
Whether we 're talking about Germany after World War I , or the United States over the next few years , hyperinflation is the only option remaining for politicians who refuse to practice fiscal sanity .
No politician ever got elected by promising voters their entitlements would be halted , did they ?
Political popularity is derived from promising voters precisely what the nation cannot afford : Endless entitlements and runaway spending without apparent consequence .
The China factor
But even the Chinese -- known for their tolerance of hard times and manual labor -- may eventually tire of lending money to a posh , arrogant Western nation that has all but abandoned the concept of saving money .
Says Kotlikoff , " China is saving so much that it ’s running a current account surplus .
Not only is China supplying capital to the rest of the world , it ’s increasingly doing so via direct investment .
The question for the United States is whether China will tire of investing only indirectly in our country and begin to sell its dollar - denominated reserves .
Doing so could have spectacularly bad implications for the value of the dollar and the level of U.S. interest rates . "
By " spectacularly bad implications , " Kotlikoff means the value of the U.S. dollar would plummet , the level of U.S. interest rates would skyrocket , and hyperinflation would be well underway .
U.S. citizens would find not only their dollars to be near - worthless on the global market , but their savings to be all but wiped out as well .
Sure , you 'll still have the same number of dollars in your bank account , but they wo n't be worth anything .
This is what eventually happens , by the way , when a government eliminates the gold standard and separates its currency from precious metals .
The U.S. dollar , a green piece of paper , technically stands for nothing other than the U.S. government 's promise to pay .
But when push comes to shove , the government will have no choice but to hyperinflate its way out of financial obligations , thereby rendering all currently - held U.S. dollars to be virtually worthless .
Those investors or citizens who hold savings in U.S. dollars will be wiped out by a government that will essentially steal their wealth without having to snatch a single physical dollar from their hands .
Future obligations cannot be met
That this is considered a success by the Bush Administration is testament to the psychotic fiscal self - deception that now serves as the norm in the United States .
It 's like a family that owes $ 1 million on a $ 200,000 home announcing " success " because it has just reduced its monthly credit card borrowing from $ 15,000 to $ 12,000 .
And that 's if you actually believe the numbers , because if there 's one area where Washington has proven its skill , it 's the expert deployment of smoke and mirrors on all things involving numbers .
Cutting the annual budget deficit wo n't save us anyway .
It only means that we 're barreling head - first into a brick wall at a slightly slower pace than before .
The entitlements will still come due :
" There are 77 million baby boomers now ranging from age 41 to age 59 .
All are hoping to collect tens of thousands of dollars in pension and healthcare benefits from the next generation .
These claimants are n’t going away .
In three years , the oldest boomers will be eligible for early Social Security benefits .
In six years , the boomer vanguard will start collecting Medicare .
Our nation has done nothing to prepare for this onslaught of obligation .
Instead , it has continued to focus on a completely meaningless fiscal metric — “ the ” federal deficit — censored and studiously ignored long - term fiscal analyses that are scientifically coherent , and dramatically expanded the benefit levels being explicitly or implicitly promised to the baby boomers . "
The result of this is not in question :
The United States government is already running on fumes , and in a few more years , it will suffer financial collapse .
" Countries can and do go bankrupt , " says Kotlikoff , and the U.S. is no exception to the laws of economic reality .
Oblivious to what 's coming
The idea of ever having to pay back their debt and live within their means is as foreign to most Americans as it is their own government .
Financial consequences have been put off so habitually , for so long , that people forget they even exist .
And thus the reality awakening becomes ever more rude when it finally appears .
To say that most Americans will be in a state of shock when their life savings are suddenly wiped out is an understatement :
These people will have never even imagined such an event is possible , much less contemplated how it might affect them .
Rome is burning
Even worse , there 's not even recognition among the masses that a financial problem exists .
As long as the President continues to proclaim the economy is in good shape , and the press remains complicit with its printing of economic half - truths , few will recognize any problem at all .
Besides , any such recognition of the financial problems now facing this nation requires the observers to actually be able to do basic math .
Our public education system , which is now largely considered institutionalized day care for nutritionally - deficient children , has seen to it that mathematics instruction never gets in the way of diagnosing children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and drugging them up on amphetamines so powerful that they actually have a street value as recreational drugs .
Thus , few young Americans can even do math .
And none of them lived through the Great Depression , nor did they understand the study of it in school , meaning they are precisely the kind of naive , overconfident yuppie spenders who are ripe for being financially obliterated by an economic meltdown .
When their ignorance turns to fear , the ever - widening spiral of financial panic becomes unstoppable until the whole system hits rock bottom .
And " rock bottom " is far , far below the relatively luxurious lifestyle to which American consumers have become so smugly accustomed .
Protecting yourself from the inevitable
That leaves the more intelligent among us plenty of time to prepare .
But the usual preparatory actions by Americans wo n't suffice in such a large - scale collapse .
FDIC - insured banks , for example , will almost certainly collapse and take the DFIC down with them .
Even if you are repaid by the FDIC , you 'll only be paid in worthless U.S. dollars anyway .
Beating the odds on this financial hurricane requires exceptional planning and preparedness .
I 'll publish practical solutions and strategies on this website in the months and years ahead .

As a subscriber , you 'll receive an email alert when I publish new solutions to the coming financial crisis that , according to many observers , now seems a foregone conclusion .

Popular books applying Darwinian logic to everything from religion to dating to dealmaking may fly off the shelves , but attempts to apply evolutionary theory to literary analysis tend to make novelists , English professors and other humanist types break out in hives .
So I was interested to receive a copy of William Flesch ’s new book , “ Comeuppance : Costly Signaling , Altruistic Punishment , and Other Biological Components of Fiction ” ( Harvard University Press ) , blurbed by no less stout a guardian of the humanistic tradition than Harold Bloom as a “ fresh account of the workings of high literature . ”
Most so - called literary Darwinists — who are usually scientists first , and students of literature second ( and often quite superficially ) — argue that narrative evolved because it helps us to rehearse how we might behave in various hypothetic situations , or because it expands our capacity for human sympathy , a version of Matthew Arnold ’s “ sweetness and light . ”
Flesch , an English professor at Brandeis who cites E.O. Wilson and Robert Trivers as fluently as “ Richard III ” and “ The Maltese Falcon , ” asks a deeper question : Just why are human beings universally capable of deep absorption in narratives about people who are made up , or whose fates are so irrelevant to ours that they might as well be ?
( At this point , who among us can be sure that Britney Spears actually exists ? )
Literature — like movies and soap operas and gossip — may instruct , but we gobble it up because it delights .
Our pleasure in narrative , in Flesch ’s account , has a double edge .
On the one hand , we enjoy seeing bad guys — “ defectors ” or “ cheaters , ” in the jargon of evolutionary psychology — punished .
But we do this not out of sadism , but out of an ingrained , evolved desire to affirm our shared moral community and to shore up the group .
( Flesch cites a lot of classic research from game theory to back up this point , and digs into the decades - long debate over the evolution of altruism ; among other things , his book is a challenge to Richard Dawkins ’s idea of the selfish gene . )
But equally powerful is our desire to make sure that those who observe wrongdoing do in fact punish it , often at a great cost to themselves .
These are what Flesch calls “ altruistic punishers , ” and he counts among their numbers everyone from Moses , Achilles , Odysseus , Quixote , “ many Shakespearean heroes , ” Emma Woodhouse , Daniel Deronda , most of Henry James ’s heroines , Ahab and Ishmael to “ almost any modern detective , and almost any modern superhero . ”
We “ instinctively approve of what altruistic punishers do , ” Flesch writes , and , thanks to our evolved capacity to track complex social relationships and monitor reputations , we are “ constituted to observe what they do with some attention . ”
Narrative , he argues , is both about the monitoring of cheaters and punishers , and a reenactment of that monitoring .
That summary does n’t do justice to the complexity and texture of Flesch ’s arguments .
And it leaves out the comeuppance , so to speak , that Flesch himself aims to deliver to some on the other side of the science - humanities divide .
While his book is clearly written for skeptical colleagues in literature departments , Flesch also scolds those more reductionist evolutionary thinkers who have taken an interest in “ explaining ” literature but assume that it cannot possibly be “ as subtle and deep as the best literary criticism takes it to be . ” “ Comeuppance ” is hardly an easy read , but readers from both of the two cultures would do well to take a look .

Liberal evangelical : Gays being stoned means getting high David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 6 , 2008

Print This Email This Steven Colbert turned his attention to religious political attitudes on Monday 's Colbert Report .
" Mitt Romney seems to be a favorite of conservative Christians this time around because as a Mormon he is Christian - ish , " Colbert joked .
" John McCain has a little bit of a tougher time because he called Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ' agents of intolerance ' eight years ago .
And if there 's one thing we know about Christians , they do not forgive . "
Colbert then introduced Tony Campolo , author of Red Letter Christians : A Citizen 's Guide to Faith and Politics .
He asked Campolo whether he agrees that " the Christian right is monolithic and all Christians think the same thing . "
" I am an evangelical , " stated Campolo , presenting himself as a counter - example .
" I am a Democrat . ...
There are a whole mob of us who say we 're not pro-war . "
" Based on what ? " demanded Colbert .
" Show me one thing in the Bible that says Jesus would n't be pro-war .
He said , ' I come not with peace but with a sword , ' sir . "
" And he said , ' love your enemies , ' " Campolo shot back .
" There 's a whole gang of us who are emerging , called red letter Christians , " Campolo continued .
" They 're people who believe in the red letters of the Bible . "
In many editions of the Bible , direct quotes from Jesus are printed in red , and it has often been noted that those quotes taken alone present a very different image of Christianity than the Gospels as a whole .
Colbert then asked about " the gay agenda , " and Campolo responded , " Marriage is in trouble in this country ... because the heterosexuals are getting divorces .
The gays want to get married .
That 's the reality .
...
All they really want is the same privileges . "
" Do you believe in Leviticus where it says that gay people should be stoned ? "
Colbert asked .
" Yes ! " replied Campolo enthusiastically , before explaining to a bemused Colbert , " It 's not that kind of stoned . "
" To get high ? " asked Colbert , miming holding a joint to his lips .
" You got it ! " Compolo answered boisterously .
" The thing is , " Compolo continued , more seriously , " Jesus ups the ante .
He says , ' This is what it said in the Hebrew Bible , but I give you a new commandment .
Love your enemies , do good to those who hurt you . '
And he would even say , ' Love and justice for people who are oppressed . ' "
" And you 've got to admit , gay people have been oppressed in our society , " concluded Compolo .
" We want justice for our gay brothers and our lesbian sisters because we think that God loves them . "

There is one Christmas card missing from the usual line - up on Sam Hunter 's mantelpiece .
It is the one from her local Indian takeaway , thanking her for being such a loyal and regular customer .
Mrs Hunter , 38 , is delighted to have been forgotten - because it means that she stuck to her massive weightloss goal for 2007 .
Scroll down for more ...
The mother of two , a nurse , shed eight stone in 12 months after giving up her beloved curries .
She shrank from a size 26 , at 17 stone , to a petite size eight to ten .
It is a radical change from last Christmas , when she was feeling lethargic and old before her time .
" I used to go to the Indian takeaway as many as four times a week , " she said .
" My husband always told me he loved me how I was , but I felt huge and embarrassed . '
Mrs Hunter , from York , had struggled with her weight for years .
In 2000 the family moved to Australia , where she believed her quality of life would improve .
Scroll down for more ...
Instead , her size meant the heat was unbearable and they were forced to return to the UK .
She said : " I sweated so much that I developed abscesses on my tummy and thighs . "
On their return , she took a job as a maternity nurse at York District Hospital .
" The patients were always giving me chocolates as thank - you gifts , " she recalled .
" I would think nothing of eating a whole family - size tin all by myself .
" On top of that , I would have cereal and toast for breakfast , a bacon sandwich , a bowl of soup , crisps and cakes for lunch , a plate of pasta from the hospital canteen for tea and then pick up a takeaway on the way home . "
But everything changed when she was given the autobiography of the late Jane Tomlinson for Christmas in 2006 .
Mrs Tomlinson raised thousands of pounds for cancer charities while battling the disease .
Mrs Hunter said : " It gave me a new perspective on life and inspired me to take up running .
" Exercise was agony at first , but I started losing weight , which inspired me to ditch my old eating habits .
" The manager at the takeaway even called to ask if I was okay because I had n't been in for so long . "
By September , she was fit enough to finish the Great North Run half - marathon , raising funds for a friend 's son who has muscular dystrophy .
" When I crossed the finishing line in just two hours , I felt really emotional , " she said .
" For the first time I did n't feel embarrassed to be me .
" I might not be getting a Christmas card from the Indian takeaway this year , but I will be slipping into a slinky little black dress and I could n't be happier . "
You know your conference has hit the big time when Robin Williams steps up from the audience to fill the dead air during an embarrassing , show - stopping technical glitch .
The actor - comedian was in the audience at the TED ( Technology , Entertainment and Design ) conference in Monterey , Calif. , last night when a technical glitch halted a panel discussion that was being recorded by the BBC .
( Apologies for the blurry image at right ; it was snapped quickly by my seatmate , Paul Holland , who graciously e-mailed me the pic ) .
Williams was sitting in the row behind me at the panel discussion on new media .
Before the host , BBC World presenter Matt Frei , could finish his introduction of panelist Sergey Brin from Google , he announced the BBC was having a technical issue .
Frei did n't quite know what to do with the empty air while waiting for a fix and joked that the voice in his earphone ( the producer ) was telling him a long , elaborate political joke about Poland .
That 's when a voice behind me spoke up , presumably a heckler , and began speaking loudly as if he were conducting a live news feed , joking that he was reporting live from TED but " could n't understand a fucking word " and was " wondering why at a technology conference everything is running so shittily " ( at least that 's the word I think he used ; it was hard to hear the last word through the audience 's laughter ) .
The crowd by then had realized it was Williams .
Encouraged by their reaction , he continued reporting to some unseen BBC anchorman from his seat : " Well , they said they found the wire , but it 's not plugged in . "
Williams was then invited to take the stage and the crowd roared .
He spent the next ten minutes or so riffing on Stephen Hawking ( who spoke at TED earlier in the day from Cambridge , England ) and the end of the universe – which will take place " exactly in one hour , " he said , looking at his watch .
He joked again about the technical glitch , indicating that although the BBC was n't working , audience members " with their phones are going , ' I 'm getting all of this ! ' "
And it was true .
Dozens of people were capturing the stand - up act on their phones .
He riffed about a new Apple product called the " iWhy ? " and a few seconds later said , " I have just one question about the British royal family :
All that money and no dental plan , " which got a lot of laughs and a few sympathetic nods toward the BBC presenter sitting behind him ( who appeared to have perfectly fine dental hygiene ) .
He did n't spare panelist Brin and Google , noting that if you walk into Google you see everyone in front of their computer sitting on exercise balls , " which I think is how they 're hatching new employees . "
And Israel got a mention as well , since it was launching a new internet service called " Net - 'n - Yahoo " ( riffing on Bibi Netanyahu 's name ) .
The glitch was finally fixed but not before TED curator Chris Anderson asked Williams to come back the next day and lend the proceedings some more of his good cheer .
The panel discussion that ensued was interesting and included , in addition to Brin , Queen Noor of Jordan , Watergate - buster Carl Bernstein , Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert and Ugandan journalist Andrew Mwenda .
The BBC will broadcast the panel discussion sometime in March .
I 'll report back with more from TED later .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Banks have borrowed $ 34 billion in short - term credits from three central banks as part of the coordinated effort to alleviate a liquidity crunch at the end of the year .
U.S. banks borrowed $ 20 billion from the U.S. Federal Reserve for 28 days at 4.65 % , the Fed announced Wednesday .
The European Central Bank lent $ 10 billion at 4.65 % , and the Swiss National Bank lent $ 4 billion at an average rate of 4.79 % .
The interest rates were determined by competitive bids .
Demand for the funds was relatively strong across a wide swath of banks , but did not reflect any desperation to obtain funds , according to analysis .
The stop - out interest rates were on the high side of expectations , suggesting healthy demand .
Read Steve Goldstein 's commentary .
It was the first round of several auctions of short - term credits planned by the central banks to alleviate a liquidity crunch in credit markets .
The Fed 's second auction will be held Thursday , with $ 20 billion being offered for 35 days .
The results of that auction will be released Friday .
A total of 93 banks bid in the Fed 's auction on Monday , asking for $ 61.6 billion .
The bid - to - cover ratio was 3.08 .
The loans are fully collateralized and will be repaid on Jan. 17 .
See the full announcement .
At 4.65 % , the stop - out interest rate for the auction stood 10 basis points below the Fed 's discount window rate of 4.75 % and was 28 basis points below the prevailing interbank lending rate of 4.93 % .
With 93 banks bidding , there was clearly no stigma to participating in this program , as has been the case with the Fed 's primary credit facility ( also known as the discount window ) , according to Lou Crandall , chief economist for Wrightson ICAP .
" The results are consistent with the notion that banks have a strong demand for funding at the right price , " wrote David Greenlaw , an economist for Morgan Stanley .
" If the stop - out rate had been above the discount rate [ 4.75 % ] , it would have conveyed a hint of desperation .
Alternatively , a lower bid - to - cover would have signaled a lack of interest in the new program . "
" The relatively high stop - out rate probably says more about the cost of alternative sources of funds than about severe year - end funding problems , " Crandall wrote .
Ahead of the results , observers warned against overanalyzing the auction .
The proof of whether the extra liquidity is working will be seen in interbank interest rates .
Last week , major central banks announced a coordinated plan to pump at least $ 80 billion into the financial system at the end of the year .
See full story .
Interbank lending rates have been extraordinarily high , showing a reluctance to lend .
The hope is that the central banks can prime the pump and get credits flowing again .
On Tuesday , the European Central Bank trumped that announcement by offering unlimited funds at 4.21 % .
More than 350 billion euros ( $ 500 billion ) were borrowed in that auction .

I can tie a tie in one second .
I use a trick taught by a magician known as the Amazing Randi and appeared in the now defunct OMNI magazine of the late ' 70's .
It 's way cool & you only need one hand !
I often flip the tie over my shoulder as I 'm tying it so others can't see the knot .
Then I ask them to count while I " tie " the tie .
I whip it out in an instant , already tied .
I 'm sure you can find this method somewhere on the web .
I do n't have time right now to make a video of it or describe the method ... maybe later .

The four - year project is due to start next month
Staff at the University of Plymouth will work with a 1 m - high ( 3ft ) humanoid baby robot called iCub .
Over the next four years robotics experts will work with language development specialists who research how parents teach children to speak .
Their findings could lead to the development of humanoid robots which learn , think and talk .
The project is believed to be the first of its kind in the world and typical experiments with the iCub robot will include activities such as inserting objects of various shapes into the corresponding holes in a box , serialising nested cups and stacking wooden blocks .
Artificial intelligence
The iCub , which will arrive at the university next year , will also be asked to name objects and actions so that it acquires basic phrases such as " robot puts stick on cube " .
A consortium led by the University of Plymouth , a world leader in cognitive robotics research , beat competition from 31 others to win a £ 4.7 m grant for the Italk - Integration and Transfer of Action and Language Knowledge in Robots - project .
The university 's partners in the project include the University of Hertfordshire and others from across Europe .
Angelo Cangelosi , Professor in Artificial Intelligence said : " The outcome of the research will define the scientific and technological requirements for the design of humanoid robots able to develop complex behavioural , thinking and communication skills through individual and social learning . "
No one can agree on what exactly happened the day a Colorado man spotted Dick Cheney strolling the streets of a ski resort town and decided to give the vice president a piece of his mind .
Steve Howards , 55 , says he walked up to Cheney and delivered his message -- “ Your policies in Iraq are disgusting ” -- then lightly touched the vice president ’s shoulder .
The White House photographer says he saw Howards slap Cheney on the back .
Cheney ’s personal aide remembers Howards placing his hand on Cheney ’s arm and shaking his hand .
Advertisement
As for the Secret Service agents who arrested Howards on suspicion of assault : two say he lightly clapped Cheney on the shoulder ; one demonstrated it as a shove ; a fourth said Howards reached over several small children and struck Cheney .
Since the agents -- now accusing one another of changing their stories and lying about what happened -- ca n’t agree , Cheney should give his own version , Howards said .
He has filed a federal lawsuit against the agents , claiming they violated his right to free speech and protection from unreasonable search and seizure .
“ He ’s the so - called victim of the assault .
Clearly the vice president should have very relevant testimony to give , ” said Howards ’ attorney , David Lane , who this month asked a federal judge to order U.S. marshals to serve a subpoena to the White House .
Advertisement
Getting the vice president in a witness box would be a historic achievement .
It ’s exceedingly rare for high - level officials to testify or give depositions , said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , a Washington group that advocates for transparency in government .
Fitton said he could not recall any instance in which Cheney had given a deposition while in office .
He said that to compel such a high - ranking executive branch official to testify , one must show that that official has information that could n’t be obtained in another way -- the same argument Cheney ’s attorney made in U.S. District Court last week .
Advertisement
Biz Van Gelder , a Washington lawyer who specializes in white - collar criminal defense , disagrees .
“ I know of no law that says the vice president of the United States is immune from service process because he ’s the vice president , ” she said .
One question the courts will consider is how much of an intrusion it is on the schedule of the vice president to be called to testify , said Joel Goldstein , a law professor at St. Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency .
Perhaps the best - known example of a president or vice president giving a deposition in recent times is former President Clinton ’s 1998 testimony in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones , an event whose anniversary is still noted in “ Today in History ” newspaper columns .
Advertisement
Another example is the 1990 testimony of former President Reagan as a defense witness in the trial of former national security advisor John M. Poindexter .
And last year , speculation swirled that Cheney would testify at the criminal trial of his former aide , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , but that did n’t happen .
Experts noted that situations such as the Howards - Cheney exchange are rare .
“ These sorts of things do n’t happen that often because they have a pretty sheltered existence , ” Goldstein said .
Advertisement
On June 16 , 2006 , Howards , an environmental consultant , was with his family in Beaver Creek , a resort town about 100 miles west of Denver , when he spotted Cheney walking down the street .
That morning , Howards said he had read a newspaper article that listed the number of troops killed in Iraq .
“ I was outraged , ” he said .
“ The fact he happened to cross my way , I felt , was an opportunity I could n’t ignore . ”
So Howards said he spoke his piece , then patted the right shoulder of Cheney ’s silk suit and walked away .
A Secret Service agent caught up with him a few minutes later and began to question him .
Advertisement
The agent , Virgil “ Gus ” Reichle Jr. , did not see what happened .
But he said other agents told him an assault had occurred -- that Howards slapped Cheney “ with such force that his shoulder dipped , ” according to Reichle ’s deposition .
Reichle arrested Howards , but assault charges were never filed .
Instead , Howards was issued a summons for misdemeanor harassment , but the district attorney later dismissed the charge , saying it was clear Howards had n’t attacked Cheney .
What transpired next is anything but clear .
In his Nov. 27 deposition , Reichle claimed the other agents later changed their stories to say there was no assault -- perhaps because they did n’t want to inconvenience Cheney with any legal hassles .
Advertisement
“ Certainly they do n’t want him to be bothered with a deposition , ” he said .
“ Perhaps Vice President Cheney just was willing to let it go , you know .
He ’s a tough guy , played high school football . ”
Another agent , Daniel McLaughlin , denied that he had ever considered the incident to be an assault .
After Howards ’ arrest , he said , he and another agent , Adam Daniels , wrote statements describing what they had seen -- physical contact but no assault .
McLaughlin said Reichle called him several hours after the arrest and asked him to alter his written statement .
" [ Reichle ] said , ‘ I need you to change your statement ; your story and mine are not the same . ’
I said , ‘ My statement is what I recollect from what I participated in .
We ’re not having this conversation . ’
Then I hung up on him , ” McLaughlin testified .
Advertisement
The next morning , McLaughlin said Reichle confronted him and said , “ ‘ The vice president ’s detail is involved in a cover - up . ’
I thought that he had taken a giant leap away from his good senses . ”
A Secret Service spokesman declined to comment on the case because of the litigation .
The agents ’ rancorous difference of opinion makes Cheney a crucial witness in the case , the attorney for Howards argued .
He said it was customary for lawyers to accept subpoenas on behalf of their clients , but Cheney ’s attorney , James Gilligan , had refused to do so .
Advertisement
Gilligan noted that the agents and other government employees had complied with depositions .
Asking the vice president , he said , “ is a different kettle of fish . ”
To compel the testimony of a high - level official , the plaintiff must show the testimony ca n’t be gleaned from other sources , Gilligan said .
Magistrate Judge Craig Shaffer ordered Gilligan to present his legal arguments by the end of February outlining why Cheney should not be subpoenaed .
Another hearing is scheduled for March 6 .

No one likes paying $ 35 for a fill - up that used to cost $ 15 .
But where does all your dinero go , actually ?
Is it Big Oil — or Big Government — that ’s got you over a barrel ?
Let ’s break it down .
Crude Oil
Believe it or not , the cost of the oil itself is pretty low , roughly about 50 cents of the current per-gallon retail price of fuel .
Even though world demand for oil continues to uptick steadily ( and geometrically ) , the oil producing countries have kept pace – opening the spigots all the way .
There appears to be plenty of oil , actually .
It ’s mostly market volatility ( which is based to a great extent on the social / political volatility of the situation in oil - producing areas and countries like Iraq and Venezuela ) and artificial decreases in production by OPEC states that causes the world price of a gallon of crude to fluctuate like a haywire Geiger counter .
Who to blame ?
Unstable government , radical regimes ; market manipulators , current events .
Refining / Distribution Costs
This is the big one , bottom - line wise .
Around 50 - 75 cents of what you ’re paying per gallon at the pump ( depending on where you live / the time of year ) goes to offset the cost of turning light sweet crude into something that will burn in your car ’s engine .
And burn cleanly , it ’s important to add .
There are multiple ( and varying ) requirements for retail gasoline – including that it be “ oxygenated ” or “ reformulated ” in some areas ( and at certain times of the year ) as a means of curbing vehicle exhaust emissions .
This is not cheap .
In fact , the add - on costs of complying with federal and state motor fuels requirements have increased massively over the past 20 years .
It is often necessary , for example , to brew one type of fuel for one state – and a slightly different one for an adjacent state .
These fuels must then be transported separately , via dedicated pipelines or trucks .
That gets into bucks , fast .
Also , refiners must guesstimate how much of a given type of gas to produce ; if demand ends up exceeding supply , the price goes up .
Who to blame ?
Your federal and state lawmakers ; excessive bureaucracy , conflicting / counterproductive regulations ; air pollution .
Motor Fuels Taxes
This one ’s beefy , too .
Depending on where you live , you ’re paying another 50 cents ( or more ) in federal , state and local motor fuels taxes on every gallon you burn .
The good news :
As the total price of a gallon of regular unleaded shot up from around $ 1.50 just a few years ago to $ 3 or more today , the relative cost of motor fuels taxes has gone down .
They used to account for about a third of the total price we paid ; that ’s now down to about a fourth .
Feel better now ?
Who to blame ?
The government , at all levels .
Oil Company Profits
In a word , huge .
About 75 cents to $ 1 out of the $ 3 something you are paying at the pump – depending on whose numbers you use ( or believe ) .
This accounts for the record profits we ’ve all read about .
However , there is a caveat here – and it is “ net ” vs. “ gross ” profits .
While there ’s no question the oil companies have been raking it in lately , there is a question as to just how much is actually left over after taking into account operating expenses and other things ( including massive CEO pay packages ) that detract from the bottom line .
The true number is hard to gauge .
But rest assured , it ’s not small .
Who to blame ?
The oil companies .
They have something you not only want but pretty much must have .
You ’ll pay what they say – like it or not .
Small Stuff
The remaining chump change ( about 10 - 15 cents per gallon ) goes to pay for things like credit card fees , mark - up / profit for the individual gas station dealer ( he has to make money , too ) and so on .
Trying to make a buck selling gas on the retail level is actually a very tough proposition .
Your local gas n’ go very likely makes more money on its mini-mart than it does on the fuel it sells – so do n’t get mad at him when the gas you bought yesterday for $ 3.10 is selling for $ 3.29 on Saturday morning .
He ’s probably feeling just as screwed as you .
Who to blame ?
No one .
We ’re in this one together .

Four years ago , Mark Prior had the kind of stature that
Johan Santana has now , as the pitcher that everybody would love to have .
But now the Chicago Cubs have made it known that they are willing to trade the former All - Star pitcher , rival executives say .
Prior , 27 , had shoulder surgery last April and has received a very encouraging prognosis from Dr. James Andrews , and he is expected to pitch in 2008 .
But since he went 18 - 6 with a 2.43 ERA in 2003 , Prior has had repeated physical problems , and has pitched in just 57 games over the last four seasons -- and none in 2007 .
Officials with other teams say that the Cubs have made it known in recent weeks that they are willing to trade Prior , which could be an alternative to working through a difficult contract decision .
The Cubs have to tender a 2008 contract to Prior by Dec. 12 , and their preference has been to sign the right - hander to a one - year deal with an option for 2009 , rather than go through arbitration with him this winter .
But Prior , who made $ 3.65 million , may prefer to sign a contract of longer terms .
So the Cubs , who already have multiyear deals with Carlos Zambrano , Ted Lilly and Jason Marquis , could choose to deal Prior rather than settling on a new deal .
Prior was the second player taken in the 2001 draft , and paid off almost immediately for the Cubs , going 6 - 6 with a 3.32 ERA in 2002 before his standout season of 2003 ( 18 - 6 , 2.43 ERA ) , when the Cubs came close to advancing to the World Series .
But since then , he 18 - 17 .

I ’ve got portions of HTML5 lib working on Ruby 1.9 , enough to pass Mars 's unit tests .
My initial reaction to Ruby 1.9 ’s support is n’t favorable .
I definitely like Python 3 K 's Unicode support better .
This feels closer to Python 2.5 .
In fact , I think I prefer Ruby 1.8 ’s non-support for Unicode over Ruby 1.9’s “ support ” .
The problem is one that is all to familiar to Python programmers .
You can have a fully unit tested library and have somebody pass you a bad string , and you will fall over .
An example that fails with Ruby 1.9 :
[ 0x2639 ] . pack ( 'U ' ) + " \u2639 "
The error that is produced is ArgumentError : character encodings differ .
The left hand side specifies packing as UTF - 8 .
The right hand side is expressed as Unicode , which Ruby represents as #< Encoding : UTF - 8 > .
The problem is that the left hand side is actually stored as #< Encoding : ASCII - 8BIT > which is a misnomer .
In many ways this mirror ’s Python 2.x ’s < type ' str ' > vs < type ' unicode ' > except that with Ruby 1.9 both Strings are the same type .
Ruby 1.9 both mitigates and compounds the problem by providing a number of implicit conversions .
Sometimes .
Take a look at this code which produces this output .
Specifically , look at rows 2 and 4 , where two Strings , of the same type , encoding , length , and value produce different results when concatenated with UTF - 8 strings .
This type of magic destroys any confidence I have in unit testing as a viable strategy .
Update : no magic , just a bug .
My preference would be that #< Encoding : ASCII - 8BIT > be abolished , in favor of #< Encoding : ASCII - 7BIT > and a separate Bytes class .
Generally , programmers would only see objects of class Bytes if they do “ binary ” file I/O , explicitly create constants of that type , or invoke methods such as String # bytes .

I have not been to Paris myself .
Yet .
I visited Paris for the first , and so far only , time in 2012 .
Looking at the photo in the comic , and matching it up to one of my own photos from that trip ( below ) , I believe I can say that the photo in the comic was taken from the top of Notre Dame Cathedral :
Note the similar position of the golden dome to the left of the Eiffel Tower .
The dome marks the position of Les Invalides .
Well , obviously the background is from somewhere near the top of Notre Dame , since they would n't want to crash their zeppelin into the cathedral .
Interestingly enough ( for those of us interested in such minutia ) , the phrase " the First World War " does appear in print well before the start of the Second World War , although it does n't become popular or widespread until after WWII .
But it would be possible for Haken to be simply well - read in these things . :)
For instance :
" It is interesting to note that in the end Repington , with remarkable foresight , chose for his book of 1920 the title The First World War ( a name Churchill was also to use for the Seven Years ' War ) , reminding us of the remarks D. H. Lawrence reportedly said whilst attending a party on Armistice Night :
' The war is n't over .
The hate and evil is greater now than ever .
Very soon war will break out again and overwhelm you ... the Germans will soon rise again .' ( quoted in S. Hynes , A War Imagined , 1992 , pp. 566-67 ) . "

BEFORE the candidates for America 's presidential election have even been decided , hardened gamblers and political junkies can still take a flutter on who will take the vice - presidency .
Punters reckon Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are in close contention to become the Democrats ' second - in - command , according to fast - changing odds offered on Betfair , a British online - gambling exchange .
Mike Huckabee is the Republican with the shortest odds .
But if you think John McCain might somehow blow his chances of securing the Republican nomination and instead walk into the White House alongside President Huckabee , you can expect very attractive odds indeed .

This project was started for Dynamism for the GP2X community , but its userbase far exceeds its original design .
and Linux is free and will remain so , but donations are greatly needed .
andLinux uses coLinux as its core which is confusing for many people .
coLinux is a port of the Linux kernel to Windows .
Although this technology is a bit like running Linux in a virtual machine , coLinux differs itself by being more of a merger of Windows and the Linux kernel and not an emulated PC , making it more efficient .
Xming is used as X server and PulseAudio as sound server .
andLinux is not just for development and runs almost all Linux applications without modification .

After 20 years and five series , including “ thirtysomething ” and “ My So - Called Life , ” my partner , Ed Zwick , and I have -- for the time being at least -- stopped producing television programs .
It ’s not personal .
I count as friends many of the executives who work at the networks .
We had a deal at one network , ABC , for all of those 20 years , and , in spite of many regime changes , we were always treated with great respect .
This is not about how we were treated but rather something much larger :
How a confluence of government policy and corporate strategy is literally poisoning the TV business .
It started in 1995 when the Federal Communications Commission abolished its long - standing “ finsyn ” rules ( that ’s financial interest and syndication , for those unfamiliar with the term ) , allowing networks for the first time to own the programs they broadcast .
Before that , under classic antitrust definitions , the networks had been confined to the role of broadcaster , paying a license fee to production companies for the right to broadcast programs just two times .
The production companies owned all subsequent rights .
In the mid-1990s there were 40 independent production companies making television shows .
If a particular network did n’t like a show -- as famously happened with “ The Cosby Show ” many years ago -- the production company could take it to another network .
But not after 1995 .
The abolition of the old rules set in motion an ineluctable process , one that has negatively affected every creative person I know in television .
Today there are zero independent production companies making scripted television .
They were all forced out of business by the networks ’ insistence -- following the FCC ’s fin-syn ruling -- on owning part or all of every program they broadcast .
The most profound change resulting from that ruling is the way networks go about the business of creating programming .
Networks today exert a level of creative control unprecedented in the history of the medium .
The stories my friends tell me would make me laugh if the situation were n’t so self - defeating .
Network executives routinely tell producers to change the color of the walls on sets ; routinely decide on the proper wardrobe for actors ; routinely have “ tone ” meetings with directors on upcoming pilots ; routinely give notes on every page of a script .
( When we did “ thirtysomething ” in the late ‘ 80s , we never received network notes . )
And by the way , they have every right to do these things .
As owners , they have a responsibility to satisfy themselves that their product is competitive and successful .
The problem , of course , is that these executives often have little background or qualification for making creative decisions .
They are guided by market research and -- they want to believe -- a learned intuition about what the public wants .
This season ’s new shows have been a good indicator of how successful that strategy is :
Even before the current writer ’s strike , virtually every new show was struggling .
But the changes have gone further .
Over the last few years -- during a time when network profits have been increasing -- salaries and profit participation for the writer - producers who create the shows have been slashed .
Fees were cut by one - third to one - half , and profit participation in many cases was effectively eliminated .
It ’s a curious ( and peculiarly American ) fact that many of the great artistic talents in the history of film and TV also have been entrepreneurs : Chaplin , Capra , Serling , Pakula , Lucas , Spielberg -- the list goes on .
For reasons that are probably more psychological than anything else , creative and financial independence seem to go hand in hand .
Yet what we have now is a complete absence of either in the world of television .
Your TV may receive 200 channels , but virtually every one of them is owned by one of six big companies -- NBC Universal , Disney , Time Warner , Viacom / Paramount , Sony and News Corp .
And each channel has a brand identity dictated by those companies to which each program must adhere .
Producers are now employees , not creators .
If you were foolish enough to independently produce a TV pilot today , when you took it to the network , you would give up at least half of your ownership and all of your control , even though the network would n’t pay any more than it used to pay as that old license fee .
Is there significance to this , outside the narrow concerns of Hollywood and the lost earning power of producers ?
I think so .
Besides any esoteric discussion of the value of storytelling in a culture -- which I believe is immense -- this trend is part of a larger problem caused by the FCC in all areas of media .
The relaxation of the Fairness Doctrine ( which required the networks to present the news in a balanced way ) , the lapse of any oversight of networks ’ civic responsibility , the commoditization of network news -- these are all parts of a troubling move toward the aggregation of control of information in an ever - shrinking number of entities .
Our founding fathers could not have foreseen that freedom of the press might eventually be threatened just as much by media consolidation as by government .
And if you doubt that ’s happening , just watch Bill Moyers ’ recent expose on the networks ’ passive collusion with government in selling the Iraq war .
Because the business of television has become an exclusive club , closed to new members , some producers are turning to the Internet to have a voice .
And , of course , the Big Six are doing everything they can to own and control that as well .
Already , it ’s impossible to make an “ overall deal ” -- the time - honored arrangement in which producers are kept on retainer to develop shows for a particular network -- without agreeing to be exclusive to the network on the Internet as well as television .
The logic of this defies all laws of economics ; producers pledge fealty to networks because they ( the producers ) do n’t have the millions it takes to shoot , distribute and broadcast their own programs on television .
Producing for the Internet , on the other hand , costs as little as $ 30,000 an hour , and “ broadcasting ” costs much less .
Virtually anyone can do it .
So what value do the networks provide that makes it worthwhile for producers to agree to that exclusivity ?
You tell me , because I can’t figure it out .
Less polite folks might call it extortion .
Zwick and I have joined that migration to the Internet .
We ’ve created a project called “ quarterlife ” -- a series and a social network -- that we own and control , and we had to give up our TV deal in order to do it .
The series will premiere Sunday on MySpace and then on our site , quarterlife.com , the next night .
We ’ve worked very hard , and spent a great deal of our own money , to make it as good as anything we ’ve ever done on television .
And we ’ve gotten calls from every guild and virtually every producer we know , all of whom are curious to see if this little experiment can succeed .
Because if it does , it will prove that there ’s a way to independently produce , finance and distribute ambitious content on the Internet .
And if we can do it , others can do it .
To be sure , there ’s every possibility this series will end up on television after it ’s established on the Internet , but only if we still own it and control it creatively , which would make it unique in today ’s landscape .
The problems of network ownership and creative control are not directly at issue in the current strike by the Writers Guild of America .
What ’s at stake is how writers will be compensated , given the control everyone assumes the big companies will exert over new methods of delivery .
But make no mistake -- deep resentment in the entire creative community over the absolute power now wielded by these companies is the fuel that feeds the strike .
The public is also fed up , turning out in droves and sending millions of e-mails whenever the FCC holds hearings on the subject .
And yet the large corporations move forward , seemingly unaware that they are strangling the creative engine that might save them .
Within five years there wo n’t be a significant distinction between TV and broadband .
As of now , the Internet is just too big for any company to get its hands around , and that ’s good for all of us .
If the large companies -- and the FCC -- cannot come to comprehend the paradox that too much control is destructive to their own ends , they may bring about their own downfall , losing their audience and their workers at the same time .
Like carriage makers at the dawn of the auto age .

Partially applying a function is a , particularly , interesting technique in which you can pre-fill - in arguments to a function before it is ever executed .
In effect , partially applying a function returns a new function which you can call .
This is best understood through an example :
String.prototype.csv = String.prototype.split.partial(/,\s*/) ; var results = " John , Resig , Boston " .csv( ) ; alert ( ( results [ 1 ] == " Resig " ) + "
The text values were split properly " ) ;
In the above case we ’ve taken a common function – a String ’s .split ( ) method – and have pre-filled - in the regular expression upon which to split .
The result is a new function , .csv( ) that we can call at any point to convert a list of comma-separated values into an array .
Filling in the first couple arguments of a function ( and returning a new function ) is typically called currying .
With that in mind , let ’s look at how currying is , roughly , implemented in the Prototype library :
Function.prototype.curry = function ( ) { var fn = this , args = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments ) ; return function ( ) { return fn.apply ( this , args.concat ( Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments ) ) ) ; } ; } ;
This is a good case of using a closure to remember state .
In this case we want to remember the arguments that were pre-filled - in ( args ) and transfer them to the newly - constructed function .
This new function will have the filled - in arguments and the new arguments concat ’d together and passed in .
The result is a method that allows us to fill in arguments , giving us a new function that we can use .
Now , this style of partial application is perfectly useful , but we can do better .
What if we wanted to fill in any missing argument from a given function – not just the first ones .
Implementations of this style of partial application have existed in other languages but Oliver Steele was one of the first to demonstrate it with his Functional .js library .
Let ’s take a look at a possible implementation :
Function.prototype.partial = function ( ) { var fn = this , args = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments ) ; return function ( ) { var arg = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < args .
length && arg < arguments .
length ; i++ ) if ( args [ i ] === undefined ) args [ i ] = arguments [ arg ++ ] ; return fn.apply ( this , args ) ; } ; } ;[ / js ]
This implementation is fundamentally similar to the < code >.curry ( ) </ code > method , but has a couple important differences .
Notably , when called , the user can specify arguments that will be filled in later by specifying < code > undefined < / code > , for it .
To accommodate this we have to increase the ability of our arguments - merging technique .
Effectively , we have to loop through the arguments that are passed in and look for the appropriate gaps , filling in the missing pieces that were specified .
We already had the example of constructing a string splitting function , above , but let 's look at some other ways in which this new functionality could be used .
To start we could construct a function that 's able to be easily delayed : var delay = setTimeout.partial ( undefined , 10 ) ; delay ( function ( ) { alert ( " A call to this function will be temporarily delayed . " ) ; } ) ;
This means that we now have a new function , named delay , which we can pass another function in to , at any time , to have it be called asynchronously ( after 10 milliseconds ) .
We could , also create a simple function for binding events :
var bindClick = document.body.addEventListener .partial ( " click " , undefined , false ) ; bindClick ( function ( ) { alert ( " Click event bound via curried function . " ) ; } ) ;
This technique could be used to construct simple helper methods for event binding in a library .
The result would be a simpler API where the end - user would n’t be inconvenienced by unnecessary function arguments , reducing them to a single function call with the partial application .
In the end we ’ve used closures to easily , and simply , reduce the complexity of some code , easily demonstrating some of the power that functional JavaScript programming has .

Editor 's note for Sept. 27 , 2015 : If you are looking for viewing details on the rare supermoon lunar eclipse of Sept. 27 - 28 , 2015 , please visit our complete coverage page : Supermoon Lunar Eclipse 2015 : Full ' Blood Moon ' Coverage .
A total eclipse of the moon tonight is expected to delight skywatchers across the United States and much of the world .
It will be the last total lunar eclipse until 2010 .
The easy - to - watch event will play out in several stages as Earth 's shadow blocks sunlight from shining on the moon .
Weather permitting , the eclipse will be visible from all locations in the United States , according to NASA .
Along the Oregon and northern California coasts , the moon will rise during the early stages of the eclipse , however .
When to watch
Eclipses occur only at full moon when the sun , Earth and moon are in a perfect line .
Because the moon 's orbit around Earth is not perfectly aligned with the plane of Earth 's orbit around the sun , eclipses do not occur at every full moon .
The moon will enter Earth 's umbral shadow ( the full shadow ) at 8:43 p.m. ET ( that 's 7:43 p.m. Central , 6:43 p.m. Mountain and 5:43 p.m. Pacific ) on Wednesday , Feb. 20 .
It will appear as though an ever - larger bite is being taken out of the moon .
Some 78 minutes later , the moon will slip into full eclipse .
About 51 minutes later , a bright scallop will appear as the moon starts emerging .
It will be completely out of the umbral shadow at 9:09 p.m. Pacific time , which is 12:09 a.m. ET on Thursday morning .
For Europe and Africa , the eclipse is a predawn Thursday event , with the moon starting entry to the umbral shadow at 1:43 Greenwich ( or Universal ) Time .
What you 'll see
Look for the moon to possibly turn red during the total portion of the eclipse .
" The exact color that the moon appears depends on the amount of dust and clouds in the atmosphere , " according to a NASA statement .
" If there are extra particles in the atmosphere , from say a recent volcanic eruption , the moon will appear a darker shade of red . "
The redness occurs because while the moon is in total shadow , some light from the sun passes through Earth 's atmosphere and is bent toward the moon .
The effect is to cast all the planet 's sunrises and sunsets on the moon .
Christopher Columbus famously used a blood - red eclipse in 1504 to frighten natives on Jamaica into feeding his crew .
The planet Saturn and the bright star Regulus will form a broad triangle with the moon 's ruddy disk , according to Joe Rao , SPACE.com 's Skywatching Columnist .
You do n't need any special equipment to watch a lunar eclipse .
Comfortable chairs and warm clothing are good ideas .
A telescope will bring out interesting details of the lunar surface , and even a small telescope will reveal Saturn 's stunning rings .
Benjamin Franklin New Page -- 6 September 2003 Benjamin Franklin was a babe magnet .
This may not be the most noteworthy of his many talents , but then again , it might be .
Of all the signers of the Declaration of Independence , it 's nice to know that the crafty dodger was sufficiently cognizant of the feminine mystique to gain notoriety for being highly attractive to members of the female sex .
It speaks well of any male politician to genuinely like women .
It 's the old , " Make love , not war " style innovation .
The standard accolades for Benjamin are things like " America 's best scientist , inventor , diplomat , humorist and business strategist . " [ 1 ]
Yada , yada , yada .
Perhaps Monsieur Franklin did indeed accomplish much .
But then again , maybe he was just in the right spot at the right time .
The more relevant question is what was his philosophy , what was his ideals and aversions , and most significantly , how did he manage to attract all those babes ?
Walter Isaacson [ 1 ] does a commendable job in answering some of these questions , and organizes it around 7 virtues attributed to Franklin .
These include : 1 -- An Aversion to Tyranny ( So relevant today ) 2 -- A Free Press ( and by implication , a couple of hundred years later , Inter Net ) 3 -- Humor ( It 's the babe thing . )
4 -- Humility 5 -- Idealism in Foreign Policy 6 -- Compromise 7 -- Tolerance 8 -- Babes ( I added this ) 9 -- 1776 ( this too ) 1 -- Franklin wrote prolifically in the pen name guise of a slightly prudish widow named Silence Dogood .
[ You 've got to admire his choice of pen names ! ]
In one instance , " she " wrote , " I am a mortal enemy to arbitrary government and unlimited power . " [ 1 ]
This is the kind of succinct statement which can be mined extensively for meaning and value .
From mortal enemy to arbitrary government , Dogood makes it clear upon which side she stands .
" I am naturally very jealous for the rights and liberties of my country ; and the least appearance of an encroachment on those invaluable privileges is apt to make my blood boil exceedingly . " [ 1 ]
Go get 'em , Silence !
According to Isaacson [ 1 ] , Franklin also uses Mrs. Dogood " to attack the theocratic rule of the Puritan establishment and the link between the church and state that was then the very foundation of Massachusetts government . "
She goes on to say , for example , " A man compounded of law and gospel is able to cheat a whole country with his religion and then destroy them under color of law . "
William Rehnquist -- currently the Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court -- said , " The separation of church and state was ' a misleading metaphor based on bad history , " and thereafter advocated that " the framers of the Constitution intended merely to forbid the establishment of an official state religion , as exists in England . "
Obviously he was unfamiliar with Benjamin Franklin and Ben 's part in writing the Constitution for the United States .
But then again , Willy Rehnquist seems unfamiliar with the Constitution itself and the liberties which it advocates .
This constitutional familiarity can be a common problem as the former Attorney General of the United States , failed Senator John Ashcroft , ignored the basis on which is oath of office was made , and routinely mixed " law and gospel " " under color of law " on a regular and unfortunately consistent basis .
It is precisely these people and others like them which Benjamin Franklin would quite possibly consider to be mortal enemies .
They are certainly mortal enemies of freedom loving Americans , and their continuing presence constitutes just one of the Perils of Democracy .
Benjamin Franklin's most relevant quote for the current age was also what became " an American rallying cry back in the early days of the Republic : ' Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety ' . " [ 1 ]
The current morass of the USA ( anti ) Patriot Act and the infliction upon America of the Homeland InSecurity Department makes this question of liberty and security the most important issue in the United States and the world today .
It is John Ashcroft and his co-conspirators which are most likely the moral enemies of liberty , security , and most anything worthwhile .
On the other side of the coin , however , Ben 's " Aversion to Tyranny " makes him someone worthy of emulation , especially in the current State of the Union .
2 -- Franklin early on decided that the surest guard against tyranny was free expression -- including specifically the free flow of ideas and a free press .
According to him " No tyrannical society can long exist when it cannot control the flow of information . "
One wonders what he would have thought of the Inter Net , and today 's damming [ pardon the pun ] Media .
[ No flow of information , get it ? ]
The free wheeling Inter Net might easily have delighted Benjamin Franklin .
Certainly , he was not one to shy away from offending anyone , and believed that " when Truth and Error have fair play , the former is always an overmatch for the latter . " [ 1 ]
He might have been concerned , however , at the constant barrage of worms , hackers , computer viruses -- and the inevitable knee - jerk reaction of control freaks to limit the Inter Net .
He would probably suspect that within the " security needs of cyberspace " lie the seeds of liberty - denying shrubs .
[ pardon the pun ... think about it !]
As Isaacson notes , " America 's democracy learned that it could thrive in an atmosphere of unrestrained , even intemperate , free expression .
Indeed , its democracy was built on a foundation of unbridled free speech .
In the centuries since then , the nations that have thrived , economically and politically , have been those , like America , that are most comfortable with the cacophony , and even occasional messiness , that comes from robust discourse . "
That pretty well describes the Inter Net , and its true greatness .
Ben would have liked it .
3 -- Franklin also led the way for such descendants as Mark Twain and Will Rogers with a wry and self - deprecating homespun character .
Quotes such as , " I have likewise a natural inclination to observe and reprove the faults of others , at which I have an excellent faculty " , is a style wholly within the Art of Writing unto itself .
Humor ( and / or laughter ) is the essence of wisdom .
It 's also an essential ingredient in the babe magnet thing .
A sense of humor displays to all that the possessor maintains a delightful confidence in the past , present and future ; and inasmuch as confidence is one of the most attractive of all interpersonal attributes , it follows that humor is the most necessary of all attributes .
It also follows that the terribly serious and concerned folk are about as attractive as a rogue T - Rex in heat on a bad - hair day .
Franklin 's observation , " Early to bed , early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise , " may not sound terribly humorous , but it did motivate Groucho Marx to reply that the statement was a lot of hoopla .
" Most wealthy people I know like to sleep late , and will fire the help if they are disturbed before three in the afternoon . "
Now , that 's funny !
4 -- Humility is a tough road to hoe , particularly when one is so incredibly brilliant , witty , handsome , and genteel .
[ BTW , arrogance is the illusion of being superior .
If one really is superior , then it 's not arrogance . ]
Franklin considered humility to be something worth acquiring , even if only a life long attempt in his case .
" Even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it [ pride ] , I would probably be proud of my humility . " [ 1 ]
Obviously , this is a good example of humor and humility , in that admitting to it displays a degree of humility .
But this is also one which Benjamin could not claim personally , as he would then be proud of the statement .
[ This humility is really a multi- edged sword .
There 's really no escaping it !]
On the other hand , Franklin noted [ 1 ] , " People will eventually give you the credit ... if you do n't try to claim it at the time .
' The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid ' . "
5 --
It has been said ( by historian Bernard Bailyn ) that , " America 's great historical moments have occurred when realism and idealism have been combined , and no one knew this better than Franklin . " [ 1 ]
Franklin employed this understanding as the official American envoy to Paris during the Revolutionary War .
He both courted the cold calculating French Foreign Minister with crass mercantile interests , and appealed to the idealism of the French public in the potential brilliance of America and its goal of providing an alternative to tyranny the world over .
This tactic of combining realism and idealism is fairly common -- including the idea of going to war with Iraq in order to free the people from tyranny ( idealism ) , but also to obtain exclusive access to a whole lot of oil ( realism ) !
The difference , however , between the current state of the world and Franklin's was that Franklin was able to pull it off with a degree of credibility .
No one believes the democracy argument with respect to Iraq , if only because of the serious lack of credibility of those making the argument .
The curious part is that for anything to work in any age , there must be a compromise between realism and idealism -- and thus the sixth virtue .
6 -- Compromise .
" For Franklin , who personally believed in proportional representation , compromise was not only a practical approach but a moral one .
Tolerance , humility and a respect for others required it .
The near perfect document [ the Constitution ] that arose from his compromise [ to include both representation on the basis of population and statehood ] could not have been approved if the hall had contained only crusaders who stood on unwavering principle .
Compromisers may not make great heroes , but they do make great democracies . " [ 1 ] [ emphasis added ] ( 6/20/05 ) Franklin , while working with Jefferson and Adams on the Declaration of Independence , rewrote Jefferson 's phrase " We hold these turths to be sacred and undeniable ... " as " We hold these truths to be self - evident . "
Walter Isaacson [ 4 ] wrote : " Our rights derive from nature and are secured ' by the consent of the governed ' , Franklin felt , not by the dictates or dogmas of any particular religion . "
But with Adams input , Franklin was willing to compromise and accept , " that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights . "
Tolerance , humility and respect for others ...
There is implied in this phrase the idea that perhaps , just perhaps , one does not know everything or that one is not singularly blessed with divine guidance in all things .
[ Obviously , if I 'm right all the time , then everyone else must be wrong , at least part of the time ! ]
It is thus compromise on the basis of tolerance for other 's opinions that lead us to ... 7 -- Tolerance .
Isaacson [ 1 ] makes the statement : " The great struggle of the 21st century will be between the forces of fanatic fundamentalism and those of tolerance . "
Not quite .
The greatest struggles -- at least those with the greatest sound and fury ( and probably signifying nothing ) -- will be those between different sects of fanatic fundamentalism .
The lynch pin in such conflicts will be the compromising forces of tolerance .
The dramas on the world stage currently are in reality between the fanatic fundamentalisms of Shiite and Sunni Muslims , Orthodox Jewry , Christian - at - whatever - cost administrations , and all those who would misuse religion in order to control , manipulate , and deceive any and everyone else .
When one realizes that the basis of the problems in the breakup of Yugoslavia into Bosnia , et al , was the centuries old conflict of Muslims and Christians of different sects , remembrances of battles hundreds of years prior , and the use of religion as a wedge so one person could steal another person 's land .
One can readily see that it is not quite enough to solve problems by waiting patiently until the current generation croaks .
Sometimes , the religious bigotry lives on , and thus , it is essential to preach tolerance .
As Franklin has said , " I think vital religion has always suffered when orthodoxy is more regarded than virtue . "
The relevant factor is that all major religions have within their purview a Golden Rule in which it is delineated that one should do unto others what one would like others to do unto them -- or words to that effect .
Tolerance , therefore , sees the fundamental connecting links between religions , while orthodoxy sees only the elaborate rules which attempt to distinguish one sect from another .
8 -- Babes .
One of Franklin 's favorite lines was , " If you ladies have any questions , the answer is ' yes ' . " [ 2 ]
Willingness is the mother of invention .
Or something like that .
But if a " paunchy , balding , bifocaled septuagenarian managed to get French ladies in a flutter , " [ 3 ] , then you have to sit up and take notice of his advice .
Keep in mind that many of the women who surrounded Benjamin , were young , attractive , and intelligent .
If the only one of these three assets Franklin could claim was intelligence , then his sage advice is worth heeding .
It should be note , in addition that Franklin did master the " amorous friendship " of intimacy expressed in teasing kisses , tender embraces , intimate conversations , flowing love letters , and a hesitation toward sexual congress .
Any such a talent can carry someone a long ways .
There is the hint of a man who truly appreciated and respected women -- an attribute which can be very attractive to any female .
It is admittedly short of Sacred Orgasm , but it 's based on the same principle .
9 -- Then there 's " 1776 " , the musical .
See it .
No kidding .
It 's Benjamin at his best .

Newsflash : The Sun is Causing Global Warming
There is a radical new global warming theory that you can read about in this article .
“ We are fairly sure that what ’s causing the warming are changes in the sun , ” he said .
“ These are very subtle changes that are very difficult to observe .
The sun is really a quite variable star . ”
That ’s right , the SUN IS CAUSING THE EARTH TO WARM .
Stop the presses , hold everything , I never thought of that before .
That little ball of light and HEAT could actually be heating the earth ?
This group can kiss their federal grants goodbye for coming up with such a radical , out of the mainstream theory such as this .
They also claim the models that predict our impending doom are flawed .
Singer said the reason why the models “ overestimate the effectiveness of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is that the models ignore what are called negative feedbacks which occur in the atmosphere , such as clouds , which reduce the effect of the greenhouse gases . ”
“ Their models just do n’t consider them properly , ” he said .
Al Gore , and the like , conveniently forget to include cloud cover in their models .
Cloud cover helps cool the earth and as such is inconvenient for the global warming alarmists .
“ We have to remember that the climate has always been changing ever since we have records , and we have geologic records going back millions and millions of years .
We know that there have been huge climate changes on the earth long before human beings actually came into existence .
Now while I find the fact that a research group has determined the sun , of all things , is responsible for global warming welcoming , I do have one question to ask .
How much did this cost the taxpayers ?
After all this money was spent we learned two things , that the sun heats the earth and that clouds cool the earth .
Let me repeat my question , this cost us how much ?
I learned this in second grade , and we need researchers to tell us this ?
1 .
Let ’s think about the future for a second .
You probably do n’t understand the kids that make up the bulk of our audience , but I do .
I call them the network MySpace remix 3.0 social generation .
Unlike any other people before them , young people today like to interact with each other .
They also like music .
YouTube is the perfect example of whatever point it is I ’m making .
Everything should be online and customizable .
2 .
Iteration is the key .
Everything is about iteration .
How many times can I use iteration in this talk ?
Iteration , iteration , iteration .
This is how you make good games : by iterating .
The more you iterate , it does n’t matter what direction you ’re going in or what you actually do , as long as you get the number of iterations up .
This process ( iteration ) is what turns all the bad stuff into the good stuff .
Here ’s a graph showing game quality and number of iterations approaching infinity together .
This graph proves my point .
3 .
For our last project we used Scrum , and boy , are we glad we did .
There is no way anything we did would have been possible without it .
What is Scrum , you ask ?
It ’s a set of new terminology for things that already happen when groups of people work together .
For example , instead of a “ meeting , ” you have a “ Scrum , ” and so on .
You should use Scrum too , since it will solve all your problems .
If I ’ve piqued your interest , sign - up sheets for my specially discounted seminars on Scrum can be found clipped to the bottom of your conference program .
4 .
The game we made was great – because we ’re great .
We are just a group of awesome people .
We never crunch , and we go to the beach every other Friday to play volleyball .
Even those times when we did crunch , we had delicious catered meals .
And there was one time we got a masseuse in the office .
Awesome .
Yes , our studio ’s amazing array of perks and benefits keep us happy and doing our best work all the time .
We have a ton of open positions we need to fill very quickly so please send us your resume as soon as you can .
5 .
The game industry is in trouble .
We ca n’t keep doing what we ’ve been doing before .
We need to do this other thing , which is the thing that I ’m doing .
I said this last year but none of you came with me .
Well , this time I really mean it .
WASHINGTON  Senator John McCain ’s campaign advisers will ask the White House to deploy President Bush for major Republican fund - raising , but they do not want the president to appear too often at his side , top aides to Mr. McCain said Sunday .
After a weekend of strategy meetings at Mr. McCain ’s Arizona ranch  in a sense , the first Sedona summit of the Republican Party ’s new leadership  the advisers said that much remains undecided about coordinating the campaign with the White House and the party apparatus until Mr. McCain wins enough delegates to be the official nominee .
But even as the consensus was that Mr. McCain needed to “ stand in the sun ” on his own , as one adviser put it , without the large shadow cast by Mr. Bush , left unsaid was the difficult calculus the McCain campaign faces : Using Mr. Bush enough to try to make the tough sell of Mr. McCain to conservatives but not so much that he will drive away the independents and some moderate Democrats that Mr. McCain is counting on in November .
Democrats , meanwhile , have been using every opportunity to link Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush , even defining Mr. McCain ’s candidacy as part of a “ Bush - McCain ” ticket that they say will essentially give the president another term .
In Japan , there ’s an aquarium with an electric eel in it .
And the eel ’s electrical power is being used to energize the lights on a Christmas tree .
It ’s clean energy right ?
Each time the electric eel at the Aqua Toto Gifu aquarium touches a copper wire in its tank , it sends power that lights up globes decking a Christmas tree .
Officials expect the “ eel Christmas tree ” to be a popular attraction for dating couples in the lead - up to Christmas Day , when the tree will be removed .
There ’s no word on whether the electric eel feels unduly drained by the whole scenario .
Electric eels are capable of generating electricity in their bodies .
They have notoriously poor eyesight and use electric shocks to stun prey so they can catch and eat them .

The allegation was made by General Gianadelio Maletti , a former head of military counter - intelligence , at the trial last week of rightwing extremists accused of killing 16 people in the bombing of a Milan bank in 1969 - the first time such a charge has been made in a court of law by a senior Italian intelligence figure .
Gen Maletti , comannder of the counter - intelligence section of the military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975 , said his men had discovered that a rightwing terrorist cell in the Venice region had been supplied with military explosives from Germany .
Those explosives may have been obtained with the help of members of the US intelligence community , an indication that the Americans had gone beyond the infiltration and monitoring of extremist groups to instigating acts of violence , he said .
" The CIA [ Central Intelligence Agency ] , following the directives of its government , wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and , for this purpose , it may have made use of rightwing terrorism , " Gen Maletti told the Milan court .
" I believe this is what happened in other countries as well . "
The general has been living in South Africa for the last 21 years as a fugitive from Italian justice .
He has been sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for leaking a secret service document to the press and last year received a 15 - year sentence for obstructing justice .
He was granted a special 15 - day immunity from arrest to enable him to give evidence at the trial for the bombing of a bank in Milan 's Piazza Fontana , the atrocity that inaugurated the " strategy of tension " , a series of bombings intended to shift the country 's political centre of gravity to the right .
" The impression was that the Americans would do anything to stop Italy from sliding to the left , " Gen Maletti said during an interview at his Milan hotel .
" Do n't forget that [ former US president Richard ]
Nixon was in charge and Nixon was a strange man , a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives . "
The CIA supported SID , the Italian defence intelligence service , financially , but Gen Maletti's US counterparts were rarely willing to share information .
There may have been good reason for the American caginess .
In a posthumous memoir published last year , the wartime resistance hero Count Edgardo Sogno described how he visited the CIA station chief in Rome in July 1974 to inform him of his plans for an anti-communist coup .
" I told him that I was informing him as an ally in the struggle for the freedom of the west and asked him what the attitude of the American government would be , " Mr Sogno wrote .
" He answered what I already knew : the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government . "
Despite contacts with his CIA counterparts , no word of the Sogno plot was uttered .
" I , for one , did n't know about the Sogno thing .
I knew Mr Sogno was being investigated by a Turin magistrate but I did n't know he had such important contacts with US agencies in the United States and Italy , " Gen Maletti said .
" Clearly , Sogno had great confidence in the complicity of the American service . "
The lucid 79 - year - old general , whose English is almost perfect , has spent his retirement in South Africa painting and writing his memoirs , which are due to be published soon .
He admits to feeling nostalgic for his homeland .
But the judges who convicted him in absentia last year were far from convinced of his gentlemanly qualities .
In their written verdict they said he had obstructed an investigation into a 1973 attack on the interior minister by withholding crucial information from the magistrates .
Four members of the public were killed and 45 injured when an anarchist , Gianfranco Bertoli , hurled a grenade into a crowd outside police headquarters in Milan .
Bertoli , according to the judges , was really a man of right - wing sympathies and a long - standing SID informant , codenamed Negro .
Gen Maletti's men were warned in advance of the attack on the minister , Mariano Rumor , but took no action to prevent it and failed to pass on their information on Bertoli even after the killings .
Gen Maletti's role at the heart of the complex intrigues makes him an illuminating witness .
Italy must clarify the mysteries of that time if it is to recover its national dignity and sovereignty , he said .
" Among the larger western European countries , Italy has been dealt with as a sort of protectorate .
I am ashamed to think that we are still subject to special supervision . "

Internet service provider Tele2 has been ordered to block access to The Pirate Bay by a Danish court , after a civil lawsuit brought by the IFPI .
Not to be outplayed , The Pirate Bay has launched a new workaround at www.jesperbay.org, named after the IFPI head .
TorrentFreak is reporting " The Pirate Bay team is also asking fellow BitTorrent admins to help out , by redirecting all customers from Tele2 , to The Jesper Bay .
They have written a piece of code that will redirect all the users from Tele2 to The Jesper Bay , so they can change their DNS . "
Welcome to the back and forth battle that is now emerging between The Pirate Bay , its community , and the music industry .
This is coming from the recent announcement that the operators of The Pirate Bay ( Carl Lundstrom , Peter Sunde , Frederik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm Warg ) were participating in copyright infringement , with charges brought saying that they were " promoting other people 's infringements of copyright laws . "
The IFPI expects that other ISPs will follow along with the block , but Reuters is saying that " Other large Danish Internet service providers said they would not immediately follow the order . "
A perennial question that comes up this time of the year is the question of how Christmas should be celebrated in public places , with a significant amount of anger and heated accusations being traded between proponents and opponents of the idea .
The Argument For
Christmas is a major part of American culture , especially since it was heavily commercialized in the late nineteenth century by nascent department stores and mail order businesses .
Since the majority of the citizenry in nearly every polity on the local , state and federal levels that make up the United States are self - described Christians , governments universally make concessions to their holy day by refusing to conduct public business on or around that day .
In order to maintain vital services , fire - fighters and police - men are paid bonuses for working on that day .
Since governments are already marking this Christian holy day , since they are spending extra public monies for it , so why not go the extra step ?
After all , Christmas is a cheerful celebration marking birth and life , and God knows generally when the state shuts down business to mark an anniversary , it usually is about death ; the day a war started or ended , or the day some war - maker was born or something .
Argument Against #
1
Of course , a substantial minority of Christians do n’t celebrate Christmas as it actually has little to do with Christianity itself .
Jesus was not born anywhere near the Winter Solstice .
The earliest recorded celebration of Christmas on or about the winter solstice as a Christian holiday occurred in Egypt .
Their worship of the holiday bears a strong resemblance to the celebration of the resurrection of Osiris , which were also celebrated on the winter solstice .
It is very clear that the leaders of the late Roman Empire folded the popular festival of Saturnalia into the new imperial Christian religion .
Much like Jews making a big deal about Hanukkah , and black Americans celebrating Kwanzaa , it is clear that the early Christians made up the holiday to basically have an excuse to participate in the holidays of the non-Christian cultures they were embedded within .
The Christians who do n’t celebrate Christmas and view its observance as a heresy , are quite understandably upset to see it promoted anywhere .
This would have included many of the colonists in new England .
As frequent Reason Hit and Run commenter joe observed :
Here is Massachusetts , they had a fight a few years ago about whether the Town of Lexington should be paying to put a nativity scene on the town common .
One of the arguments often made was , “ What would the Minutemen say if they found out we could n’t have a nativity scene for Christmas ? ”
The desired answer was , they would be aghast at the hostility of the government towards Christianity .
The correct answer was , they would be aghast at such a blatant display of papist idolatry , and smash it to bits with the butts of their muskets .
Why should people be forced to pay for blasphemy ?
Argument Against # 2
Some people pay taxes but do n’t like to see the money spent on things that they do n’t like , including Christmas celebrations .
The reason they do n’t approve is immaterial , perhaps they are not Christian , perhaps they are but think that Christmas should be a private matter .
These folks are , of course , aghast at the misuse of money .
It is one thing to compel people to pay for a good like fire - prevention .
It is another to force people to pay for something frivolous like a manger scene .
They want their tax money spent on other things , perhaps ensuring that children have adequate health care or for more policemen or better radios for firefighters .
If they were in charge the public monies would go to those things and not be frittered away on displays .
Argument Against # 3
Of course , a significant number of people are n’t Christian , yet they too have their own ways of celebrating the Winter Solstice .
Why should n’t they have their traditions celebrated as well ?
Where should one draw the line ?
At having the 49 % of the population who are non-believers subsidize to 51 % who are ?
25 %? 5 % ?
Again , why should a man be forced to pay for another religion ’s celebrations ?
Christmas at Disney - world : Where ’s the Controversy ?
“ Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention ? ” [ asked Inspector Gregory ]
“ To the curious incident of the dog in the night - time . ” [ answered Holmes ]
“ The dog did nothing in the night - time . ”
“ That was the curious incident , ” remarked Sherlock Holmes .
Every year , Disney - world has a massive extravaganza in celebration of Christmas .
This celebration elicits little or no controversy .
People do n’t file lawsuits or get in shouting matches over their choices of how to celebrate the holiday .
Why is that ?
It ’s not that a single individual or sect owns the property .
Disney ’s board of directors answer to the shareholders , and there are millions of shareholders who own Disney , more than the thousands of voting taxpayers living in Lexington , MA .
Surely there must be atheists , Jews , or people opposed to ostentatious displays of Christmas cheer in their ranks .
Why do these millions not get angry while a mere ten thousand or so get into shouting matches ?
The answer lies in the fact that people who are unhappy with Disney ’s decision are free to end their involvement with the company .
They can sell their shares .
They can refuse to give their custom to Disney - world .
But when it comes to government , people are denied that freedom .
In his wonderful 15 + hour Commentaries , Robert LeFevre recounts the story of an exchange he had with a town commissioner .
At the time , he was a newspaperman , and he was asked to publish an announcement on behalf of the town government to the effect that a local park would be closed to public access on a certain night .
The commissioner explained that they had invited a youth group from a neighboring town to have a party of some kind in the park .
LeFevre , apparently feeling a little mischievous , challenged the commissioner and asked him by what right he could make such a decision .
The commissioner explained that he had been appointed by the townspeople who collectively owned the park .
“ Aha ” LeFevre said , “ you see , I know something about the guests you have invited , and they are rough customers . ”
He told the commissioner that he feared the guests would damage the park , and as an owner he would be on the hook for repairs .
Since he thought his ownership share in the park was about to become a liability , he told the commissioner that he would like to sell his share .
The commissioner , of course was apoplectic at the idea ; “ you ca n’t sell your share ! ” he cried .
Regardless or Robert LeFevre ’s concerns , he was a prisoner .
So long as he lived within the commissioner ’s zone of control , he was yoked to the wagon of state , compelled to go where the commissioner directed it , and forced to yield his back to the commissioner ’s whip .
As LeFevre predicted , the guests caused a significant amount of damage to the park .
The damage was repaired at cost to the taxpayers .
Government Action Inevitably Causes Conflict
By forcing people to bear the costs of government , government officials are setting people at each other ’s throats .
Rather than being a force for peace and civilization , the government becomes a divisive entity , weakening the bonds of fellowship .
People who otherwise would get along and have good relations with each other find themselves driven into conflict .
If the fans of Christmas really which to honor the Prince of Peace , they should eschew government - funded displays in favor of privately funded ones .
Otherwise they are nudging society in a more conflict - prone , violent direction .

Numbers for the 2007 -2008 season are available here
For the third straight year Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid topped the list of richest soccer clubs in the world .
Three teams from the Premier League made the top five in Manchester United , Chelsea , and Arsenal , while another Spanish League team Barcelona is the other club in the top 5 .
The list is for the money generated but does not include transfer fees .
Dan Jones the partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte , the group that compiled the list , stated , “ This is the first time that any country has had three clubs in the top five of the Money League .
Arsenal ’s move to the Emirates Stadium has transformed their revenues whilst Chelsea ’s revenue increase sees them return to the top five . ”
In 2006 - 2007 Real Madrid and Manchester United became the only clubs to ever generate in excess of 300 million Euros in a single season .
Real Madrid generated 351 million Euros while Manchester United generated 315 million Euros .
The rise in the Premier League revenues is due to the new television deals that are now available online for the 2007 - 2008 season .
Jones stated , “ With the new Premier League television deals now online for the 2007/08 season , Manchester United have the opportunity to significantly close the gap on Real and a successful Champions League run may even see them challenge again for the number one position . ”
The top 20 revenue generating clubs increased by 11 % to 3.7 billion Euros in the 2006 - 2007 season , which is the largest increase since the 2002 - 2003 season .
All of the soccer clubs in the top 20 are in Europe with 6 teams in the Premier League , 4 in the Bundesliga ( German league ) , 3 in Italian League A , 3 in La Liga ( Spanish league ) , two in the French league , and one in the Scottish league .
Here is the list of the top 20 revenue generating teams in the 2006 - 2007 season and how much money , in Euros , the team generated in millions of Euros and Dollars .

TRENTON , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
The man who raped and killed 7 - year - old Megan Kanka -- the 1994 crime that inspired " Megan 's Law " -- is one of eight men whose sentences were commuted to life in prison this week as part of New Jersey 's new ban on execution .
Megan Kanka 's killer , Jesse Timmendequas , is among eight men whose sentences were commuted to life .
The Garden State on Monday became the first state in more than three decades to abolish the death penalty after a commission ruled the punishment is " inconsistent with evolving standards of decency . "
Gov. Jon Corzine the day before commuted the sentences of eight men sitting on the state 's death row .
They will now serve life in prison without parole , according to the governor 's office .
Among the eight is Jesse Timmendequas , 46 , who was sentenced to death in June 1997 for Megan 's murder .
Prosecutors said Timmendequas lured Megan to his home by saying he wanted to show her a puppy .
He then raped her , beat her and strangled her with a belt .
A day later , he led police to her body .
" Megan 's Law , " introduced after her death , requires that authorities notify neighbors when a sex offender moves into an area .
Timmendequas had twice been convicted of sex crimes -- on 5 - and 7 - year - olds -- before he murdered Megan .
In signing Monday 's bill , Corzine called it a " momentous day " and made New Jersey the first state to ban capital punishment since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976 .
Do n't Miss Lawmakers vote to abolish death penalty
" It 's a day of progress for the state of New Jersey and for the millions of people across our nation and around the globe who reject the death penalty as a moral or practical response to the grievous , even heinous , crime of murder , " Corzine said .
Society is not forgiving criminals , the Democratic governor insisted , but the law is necessary because " government cannot provide a fool - proof death penalty that precludes the possibility of executing the innocent . "
Watch Corzine sign the document »
" Society must ask , " he continued , " is it not morally superior to imprison 100 people for life than it is to execute all 100 when it's probable we execute an innocent ? "
The state Assembly approved the measure Thursday by a 44 - 36 vote after the Senate OK'd it 21 - 16 .
New Jersey has not executed a prisoner since 1963 .
The new legislation replaces the death penalty with life in prison without parole .
The bill was introduced in November after a state commission concluded capital punishment was an ineffective deterrent to crime .
Since the Supreme Court 's reinstatement of the death penalty , almost 1,100 people have been executed in 37 states .

According to the Death Penalty Information Center , which opposes capital punishment , New Jersey joins 13 states and the District of Columbia that do not use execution as a means of punishment .

I never got the whole Guitar Hero , Rock Band and their fake guitars playing thingie , which require so much practice to master that you may as well use a real guitar to become as good as Satriani .
That 's why I love the idea of Guitar Rising , which can use any real electric guitar , from a Fender Telecaster to a Gibson Les Paul .
The software teaches you how to play actual songs , tracking your accuracy much like Guitar Hero would do , as their demo video shows .

According to GameTank 's CEO Jake Parks , the connection to the guitar would either work " via a guitar - USB adapter , a microphone , or directly to the sound card . "
He told us that they are planning to release for both Mac and PC .
The cool thing about Guitar Rising is that it is n't a simple videogame , but combines the fun of playing and beating scores to actually teach you how to play the real thing .
While they " are in the process of licensing popular rock songs , and we 'll announce them on our website as soon as we finalize the deals , " there will be different songs for different levels of difficulty to ease the learning curve , as well as different speed settings , so you can start slow and progress until you master the song at real speed .
In fact , they say that the song selection will include stuff easy for beginners but also songs challenging for experienced players .

In other words , you will actually learn to play guitar and try to be a Keith Richards - wannabe rather than just pretending to be Jeff Vader pretending to be Keith Richards .
If you want to give it a try , they will be at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco to visit us in the OMPR / IBM Pavilion , booth 6241 .

DARPA 's brain - on - a- chip project ( cleverly titled SyNAPSE , or Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics ) sounds straight out of Cyberdyne 's portfolio :
They want to " develop a brain inspired electronic ' chip ' that mimics that function , size , and power consumption of a biological cortex . "
That whole neuromorphic adaptive business sounds a whole lot like the T - 800's neural net processor , do n't it ?
Here 's the scary manifesto that puts us on the path to Judgment Day .
As compared to biological systems , today 's intelligent machines are less efficient by a factor of one million to one billion in real world , complex environments .
The key to achieving the vision of the SyNAPSE program will be an unprecedented multidisciplinary approach that coordinates aggressive technology development in the following technical areas : 1 ) Hardware ; 2 ) Architecture ; 3 ) Simulation ; and 4 ) Environment .
Hardware includes neuromorphic electronics with novel , high density , plastic , synaptic components ; Architecture includes neuromorphic design from microcircuits to complete system ; Simulation includes large - scale digital simulation of neuromorphic circuits and functional neuromorphic systems ; and Environment includes virtual training , testing and benchmarking for neuromorphic systems .

Desalination plants use reverse osmosis to turn salty water into fresh .
John Zoiner / Workbook Stock / Getty Images
Do n't feel stupid if you 've ever seen a news story about a terrible drought , then turned to your computer to see your pretty ocean beach screensaver and thought , " Why do n't they just use that ? "
Of course , within a moment , you probably made a few points to yourself .
One , the sea is salty .
Two , salty water is n't so great for drinking or growing plants .
Three , you can't just take the salt out of water , just like you could n't dissolve the sugar out of your tea .
Or can you ?

Reverse osmosis is one of the processes that makes desalination ( or removing salt from seawater ) possible .
Beyond that , reverse osmosis is used for recycling , wastewater treatment , and can even produce energy .
Water issues have become an extremely pressing global threat .
With climate change come unprecedented environmental impacts : torrential flooding in some areas , droughts in others , rising and falling sea levels .
Add to that the threat of overpopulation -- and the demand and pollution a swelling population brings -- and water becomes one of the paramount environmental issues to watch for in the next generation .
Water treatment plants and systems are now adapting reverse osmosis to address some of these concerns .
In Perth , Australia ( notably dry and arid , yet surrounded by sea ) , nearly 17 percent of the area 's drinking water is desalinated sea water that comes from a reverse osmosis plant [ source : The Economist ] .
Worldwide , there are now over 13,000 desalination plants in the world , according to the International Desalination Association .
But while knowing that reverse osmosis can convert seawater to drinking water is useful , what we really need to understand is how the heck the process occurs .
Assuming that you have a fairly good grasp on the definition of " reverse , " we better start by taking a look at how osmosis works before we put the two together .
Let 's learn about osmosis by filtering through to the next page .
There have been few indie gaming success stories as big as Dwarf Fortress , an ASCII freeware simulation game in which the player helps to establish and govern a colony of dwarves , as they construct a Moria of their own .
The scope of the game defies belief : it contains an extensive world generator , a three - dimensional cellular automata system for simulating fluids , naming languages for all major races , an economics simulation , and even a complete Adventure Mode in which the player can explore abandoned fortresses .
It 's so detailed that large web communities have sprung up around the game , both on the developer 's forums and Something Awful , where players trade stories about what happened in their games .
Some of these stories have even become popular outside the game 's community .
Amazingly for a game as rich as Dwarf Fortress , it remains the work of just te wo people , programmer Tarn " Toady One " Adams and his brother Zach .
Tarn supports himself primarily with donations from Dwarf Fortress enthusiasts .
In this interview , Tarn talks about the inspiration and origins of the game , and some of the finer points of its construction .
This interview was originally held over a private IRC conversation , and edited into a more traditional interview format .
Games Leading Up To Dwarf Fortress
Why do n't we start with what gave you the inspiration to create Dwarf Fortress ?
Tarn Adams :
It 's really the joining of two different tracks of development .
The first has to do with our ( my brother Zach Adams and I ) " fantasy game . "
Way back when , like , when I was in elementary school , fifth grade or so , I wrote a BASIC game called dragslay .
That was just a D&D game , more or less , with text that scrolled up from the bottom of the screen .
You mean Infocom - style ?
TA : Pretty much , yeah .
But it did n't even have a map .
Just a line through 8 or 10 encounters , then a dragon fight , then repeat .
It was very basic , but it was our first project .
Our first fantasy project , rather .
We had a ton of other space / samurai / etc .
things going on , all BASIC , all very small , so we did n't do so much with it .
Then in the summer of my freshman year in high school , I picked up C and dragslay was revisited .
So I was able to make a larger project .
Dragslay was sort of horrifying .
You could kill an enemy and then be attacked by maggots from the corpse at random .
Wounds could fester as well then you 'd catch diseases .
In any case , yeah , this time it got a basic world map , and you could depopulate goblin tribes in the wilderness as you searched for dragons .
Along with several other projects , we worked on that until , say , my sophomore year of college .
So the game kept track of goblin populations ?
TA : Yeah , it was one of my first save / load experiences outside of score lists .
It kept track of their names and kills and they could yell at you like the enemies do in Dwarf Fortress .
It was really quite far along , farther along than DF adventure mode in some respects .
By yell at you , I mean it would track which players they had killed then they 'd proceed to make fun of you .
They also stacked their skulls outside the caves .

It is most unlikely that git or Mercurial will be GNU packages .
Thus , unless
Bzr is unsuitable , we should use Bzr .
We 've seen enough to know that each has its advantages but all are workable .
So we should use Bzr .
And if there are aspects of it which prove inconvenient , we can ask the Maintainer of Bzr to improve them .

Threatened by ' Operation Planetary Calm ' Germany Will Continue to Watch Scientologists

Vater werden ist ja bekanntlich viel leichter als Vater sein , und also war man um halb sieben aufgestanden und saß um halb acht am Küchentisch einem Siebenjährigen im Schlafanzug gegenüber , der eigentlich längst im Bad hätte sein müssen , sich aber lieber die Serviette um den Kopf hielt und sang : „ Ich bin ein Islam ! “
Vater sein in der heutigen Zeit bedeutet ja , immer die Übersicht zu behalten , und also mahnte ich den Sohnemann , dass es , wenn schon , „ Ich bin ein Muslim ! “ heißen müsse , was aber Quatsch sei , weil nur Musliminnen Kopftuch tragen , und dass ich jedenfalls empfehlen würde , in der Schule auf die Vorführung mit der Serviette zu verzichten .
Der Sohn sagte , in der Schule seien die Servietten ohnehin zu klein , und damit war das Thema durch .

Rufen aufgebrachte Eltern den Trainer an und fordern , das Training zu intensivieren ; allerdings ( und wenig überraschend ) nicht die bildungsfernen , die vielleicht glauben , ihre Kinder würden um eine Zukunft im Leistungssport betrogen , sondern die sog .
Leistungsträger und Vorstadtidiotinnen , die so fest vertäut sind in der Welt , wie sie Christian Lindner für die beste aller möglichen hält , dass es gar nichts macht , wenn mir dazu nichts mehr einfällt :
Es wäre sinnvoller , mit einer Wand zu reden , als mit dieser Kaputtheit , die die Kaputtheit der Welt dann auch in der Höhe erklärt .
„ Nehmen Sie die Menschen , wie sie sind , andere gibt ’s nicht . “
Adenauer , o.J .
Aber reden ist womöglich sowieso zu nichts mehr nütze .
Ich widerspreche Dietmar Dath äußerst ungern , aber dass man mit den Leuten reden müsste , um sie vom ( oder wenigstens : irgendeinem ) Sozialismus zu überzeugen : dazu fehlen schlicht die Leute .
Wo ich wohne , heißen die Kinder so , dass man nicht im Irrtum darüber sein kann , wo sie wohnen , und sie tragen , als F - Jugendliche , die sich morgens vielleicht Servietten um den Kopf binden , die gleichen Marken - Sneaker wie die Eltern .
Es gab ja mal so was wie „ No Logo “ , aber das muss tausend , ach was : eine Million Jahre her sein .
Kann sein , dass sich die Eltern von Janne und Eduard für allerhand interessieren und in der Schlange vorm hippen Bio-Eisladen ( was ihn hip macht , ist die Schlange ) auch drüber reden , Geflüchteten helfen und so ; aber dass die Schule für alle im selben Viertel ist , in dem der Eisladen nicht für alle ist , etwa die mit dem Kopftuch , und dass neben der Schlange vom Eisladen die 300 - PS - Dienstaudis parken , die man nicht kriegt , wenn man als Kind nicht ordentlich trainiert hat , das gehört vermutlich so , wg .
Individualität , und so sehen sie dann auch aus , und ihre Kinder , geht ’s nach ihnen , eben auch .
Man möchte , bei Allah , in die Serviette kriechen .
US “ enemy combatant ” Jose Padilla sentenced to 17 years in prison
By Jerry White
23 January 2008
Jose Padilla — the US citizen held for years in isolation as an “ enemy combatant ” and tortured in a South Carolina military brig — was sentenced to 17 years and four months Tuesday by a federal judge in Miami , after being convicted on terrorism conspiracy charges last August .
Two co-defendants , Adham Amin Hassoun , a 45 - year - old computer programmer of Palestinian descent , and Kifah Wael Jayyousi , 46 , an engineer and school administrator originally from Jordan , were sentenced to 15 years and eight months and 12 years and eight months , respectively .
The imprisonment of Padilla is the culmination of a years - long campaign by the Bush administration to use his persecution as a test case for the dismantling of constitutional and democratic rights under aegis of the so - called war on terror .
Padilla was arrested without charges by federal agents on May 8 , 2002 at Chicago ’s O’Hare International Airport .
A month later , then - Attorney General John Ashcroft declared in a nationally televised press conference , “ We have captured a known terrorist who was exploring a plan to build and explode a radiological dispersion device , or ‘ dirty bomb , ’ in the United States . ”
Based on this charge Padilla , who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Chicago , was declared an “ enemy combatant ” — a category that , according to the Bush administration , denied him any protection under either the US Constitution or the Geneva Conventions .
He was transferred to military custody where he remained held without charges , trial or right to an attorney for three - and - a - half years .
In June 2004 , the Justice Department claimed Padilla had made a full confession ; however , officials said that the alleged information would not be accepted in an American courtroom because of the third - degree methods employed in the interrogation .
Following a number of court rulings rejecting the administration ’s insistence that Padilla could be held without being charged and without access to legal counsel , the government transferred Padilla to a civilian jail in November 2005 , in order to avoid a Supreme Court hearing on a challenge to his detention .
New charges were then produced that had no connection to the original allegations of a “ dirty bomb ” or subsequent claims that Padilla was plotting to blow up apartment buildings and hotels in American cities .
Instead , Padilla was charged with being the “ star recruit ” of a North American terrorist cell .
He and the two other defendants — Hassoun and Jayyousi — the Justice Department claimed , had conspired to commit murder overseas and provide material support for terrorism .
During the trial , prosecutors were unable to present any evidence of Padilla ’s involvement in or knowledge of any plan to murder , kidnap or maim anyone .
Instead they told the jury that Padilla had attended a training camp in Afghanistan in 1998 , demonstrating his intent to engage in violent jihad .
The evidence produced by the government , however , was extremely weak .
Out of its over 300,000 intercepted phone conversations , only seven involved Padilla and none included any of the “ code words ” that the prosecution claimed referred to plans to carry out terrorist attacks .
Moreover , the statements allegedly made by Al Qaeda official Abu Zubaydah — who the administration claimed implicated Padilla as a member of the organization — were destroyed as part of the effort to eliminate evidence of CIA torture of terrorist suspects .
As unjust as the harsh prison term for the 37 - year - old Padilla is , it fell short of the demands of the Bush administration and Justice Department , which wanted a life sentence in order to justify it flagrant violation of Padilla ’s democratic rights .
Prosecutors argued during the sentencing phase that a life sentence was merited because the judge should interpret murder conspiracy statutes to include “ dangerous intentions ” to conduct some unspecified terrorist action in the future .
They even attempted to produce an Al Qaeda training camp “ graduation list , ” which they alleged included Padilla ’s Arabic name , but this last minute “ evidence ” was rejected by the judge as unreliable .
Prosecutors also insisted that the three - and - a - half years Padilla spent in the military brig and two additional years he was held in Miami in solitary confinement had nothing to do with the criminal charges on which he was convicted and therefore should not be taken into account in determining the sentence .
In his own sentencing brief , federal public defender Michael Caruso wrote : “ Mr. Padilla ’s assertion that he was tortured is , by any definition , unassailable .
There can be no dispute ... that the government intentionally inflicted psychological pain and suffering upon Mr. Padilla . ”
In her ruling , US District Judge Marcia Cooke said she took into consideration the “ harsh conditions ” of Padilla ’s confinement in a Navy brig before he was charged , including , “ the noise , no mattress , no books , no contact with family or a lawyer . ”
The judge added , “ I dispute the government ’s contention that I ca n’t take into account these considerations in fashioning a sentence . ”
Lawyers for Padilla have filed civil lawsuits in South Carolina and California against Bush administration appointees and military personnel , detailing how Padilla was kept in strict isolation and subjected to sleep and sensory deprivation , including being deprived of sunlight for many months at a time .
In addition he was shackled in stress positions , threatened with imminent execution , put in frigid temperatures , administered “ truth serums ” and other drugs and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological assaults .
Cooke acknowledged the three men did not engage in conduct intended to murder or maim on US soil and did not harm any Americans in the US or abroad .
Nevertheless , she upheld the prosecutors legally specious argument , saying , “ I support the government ’s contention that these defendants were engaged in conspiracy to murder , maim and kidnap ” in other countries .
During the sentencing phase Padilla ’s mother , Estela Lebron , told the judge , “ I just want to let you know my son is not a monster , and he is not a danger to this country . ”
She added , motioning towards the prosecutors , “ What they are doing to my son is injustice . ”
Padilla is appealing his conviction and prosecutor John Shipley said the government will appeal the sentence as too lenient .

Part A .
I. Introduction
Something strange is going on .
Usually , when mainstream media journalists write about libertarianism , they can barely spell the word correctly .
Often , in terms of their understanding , they seem to think of it as " libertoonianism " or , perhaps , " librarianism " ; sometimes they actually confuse it with libertinism or conservatism ( Block , Walter .
2007 .
" Plumb Line Libertarianism : A Critique of Hoppe . "
Reason Papers , Vol. 29 , Fall , pp. 151—163 ) .
Typically , at least in surveys , leading pollsters do not even include the philosophy of liberty as an option , along with the alternatives they do offer : socialism , liberalism , on the left , a category for moderates , and then on the right conservatism and fascism .
It is , then , with great appreciation that we must welcome a series of two articles written by Michael Kinsley on this subject ( here and here ) .
This journalist certainly qualifies as a leader of his profession ; but , amazingly , his understanding of our philosophy is not the typical hopeless mishmash of misunderstanding to which we have become accustomed .
He actually gets more than just a few things right .
Were he a student of mine , I would have to award him as high as a B — .
It is in the hope of raising his grade even further that I offer the present reaction to his two essays .
There will be reading homework for Mr. Kinsley embedded in it ; I hope and trust he will react to these bibliographical suggestions in a manner far different to Rudy Giuliani ’s ( non ) response to Ron Paul ’s request that he read some material on " blowback . "
II .
Rising libertarians
Mr. Kinsley ’s first effort to wrestle with our philosophy is entitled " Libertarians Rising , " and was published on 10/18/07 in Time Magazine .
In it , he starts off by demonstrating keen understanding of the views of Democrats and Republicans regarding government .
Neither wishes to greatly reduce its size overall .
He notes , correctly , that the former support civil liberties to a greater degree than the latter .
I have a slight quarrel with his view that " War in general and Iraq in particular — certainly Big Government exercises — are projects Republicans tend to be more enthusiastic about ( than Democrats ) . "
This certainly ignores the views of Dr. Ron Paul , a ten - term Republican candidate for his party ’s nomination for President .
It also fails to reckon with the fact that US participation in the Korean and Viet Nam “ police actions ” as well as World Wars I and II were begun under Democratic , not Republican , administrations .
When it comes to libertarians , our author is certainly on solid ground when he avers " Libertarians are against government in all its manifestations .
Domestically , they are against social - welfare programs .
They favor self - reliance ( as they see it ) over Big Government spending . "
I ’ll let that crack about " as they see it " pass under poetic license .
If this was meant seriously , Mr. Kinsley would have indicated in what manner the libertarian notion of self - reliance was faulty .
III .
Isolationists ?
But then he says " Internationally , they are isolationists .
Like George Washington , they loathe “ foreign entanglements , ” and they think the rest of the world can go to hell without America ’s help . "
Now , it is time to take out the red pen and penalize him a few points .
Libertarians in general , and Ron Paul in particular ( he will do just fine as an exemplar of this perspective ) , are not at all " isolationists . "
Rather , they , and he , are non-interventionists .
What , pray tell , is the difference ?
This is a distinction beyond the ability to comprehend of virtually all non-libertarian journalists , so we do well to carefully spell it out .
An isolationist is one who wishes to hide behind his national boundaries , and close out the entire world behind them .
North Korea is a reasonable case in point .
Wishing that " the rest of the world can go to hell " is indeed a good characterization of this viewpoint .
In very sharp contrast , a non-interventionist desires to eschew one and only one means of international interaction : gunboat " diplomacy , " imperialism , forcing our will upon foreign nations at the point of a gun when they pose no threat to us whatsoever .
It is entirely compatible with this stance to wish the rest of the world well , and to act so as to attain it .
How would a non-interventionist accomplish this task , if he is precluded from utilizing military force ?
Why through trade , investment , cultural and intellectual exchanges , competing in sports programs with other countries , etc .
By serving as a disinterested judge , to resolve foreign disputes , if we are called upon to do so .
Congressman
Paul is the only true internationalist now running for the Republican nomination for President since he enthusiastically embraces all of these modes of interaction .
But all is not lost .
Mr. Kinsley ’s next characterization of the libertarian philosophy shows great acuity : " … they do n’t think the government should care — about what people are reading , thinking , drinking , smoking or doing in bed , " that is , if we interpret this sympathetically : not " people , " but rather " adults . "
Libertarians , like most other people , favor paternalist laws that apply to children ; just not to consenting adults .
In the felicitous statement of Robert Nozick in his book Anarchy , State and Utopia ( p. 163 ) , libertarians oppose the prohibition of any " capitalist acts between consenting adults . "
Sex , drugs , earning a profit , it does not matter ; liberty is a seamless web .
IV . Communitarians ?
But then comes the next logical howler : " And what is the opposite of libertarianism ?
Libertarians would say fascism .
But in the American political context , it is something infinitely milder that calls itself communitarianism .
The term is not as familiar , and communitarians are far less organized as a movement than libertarians , ironically enough .
But in general communitarians emphasize society rather than the individual and believe that group responsibilities ( to family , community , nation , the globe ) should trump individual rights . "
Not so , not so .
Libertarians do not oppose communities , no matter how ostensibly coercive and totalitarian they are , provided , only , that membership in them is voluntary .
For example , the nunnery , the monastery , the commune , the kibbutz , the volunteer army , all believe that ( in very different ways ) the desires of the group should take precedence over those of the individual .
But as long as no one is forced to join , libertarians have no problem with any of these organizations .
Take the orchestra as perhaps the ultimate in communitarianism .
Here , the individual will is so subservient to the needs of the group that members ( wind players ) are told when to breathe .
If a flutist so much as gasps for air at the wrong time , the conductor will stop the entire rehearsal and glare at him .
One can hardly be more totalitarian than that .
No , the polar opposite of libertarianism is communism and fascism .
Libertarians believe in freedom in economics , in civil liberties and also in freedom from imperialism .
These others tolerate none of these liberties .
Mr. Kinsley is quite correct to criticize as hypocritical those who " advocate (e ) mandatory so - called voluntary national service by people younger than whoever is doing the advocating . "
Here , he sounds almost like a libertarian .
But what are we to make of this : " Libertarians … are not the selfish monsters you might expect .
They are earnest and impractical — eager to corner you with their plan for using old refrigerators to reverse global warming or solving the traffic mess by privatizing stoplights .
And if you disagree , they ’re fine with that .
It ’s a free country . "
Part of this is correct .
If and to the degree that libertarians are indeed selfish , it is in the spirit of Adam Smith ’s " invisible hand , " where the public good is best attained by everyone seeking to maximize profits , and thus coordinate their economic activities with each other .
And , libertarians are amongst the most easy - going people on the entire planet .
But the plan to deal with global warming in particular , and with the environmental crisis in general , has nothing to do with " old refrigerators . "
Rather , it is predicated upon the notion of " free market environmentalism . "
See on this here and here .
As to privatizing stoplights , I will deal with this charge in my comments on Mr. Kinsley ’s next essay , which centrally features this fallacious charge .
V. Conclusion
This author ends on a splendid note :
" But the party that does well in the future will be the one that makes the better guess about where to place its bets .
My money ’s on the libertarians .
People were shocked a couple of weeks ago when Ron Paul — one of those mysterious Republicans who seem to be running for President because everyone needs a hobby — raised $ 5 million from July through September , mostly on the Internet .
Paul is a libertarian .
In fact , he was the Libertarian Party presidential candidate in 1988 .
The computer revolution has bred a generation of smart loners , many of them rich and some of them complacently Darwinian , convinced that they do n’t need society — nor should anyone else .
They are going to be an increasingly powerful force in politics . "
Well , let me temper that a little bit .
What ’s with this " convinced that they do n’t need society — nor should anyone else ? "
This bespeaks a confusion between society and the state .
Not good , not good .
Libertarians are as social as anyone else .
More so than most , perhaps , as witness the vast number of Ron Paul Meetup groups , the Ron Paul blimp , the money bomb days that have garnered for the Paul campaign in the tens of millions , and LewRockwell.com , all of which are supported by voluntary , that is , social efforts .
Most libertarians do not at all oppose society , but rather the state , at least when it grows larger than constitutional limits .
All in all , this was not a bad essay .
I would rate it a B+ , maybe , even , were I in a generous mood , an A — .
Why , then , the overall rating of a B — ?
It is because I am grading both essays as one package , and if the first was pretty good , the second is anything but .
Let us now turn to it .
Part B .
I. Introduction
This second one is entitled " The Church Doctrines of Pope Ron Paul , What ’s wrong with libertarianism ? " and appeared in the Saturday , January 12 , 2008 edition of the Washington Post .
Even the title is problematic .
Pope Ron Paul ?
Dr. Paul is a practicing Baptist ( although he does not use his private faith as a means of garnering votes as do some of his competitors for the presidency , who are trying to out Christianize each other ) .
Thus , this title is at least extremely insensitive on religious grounds .
But more .
It also implies that Congressman Paul is a bit of a fanatic for attempting to import religious dogma into a context where it does not belong .
As a matter of fact , Mr. Paul bases his political views , and defends them , on grounds of the Constitution , logic and fact , not faith .
But if the title is off - putting , the same applies to the opening salvo :
" Libertarians get patronized a lot .
Chipmunky and earnest , always pursuing logical consistency down wacky paths , they pose no real threat to the established order .
But the modest success of U.S. Rep.
Ron Paul of Texas in the presidential campaign entitles them to some answers to the questions they raise .
They say : People should be free to do whatever they want , as long as it does n’t hurt other people . "
Yes , libertarians do indeed " get patronized a lot . "
And Mr. Kinsley is guilty of doing just that right here .
Chipmunk ?
Okay , yes , I can see it .
My friend of 40 years Ron Paul , maybe , looks a little like a chipmunk .
If you had to pick an animal , that might do it .
Or , maybe , a raccoon .
He ca n’t help looking like that .
Mr. Kinsley is here guilty of " lookism . "
This does n’t bother me one bit , nor would it Dr. Paul , but what pray tell will Mr. Kinsley ’s employers think of such rampant non-political correctness ?
While we are on this topic , why does no mainstream journalist opine that Mick Huckabee and Fred Thompson look like basset hounds , that Rudy Giuliani looks like a weasel , that John McCain looks like a prune , or maybe a bowling ball , that Mitt Romney and John Edwards look like Ken ( of Ken and Barbie fame ) and that Hillary looks like a shrew .
( I dare not speculate as to which animal Obama resembles , such is the parlous state of our society nowadays , none of it due to " kooky " libertarians . )
" No threat to the established order ? " C’mon , give us a break .
If Ron Paul were " no threat , " why would he raise so much money ?
Cure an entire younger generation of their political apathy ?
Inspire a modern - day tea party ?
A blimp ?
Why , when he is interviewed by the likes of Hanratty , and Russert , do they not allow him a moment to answer their questions , before interrupting him , lecturing him , trying to browbeat him ?
Why would Fox choose to exclude him from their debates ?
Why is a man who beat out Giuliani in Iowa , and Thompson in New Hampshire , given so little time in these debates ?
Why do pollsters stick to land telephones and those who voted in Republican primaries ?
What is it with those " focus groups ? "
Why has there never been a supporter of Mr. Paul in any of them ?
It seems to me that he is " a threat " alright .
It is a mistaken interpretation of libertarianism , albeit it a common one , to attribute to it this : " People should be free to do whatever they want , as long as it does n’t hurt other people . "
Not at all .
The correct rendition of this is : " People should be free to do whatever they want , as long as it does n’t violate the rights of other people . "
This is not mere semantics .
If I open up a bakery across the street from yours and attract half your customers , or alienate your girl friend ’s affections away from you and in my direction , I can indeed be said to have " hurt " you .
But in so doing I have not violated your rights .
Others might ( anti - trust regulations might call the former predatory pricing , or monopolizing ) deny this , but libertarians would not .
All is not lost , however .
There are some good bits in this essay :
" The libertarian perspective is useful , and undervalued .
Why does the government pay farmers not to grow food ?
Why are medications for fatal diseases sometimes held off the market in case they are n’t safe ?
( Compared to death ? )
Legislators and regulators should ask themselves far more often than they do whether some government activity or other expands freedom or contracts it .
" Furthermore , democracy and majority rule are no answers .
Tyranny of the majority is a constant danger .
How would you like a law requiring that people with odd Social Security numbers have to give $ 1,000 to people with even Social Security numbers ?
To libertarians , much of what the government does is essentially like that .
Good bits ?
No .
These are excellent !
II . Public Goods
But now comes material unworthy of the person who just wrote those great insights :
" So what is wrong with the libertarian case for extremely limited government ?
Economics 101 teaches some of the basic justifications for government interference in the economy .
Some things , such as the cost of national defense , are u2018 public goods . ’
We ca n’t each decide for ourselves how much defense we want .
We have to decide that together .
Then there are u2018 externalities , ’ which are costs ( or , sometimes , benefits ) that your decisions impose on me .
Pollution is the classic example .
Without government involvement of some sort to override our individual judgments , we will produce more pollution than most of us want . "
Before poking holes in this , let me say the following .
Erroneous as it is , this criticism is at least an intellectually able one .
Most journalists , when criticizing libertarianism , will resort to ad hominem arguments and name - calling .
We are greedy .
We do not care about the poor .
We are racists .
We are in the pay of Wall Street .
We are Nazis .
Say what you will about Mr. Kinsley ’s criticisms , none of them deserve to be placed in the gutter , like these others .
Now , back to the point .
Our journalist friend is entirely correct when he attributes his criticisms of libertarianism to " Economics 101 . "
The problem is that there is more to economics than " Economics 101 . "
There are also advanced courses ; even graduate studies in the dismal science .
The American people deserve better than " Economics 101 " from their top journalists .
First of all , national defense is not a public good , mainstream economists to the contrary notwithstanding .
In order for a good to be considered a good in the first place , people must be willing to pay for it .
But , based on the neoclassical story , no one would freely pay for this service ; each person would wait for others to do so , and then " free ride " off of them .
But if so , then public goods , all of them , are not " goods . "
Secondly , for a " good " to be considered a public " good " two criteria must be met : a. it must be non-rivalrous , and b. it must be non-excludable .
The first means that if one person consumes this service , it does not leave any the less for anyone else .
Air qualifies : if I breathe heavily , there is still plenty for you .
But this is clearly false in the case of defense : if the U.S. defends the East Coast , there will be just that many fewer resources left over to do so for the West Coast .
The second means that non-payers cannot be excluded from receiving the benefits of protection .
But if , say , Taxachussets becomes filled with pacifists , who refuse to pay taxes for defense , the Federal Government can say to our enemy , the " Hitler " of the day , whoever he is : " That state is no longer under our protection .
If you kick their butts , we will not retaliate . "
Thus , they could be excluded .
No one is saying that Washington D.C. would or should say any such thing .
Only that national defense , strictly speaking , does not qualify as a public good , despite serving as the very paradigm case thereof in " Economics 101 . "
For more on this see here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .
For a refutation of the claim that the lighthouse qualifies as the second paradigm case of the public good , see this material : Barnett , William II and Walter Block .
2007 .
" Coase and Van Zandt on Lighthouses , " Public Finance Review , Vol. 35 , No. 6 , November , pp. 710— 733 ; Barnett , William and Walter Block .
Unpublished .
" Coase and Bertrand on Lighthouses . "
Third point .
This entire discussion is irrelevant to Ron Paul , presumably the focus of Michael Kinsley ’s entire article .
For Representative
Paul fully supports not only a U.S. national defense , but a strong national defense .
Indeed , that is one of the primary reasons he objects to our country operating some 700 foreign military bases in some 130 countries .
In his view , these do not at all serve to defend ourselves .
Rather , their effect is to make enemies out of people who would otherwise not bear us any ill will , and encourage them to attack us .
Anyone ever hear of 9/11 and blowback out there ?
States Mr. Kinsley : " Libertarians have a fondness for complex arrangements to make markets work in situations where the textbooks say they can’t .
Hey , let ’s issue stamps , y’see , and use the revenues to form a corporation that sells stock to buy military equipment , then the government leases the equipment and the stockholders vote on whether to user ( sic ) it — and so on .
The point becomes proving a point , not economic or government efficiency . "
I have no doubt that some person calling himself a libertarian said this , or something like it ( however , it would have been nice to have been furnished specifics ) .
But no sensible libertarian did so .
In any case , this is certainly not Dr. Paul ’s view .
In logic , this is called setting up a straw man and knocking it down .
Not really cricket .
III .
Pollution
Now consider the " externality " of pollution .
The truth of this matter is almost the diametrical opposite of Mr. Kinsley ’s view .
Pollution is not a market failure .
Rather , it is a government failure .
Consider this finding from the Supreme Court of Georgia , which serves as the basis of U.S. government policy : " The pollution of the air , so far as reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of life and indispensable to the progress of society , is not actionable " ( Holman v. Athens Empire Laundry Co. [ 1919 ] ) .
When government takes upon itself the role of protecting property rights ( pollution is nothing but a trespass in the libertarian legal code ) , but then abrogates this responsibility with court findings of this sort , to characterize the situation as the market failure of externalities as is commonly done not only in " Economics 101 " but all throughout the profession of economics , is highly problematic .
See here for a further analysis along these lines .
But Mr. Kinsley is not yet finished bashing the free enterprise philosophy on the issue of pollution .
He continues : " Libertarians also have a tendency to see too many issues in terms of property rights …
Pollution , libertarians say , is simply theft : you are stealing my clean air .
Settle it in court .
This is a really terrible idea : inexpert judges , lawyers and juries using the most elaborate and expensive decision - making process known to humankind — litigation — to make inconsistent decisions in different cases .
And usually there is no one u2018 right ’ answer :
There is a spectrum of acceptable answers , involving tradeoffs ( dirty air versus fewer jobs , etc. ) that ought to be made democratically — that is , through government . "
This is more than passing curious .
If we read this literally , and how else are we to interpret it , he is saying that government courts are not part of government .
Surely , he would acknowledge that the Supreme Court , the Circuit Courts , indeed all government courts , are , well , government courts .
His way of putting the problem , perhaps leads to his error here .
He says , " Pollution , libertarians say , is simply theft : you are stealing my clean air . "
Not so .
In our view , pollution is not a theft of clean air .
Rather , it is a trespass of dust and other particles onto the property ( and lungs ) of other people .
IV .
Private roadways
At last we arrive at what is for me the crux of Mr. Kinsley ’s argument against libertarians .
We are kooky because we want to privatize highways .
Let us allow him to speak for himself on this matter :
" Sometimes libertarians end up reinventing the wheel .
My favorite example is an article I read years ago advocating privatization of highways .
This is a classic libertarian fantasy : government auctions off the land , private enterprise pays for construction and maintenance , tolls cover the cost , competition with other routes keeps it all efficient .
And what about , um , intersections ?
Well , markets would recognize that it is more efficient for one company to own both roads at major intersections , and when that happened the company would have an incentive to strike the right balance between customers on each highway .
And stoplights ?
Ultimately , the author had worked his way up to a giant monopoly that would build , own , and maintain all the roads , and charge an annual fee to people who wanted to use them .
None dare call it government . "
There is more wrong here than you can shake a stick at .
There is enough to write an entire book about the errors here .
As a matter of fact , I have written a book on it : Block , Walter .
Forthcoming , 2008 .
Privatize The Highways .
Auburn , AL : The Mises Institute .
( I strongly suspect that the " article he read years ago was one of mine , since I have written so much about this topic ; but who knows ? )
Let us , however , before analyzing the problems , ask , why is it that libertarians so vociferously reject the present institutional arrangements that govern highways and streets ?
In a word , it is because some 40,000 people in the U.S. bite the dust , are slaughtered , are dying like flies , on the nation ’s thoroughfares .
I know , I know , it is weird and kooky to be concerned with so much needless death , but , bear with me gentle reader , while I explain further .
To put this into context , " only " some 3,000 people perished in the tragedy of 9/11 .
A similar number of U.S. military have so far been given a one - way ride home in a casket from Iraq .
" Only " some 50,000 of our servicemen died in quagmire of Viet Nam in all the years we were engaged in our imperialist initiatives in that country .
Compared to these , the 40,000 deaths per year on our roadways is a national shame .
A disgrace .
The death toll includes women , children , black people , old people , gays , the groups usually in the public eye whenever something untoward occurs to them .
Why is it not in the news ?
Because journalist such as Mr. Kinsley are too busy trying to embarrass libertarians , the only ones concerned with the problem , and who are offering realistic solutions .
Why are there no governmental commissions studying this problem ?
Why is there no public outrage ?
Again , this is due to the undoubted power of the Fourth Estate .
They have lulled the populace into accepting the notion that like death and taxes , massive highway fatalities are inevitable .
It is only to be expected that people of the perspicacity of Mr. Michael Kinsley will object at this point : the fault for these deaths lies not with the state .
Rather , responsibility for these tragic killings can be laid at the door of excessive speed , drunken driving , vehicle malfunction , driver error , bad weather , the litany goes on and on .
No .
These phenomena are but proximate causes .
They are not the ultimate causes of the problem .
The deaths are the responsibility of the managers of the highways .
It is as if we were to blame for a restaurant bankruptcy cold food , poor service , dirty conditions , bad location .
No , no , no , these are the fault of the restaurant manager .
In like manner , the " buck " stops with the statist bureaucrats in charge .
It is they who have failed to confront the problems of excessive speed , drunken driving , vehicle malfunction , driver error , bad weather , etc .
Why privatization , then ?
This is because competition brings about better products at lower prices .
It does so for every good and service in the private economy .
We have reasonably good pizza , for example , because those who cannot satisfy customer demands in this regard fall by the wayside .
Imagine if government were placed in charge of providing this foodstuff .
We would have Sovietized pizza .
Well , we now suffer under the yoke of Sovietized highways and streets .
Let us now consider Mr. Kinsley ’s puerile objections to privatization .
First , he calls it " a classic libertarian fantasy . "
But this is mere name - calling .
Any student of mine guilty of this sort of " arguing " would soon enough feel the wrath of my red pen .
Every new idea , in any case , starts out as a " fantasy . "
This applies to the horseless carriage , the computer , pizza , bubble gum , the airplane .
Second , our libertarian critic comes up with this gem : " And what about , um , intersections ? "
I love that " um . "
Any discerning economist would .
The implication is that no long thin things , like roads , which necessarily overlap , could be privatized .
But what about railroads ?
At least in this country , we have private entities in that industry .
How , ever , do they solve the horrendous challenge of the , um , intersection ?
There really is no difficulty .
In libertarian property rights theory , based on the concept of homesteading as outlined by Locke , Rothbard and Hoppe , one railroad or highway , would privatize , say , 500 miles in a north — south direction ( the earliest roads in our nation were created by private turnpike companies ) .
When a second owner wanted to build an east — west thoroughfare , he would have to purchase the rights ( or else tunnel under or bridge over ) from the owner .
The initial company would have every incentive to deal reasonably with the second , since a crossroad would enhance the value of his own installation .
But Mr. Kinsley is having none of this .
The only " solution " he sees to this " problem " of intersections , and , also " stoplights , " is " a giant monopoly that would build , own , and maintain all the roads , and charge an annual fee to people who wanted to use them , " which in his view would be equivalent to " government . "
But there is no reason for one private company to own all the nation ’s roads , any more than there is for railroads , autos , steel , oil or computers .
And , even if there were , that is , one big firm owned an entire industry , it would still not be governmental .
If Wal - Mart took over all the groceries , or McDonald ’s all the fast - food emporiums , they would still be private entities .
There is an old joke : " Do you know the difference between a bathroom and a living room ? "
If the reply is " no , " the rejoinder is , " Well , then , do n’t come to my home . "
In like manner I say to Mr. Kinsley , if you do n’t know the difference between a large private enterprise , and a government enterprise , then do n’t get into political economy , for this is the single most basic distinction to be made in that entire field .
For the libertarian case in favor of private highways and streets , see here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .
Also , google the following libertarian scholars : David Beito , Dan Klein , Gabriel Roth , John Semmens all of whom have done important work in this crucial field .
V. Paternalism
Let us accord Mr. Kinsley the opportunity to speak out , without interruption , on this issue ( a privilege rarely accorded to libertarians in the mass media , nor to Ron Paul ) :
" Something similar goes on when the government forbids or requires people to do something for their own good .
Why should n’t people , at least adult people , have the right to decide for themselves ?
Libertarian thinking has been useful , for example , in making it easier to get prescription drugs through the maze at the FDA .
The Terry Shiavo case of 2005 was libertarianism ’s greatest moment so far , as the entire nation rose up in defense of her right to die . "
Let us pause for a moment .
Much as I hate to reject accolades from eminent journalists , the correct libertarian position on Terry Schiavo was to support her life ( Block , Walter .
Forthcoming .
" Terri Schiavo : A Libertarian Analysis , " Journal of Libertarian Studies ) not her death .
( I wonder if Mr. Kinsley ’s unconcern with the life of this unfortunate woman has anything to do with his unconcern for highway fatalities . )
Her husband was ruled to be her guardian .
Well and good , as long as he kept " guarding " her life .
But when he wished to do away with her , something akin to child abuse given that she was in a helpless vegetative state , this guardianship should have passed on to someone , her parents for example , who wanted to protect her , as a good guardian should .
To return to Mr. Kinsley ’s attack on libertarians for being insufficiently paternalistic , to adults that is :
" The trouble here is that libertarians tend to analogize everything to a right to die .
If you have the right to end your own life , you must have the right to do anything else you wish , short of that .
If you ’re allowed to shoot yourself through the head , why are n’t you allowed to drive without a seat belt ?
" The answer is that it ’s a bad analogy .
When you drive without a seat belt , you are not motivated by a desire to die , or even a desire to take a small risk of dying .
Why should your motive matter ?
Because your death — especially your death in a car crash — does impose externalities on others .
I would pay good money not to have to see your bloody carcass lying beside the highway , or endure the traffic jam , or pay the emergency room costs .
A serious right like the right to die may be worth the cost , while a right to be careless or irresponsible is not . "
No , it is not a matter of costs or benefits .
It is solely a matter of rights , something with which Mr. Kinsley seems unfamiliar .
If the private road owner is concerned with " a bloody carcass " negatively impacting his other customers , he can insist on seatbelts , if he thinks that the best means to this end ( studies have shown , however , that the more safe the motorist feels , the more chances he will take ) .
In some jurisdictions in Canada bicyclists are compelled to wear helmets .
This bit of nannyism is " justified " on the ground that if a bicycle user gets hurt , he will constitute an external diseconomy , others will have to pay his medical bills due to that nation ’s socialized medical system .
The proper answer to the charge of " imposing externalities " on others is privatization , however .
Without socialized medicine , injured bikers will have to pay their own medical bills .
Similarly , with private highways , all such externalities get internalized .
At this rate helmets and seatbelts will soon be compulsory for walkers , joggers , maybe even for people who are sleeping .
After all , if you fall out of bed , you can hurt your head , and " impose " costs on other people .
VI .
Milk socialism
Mr. Kinsley now launches into an attack on Dr. Paul for his views on pasteurized milk :
" Libertarians are quick to see hidden costs of ignoring libertarian principles and slow to see such costs in adhering to them .
For example , Tucker Carlson reports in the Dec. 31 New Republic that Ron Paul wants to end the federal ban on unpasteurized milk .
No one should want to drink unpasteurized milk , and almost no one does .
Paul himself does n’t .
But it bothers him that the government tells people they cannot do something they should n’t do .
Libertarians would say that if most people want pasteurized milk , the market will supply it .
Firms will emerge to certify that milk has been pasteurized .
These firms will compete , keeping them honest .
" So yes , a Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism could replace a straightforward government regulation .
But what if you are n’t interested in turning your grocery shopping into an ideological adventure ?
All that is lost by letting the government take care of it is the right of a few idiots to be idiots .
That right deserves respect .
But not much . "
" Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism ? "
To borrow a leaf from Rudy Giuliani in his criticism of Ron Paul regarding blowback and 9/11 , " I have heard many attacks on capitalism in my day , but I have never once heard it characterized as a u2018 Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism . ’
I ask the distinguished journalist from The Washington Post to take back his ill - considered remark and apologize for it . "
Dear Mr. Kinsley : the Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism is capitalism .
Everything else is , yes , wait for it , hold on a minute , socialism .
A French economist is reputed to have looked down from the Eifel tower at people scurrying around down on the streets , as small as ants from his vantage point , and wondering how Paris got fed .
They were running around down there without any central direction at all .
It is the function of economics , a discipline about which you seem unfamiliar , to explain all this .
Hint : it has to do with supply and demand , competition , entrepreneurship , and , most important , economic freedom .
( I am not now engaging in an ad hominem criticism of Mr. Kinsley for not being credentialed in the dismal science .
Dr. Ron Paul , a physician who has delivered some 4,000 babies — of all races and ethnicities I would add — also has no credentials in economics .
But he full well understands the fallacy of sneers like the " Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism . " )
Another phrase soon to enter the libertarian lexicon I predict is u201Cstraightforward government regulation .
u201D
I love it .
I wish I had invented it myself , but I am not as blessed with words as is the gifted Mr. Kinsley .
The West German version of our Food and Drug Administration , which must be beloved by Mr. Kinsley , is a marvelous example of u201Cstraightforward government regulation .
u201D
They approved , yes , approved , of Thalidomide , committing a type I error .
Then , in the aftermath , governmental licensing bureaus in many countries , including the FDA in the U.S. , hardly approved of anything in a timely manner , committing type II errors on a massive scale .
Nowadays , it takes years , and zillions ( yes , the technical term is indeed zillions ) of dollars for a new drug to negotiate its way through , pardon the expression , this FDA u201CRube Goldberg contraptionu201D of , no , not capitalism , but rather socialism .
This failure , too , has reduced consumer protection , not increased it .
Mr. Kinsley is on record as stating " Why are medications for fatal diseases sometimes held off the market in case they are n’t safe ?
( Compared to death ? ) "
Why , indeed ?
It is because of the nanny FDA , that will not even allow dying people the crapshoot of a medicine not approved by them .
I have a great idea .
A libertarian one .
Therefore , a kooky one .
Yes , here is another " classic libertarian fantasy " coming up .
It is called , hold onto your socks , competition .
Yes , another " Rube Goldberg contraption . "
How would this work ?
Instead of a monopoly FDA , there would be a whole host of private certifiers of food and drugs .
Groups like Consumers Reports , Good Housekeeping Seals of Approval , Standard and Poor , Moody ’s , private testing laboratories , perhaps even rabbis with their " kosher " criteria would enter into this business .
Of course , private courts would have to interpret their advice strictly on this basis : no one would be allowed to sue if errors occurred , as they undoubtedly do in all of human endeavor .
The only difference is that groups that make great errors , such as the FDA with Thalidomide , would go bankrupt ( the Army Corp of Engineers and FEMA would have the same fate ) .
VIII .
Redistribution
Here is Mr. Kinsley on egalitarianism :
" A similar flaw affects libertarian thinking about government - mandated redistribution .
Extreme libertarians believe this is immoral or even unconstitutional , and even more moderate libertarians disapprove of government social welfare programs as an infringement on the freedom of taxpayers .
But freedom is only one of the two core values our nation was built on .
The other is equality .
Defining equality , libertarians tend to take a narrow view , believing that it means only political equality with no financial aspects .
Defining freedom , by contrast , they take a broad view , and see a violation in every nickel a citizen must spend . "
Say what ?
Yes , historically , freedom is one of our national core values ( well , apart from slavery ) and the other is indeed equality .
However , " equality " is not a synonym for " egalitarianism . "
Equality means equality before the law .
When a rich man and a poor man are at loggerheads in court , the judge is to ignore their relative wealth .
But it does not mean that the government shall take money from the rich and give it to the poor .
There is entirely another word for that : " theft . "
Just because a majority can be convinced of the righteousness of this sort of stealing does not render it acceptable .
Hitler , after all , came to power through a democratic process .
QED .
Mr. Kinsley continues : " Libertarians ask :
By what justification does the government concern itself with inequality — financial or otherwise — in the first place ?
They are nearly alone in asking this question .
Even conservatives claim a great concern for equality of opportunity , while opposing opportunity of result .
And the reasons seem obvious : some degree of material equality as a necessary basis for political equality ; the huge role of luck in getting each of us to our relative stations in life ; etc . "
Let us forget about equal rights for the moment .
Concentrate , instead , on income and wealth inequality .
How can this best be reduced , given that this is the goal ( it is not a libertarian goal , but that is another matter ) ?
There are two ways to achieve this end : through the market place ( yes , the aforementioned " Rube Goldberg contraption of capitalism " ) , or through governmental coercion ( a redundancy ) .
At first blush it would appear that the latter is the better bet .
After all , " straightforward government regulation " is much more , well , " straightforward . "
All we need do is decree that certain amounts of money will be taken , from Peter and given to Paul ( not Ron Paul . )
What could be more " straightforward ? "
But , maybe , the rich , who usually wield more power than the poor , will , instead , seize wealth from the poor and middle class , and give it , instead , to their well - deserving selves ?
Anyone ever hear of Halliburton ?
Bechtel ?
President Lyndon Baines Johnson died a rich man , even though his governmental salary could never have garnered for him such wealth .
No , a far more reliable way to attain this goal is through laissez faire capitalism .
How , you may ask , does this work ?
Simple .
The market consists of nothing more than the concatenation of all trades and commercial interaction : buying , selling , renting , lending , employment , barter .
Each and every time anything like this occurs there are mutual gains , at least in the ex ante sense .
Both trading partners necessarily gain in this manner , otherwise , why would they voluntarily enter into the transaction ?
In other words , the market does not constitute a fixed or shrinking pie .
Bill Gates became wealthy through his efforts , but in doing so , he enriched all of those who purchased goods or services from him .
That is , in gaining income , he improved the economic situation of everyone he dealt with .
He gained wealth , but so did everyone else .
In sharp contrast , when a dictator seizes money ( usually for his Swiss bank account ) he enriches himself , to be sure , but he impoverishes everyone else .
These theoretical considerations are empirically illustrated by Gwartney , James , Robert Lawson with Dexter Samida in 2000 Annual Report : Economic Freedom of the World ( Vancouver , B.C. : The Fraser Institute , p. 17 ) who positively correlate the economic freedom that prevails in a country with a more egalitarian income distribution .
IX . Conclusion
Mr. Kinsley ends on a positive note :
" But nothing like this is obvious to libertarians .
They force us to think it all through from scratch .
Good for them . "
I say , in return , " Good for Mr. Kinsley . "
In spite of my many and serious reservations about his views , I think I speak for the entire libertarian community when I say that we are grateful for his mention of our philosophy in such great detail in the pages of the august Washington Post .
It is to be hoped that , having touched his toe in the libertarian waters , in not one essay but two , he will in the future endeavor to learn more about this philosophy , so that his subsequent criticisms , if he still has any , will be more accurate .
The Best of Walter E. Block
In a recent PBS radio interview Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid scoffed and demeaned the idea of impeaching George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
The whole process appeared so ludicrous to him that at one point he appeared ready to terminate the interview if the subject did not promptly change .
We remember the days when Republican hypocrites in the House of Representatives , Newt Gingrich , Henry Hyde and Bob Livingston , all of whom had notable marital transgressions , successfully managed to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about an extra-marital affair conducted in the White House and lying about it on an affidavit in a civil case .
We also remember the reason persistently advanced by these Republicans of â€ œThe important thing was that Clinton lied !â€ 
So now these same self - acknowledged moral guardians are silent , as is much of the mainstream media , which was only too happy to declare open season on Clinton concerning his extra-marital peccadilloes , in the face of conduct extending into the realm of treason , by normal standards considered the most heinous of crimes in a democratic nation .
Recent disclosures by former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan prior to the release of his book â€ œWhat Happenedâ€ that he was misled when he sought to exonerate Karl Rove and Lewis â€ Scooterâ€  Libby from involvement in the outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame , an expert in the field of nuclear weapons investigation , underscores the need for further investigation into Bush Administration activities .
McClellanâ€™s excerpt , as quoted in Editor & Publisher , reads :
â€ œI had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice president , the presidentâ€™s chief of staff , and the president himself .â€ 
With such an important number of major government leaders involved , the McClellan statement prompted historians to recall the Watergate period , when the term â€ œcover - upâ€ was so much in the public vogue and a chief executive was besieged with questions he failed to answer in a sea of recriminations and repeated attempted escapes from responsibility .
Valerie Plame , the agent outed by the White House cabal through the intercession of the corporate rightâ€™s most reliable rubber stamp , columnist Robert Novak , issued a statement from her Santa Fe , New Mexico home concerning McClellanâ€™s statement :
â€ œI am outraged to learn that former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan confirms that he was sent out to lie to the press corps and the American public about two senior White House officials , Karl Rove and I .
Lewis â€ ˜Scooterâ€™ Libby who deliberately and recklessly released my identity as a covert CIA operations officer .
Even more shocking , McClellan confirms that not only Karl Rove and Scooter Libby told him to lie but ( also ) Vice President Cheney .
Presidential Chief of Staff Andrew Card and President Bush also ordered McClellan to issue his misleading statement .
Unfortunately , President Bushâ€™s commutation of Scooter Libbyâ€™s felony sentence has short - circuited justice .
â€ œVice President Cheney in particular knew that Scooter Libby was involved because he had ordered and directed his actions .
McClellanâ€™s revelations provide important support for our civil suit against those who violated our national security and maliciously destroyed my career.â€ 
It was none other than George Bush the Elder who as Ronald Reaganâ€™s vice president bitterly denounced the act of disclosing a name or names of covert CIA operatives .
By revealing Ms. Plameâ€™s identity her life was placed at risk as well as those with whom she interacted in her government duties .
Remember when George W. Bush assured Americans that if any of his subordinates were discovered to be involved in such outing activities that he would immediately fire such individual or individuals ?
Has he given any such indication since ?
Has Bush urged that this matter be investigated fully to a proper conclusion ?
What we do know is that Bush promptly pardoned Libby .
As Valerie Plame noted , this act â€œshort - circuited justice.â€ 
Such actions fall under the heading of high crimes and misdemeanors as defined by the nationâ€™s Founding Fathers in the U.S. Constitution .
The action herein involved represents treason by any reasonable definition .
It is the mandated responsibility of members of Congress to investigate and , if the evidence warrants , impeach and ultimately remove from office public officials engaging in such misconduct .
This mandate also includes a violation of international law by attacking another nation without reasonable cause , as occurred in the case of Iraq on the basis of unfounded charges of â€œweapons of mass destruction .â€ 
Senator Reid and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , do we simply allow such acts to go uninvestigated ?
Do you not believe in carrying out the responsibilities invested in you as members of Congress ?

Deep beneath the plains of central Texas lies a catacomb of tunnels once meant to house the most expensive physics experiment ever devised .
That experiment , the Superconducting Supercollider , would have revolutionized our understanding of the physical world by giving us our first glimpse of the “ God Particle . ”
And , proposed during the Cold War , it would have been a monument to the technological and scientific prowess of the Western world .
But in 1993 after investing over $ 2 billion dollars into the project , President Clinton and Congress cancelled it entirely .
Highly sophisticated machinery and laboratories were simply sold to the highest bidder , and thousands of acres of empty land were parceled off and sold as well .
All that now remains are 200,000 square feet of still - vacant factories and labs , and over 30 km of carved - rock tunnels slowly filling with water .
One of the most persistent mysteries of the Universe is why matter has mass at all .
Physicists think they know the answer ; a particle called the Higgs Boson , also called the “ God Particle ” , is thought to exist that gives all other particles mass .
Around this theoretical particle they constructed the glittering edifice of late - 20th century physics known rather plainly as the Standard Model .
Despite its tremendous importance , the Higgs has never been observed in experiments .
According to calculations , it exists in detectable form only at astoundingly high temperatures and pressures – similar to those of the first few seconds after the Big Bang .
Particle accelerators smash sub-atomic scraps together to regularly recreate such conditions , but none exists powerful enough to actually see the Higgs .
Frustrated by this problem , physicists petitioned the Department of Energy in the early 1980s to create the most powerful particle accelerator in the world .
As its name suggests , the Superconducting Supercollider ( SSC ) was to be enormous in every single way .
It would slam particles together with more than 20 times the energy of any other existing or planned device .
The beam of protons and anti-protons it would produce would be 100 times ‘ brighter ’ than even today ’s most powerful accelerators .
In order to control such tremendous energies , cutting - edge superconducting magnets would bend the beam around an oval - shaped beam tunnel more than 80 km in circumference .
Choosing the site for such an enormous facility was a country - wide effort involving geological and economic studies in 43 states .
Though the process was a drawn - out political affair , the final choice seems a natural one ; after all , everything ’s bigger in Texas !
The main accelerator ring would be bored through the bedrock 200 feet beneath Waxahachie , Texas .
Sleepy Waxahachie would have been completely transformed by the SSC .
Labs and factories were to be built nearby to produce the superconducting magnets and provide the above - ground facilities for the SSC ’s considerable staff .
Literally thousands of researchers , graduate students , and technicians would have been involved in running the machine and many would have been housed there .
Construction began in 1991 , and by 1993 workers had dug over 30 km of tunnels .
In order to bore through the sandstone and limestone beneath Waxahachie , a 15 foot diameter tunneling machine was created that literally chewed through the bedrock .
Most of the ring tunnel would be a smooth - sided tube , but the giant particle detectors required cavernous galleries that had to be blasted out of the rock .
As work progressed on both the construction of the facilities and the design of the experiments themselves , expenses and projected costs rose precipitously .
By 1993 the finished cost estimate was $ 8.25 billion ; about the same as the projected cost of the International Space Station .
Facing a bloating price tag on a program associated with his predecessor , President Clinton was never fond of the SSC .
Without a presidential champion the deficit - weary Congress cut funding for the SSC entirely and chose to abandon the $ 2 billion that had already been spent .
Today the failure of the SSC project continues to cast a long shadow on the physics community .
Had it been fully funded , it would have begun experiments by the late 1990s and produced results around the turn of the millennium .
The capabilities it would have afforded scientists are still unmatched , even by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland which will not be fully operational for another few years .
Some say that the days of big particle accelerators may be gone for good .
Though there are still a number of accelerators in operation , and others in construction and planning , none will push forward the boundaries of physics research as the SSC would have .
Meanwhile , the needs of high energy physicists have only grown .
The latest theories , including string theory , require accelerator energies greater than even the SSC could have produced in order to test their predictions .
The one piece of the SSC program that could not be sold or auctioned may prove to be the silver lining in this tale .
After all , the Earth changes slowly – far more slowly than the whims of government - funded science .
Should Congress and the President ever decide to revive the SSC , the tunnels beneath Waxahachie will be waiting .
Winston Churchill  icon for President George W. Bush and the neo-crazies  is revered for declaring “ I did not become Her Majesty ’s First Minister so that I might oversee the liquidation of the British Empire ! ”
Churchill is  understandably  much less revered for proceeding to do just that .
With just a year to go in his Presidency , it increasing appears that Bush - 43s chief legacy may be the liquidation of our empire , accumulated during the so - called American Century .
To get a sense of the State of the American Hegemony under the stewardship thus far of Bush - 43 , take a look at the Antiwar.com homepage .
There are separate sections , there , largely devoted to consequences of Bush - 43 interventions  actual , intended or threatened  into the internal affairs of Russia , Iran , Iraq , Israel / Palestine , Lebanon / Syria , Afghanistan , India , the Koreas , Pakistan , Somalia , the Congo , Algeria , Peru , the Middle East , Europe , Asia and the American Homeland , itself .
Of course , we  and the whole world  were given fair warning that there would be such interventions .
In his very first State of the Union Address , Bush - 43 , the self - proclaimed Commander - in - Chief of the Global War on Terror , declared that ;
“ Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives .
“ First , we will shut down terrorist camps , disrupt terrorist plans , and bring terrorists to justice .
“ And , second , we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical , biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world .
“ Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business , yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries .
A terrorist underworld — including groups like Hamas , Hezbollah , Islamic Jihad , Jaish - i- Mohammed — operates in remote jungles and deserts , and hides in the centers of large cities .
“ Our soldiers , working with the Bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy .
“ Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia .
“ Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction .
“ North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
“ Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror , while an unelected few repress the Iranian people ’s hope for freedom .
“ Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror .
“ States like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
“ We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials , technology , and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction .
We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack .
“ And all nations should know : America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation ’s security .
“ We ’ll be deliberate , yet time is not on our side .
I will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
I will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer . ”
Bushs 2002 National Security Statement , formalizing those policies to be implemented during prosecution of the GWOT under the American Hegemony , focused on “ rogue states , ” rather than the terrorists themselves .
The 2006 update to the 2002 NSS further states that ;
“ The best way to block aspiring nuclear states or nuclear terrorists is to deny them access to the essential ingredient of fissile material .
“ Therefore , our strategy focuses on controlling fissile material with two priority objectives :
“ First , to keep states from acquiring the capability to produce fissile material suitable for making nuclear weapons ; and second , to deter , interdict , or prevent any transfer of that material from states that have this capability to rogue states or to terrorists .
“ The first objective requires closing a loophole in the Non-Proliferation Treaty that permits regimes to produce fissile material that can be used to make nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear power program . ”
Of course , the internationally agreed - upon strategy to prevent nuclear - weapons proliferation has always focused on controlling the fissile materials absolutely essential to their production .
But , in return for a signatory s subjecting all nuclear - energy related activities to International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards  for the exclusive purpose of the IAEAs being able to verify that certain proscribed materials are never used to produce nuclear weapons  the NPT affirms a signatorys inalienable right to produce and use such materials for peaceful purposes .
Far from constituting a “ loop hole , ” that guarantee is one of the “ three pillars ” of the NPT .
Another NPT pillar is the commitment  reaffirmed by President Clinton at the 2000 NPT Review Conference  to get rid of all our nukes .
Then , theres the NPT prohibition  as well as prohibitions in US law  against Bushs assisting India [ not a NPT - signatory ] with its nuclear programs .
Finally , theres the implied NPT prohibition  and the explicit prohibition in the UN Charter  against Bushs imposition of sanctions on Russia and China for facilitating Irans enjoyment  without discrimination  of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
Hence , implementing Bushs 2006 National Security Strategy  designed to secure the American Hegemony  requires nothing less than the deliberate destruction of the existing international nuclear - weapons proliferation - prevention regime .
But , hold on .
Even though Bush - 43 recently warned Russia and China that World War III could result unless they joined him in imposing crushing economic sanctions on Iran  in violation of the UN Charter  and in denying Iran its inalienable rights under the NPT , Russian President Putin defied Bush by attending a summit meeting in Tehran of the oil - rich Caspian Sea littoral states , pointedly declaring afterward in a joint Iran - Russia press conference that “ Iran is an important regional and global power ” .
Furthermore , China has just defied Bush - 43 by concluding a deal with Iran that obliges it “ to make all necessary investments to develop the Yadavaran Oil Field in Southwestern Iran . ”
So , maybe Russia and China wont allow Bush to emasculate the IAEA - NPT - NSG nuke proliferation - prevention regime  which is solidly athwart his American Hegemony ambitions .
Then what will be George W. Bushs chief legacy ?
World War III , or  like Churchill  liquidiation of an empire ?

Senior Research Associate Tom Woods of CU - Boulder 's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics said the brightening of the sun as it approaches its next solar cycle maximum will have regional climatic impacts on Earth .
While some scientists predict the next solar cycle -- expected to start in 2008 -- will be significantly weaker than the present one , others are forecasting an increase of up to 40 percent in the sun 's activity , said Woods .
Woods is the principal investigator on NASA 's $ 88 million Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment , or SORCE , mission , launched in 2003 to study how and why variations in the sun affect Earth 's atmosphere and climate .
In August , NASA extended the SORCE mission through 2012 .
The extension provides roughly $ 18 million to LASP , which controls SORCE from campus by uploading commands and downloading data three times daily to the Space Technology Building in the CU Research Park .
Solar cycles , which span an average of 11 years , are driven by the amount and size of sunspots present on the sun 's surface , which modulate brightness from the X-ray to infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The current solar cycle peaked in 2002 .
Solar activity alters interactions between Earth 's surface and its atmosphere , which drive global circulation patterns , said Woods .
While warming on Earth from increased solar brightness is modest compared to the natural effects of volcanic eruptions , cyclical weather patterns like El Nino or human emissions of greenhouse gases , regional temperature changes can vary by a factor of eight .
During the most recent solar maximum , for example , the global mean temperature rise on Earth due to solar - brightness increases was only about 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit , said Woods .
But parts of the central United States warmed by 0.7 degrees F , and a region off the coast of California even cooled slightly .
A paper on the coming decade of solar activity by Woods and Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , was published online Oct. 30 in the scientific newsletter , Eos .
" It was very important to the climate change community that SORCE was extended , because it allows us to continue charting the solar irradiance record in a number of wavelengths without interruption , " Woods said .
" Even relatively small changes in solar output can significantly affect Earth because of the amplifying affect in how the atmosphere responds to solar changes . "
With mounting concern over the alteration of Earth 's surface and atmosphere by humans , it is increasingly important to understand natural " forcings " on the sun-Earth system that impact both climate and space weather , said Woods .
Such natural forcing includes heat from the sun 's radiation that causes saltwater and freshwater evaporation and drives Earth 's water cycle .
Increases in UV radiation from the sun also heat up the stratosphere -- located from 10 miles to 30 miles above Earth -- which can cause significant changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over the planet , affecting Earth 's weather and climate , he said .
" We will never fully understand the human impact on Earth and its atmosphere unless we first establish the natural effects of solar variability . "
SORCE also is helping scientists better understand violent space weather episodes triggered by solar flares and coronal mass ejections that affect the upper atmosphere and are more prevalent in solar maximum and declining solar cycle phases , said Woods .
The severe " Halloween Storms " in October and November 2003 disrupted GPS navigation and communications , causing extensive and costly rerouting of commercial " over - the - poles " jet flights to lower latitudes , he said .
Woods also is the principal investigator on a $ 30 million instrument known as the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment , or EVE , one of three solar instruments slated for launch on NASA 's Solar Dynamic Observatory in December 2008 .
Designed and built at LASP and delivered to NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland last September , EVE will measure precise changes in the sun 's UV brightness , providing space weather forecasters with early warnings of potential communications and navigation outages .
About one - third of the annual SORCE budget goes for commanding and controlling the satellite , roughly one - third for producing public data sets and one - third for analyzing how and why the sun is changing , he said .
" CU - Boulder students are our lifeblood , " said Woods .
" They are involved in all aspects of the SORCE mission , from uploading commands to the spacecraft to analyzing data . "

At the Midem conference in Cannes , France , Qtrax and its parent company Brilliant Technologies Corp. announced deals on Sunday with all four major labels that would make it the first free and legal ad - supported P2P service with major label music .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
By allowing users to share DRM - protected files with label approval , Qtrax CEO Allan Klepfisz said he expected the service to offer over 25 million songs , dwarfing the catalogs of iTunes and other online music stores .
The service launched today , after what Klepfisz called four and a half years of negotiations with the labels .
But the resulting deals are nowhere near as firm as Klepfisz indicated they were during conversations with the press last week .
For example , here ’s an audio sample of Klepfisz telling me that his company would announce deals with all of the major labels :
Although the company is said to be negotiating with all four labels , and has at least one confirmed current major label deal ( with EMI ’s publishing division ) , Qtrax apparently lacks current deals with the major labels to offer song downloads .
" EMI Music had an initial agreement with Qtrax , essentiallyalicense designed to help them experiment with this ad - supported modelhad licensed songs to Qtrax , " said an EMI spokeswoman .
" Qtrax didn ’ tlaunch the service duringthe period of the agreement — I think we initially did this two yearsago .
We ’re now in talks with the company about a possible new deal ,
but as of today , they do n’t have a license with EMI Music . "
Qtrax doeshave a deal with EMI Publishing , she said , but its license for offeringEMI sound recording downloads has expired .
An agreement with Universal Music Group has also apparently expired , while a Warner Music Group spokeswoman flatly denied any deal with Qtrax :
" Warner Music Group has not authorized the use of our content on Qtrax ’s recently announced service . "
However , sheconfirmed that negotiations between Warner and Qtrax are ongoing .
A spokesman for Sony / BMG said the label had licensed Qtrax to offer tracks from its catalog on a limited play basis in April of 2007 , so long as Qtrax included an option to purchase the track once the play limit had been reached .
However , Qtrax ’s new service offers unlimited playback , and so it is not covered by that agreement .
The spokesman confirmed that Sony / BMG is also in talks with the company to forge a new deal .
Apparently , Qtrax , eager to make its announcement during the Midemconference , misrepresented ongoing negotiations and expired deals as official major label sign - off .
Thecompany certainly did n’t earn points with the media over this strategy – at least one major publication had to " stop the presses " over theweekend , according to one source .
The flub could hurt negotiations too .
Now that Qtrax has promised major label catalogs to consumers , its bargainingposition with the labels may have been weakened , although aspokesman said company executives " still feel they have the backing of the industry . "
Assuming that QTrax can untangle its licensing situation , it will offer a socially - driven music source for the 94 percent of internet users Klepfisz says do not and will not pay for music online .
" You ca n’t change the attitudes and habits of what is now probablyamounting to two generations who believe that music ought to be free onthe internet , " said Klepfisz .
" Those people are notgoing to be discouraged by Supreme Court decisions , they ’re not goingto be discouraged by technological interference .
Ultimately , what willdiscourage them is a demonstratively better service . "
Songs will be wrapped in Microsoft ’s Windows Media subscription DRM .
This means that unlike the free , ad - supported services offered by imeem
and Last.fm , Qtrax ’s songs can be downloaded onto compatible players .
The application is based on the Songbird engine , so sharing and downloading occurs within a customized Firefox browser — no separate application required .
As of now , the tracks are not compatible with the Apple iPod , butKlepfisz said that the service would be compatible with iPods beforetoo long — an indication that Qtrax could apply the subscriptiontechnology Apple developed for iTunes movie rentals to the music market .
To get the industry on board with P2P , Qtrax will sign over " the lion ’ sshare of revenue " to labels and publishers , paying out on per - downloadand per-play bases .
The site also categorized the music of the worldinto three lists .
One list includes artists who do not permittheir music to be made available online in any capacity .
" The blacklist isfast disappearing — my prediction is that in a year , the blacklistwo n’t be in existence , " said Klepfisz .
The white list consists of thestandard digital catalogs from major and indie labels — the same 5 - million - plus songs that are on iTunes .
The gray list constitutes the difference between what ’s available oniTunes and what ’s available on BitTorrent .
" Then you have the graylist , which is that vast body of stuff that ’s out there on P2P , wherethere are rights holders , but the rights holders themselves may not evenknow that a song is being downloaded frequently … .
To the best of ourability , we identify the rights holder and pay them a percentage of theadvertising revenue .
In the minority of cases where we ca n’t identify arights holder , we will actually put up the song for claiming , and willreserve the portion of the ad pie until that song is appropriatelyclaimed . "
As with other free , ad - supported services , revenue comes fromadvertisers who want to target ads to specific types of listeners .
In negotiating with Qtrax , with whom some of them have signed deals in the past , the labels are demonstrating an openness toward revenue streams that deviate from the record - store model .
" This is a tacit acknowledgment that ‘ bulletproof ’ was n’t working , "
said IDC consumer audio analyst Susan Kevorkian .
" And it has n’t beenworking .
But it was an experiment the music industry needed toundertake in order to figure out how to address digital distribution .
It was a very long learning process , but fortunately there ’s still thepossibility of finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . "

· Human activity damages more than 40 % of seas · First ' big picture ' map worse than expected
Fishing , climate change and pollution have left an indelible mark on virtually all of the world 's oceans , according to a huge study that has mapped the total human impact on the seas for the first time .
Scientists found that almost no areas have been left pristine and more than 40 % of the world 's oceans have been heavily affected .
" This project allows us to finally start to see the big picture of how humans are affecting the oceans , " said Ben Halpern , assistant research scientist at the University of California , Santa Barbara , who led the research .
" Our results show that when these and other individual impacts are summed up the big picture looks much worse than I imagine most people expected .
It was certainly a surprise to me . "
Human impact is most severe in the North Sea , the South and East China Seas , the Caribbean , the Mediterranean , the Red Sea , the Gulf , the Bering Sea , along the eastern coast of North America and in much of the western Pacific .
The oceans at the poles are less affected but melting ice sheets will leave them vulnerable , researchers said .
The study found that almost half of the world 's coral reefs have been heavily damaged .
Other concerns rest with seagrass beds , mangrove forests , seamounts , rocky reefs and continental shelves .
Soft - bottom ecosystems and open ocean fared best but even these were not pristine in most locations .
Previous studies of human impacts have focused on a single activity or on an isolated ecosystem , and rarely on a global scale .
Fiorenza Micheli , an associate professor of biology at Stanford University , said the maps should guide ocean management in future .
" By seeing where different activities occur and whether they occur in sensitive ecosystems we can design management strategies aimed at shifting activities away from the most sensitive areas . "
To make the map scientists compiled global data on the impacts of 17 human activities including fishing , coastal development , fertiliser runoff and pollution from shipping traffic .
They divided the ocean into one - square - kilometre cells and worked out which human activities might have touched each particular cell .
For each cell , the scientists allocated an impact score to look at the degree to which human activities affected 20 types of ecosystems .
Around 41 % had medium high to very high impact scores .
A small fraction , 0.5 % but representing 2.2 m square kilometres ( 850,000 square miles ) , were rated very highly affected .
Halpern said the results , which were published in the journal Science and presented yesterday to the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting , still gave room for hope .
" With targeted efforts to protect the chunks of the ocean that remain relatively pristine we have a good chance of preserving these areas in good condition . "
Andrew Rosenberg , a professor of natural resources at the University of New Hampshire , who was not involved with the study , said : " Clearly we can no longer just focus on fishing or coastal wetland loss or pollution as if they are separate effects .
" These human impacts overlap in space and time , and in far too many cases the magnitude is frighteningly high . "
He added : " The message for policy - makers seems clear to me : conservation action that cuts across the whole set of human impacts is needed now in many places around the globe . "
Highlighting examples of action , the researchers said that , for example , fishing zones have been shown to help ecosystems survive better , and navigation routes across seas have been altered to protect sensitive ocean areas .
Although the research will be helpful , making conservation decisions will require more detailed research at the local level , said Micheli .
" Our results and approach , augmented with additional local information , can also inform management at a local and regional scale .
Looking at the data globally , some information is lost . "
Halpern said the map was a wake - up call .
" Humans will always use the oceans for recreation , extraction of resources , and for commercial activity such as shipping .
This is a good thing .
Our goal , and really our necessity , is to do this in a sustainable way so that our oceans remain in a healthy state and continue to provide us with the resources we need and want . "
Parenscript
Introduction
Parenscript is a translator from an extended subset of Common Lisp to JavaScript .
Parenscript code can run almost identically on both the browser ( as JavaScript ) and server ( as Common Lisp ) .
Parenscript code is treated the same way as Common Lisp code , making the full power of Lisp macros available for JavaScript .
This provides a web development environment that is unmatched in its ability to reduce code duplication and provide advanced meta- programming facilities to web developers .
At the same time , Parenscript is different from almost all other " language X " to JavaScript translators in that it imposes almost no overhead :
No run-time dependencies
Any piece of Parenscript code is runnable as - is .
There are no JavaScript files to include .
Native types Parenscript works entirely with native JavaScript data types .
There are no new types introduced , and object prototypes are not touched .
Native calling convention Any JavaScript code can be called without the need for bindings .
Likewise , Parenscript can be used to make efficient , self - contained JavaScript libraries .
Readable code Parenscript generates concise , formatted , idiomatic JavaScript code .
Identifier names are preserved .
This enables seamless use of JavaScript debuggers .
Efficiency Parenscript introduces minimal overhead for advanced Common Lisp features .
The generated code is almost as fast as hand - written JavaScript .
Download
The latest Parenscript release , version 2.7.1 , came out on December 5 , 2018 and can be downloaded here ( PGP signature ) .
Older versions can be downloaded from the release directory .
Parenscript is also available via Quicklisp : ( ql:quickload : parenscript )

More than a dozen officials in Washington and Islamabad from a number of countries spoke on condition of anonymity because of the fragility of Pakistan ’s current political situation .
The doubts that American officials voiced about whether General Musharraf could survive were more pointed than any public statements by the administration , and signaled declining American patience in advance of Mr. Negroponte ’s trip .
Officials involved in the discussions in Washington said the Bush administration remained wary of the perception that the United States was cutting back - room deals to install the next leader of Pakistan .
“ They do n’t want to encourage another military coup , but they are also beginning to understand that Musharraf has become part of the problem , ” said one former official with knowledge of the debates inside the Bush administration .
That shift in perception is significant because for six years General Musharraf has sought to portray himself , for his own purposes , as the West ’s best alternative to a possible takeover in Pakistan by radical Islamists .
While remote areas in northwestern Pakistan remain a haven for Al Qaeda and other Islamic militants , senior officials at the White House , the State Department and the Pentagon now say they recognize that the Pakistani Army remains a powerful force for stability in Pakistan , and that there is little prospect of an Islamic takeover if General Musharraf should fall .
If General Musharraf is forced from power , they say , it would most likely be in a gentle push by fellow officers , who would try to install a civilian president and push for parliamentary elections to produce the next prime minister , perhaps even Ms. Bhutto , despite past strains between her and the military .

EXCLUSIVE : Barack vs. Bill : Obama Hits Ex - Prez Over ' Troubling ' Attacks Bill Clinton hits back at Obama for saying Reagan better President than he was .
Jan. 21 , 2008  --
The war of words between former President Clinton and Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama escalated today as Clinton accused his wife 's Democratic rival of saying the Reagan administration was better than the Clinton administration .
Clinton 's latest shot came less than a day after Obama said that the former president 's recent remarks on the campaign trail are " troubling . "
Clinton did n't back down today as he took another swipe at Obama for courting Republican voters in Nevada and for praising former President Reagan .
" [ Hillary ] won a victory in spite of a very well - organized , and I might say a very well - executed strategy by the Obama campaign , which included doing well in the north of Nevada , where his demographic of upscale voters lived , and by making an explicit effort to get Republicans to come and vote for him in the Democratic caucus , " Clinton said Sunday night during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Buffalo , N.Y .
Clinton then accused Obama of calling conservative darling Reagan a better president than Clinton .
" [ Obama ] said President Reagan was the engine of innovation and did more , had a more lasting impact on America than I did , " Clinton said .
" And then the next day he said , ' In the '90s the good ideas came out from the Republicans . '
Which it 'll be costly maybe down the road for him because it 's factually not accurate . "
That was n't exactly what Obama said , though he invoked Reagan in a positive way .
" I do n't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure .
I think part of what 's different are the times .
I do think that for example the 1980 was different .
I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not .
He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it , " Obama said during an editorial board meeting with the Reno Gazette - Journal .
He continued : " I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s and government had grown and grown but there was n't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating .
I think people , he just tapped into what people were already feeling , which was we want clarity , we want optimism , we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing . "
Obama Takes Former President to Task
Earlier , in an exclusive interview with ABC News ' Robin Roberts " Good Morning America " the Illinois senator directly engaged the former Democratic president , calling his advocacy on behalf of his wife 's presidential campaign , " troubling . "
" You know the former president , who I think all of us have a lot of regard for , has taken his advocacy on behalf of his wife to a level that I think is pretty troubling , " Obama said during his first morning television interview since coming in second in Nevada .
" He continues to make statements that are not supported by the facts -- whether it's about my record of opposition to the war in Iraq or our approach to organizing in Las Vegas .
" This has become a habit , and one of the things that we 're going to have to do is to directly confront Bill Clinton when he 's making statements that are not factually accurate , " Obama added .
Obama apparently was referring to Clinton 's comment that it was a " fairy tale " that Obama has consistently opposed the Iraq war from the start , and that Nevada union officials backing Obama were strong - arming members into caucusing for Obama .
Bill Clinton took on Obama 's record on Iraq at a Dartmouth College event days before the New Hampshire primary , saying it was wrong Obama was able to trumpet superior judgment on Iraq by claiming he had been against the war from the start .
" Give me a break .
This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I 've ever seen , " Bill Clinton said .
Bill Clinton was making the case that Obama -- just like Sen. Hillary Clinton -- had voted to fund the war since he 's been in office .
Obama said the former president has taken his campaigning on his wife 's behalf too far .
" I understand him wanting to promote his wife 's candidacy , " Obama said .
" She 's got a record that she can run on .
But I think it 's important that we try to maintain some -- you know , level of honesty and candor during the course of the campaign .
If we do n't , then we feed the cynicism that has led so many Americans to be turned off to politics . "
Hillary Clinton 's campaign manager Howard Wolfson said Obama may just be smarting from his loss to the New York senator in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday .
" We understand Sen . Obama is frustrated by his loss in Nevada , but facts are facts , " Wolfson said .
" Sen . Obama 's allies in Nevada engaged in strong - arm tactics and intimidation against our supporters and his record against the war has been inconsistent .
President Clinton is a huge asset to our campaign and will continue talking to the American people to press the case for Sen. Clinton .
" Of course Sen. Clinton and Sen. Obama are the candidates on the ballot and she is winning because she is giving voice to the Americans who will provide real solutions to the challenges they face in the daily lives , " he said .
During the run up to the caucus , Obama received a lot of pressure to denounce a third - party advertising supporting him , but accusing Sen. Clinton of abandoning Hispanic workers .
" The ad that happened in Nevada , we had nothing to do with .
I was n't even in the state of Nevada when it went up for the couple of days right before the caucus , " Obama said .
" To the extent that it implied that Sen. Clinton was trying to suppress Hispanic votes , I think that would be absolutely incorrect and unfair .
I think that they were concerned about the fact that the Clinton ad -- that Clinton supporters , not the Clinton campaign -- the Clinton supporters had filed a lawsuit in the eleventh hour to try to change the rules of the caucus in the way that they thought would advantage them .
And this happened right after the union endorsed me .
So understandably , the union was upset , " he added .
He did not denounce the ad , but when a similar ad in Iowa aired against him , Obama said third - party ads should not be tolerated .
" What I do n't want is a situation in which we are so driven to just win that we are willing to say anything , and over time , you know the American people just get turned off because they do n't believe what politicians say , " he said .
" My concern is not to try to go tit for tat on these issues and it's also , you know , not to suggest that there 's not going to be some sharp elbows in politics .
I understand that there are going to be sharp elbows in a primary and certainly there 's going to be some rough 'n tumble in a general election , " Obama added .
In a move that legal experts said could present a major test of First Amendment rights in the Internet era , a federal judge in San Francisco on Friday ordered the disabling of a Web site devoted to disclosing confidential information .
The site , Wikileaks.org , invites people to post leaked materials with the goal of discouraging “ unethical behavior ” by corporations and governments .
It has posted documents concerning the rules of engagement for American troops in Iraq , a military manual concerning the operation of prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and other evidence of what it has called corporate waste and wrongdoing .
The case in San Francisco was brought by a Cayman Islands bank , Julius Baer Bank and Trust .
In court papers , the bank claimed that “ a disgruntled ex-employee who has engaged in a harassment and terror campaign ” provided stolen documents to Wikileaks in violation of a confidentiality agreement and banking laws .
According to Wikileaks , “ the documents allegedly reveal secret Julius Baer trust structures used for asset hiding , money laundering and tax evasion . ”
On Friday , Judge Jeffrey S. White of the Federal District Court in San Francisco granted a permanent injunction ordering Dynadot of San Mateo , Calif. , the site ’s domain name registrar , to disable the Wikileaks.org domain name .
The order had the effect of locking the front door to the Wikileaks.org site  a largely ineffectual action that kept back doors to the site , and several copies of it , available to sophisticated Web users who knew where to look .
LAHORE , Pakistan 
A suicide bomber rammed a car into a campaign rally in the tribal areas on Saturday , killing 37 people and wounding at least 90 others .
The attack in Parachinar , a town in Kurram , occurred two days before parliamentary elections on Monday and was apparently intended to deter voters from participating , said Brig .
Javed Cheema , a spokesman for the Interior Ministry .
“ It ’s the same people who have been carrying out attacks , whose purpose is to create confusion and chaos and stop the polling process , ” Brigadier Cheema said .
The government of President Pervez Musharraf has blamed a Pakistani Taliban leader , Baitullah Mehsud , who is allied with Al Qaeda , for the steep rise in suicide attacks in the past year .
It seemed unlikely , however , that the attack on Saturday would have a significant effect on voter turnout because the tribal areas , which are semiautonomous and border Afghanistan , are considered remote and lawless by most Pakistanis .
This is pretty neat .
According to Howard Wolfson , pointing out that Bill Clinton is lying is a " right - wing talking point " and thus all good liberals have a duty to grant Clinton a blanket license to fib .
So when Clinton said he opposed the Iraq War , that must have been true , because I 'm a liberal .
And when Clinton said Barack Obama did n't oppose the Iraq War , that must have been true too , because I 'm a liberal .
Look , obviously Bill 's in an odd position because we 've never had an ex-president 's wife run for president before .
But if he wants to be treated as an elder statesman figure for fellow progressives , he needs to act like one .
If he wants to be Hillary Clinton 's attack dog in a primary campaign , then he 's going to be treated as one .
Certainly he 's not above criticism .

สิ่งที่กำลังจะเกิดขึ้นในอนาคตอันใกล้นี้มีผลร้ายแรงมากเกินกว่าจะคาดหวัง(มูลเหตุมาจากเรื่องราวในอดีตกาล)
เพราะฉะนั้นจากที่พวกเขาเคยต่อสู้คุ้นเคย
ก็จำเป็นต้องหันกลับมาประสานมือกันเพื่อรวมพลังแล้วกลับไปปรับแต่งสมัยก่อนอีกรอบก่อนจะสิ้นซากกันไปหมดจริงๆในช่วงเวลานั้นในกรุ๊ปไม่วเทนท์มีบุคคลที่มีความเข้าใจพิเศษสำหรับการเจาะทะลุมิติได้
แม้กระนั้นมันก็เกินข้อจำกัดของร่างกายของมนุษย์ที่จะเดินทางกลับไปในโลกของอดีตกาลเพราะว่าถึงแม้ว่าพวกเขาจะมีพลังพิเศษ แม้กระนั้นก็มิได้แปลว่ามีร่างกายที่เข้มแข็งเหนือมนุษย์อะไร จะมีก็แต่ว่าวูล์ฟเวอร์รีนผู้เดียวแค่นั้นที่มีร่างกาย
“ เกือบเป็นอมต ะ ” ฉะนั้นคนที่ได้รับหน้าที่สำคัญสำหรับการกลับไปปรับแต่งอดีตกาลนี้ก็คือเขานั่นเอง
สำหรับผู้ใดกันที่กำลังจะออกเดินทางไปหามาดูแล้วสงสัยว่าหนังจะทำอย่างไรให้หนังทุกภาคมาเชื่อมต่อกันได้แบบไม่มองแถจนถึงน่าตลก
บอกเลยว่าทำเป็นดียิ่งกว่าที่คิดอย่างไม่ต้องสงสัย
มิได้มีช่องโหว่ของพล็อตมากมายเท่าที่คิดไว้ในตอนแรก
เนื่องจากว่าหนังวางบทกับเรื่องราวเอาไว้ก้าวหน้า
ผู้แสดงทั้งคู่สมัยเข้ามาอยู่ร่วมกันได้แบบแนบเนียนอย่างยิ่งจริงๆ
ถึงภาคนี้จะดูราวกับว่าทำออกมาเพื่อล้างบางประวัติศาสตร์ของ
X - Men ( เพื่อรีบูทใหม่โน่นล่ะ )
แม้กระนั้นด้วยความเนียนนี้คาดว่าไม่ว่าจะติ่งเวอร์ชั่นออริจินัลหรือติ่งเวอร์ชั่น
X - Men : First Class ก็คงจะชอบใจไม่แพ้กัน โดยทั่วไปแล้วหนังแนวๆวีรบุรุษชอบมีแกนหลักของเรื่องในแบบที่วีรบุรุษก็คือวีรบุรุษ ตัวร้ายก็คือตัวร้าย เป็นแยกข้างกันอย่างแจ่มแจ้งแบบขาวกับดำ เวลาที่แฟรนไชน์หนัง
X - Men หนังค่อนจะมีมิติมากยิ่งกว่านั้น ลึกกว่า สลับซับซ้อนกว่า เพราะเหตุว่าผู้แสดงหลายตัวในหัวข้อนั้นมี “ สีเท า ” สามารถทำเป็นทุกๆสิ่งทุกๆอย่างตามอุดมการณ์ของตน
แม้ว่าอุดมการณ์ที่มีจะเป็นสิ่งที่ถูก(ตามความนึกคิดของตน)
แม้กระนั้นถ้าหากจะต้องทำในสิ่งไม่ดีเพื่อบรรลุเป้าหมายก็จะยอมทำ…สรุปว่าไปดูเหอะ
บอกเลยว่ามันเยี่ยมมาก โดยยิ่งไปกว่านั้นใจความสำคัญหัวข้อการแถที่แนบเนียน ซึ่งมันเนียนจริงๆจนกระทั่งสามารถรีเซตจักรวาล
X - Men แล้วสร้างภาคต่อแบบนับหนึ่งใหม่ได้แบบสบายๆอย่างยิ่งจริงๆ

Many of the Glasgow women admitted assaulting a partner
The Glasgow Caledonian students were among 6,500 women surveyed from 36 universities for an international study into attitudes on domestic violence .
Of the 200 women , 60 % said it was acceptable for women to hit their husbands while 35 % admitted assaulting their partner .
A total of 8 % admitted injuring them - the highest rate in the study .
The injured men suffered bruises , cuts or broken bones .
Among European students , only English women were more likely to have carried out assaults , with 41 % admitting that they had punched or kicked their partners .
We need make the same ' big deal ' about violence by women as we do about men who behave violently
Murray Straus
Report co-author
However those inflicting injury was less than in Scotland , at 5 % .
Just under a quarter of those in Scotland admitted there were occasions when it would be acceptable for a husband to slap his wife .
Worldwide , more than 4,800 female students approved of assaulting their partner and 2,000 admitted to pushing , shoving , slapping , throwing objects and twisting their partner 's arms or hair .
The findings , printed in the Sunday Times , will be published next month in the European Journal of Criminology .
' Bottom line '
Professor Murray Straus , co-author of the study , told the paper there was a need for better rehabilitation programmes for women with violent tendencies .
" This study raises questions about why there 's so much violence between partners whether they 're married , cohabiting or dating , " he said .
" The bottom line is that we need make the same ' big deal ' about violence by women as we do about men who behave violently . "
In recent years , the Scottish Executive has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on raising awareness of domestic abuse , including a helpline for victims which received more than 20,000 calls in 2005 - an increase of 38 % on the previous year .
David Smith , honorary professor of criminology at Edinburgh university and editor of the European Journal of Criminology , said he found the results " surprising " .
" The number of women who admit to assaulting men is interesting as it's well known that men are more violent than woman . "
Spokesman : Fox News may have bias against Ron Paul Associated Press

This ABC and Fox News Channel are narrowing the field of presidential candidates invited to debates this weekend just before the New Hampshire primary , in Fox 's case infuriating supporters of Republican Rep. Ron Paul .
The roster of participants for ABC 's back - to - back , prime - time Republican and Democratic debates Saturday in New Hampshire will be determined after results of Thursday 's Iowa caucus become clear .
Fox , meanwhile , has invited five GOP candidates to a forum with Chris Wallace scheduled for its mobile studio in New Hampshire on Sunday .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee received invites , leaving Paul of Texas and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California on the sidelines .
The network said it had limited space in its studio -- a souped - up bus -- and that it invited candidates who had received double - digit support in recent polls .
In a nationwide poll conducted December 14 - 20 by The Associated Press and Yahoo , Thompson had the support of 11 percent of GOP voters and Paul was at 3 percent .
Paul 's support is at 6 percent in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted in early December .
Paul was tied with Thompson for fifth in New Hampshire in the most recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , each with the support of 4 percent of likely voters .
Among all New Hampshire voters , Paul led Thompson 6 percent to 4 percent , but that was within the poll 's margin of error .
Do n't Miss Jesse Benton , Paul 's spokesman , said it was a " big mistake " not to include Paul , especially given Paul 's recent success in fundraising .
He said the campaign has been trying to reach Fox News to get an explanation for the decision , but its calls had not been returned .
" There very well might be some bias , " Benton said .
" Ron brings up some topics that are n't very popular with Fox News , as in fiscal responsibility and withdrawing from the war in Iraq ... that does leave us scratching our heads a little bit about whether it was deliberate .
Based on metrics , I do n't see how you can possibly exclude Dr. Paul . "
Some livid Paul supporters are distributing e-mails calling for a boycott of Fox advertisers .
A
Fox representative did not immediately return calls for comment about the complaints .
Paul has been invited to a GOP forum that Fox News is sponsoring in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , on January 10 , Benton said .
To participate in ABC's Saturday night debate , Republican and Democratic candidates must meet at least one of three benchmarks : place first through fourth in Iowa , poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major New Hampshire surveys , or poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major national surveys .
ABC News anchor Charles Gibson said the criteria were actually quite inclusive .
He defended the network taking the initiative in effectively narrowing the field at a point when no actual voters had cast a ballot , except for Iowa caucus - goers .
" You will have had a year 's politicking , " he said .
" You will have had , I think by count , about 641 debates .
You will have had national polls and state polls and one state 's vote .
I think that 's pretty indicative . "
Gibson said ABC explained the rules for participation in a conference call with all the campaigns and " nobody said , " How dare you ! ' "
We present decidable logic programs for addition , multiplication , division with remainder , exponentiation , and logarithm with remainder over the unbounded domain of natural numbers .
Our predicates represent relations without mode restrictions or annotations .
They are fully decidable under the common , DFS - like , SLD resolution strategy of Prolog or under an interleaving refinement of DFS ...
[ The ] attempts to define decidable multiplication even for the seemingly trivial unary case show the difficulties that become more pronounced as we move to binary arithmetic .
We rely on a finite representation of infinite domains , precise instantiatedness analysis , and reasoning about SLD using search trees .
So you 've read The Reasoned Schemer and were excited about the fact that unlike the built - in operations in Prolog , arithmetic relations ( over binary numbers ) were fully implemented .
For example , addition could also be used for subtraction and multiplication for factoring numbers and for generating all triples of numbers related by multiplication .
Now comes this paper to explain the motivation behind some of the more arcane definitions needed to implement arithmetic in a fully relational style , and to prove their properties formally .
The paper develops unary and binary arithmetic relations in pure Prolog ( with no cuts , negation or introspection ) .
LtU readers will also be interested in yet another embedding of pure Prolog into Haskell , that the authors offer .
It is not meant to be the most optimal or convenient Prolog implementation ( it was n't even intended to be an implementation of a logic system ) .
It was explicitly designed to be easier to reason about and so help prove certain properties of SLD or similar evaluation strategies .
The main difference of DefinitionTree from other embeddings of Prolog in Haskell has to do with the generation of fresh names for logic variables .
In DefinitionTree , name generation is not an effect , and the naming is fully decoupled from the evaluation .
The evaluation no longer needs to carry a state for the generation of fresh names , hence the evaluator is easier to reason about equationally .
I ’m worried about the University of Colorado , the school where I earned my doctorate .
Last night , in one of the more controversial moves in some time , the CU Board of Regents elected Bruce Benson to be the university ’s new president .
The 6 - 3 vote fell along party lines and marked the first time in nearly 35 years that a president has been approved by a split vote .
The main point in favor of Benson seems to be his reputation as a fund - raiser , and there ’s no question that CU needs somebody to bring more money into the system .
CU has been hamstrung ever since the early 1990s , when perennial pigfucker Douglas Bruce managed to get Amendment 1 passed .
That particular “ taxpayer ’s bill of rights ” ( TABOR ) has not served the state well , and education in particular has suffered .
TABOR Has Contributed to Declines in Colorado K - 12 Education Funding Under TABOR , Colorado declined from 35th to 49th in the nation in K - 12 spending as a percentage of personal income .
Coloradoâ€™s average per-pupil funding fell by more than $ 400 relative to the national average .
Coloradoâ€™s average teacher salary compared to average pay in other occupations declined from 30th to 50th in the nation .
TABOR Has Played a Major Role in the Significant Cuts Made in Higher Education Funding Under TABOR , higher education funding per resident student dropped by 31 percent after adjusting for inflation .
College and university funding as a share of personal income declined from 35th to 48th in the nation .
Tuitions have risen as a result .
In the last four years [ 2001 - 2005 ] system - wide resident tuition increased by 21 percent ( adjusting for inflation ) .
One of the results is that the state is n’t producing enough quality grads to meet the labor demand here .
Despite the number of its public colleges , Colorado does not produce enough graduates of its own to meet the demand from local companies , according to a study released Monday on the impact of public higher education in the state .
…
The report highlights a trend that companies will have to begin relying more on “ importing ” educated workers , Clark said . ”
The report shows that we have these high incomes and this highly educated workforce but that we ’re still near the bottom in the country as far as funding in higher education goes , ” he said .
“ We do n’t spend much time growing our own children into the workers that can take advantage of the job opportunities technology is creating . ”
…
“ Increased funding equates to more jobs that are better - paying , a more efficient workforce , higher standards of living and other tangible and intangible benefits , ” she said .
…
A well - trained workforce plus the ability to provide specific industry - based training is the top priority for companies seeking to relocate or expand to Colorado , the study says .
So if the contention is that CU needs to get serious about getting more money into the system , you ’ll find no argument here .
Further , even Benson ’s detractors do n’t indict his potential as a development official .
The problem is that being a university president is about a lot more than fund - raising , and on any number of other criteria Benson ’s appointment is troubling , at best .
His candidacy encountered significant and vocal oppositon from students and the faculty assembly opposed hiring him by a vote of 40 - 4 .
That the regents would ignore this kind of landslide opposition from its professorate is disturbing , although perhaps not unexpected .
Colorado ’s regents are elected in a process that ’s subject to the worst kinds of anti-intellectual partisan claptrap , and citizens who truly understand and value the role of education in the state have long had reason to dread Republican majorities .
The case against Benson is laid out in spades in a document circulated on February 11 by Dr. Margaret LeCompte of the CU Department of Education and president of the Boulder campus ’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors .
I encourage you to read the entire indictment , but the following points are especially troubling for me .
His affiliation with ACTA , an organization dedicated to eroding the status and qualifications of senior academic officers , a move that seems aimed at empowering non-academic administrative entities .
Most colleges need more PhD - level authority , not less , and no university of CU ’s stature should be in the business of deminishing the power of its intellectual component .
He can say he plans on leaving academic decisions to academic officers , but that ’s not consistent with ACTA ’s history .
ACTA is also affiliated with David Horowitz , a reactionary faux - consumer rights shill - for - hire asshat of the first order , and while I try to avoid getting all ad hominem if possible , Horowitz is in a rare class of people ( along with folks like George Bush and Dick Cheney ) ; if they ’re for it , the rest of us should probably be against it .
Benson poses a dramatic threat to the contractual rights of tenured faculty .
Quoting from LeCompte ’s document : “ Upon his installation as President of Metropolitan State Universityâ€™s Board of Trustees , he had the Faculty Handbook completely re-written without discussion or consultation with the faculty .
( The person rumored to have done the job had previously re-written the management guide for Quizno ’s ) .
In the new Faculty Handbook , the RIF ( Reduction in Force ) policy was changed so that in case of a financial shortfall ( not exigency ) , rank or tenure no longer need be considered in decisions about elimination of teaching positions .
He then fired tenured faculty .
Metro faculty sued , and the case still is in the courts .
What would Benson do to further weaken faculty rights and due process at CU ? ”
Frankly , this is all I ’d need for a no vote were I a regent .
( I once contemplated running for regent , actually , and if I thought I had a chance of winning it ’s something I might well take up again in the future . )
Benson has never taught , researched or been an administrator and holds only a Bachelor ’s degree , placing him among the 1 % least educated college presidents in America .
He would not be eligible to hold tenure at CU , and this is a very big deal in a university .
It undermines his ability to earn the respect of those he must lead , it makes it difficult for him to comprehend the university ’s critical research programs , it leaves him unable to contribute meaningfully to discussions about the school ’s teaching mission , and it raises a very real question about his ability to respect the achievements of his PhD - level faculty .
He may be able to build bridges and forge a bipartisan spirit , but there ’s nothing in his history to suggest that this is the smart way to bet .
He co-founded the Trailhead Group , a 527 that exists pretty much to bash Democrats , with Pete Coors and former governor Bill “ Today Colorado is on Fire ” Owens ( a man who did more in service of the state ’s War on Education than anyone since Doug Bruce ) .
Oh yeah – he does n’t believe in global warming .
Not that this would have anything to do with his background as an oil executive or that it would in any way impact university research programs in this area ( or , for that matter , the state ’s increasing profile as a center for research and development of alternative fuels ) .
I have so many questions I want to ask Benson .
Questions like :
Why should we expect you to be different in the future than you ’ve ever been in the past ?
Do you understand why tenure matters ?
Can you describe your vision of academic freedom ?
Do you understand the difference between education and training ?
What intellectuals have most influenced your view of the proper role of the academy in a democratic society ?
I ’m not optimistic about the presidency of Bruce Benson .
I fear the university I love so much has sold itself to the devil .
I hope I ’m wrong , but I would n’t bet a plug nickel on the man .
I have no doubt that he ’ll raise money .
I just worry what he ’ll do with it .

Deep sleep is associated with changes that affect metabolism
The US team discovered that volunteers who were roused whenever they were about to fall into the deepest sleep developed insulin resistance .
This inability of the body to recognise normal insulin signals leads to high blood sugar levels , weight gain and , eventually , even type 2 diabetes .
The study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Strategies to improve sleep duration and quality should be considered as a potential intervention to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes
Dr Esra Tasali
Previous studies have shown an association with diabetes and a lack of sleep .
It is also already known that the deepest sleep , known as slow - wave sleep , is associated with changes that affect metabolism .
Brain patterns
To test the impact of sleep quality on blood glucose control , nine healthy men and women were first monitored for two consecutive nights to see what their normal sleep patterns were .
Then on the following three nights , the research team woke them with a loud noise when they drifted into deep sleep - characterised by long slow - moving delta waves in the brain .
The amount of overall sleep they had was unchanged .
After injecting the volunteers with glucose and measuring their daytime blood sugar levels and insulin response , the researchers found that eight of them had become less sensitive to insulin .
Lead researcher Dr Ersa Tasali , of the University of Chicago , said there was an alarming rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes associated with an ageing population and increased obesity and it was important to understand the factors that promote its development .
" We had shown previously that restricting sleep duration in healthy young adults results in decreased glucose tolerance .
" The current data further indicate that not only reduced sleep duration but also reduced sleep quality may play a role in diabetes risk .
" The current evidence suggests that strategies to improve sleep duration and quality should be considered as a potential intervention to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in at - risk populations . "
Dr Tasali added that chronic shallow sleep and diabetes are typical factors associated with ageing and more research was needed to find out if age - related changes in sleep quality contribute to such metabolic changes .

Julia sexily learns of being cast as an aristocrat in a Merchant Ivory film
* GOOD LUCK AT THE OSCARS ON SUNDAY TILDA !
In a thrilling development for both left - wing politics and the thinly lipped , has been named Australia 's 2nd most sexy woman ( or , according to the dubiously erudite , the second " most sexiest " ) .
It 's clear that such a public endorsement of the Deputy Prime Minister 's breathtaking sensuality was merely a matter of time .
Now that it 's been predictably but sensibly acknowledged , we can set about castingwith some seriously Hollywood ambition .
There 's really only one woman for the role .
With the same style and confidence with which Julia herself sashayed into the country 's runner - up position at Australia 's most recent political pageant , so has one individual announced herself as the logical candidate for the singular role of Julia Eileen Gillard .
That 's right - Scottish actress , one of the most memorable and high profile bloodnuts the world has seen .
Tilda is an entertainment marvel , delivering Oscar - calibre acting turns inand most recentlyand
She is also the only human capable of turning up to a media - saturated awards function with no make - up draped in a kimono - themed stage curtain adorned with 100 dead tarantulas and still appear elegant .
That was last week at the BAFTAs , where she won Best Supporting Actress forin which she played a ruthless , amoral and critically self - doubting corporate lawyer .
That only one of these words applies to the splendid Julia Eileen Gillard is no barrier to Tilda 's suitability for the latter role .
Why ?
Well , for starters , politicians answer a lot of questions , sometimes even over the phone .
Tilda is highly skilled at the latter pursuit .
She also bears more than a passing resemblance to Ms Gillard .
It is , however , true that Tilda carries a necklace rather more dramatically than her potential muse .
But that takes nothing away from the striking sense of perfection inherent in this piece of casting .
How might one talk to Tilda and Julia 's respective ' people ' about such a project ?
Oh , does it not simply ring of a classic - in - the - making ?
Can you not imagine Julia sticking it toin the climacticscene ?
Incidentally , this intriguing piece of punctuation is also called a( pronounced ' tilda ' ) :
It 's a Spanish word , from the Latin , meaning ' title ' , such as ' MP ' .
Linguistically , it sits daintily atop some letters in some languages to designate a change in pronunciation , such as nasalisation , as exemplified by any word pronounced by Julia Eileen Gillard .
The web is quite mouse - centric .
Ever tried navigating a typical website without your mouse ?
I 'm not saying it can't be done -- if you 're sufficiently motivated , you can indeed navigate the web using nothing but your keyboard -- but it 's painful .
There 's nothing wrong with the point - and - click navigation model of the mouse , although it can degenerate into mystery meat navigation if you 're not careful .
I do n't expect web designers to create keyboard - centric websites ; the mouse is a natural and intuitive enough way to navigate web sites .
But so is the keyboard , in certain circumstances .
What frustrates me is when web developers fail to pay attention to the most rudimentary of keyboard support in their designs .
Let 's pick on eBay .
Here 's the eBay signin form .
This form is a perfect example of keyboard navigation trumping mouse navigation .
Done right , it reduces user interface friction to a minimum :
Type your user name Press Tab to advance to the next field Type your password Press Enter
Of course , that assumes the user knows how to use the keyboard .
In my experience , this is not a safe assumption .
I 've seen many users log in using the excruciatingly slow mouse way , and it 's not pretty .
At the risk of creating a legion of back seat drivers , I suggest that when you see coworkers users using the mouse to log in , you should gently -- gently -- let them know that they might be able to save some time by sticking with the keyboard for these little online forms .
I 'm not saying you should go commando , but a tiny bit of keyboard expertise will serve you in good stead .
This is an incredibly simple little login form .
And yet there are at least three ways web developers can screw this form up for keyboard use .
That 's why I added the caveat done right , above .
It almost never is , and keyboard users always seem to get the shaft .
To make this HTML form work properly with keyboard input , the eBay developers have to :
Set the focus to the first field so I can start typing in my user ID .
Structure the HTML form fields so that when I press the Tab key , it advances through them in a logical order .
Ensure that the HTML form submits when I press the Enter key .
You might expect the tab order on the eBay login form to proceed in the same order you read the form ( in Western cultures , anyway ) :
If so , you would be wrong .
I guess two out of three ain't bad .
The tab order , for some unknown reason , goes directly from Password to the Sign In button , completely skipping over the " remember me " checkbox directly under it .
This is a mild omission , to be sure .
I 've seen far worse , web forms with tab orders that resembled a Rubik 's cube .
But tab order on a login form is so fundamental -- when web developers screw up basic tab ordering on a form with four fields , that 's veering dangerously close to " I do n't give a damn about my craft " territory .
All the developers you know remember to test their web forms using the keyboard .
Right ?
But even if developers do remember to test for basic keyboard behavior , there 's a deeper problem here .
Keyboard navigation relies heavily on the focus .
In order to move from one area to the next , you have to be able to reliably know where you are .
Unfortunately , web browsers make it needlessly difficult to tell where the focus is .
Can you tell which field has the focus in Internet Explorer 7 ?
I think it 's fair to call that incredibly subtle .
Let 's see how Firefox 2 does .
Wow .
Good luck with that .
Now how about the same form in Safari 3 ?
No wonder users rely on the mouse so much .
Most browsers do an embarassingly bad job of making the focus obvious , so users feel compelled to click on fields to orient themselves .
The focus behavior is just as bad when the focus moves to the sign in button .
It 's technically an image masquerading as a button , but this is still a fairly common technique ; it should be handled well .
Is it ?
Internet Explorer 7 Firefox 2 Safari 3
Of the three , only Safari really gets focus right in my estimation .
Here 's hoping the next versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer copy this more obvious focus indicator .
If users can orient themselves using a clear , unambiguous focus , they 're a lot more likely to warm up to a little time - saving keyboard navigation .

PARIS – Goodbye " e- mail , " the French government says , and hello " courriel " — the term that linguistically sensitive France is now using to refer to electronic mail in official documents .
The Culture Ministry has announced a ban on the use of " e- mail " in all government ministries , documents , publications or websites , the latest step to stem an incursion of English words into the French lexicon .
The ministry 's General Commission on Terminology and Neology insists Internet surfers in France are broadly using the term " courrier electronique " ( electronic mail ) instead of e-mail — a claim some industry experts dispute .
" Courriel " is a fusion of the two words .
" Evocative , with a very French sound , the word ' courriel ' is broadly used in the press and competes advantageously with the borrowed ' mail ' in English , " the commission said .
The move to ban " e- mail " was announced last week after the decision was published in the official government register on June 20 .
Courriel is a term that has often been used in French - speaking Quebec , the commission said .
The 7 - year - old commission has links to the Academie Francaise , the prestigious institution that has been one of the top opponents of allowing English terms to seep into French .
Some Internet industry experts say the decision is artificial and does n't reflect reality .
" The word ' courriel ' is not at all actively used , " Marie - Christine Levet , president of French Internet service provider Club Internet , said Friday .
" E - mail has sunk in to our values . "
She said Club Internet was n't changing the words it uses .
" Protecting the language is normal , but e-mail 's so assimilated now that no one thinks of it as American , " she said .
" Courriel would just be a new word to launch . "
The Myth of the Oppressed Japanese Women David Thomas , in Not Guilty 
In Defence of the Modern Man , dispels the myth of the oppressed Japanese Women .
Not Guilty ... although [ British ] men have marginally more influence in six out of the eleven categories , in none of them do they have the dominance enjoyed by women in their most influential areas .
The overall average works out at a marginal advantage for the female partner by 51 to 49 .
It is also worth noting that the two strongest areas for men  motor and health insurance  have to be considered in the light of the fact that , for white - collar workers at least , both may well be included as part of a man 's professional remuneration .
So the women 's lack of influence should not be taken to imply male power : it 's just that he 's abandoned his wife 's decision - making in favour of his boss's .
Either way , he 's the junior partner .
This phenomenon is by no means confined to British society .
In fact , it might even be true to say that the more that a society appears to be financially biased in favour of men , the more the reverse is actually the case .
In Japan , for example , men still hold the vast majority of positions of executive and political power ; feminism has made nothing like the strides there that it has in the West .
Japanese wives are seen by their Occidental sisters as hapless servants , waiting hand and foot on their male masters , like geisha girls ready to provide everything that their man might require .
The truth , however , appears to be rather different .
As a Japanese salary man slaves away at the absurdly long hours that can , as we have seen , induce premature death , or karoshi , his wife is out enjoying the fruits of his labours .
A Japanese woman has the same lock on the family finances as her Western counterparts , a privilege that merely adds to the traditional power that she enjoys as the matriarchal ruler of the family home .
For the purposes of public 82 This Working Life consumption , she may play the dutiful helpmeet .
But in private , she 's the boss .
The Japanese name for a domineering , dictatorial wife is obatalian .
So common is the species that in 1992 Fuji Television launched a series called Obatalian Watching .
In the words of Joanna Pitman , reporting from Tokyo for The Times : ' A group of scowling harridans were unwittingly filmed on one of their power - shopping sprees , swarming through sales like locusts , dolling themselves up in Chanel suits and Italian shoes .
The cameras then followed them onto a crowded underground train where they were seen doing battle for seats armed with designer handbags and umbrellas .
The obatalian gets what she wants .
' The comedy of the series depends on the gap between social pretension and reality .
Everyone knows that if the cameras were to arrive at her home , the obatalian would slip into her public role as the simpering wife who selflessly tends to the needs of her husband . '
Social attitudes towards the family 's supposed patriarch can be guessed from the title of a popular Japanese comic book series ( the Japanese consume manga , or adult comic books , with a voracity and seriousness unknown in the West ) .
It is called Stupid Dad .
Its hero  if that is the right word  is eerily reminiscent of the hopelessly inadequate male to be found in so many British TV commercials ( and Japanese ones , come to that ) .
After a hard day of ritual humiliation at the workplace , he comes home for more of the same at the hands of his wife and daughters : virulent shrews who would give Regan and Goneril a thoroughly good run for their money .
Bossed at work and bullied at home ... no wonder the poor old Japanese male spends so much time getting drunk in karaoke bars ....

The editorial review shown at amazon.com pertains correctly to David Thomas ' book , but the book description shown there has nothing to do with the book .
Is that another manifestation of the feminist plot to downplay and diminish the importance of David Thomas ' book ?
After all , the feminists managed to make the book almost disappear .
Commentaries that do better justice to Not Guilty : Alan Barron , Convenor , The Institute of Men's Studies ( Melbourne , Australia ) says this about the book in the context of The problem which has no name : David Thomas , in his book " Not Guilty - In Defence of the Modern Man " ( Weidenfeld & Nicolson , London 1993 , p.63 ) writes : " It is not often that a dominant class legislates its own downfall with quite as much thoroughness as the parliaments of the Western World , filled as they are with men passing equal opportunities legislation in favour of women , have done . "
In fact men have not only shot themselves in the foot but blown their leg off as well , apparently without feeling a thing !
But men are suffering .
They die earlier , form the bulk of the unemployed and the homeless , often receive a raw deal in the family court , are under - represented at our tertiary institutions , yet barely a squeak from men .
Hence the problem with no name .
Kevin Goh , at Gender Spread feels that ,
In contrast [ to " the somewhat negative , repetitive , even whingeing tone of the [ The Myth of Male Power , by Warren Farrell ] , there is David Thomas , author of Not Guilty .
Unlike the American basis of Farrell 's book , Thomas adopts a British - based , but much more holistic perspective - and where Farrell 's background in academia and politics involves speaking to captive audiences who do not have the freedom to leave the room , Thomas is a product of the competitive and slick world of British glossy magazine journalism ; ( an industry which he notes , is one of the few that is dominated by women ) .
Unlike Farrell 's lacklustre style , here is someone who is used to having to entertain as well as to inform , who is used to fighting to keep an audience .
Not Guilty is therefore a far superior book , combining rhetorical style with statistical argument .
Thomas also uses personal anecdotes and interviews , thus adding a strongly human dimension to his raw figures and studies .
Far from weakening the force of the book , this actually adds to the argument , making it much easier for the audience to relate to the book .
J.R. Nyquist , in Men are pigs ( WorldNetDaily Exclusive Commentary , July 20 , 2000 ) Several years ago David Thomas wrote an excellent book [ whose title is ] , " Not Guilty : In Defence of the Modern Man . "
One of his chapters is called " The Myth of the Bad Man . "
Thomas shows that today 's intellectual elite is creating a myth that men are violent and violence is male .
A huge cottage industry has grown up to demonstrate that within families , men are a bad influence -- a necessary evil at best .
" Meanwhile , " asks Thomas , " why wo n't anyone have the courage and the honesty to confront and deal with abuse carried out by women ? "
There is no balance , says Thomas , who writes of a " pattern of prejudice " in social science itself .
Thomas argues that today 's accepted orthodoxy holds " that all abusers are male . ... "
This is especially true in the area of sexual harassment .
The organization of hatred along sexual lines is , in my view , the most troubling intellectual trend in modern thought today .
The next time you hear somebody say that men are pigs -- or some similar comment -- you might want to object ....
Right !
The cover of Not Guilty successfully sums up the spirit of the book in an adaptation of Michel Angelo 's Creation of Adam : Men are okay !
I found Not Guilty to be considerably more positive and informative than Warren Farrell 's books , such as The Myth of Male Power .
After all , Warren Farrell is a power - feminist that appears to want to empower women through normalizing men down and through portraying men as victims of neglect and vilification .

Jan. 1 , 2007  --
To many people , as Kevin Michael Connolly traveled the world , he was many things — most of them not even remotely connected to reality .
" This woman walked up to me , did n't say hello or anything , just said , ' Thalidomide ' in a questioning tone , " Connolly said .
Then she told him it was a drug that had caused birth defects after it was given to pregnant mothers .
" Was that you ? " she asked .
Other people presumed he was a beggar , or even a holy man .
But children were different .
" By and large , " said Connolly , " a little kid would look at you and just go , ' Aw , wow . ' "
The reality about Connolly is much more remarkable than the scenarios people imagine about him — especially when seen through the art of his camera , from an angle he 's known for all 22 years of his life .
" I was born without legs , " said Connolly , matter - of - factly .
" This is all I 've known , and to me , it 's not really a big deal .
I think it was called a ' sporadic birth defect , ' which is basically the doctors saying they do n't know what happened . "
He often travels by balancing his torso on a skateboard , and moving expertly through the streets of the cities he visits .
From the skateboard , he has taken more than 32,000 photos of the stares he attracts .
Some are displayed on an Internet site , therollingexhibition.com .
They are riveting , sometimes humorous , examples of human nature in different cultures , where , with each stare , people also form quick and even fanciful interpretations of who Connolly is , and why .
Living Without Legs , Without a Wheelchair
Connolly is a senior who studies film and photography at Montana State University .
He has short - cropped brown hair , good looks and an affable , open demeanor .
His upper torso is fully formed , large - boned , muscular and trim .
His internal organs are healthy .
He rejected the prosthetic legs with which he was fitted when he was young , because they were uncomfortable and made it difficult for him to move freely .
Instead , he wears what he calls a " boot " to cover his lower body .
It is a rounded device that fits perfectly around his lower torso and protects it as he moves .
" The boot is fully custom made and it actually serves two purposes , " Connolly said .
" One is , it 's basically a shoe , you know ?
You have a Birkenstock sole … and the whole goal is to imitate the practicality of footwear . "
It is also a posture - correcting device .
Inside the boot , Connolly has written the words " Do not steal , especially if you 're a middle - aged woman . "
One time , when he left it under a bench to ski , two women mistook it for something they could use as a flower pot and walked off with it .
The freedom that characterizes his life has been a component since the beginning .
" My parents made the decision to not put me in a wheelchair or a hospital .
They just took me home . "
Family photos from his home in Montana show a young man camping out , rock climbing and skiing so well in his custom rig , that he won a silver medal in the January 2007 X Games .
But not before he flipped down a mountainside once and broke his jaw on an avalanche fence .
" I have a steel plate here , " Connolly said , pointing to his left jaw .
" So , I can't feel it .
It was , I think , seven or eight days before I was scheduled to leave for New Zealand for a year .
And so , I postponed it for a couple days , had my jaw wired shut and then went . "
Being Stared At
As a Montana State University student , Connolly seized the opportunity to study abroad and travel .
With his skateboard , he used his time in an exchange program in New Zealand to explore the country on his own , staying in youth hostels .
Money he won in the X Games helped finance more travel in Europe .
If you can imagine the reaction to Connolly , roaming through a new city on his skateboard , in a way , that was what led to an extraordinary collection of photographic work that began on the spur of the moment in Vienna , Austria .
" I was rolling down a street in Vienna , and had just left New Zealand , and was a bit bummed out , " Connolly said .
" I had n't seen my family in about a year , and I 'd left a whole group of friends behind .
And so , I was by myself , having to deal with stares . …
I was just kind of sick of being stared at , and I was looking back with my lens . "
He snapped a photograph of a man staring at him .
He liked it , and he began to routinely take pictures of people staring as he rolled by on his skateboard .
He holds his camera low , around the edge of the skateboard .
The camera is attached to his wrist by a buckle .
He aims the lens instinctively , because he can't look through the viewfinder from such a near - to - the - street position .
The photographs Connolly captures illustrate , in its many forms , the compulsive curiosity that , in an instant , can pull people out of their everyday situations to stare .
Shifting the Public Gaze
" I do the same thing , " said Connolly .
" I 'm not above that , by any means .
And if I saw a no -legged guy in the street — hell , yes , I would stare . "
People not only stared at him , but from culture to culture , they made up their own narratives about who he was .
In the Ukraine , people thought he was a beggar .
" They would stick money into my hands or backpack .
And that 's where the seed of the idea started to come — people really need to be able to tell a story , to be able to place you in a context within their own world .
The narratives … change from country to country , " Connolly said .
" They can be completely different from place to place . "
He was also mistaken for a holy man and a member of a carnival act .
In Romania , some thought he was a gypsy .
In Sarajevo , Bosnia , he said , there was a sadness to the narratives people invented when they saw him , in a country where the sight of war victims is still all too common .
Many people assumed he had been injured by a bomb when he was a child , during the fierce fighting of the mid-1990s .
" That was … tough … that week in Sarajevo , " said Connolly .
" I was capitalizing on this urge for people to make up narratives in their head .
And I was unearthing this history that , in some ways , I was n't sure if I had a right to . "
When he finally returned to Montana in August 2007 , Connolly was mistaken for an Iraq War veteran .
What he had collected , by his senior year , were more than 32,000 photographs , and an abundance of memories , as he moved through a world of changing cultures and shifting impressions , where the truth is the most direct narrative of all .
He is an accomplished , adventurous man , who was born without legs .
Challenging Common Assumptions
Connolly is motivated to continue at warp speed , because he is n't sure how long he will be as physically fit as he is .
" I 'm using my arms … about twice as much as anyone else would , " Connolly said .
" The thing that I use as a motivator a lot of times , is to tell myself that I , maybe , have 10 years before my shoulders and my back go , and I wo n't be able to do what I 'm doing now .
The whole idea is really just to keep me moving , so that by the time I 'm 30 , hopefully , I 'm where I want to be in my career , and I 've done all these projects that I 'm capable of doing now . "
He also finds that people are curious about his personal life .
He has a girlfriend — someone he met in New Zealand .
But he wo n't elaborate on their relationship .
" The questions people ask me — ' how do you go to the bathroom ? … …
How do you get up on counters ?
How do you cook ? ' — all these things do n't really bug me , anymore , " Connolly said .
" That 's largely due to the fact that I 'm older , and that that 's what I 'm capitalizing on in this photography project — utilizing those questions and that curiosity for my own benefit . "
In fact , people are welcome to ask all the questions they want about Connolly 's adventures .
They should also be prepared to ask a few questions of themselves .
" I like making it difficult for people , " Connolly said .
" I do n't want to give people the luxury of staring at someone who 's weird — giving a pat on the back for some accomplishment , or for just getting through day to day — and moving on .
I do n't want to make it that easy for people . "
" I think that … the job of any photographer , or anyone who can call themself an artist , is to make people question what they do on reflex … to make people question a value or an idea that 's so common , that people have n't really looked at it yet .
And so , right now , what I 'm standing for … it 's that . "
N.C. Aizenman , Washington Post
A privately convened commission of labor and immigrant advocates held the first of several planned nationwide hearings yesterday to publicize allegations that U.S. immigration officials routinely violate constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure during workplace raids .
At the gathering at the Hay - Adams hotel in the District , witnesses and members of the 10 - person panel accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials of using arrest warrants for a limited number of illegal immigrants who work at a given company as a pretext to detain the entire workforce , including many U.S. citizens , while agents determine whether there are additional illegal immigrants among them . Â
“ Tens of millions of workers in America go to work every day without . . . an awareness that at their workplaces , without any warning , they could be swept up in a massive raid conducted by heavily armed government agents , ” said Joe Hansen , president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and chairman of the National Commission on ICE Misconduct and Violations of 4th Amendment Rights .
“ Workers are not aware that they could be detained at gunpoint .
That they could be handcuffed .
. . .
That they could be denied any contact with family members or legal counsel . ”

Here 's a wrinkle I do n't think we 'd planned on .
I just dinged 60 on the server that my husband has been playing on since he started playing .
Long story short , my first character was on a different server so that I could play with a female friend of mine .
I 'd made an alt type character on my husband 's server but did n't play her much .
When I finally got fed up with the server my main was on ( the only decent person there was my friend as far as I could find ) I moved over to Stonemaul permanently .
I ditched my half - assed attempt at an undead mage , rolled up my druid and was good to go .
Well , now months later I 'm finally level 60 and my husband and I are both in the same guild .
I 'll be starting my raids with them this week actually .
The problem ?
We have two small children who need to eat dinner and raids start at 5 pm .
Ack !
How are we going to make dinner ?!
There are no problems with the kids running around playing and such while we raid .
They 're already used to that , they play in the computer room and we can get them things that they need ( you know , cups of juice , snacks , what have you ) when we have breaks .
Before it was easy because if I was running an instance and in the middle of combat my husband might be in a a space between pulls where he could safely go afk for 30 seconds you know .
But now we 'll be on the same schedule essentially .
We both play support classes too ( he 's a holy priest , I 'm a resto druid ) so the guild ideally would want us to both be in a forty man raid .
It 's not like we can easily switch off any raid nights other than say , ZG and AQ20 runs .
It 's more of a logistics problem than a real stressor .
It 's just that it had n't really occured to me when I joined his guild that eventually we'd both be raiding on the same nights and thus on the same schedule game - wise .
For tonight , since dinner is already thawed out , I 'm just planning on eating with the kids at 4 pm ( about two hours earlier than our normal dinnertime ) and letting them snack when they get hungry later one .
We 'll make a plate for my husband ( who does n't usually get home from work until just about invite time ) to heat up and that will take care of tonight .
But what about the rest of the week ?
The rest of the time I 'm raiding .
I suspect that it will be me who shows up to fewer raids , because I 'm the mama after all and that 's who the kids often want .
Ack , who'd of thunk that the social problems of parenthood in America would follow me into Azeroth :o
The row is the latest to overshadow the Doha Round trade talks
The WTO has begun an investigation into US support for soya , wheat , corn , rice and other crops .
It comes after the US Senate passed a $ 286bn farm bill , following a similar bill from the House of Representatives .
The US has been accused of unfairly helping its farmers , but the US says its farm programmes meet WTO rules .
The issue has been a major topic of debate in the WTO 's six - year - old Doha Round trade talks .
' WTO obligations '
The Canadian and Brazilian complaints are over whether US support has topped Washington 's agreed WTO levels of support .
The pair claim that in six of the past eight years the US has breached the $ 19.1 bn it is allowed to spend on the most trade - distorting forms of subsidies , such as those linked to distributing goods .
" We must ensure that WTO members are meeting their WTO obligations , " Canada told the WTO 's dispute body .
The United States has designed its farm programmes to ensure compliance with the existed negotiated limits on domestic support
Juan Millan , US trade negotiator
Washington said it was disappointed at the move , and that its farm programmes were designed to comply with WTO rules .
It also said many of the issues being raised had already been addressed .
US trade official Juan Millan said the US 's payments have always been below the WTO limits .
" The United States has designed its farm programmes to ensure compliance with the existed negotiated limits on domestic support , " he said .
Talks locked
The Doha Round world trade talks have been blocked in their efforts to reach agreement by two major stumbling blocks - the large agricultural subsidies given to farmers in Europe , the US and Japan , and restrictive industrial tariffs in emerging markets such as China , India and Brazil .
Farm subsidies allow producers to sell their goods more cheaply than those in other countries , thus distorting competition .
The WTO allows some agricultural support to help secure food supplies , preserve the countryside and give farmers stability , but trade rules limit the type and size of assistance states can give .
The global trade body criticised Washington earlier this year , as it upheld a 2004 ruling in favour of Brazil , which had argued that US cotton subsidies were unfair .
During the period of the Doha trade talks , domestic opposition in the US to cuts in subsidies for farmers has grown .
‘ We did n’t want to get stuck with a lemon . ”
That ’s what Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said to a House committee last month .
He was referring to the “ virtual fence ” planned for the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada .
If the entire project goes as badly as the 28 - mile prototype , it could turn out to be one of the most expensive lemons in history , projected to cost $ 8 billion by 2011 .
Boeing , the company that landed the contract -- the largest ever awarded by the Department of Homeland Security -- announced this week that it will finally test the fence after months of delay due to computer problems .
Heavy rains have confused its remote - controlled cameras and radar , and the sensors ca n’t tell the difference between moving people , grazing cows or rustling bushes .
But this debacle points to more than faulty technology .
It exposes the faulty logic of the Bush administration ’s vision of a hollowed - out government run everywhere possible by private contractors .
According to this radical vision , contractors treat the state as an ATM , withdrawing massive contracts to perform core functions like securing borders and interrogating prisoners , and making deposits in the form of campaign contributions .
As President Bush ’s former budget director , Mitch Daniels , put it : “ The general idea -- that the business of government is not to provide services but to make sure that they are provided -- seems self - evident to me . ”
The flip side of the Daniels directive is that the public sector is rapidly losing the ability to fulfill its most basic responsibilities -- and nowhere more so than in the Department of Homeland Security , which , as a Bush creation , has followed the ATM model since its inception .
For instance , when the controversial border project was launched , the department admitted that it had no idea how to secure the borders and , furthermore , did n’t think it was its job to figure it out .
Homeland Security ’s deputy secretary told a group of contractors that “ this is an unusual invitation .
...
We ’re asking you to come back and tell us how to do our business . ”
Private companies would not only perform the work , they would identify what work needed to be done , write their own work orders , implement them and oversee them .
All the department had to do was sign the checks .
And as one former top Homeland Security official put it : “ If it does n’t come from industry , we are not going to be able to get it . ”
Put simply , if any given job ca n’t be outsourced , it ca n’t be done .
This philosophy , so central to the Bush years , explains statistics like this one :
In 2003 , the U.S. government handed out 3,512 contracts to companies to perform domestic security functions , from bomb detection to data mining .
In the 22 - month period ending in August 2006 , the Homeland Security Department had issued more than 115,000 security - related contracts .
If government is now an ATM , perhaps the war on terror is best understood not as a war but as a sprawling new economy , one based on continued disaster and instability .
In this economy , the Bush team does n’t run the venture exactly ; rather , it plays the role of deep - pocketed venture capitalist , always on the lookout for new security start - ups ( overwhelmingly headed by former employees of the Pentagon and Homeland Security ) .
Roger Novak , whose firm invests in homeland security companies , explains it like this : “ Every fund is seeing how big the [ government ] trough is and asking , how do I get a piece of that action ? ”
The Boeing border contract is just one piece of that action .
Another , of course , is the security contractor boom in Iraq , currently starring Blackwater USA .
Last month , when the Iraqi government accused Blackwater guards of massacring civilians in Baghdad , it became clear that the U.S. Embassy had no intention of severing ties with Blackwater because it could not function without it .
Perhaps that ’s why that same bureau rushed to respond to the Iraqi government ’s allegations in the September shooting with a “ spot report ” of its own : that Blackwater guards had come under attack and had responded accordingly .
Days later , it emerged that an embassy contractor wrote the report -- a contractor who worked for Blackwater .
The administration then sent in the FBI to investigate the shootings .
Yet it quickly emerged that the FBI investigators could well be guarded by Blackwater .
The FBI announced that other arrangements would be made -- but this was an exception .
And remember Hurricane Katrina , when contractors -- including Blackwater -- descended on New Orleans ?
FEMA was already so hollowed - out by then that it had to hire a contractor to help manage all the contractors .
And with all the controversies , the Army recently decided it needed to update its manual for dealing with contractors -- giving the job of drafting the new policy to one of its major contractors .
It still looks like a government -- with impressive buildings , presidential news briefings , policy battles .
But pull back the curtain and there is nobody home .
The Blackwater scandal could have provided an opportunity to question the wisdom of turning state security into a for - profit activity -- but not in today ’s Washington .
Instead , rather than replacing its cowboy contractors with troops , the State Department says it will put video cameras on the vehicles they guard .
Video surveillance is one of the most lucrative sectors of the war - on - terror economy .
This could even turn out to be great news for the top executives at Blackwater , who have launched a new private intelligence company billed as a “ one - stop service able to meet all the intelligence , operational and security needs . ”
If the past is any indication , there is no reason why the men from Blackwater cannot be contracted to spy on Blackwater .
Indeed , it would be the perfect expression of the hollow state that Bush built .
Naomi Klein is the author , most recently , of “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism . ”
Abercrombie ’s hired model
Agent Nguyen came up with the idea for this mission when he noticed the 5th Avenue Abercrombie and Fitch store had a shirtless male model greeting all customers as they enter .
Upon further examination , we discovered the model is only one aspect of the store ’s celebration of the shirtless male .
There are photographs all over the store of bare - chested men , both on the wall and on the products themselves .
There ’s even a four - story tall mural of shirtless men working on boats .
To top it all , in the basement of the store , there ’s a six - foot tall bronze statue of a shirtless man .
I sent out an email recruiting men willing to take their shirts off in public , and 111 agents showed up to the meeting point in Central Park .
Everyone wore jeans and a shirt that would be easy to stuff into a pocket .
I explained to everyone what we’d be doing , and then the shirts came off for a very tasteful Abercrombie - style photo shoot coordinated by Agent Nicholson .
Shirts off !
The men played a giant game of football
Agent Ace
$ Thugg had the best running game
Some men lounged in the shade
Team huddle

During our photo shoot , a small crowd gathered to laugh and take their own photos .
After the photo shoot , we regrouped and got organized for the mission .
There are four floors in the Abercrombie , so I divided everyone up into four groups by birthday month , to ensure we ’d have an even number of men on each floor .
Those on the second floor were out of luck , as they ’d be shopping on the women ’s only floor .
I instructed them to claim to be shopping for their girlfriend .
I then divided the group up by birthday year and had them enter the store at staggered times , to prevent an obvious line forming at the entrance .
At exactly 4:37 everyone was to discreetly remove their shirt on their assigned floor and hide it in their pocket or pants .
( We figured that if we had 100 people trying to enter the store shirtless , they ’d probably stop letting us in after the first 20 or so slipped by . )
To get the best footage possible in the store , I wore the hidden camera glasses loaned to us by the UCB ’s Matt Besser .
Agents Nicholson and Shafer helped me connect it to a video camera and hide it away in my backpack .
Around 4:15 we all started heading down to the store .
We had 11 people taking photos and video , spread out over the four floors .
Five of them were women ; we figured they could get away with blatantly filming and taking photographs more easily , especially if they dressed like typical Abercrombie customers .
Our men used a variety of tactics .
Agent Shafer had his video camera hiding in a Virgin Megastore bag .
Agent Nicholson had his still camera poking out of a duffle bag , controlled by a wireless remote .

Agent Fountain went with a more casual approach , simply hanging his camera around his neck and taking photos when no one was looking .
Agent Fountain pretends to shop
Agent CScott was the first to take his shirt off .
He thought the go - time was 4:30 and accidentally pulled the trigger 7 minutes early .
Agent CScott
He slowly realized he was the only one and that he must have gotten the time wrong , but decided just to roll with it .
Employees did n’t seem to care .
In fact , one went and checked on a size for him without even commenting on his bare chest .
At 4:37 the other 110 joined in on the fun .
Within seconds everywhere you looked there were shirtless men .
I instructed everyone to simply mill about the store and shop .
I told them that if anyone asked questions , to just claim that you ’re shopping for a shirt .
Customers and employees very quickly started reacting to us .
The majority of them laughed , smiled , and took photos .
A customer laughs
An employee laughs
Customers watch from the stairs
Those employees in management and security were predictably not as amused .
It ’s tough to say what the model himself thought of us .
He had a variety of reactions over the course of the mission .
He was positioned in front of a wall at the entrance , so when the first couple of shirtless guys approached him , he had no knowledge that there were 100 more behind him in the store .
He was very aggressive towards these first two agents .
It probably did n’t help that the two guys happened to be both taller and more sculpted than he was .
“ At least I get paid to do this , ” he scoffed at them .
He seemed to loosen up later , as he smiled and happily posed for photos with other guys who came by .
The model was happy laugh and joke around with Agent Uncle for a full minute
Back in the store , agents continued shopping , with some trying on items of clothing , looking for a perfect fit .
Agents on the second floor were forced to browse through women ’s clothing .
Another interesting thing about Abercrombie is the mannequins .
For some reason , almost all of the male mannequins have their jeans pulled down quite a bit below the waist .
There ’s a bulge poking out of the tops of the jeans , which if you think about it could only anatomically represent the shaft of a penis .
Crazy !
Notice the bulge in the background
One agent sat underneath the statue and mimicked its pose .
After about 15 minutes , the Abercrombie management decided it was time to kick us out .
Security employees started approaching all of our men and asking them to either put a shirt on or leave .
They informed us that the model was a paid employee and his state of undress did n’t justify ours .
So despite the fact that the store constantly bombards you with the image of the shirtless male , Abercrombie still maintains a “ No Shirts ; No Service ” policy .
Some agents protested that they were trying toa shirt , but the staff countered with the not - so - logical , “ If you put on a shirt then you can buy a shirt . ”
Many agents just politely agreed to leave and then walked to another floor to shop some more , getting asked to leave several times before finally heading out .
Two agents were actually stopped while in the process of checking out !
They were waiting in line for 10 minutes to buy some $ 45 shirts , only to be grabbed at the register .
One of them was in the process of handing over his credit card as he was nabbed and informed he was n’t allowed to make a purchase !
Caught in the act of buying !
An agent is asked to leave
The stairs got very crowded as agents started heading towards the exit .
Agent Nguyen , center
Everyone leaving the store at the same time created a whole new scene out on the street as 5th Avenue soon became filled with half - naked men .
Many passing tourists asked if they could get their photo taken with our men .
Others just looked on and laughed .
Everyone had their own theory on what had happened .
A British woman told me , “ One guy took his shirt off , you know as a rib on the model out front .
Then all these other guys saw him and decided to take their shirts off too !
One did it , and then they all did ! ”
It was a pretty awesome theory , so I smiled and laughed with her without revealing the truth .
Her version of events was much cooler than the truth .
Of course not everyone was as impressed .
One guy took a drag off his cigarette and coolly told me , “ They ’re all just fat asses who are mad because they could n’t get a job at Abercrombie . ”
His friends laughed and snapped photos .
Mission Accomplished .

Recursion and Generators
[ Japanese ]
Abstract : A certain kind of problems can be described with recursive procedures quite efficiently .
But sometime you need strict control over recursive procedures which produces a huge amount of data , which adds difficulty to coding .
Python generators , which are available in Python 2.2 or later , allows us to control these procedures easily preserving concise programs .

Introduction
No one doubts the power of recursion .
Although it sometime might look a little bit complicated , it normally provides a quick way to describe a solution .
This is especially true if the size of data handled by a procedure grows exponentially .
Traversing a tree is a good example .
Since each node in a tree has one or more nodes , as the procedure goes down the tree , the number of nodes grows in exponential order .
But if all nodes are homogeneous , the same procedure can apply to every node again and again .
Tree traversal is a trivial example of recursion , because almost every Computer Science textbook explains this .
Probably everyone will happily choose recursion for tree traversal without any deep consideration .
Of course however , there are many tasks where recursion works pretty well .
So let us take another example .
Consider the following function f which takes a set of vectors ( V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , ... , V n ) and returns a set of all possible combinations of each element of V i .
Each combination consists of n-element vectors ( x i1 , x i2 , ... , x im ) where x ij is an element of V i .
The total number of vectors this function returns is |V 1 | x |V 2 | x |V 3 | x ... x |V n | .
Let us consider implementing this function in Python .
For simplicity , we use String objects to represent each vector V i .
The function returns a set of vectors as a list .
The expected result is the following :
f ( [ ] ) --> [ '']
# 1 f ( [ ' abc ' ] ) --> [ 'a ' , ' b ' , ' c ' ] # 3 f( [ ' abc ' , 'xyz ' ] ) --> [ ' ax ' , ' ay ' , ' az ' , ' bx ' , ' by ' , ' bz ' , 'cx ' , 'cy ' , 'cz ' ] # 9 f( [ ' abc ' , 'xyz ' , ' 123 ' ] ) --> [ ' ax1 ' , ' ax2 ' , ' ax3 ' , ' ay1 ' , ' ay2 ' , ' ay3 ' , ' az1 ' , ' az2 ' , ' az3 ' , ' bx1 ' , ' bx2 ' , ' bx3 ' , ' by1 ' , ' by2 ' , ' by3 ' , ' bz1 ' , ' bz2 ' , ' bz3 ' , ' cx1 ' , ' cx2 ' , ' cx3 ' , ' cy1 ' , ' cy2 ' , ' cy3 ' , ' cz1 ' , ' cz2 ' , ' cz3 ' ]

At a first glance , it looks easy to implement .
You might think that this function can be written easily without using any recursion .
Let 's try .
Solutions
First , if you do n't want to use recursion at all , your program might end up with something like this :
Non-recursive Version
def f0 ( args ) : counter = [ 0 for i in args ] r = [ ] while 1 : r.append ( " " . join ( [ arg 1 [ i ] for arg1 , i in zip ( args , counter ) ] ) ) carry = 1 x = range ( len ( args ) ) x.reverse( ) for i in x : counter [ i ] += 1 if counter [ i ] < len ( args [ i ] ) : carry = 0 break counter [ i ] = 0 else : break return r
Without using recursion , you have to remember intermediate states somehow to produce all possible solutions .
In this program , I tried to emulate something like full - adders .
First the program prepares a list of integers and then repeatedly attempts to add one to the least significant digit .
At each iteration , it concatenates elements in each argument and put it into variable r .
But the behavior of this program is not so clear , even though some variable names such as " carry " are suggestive .
Recursive Version
Now you have recursion .
The function f can be defined recursively as follows :
f( V i , V i+1 , ... , V n ) = ( {x i1 } + f( V i+1 , ... , V n ) ) + ( {x i2 } + f( V i+1 , ... , V n ) ) + ... ( {x im } + f( V i+1 , ... , V n ) ) .
With this definition , you can make the program a much simpler by calling itself :
def fr ( args ) : if not args : return [ " " ] r = [ ] for i in args [ 0 ] : for tmp in fr( args [ 1 : ] ) : r.append( i + tmp ) return r
The implementation above is very straightforward .
The power of recursion is that you can split the problem into several subproblems and apply the exactly same machinery to each subproblem .
This program simply takes the first element of each argument and concatenate it with every solution of this function with one fewer arguments ( Fig 1 ) .
Fig 1 . Recursive Version
More Solutions
So far we have seen functions which return all the results at a time .
But in some applications such as searching or enumerating , you probably do n't want to remember all combinations .
What you want to do is just to inspect one combination at each time , and throw away after using it .
When the number of outputs is small , this is not a big deal .
But what we expected for recursive procedures is to provide a quick solution for functions whose result grows exponentially , right ?
Ironically , however , such functions tend to produce a huge amount of data that cause problems in your program .
In many language implementations , they cannot remember all the results .
Sooner or later it will reach the maximum limit of the memory :
$ ulimit -v 5000 $ python ... >>> for x in fr ( [ " abcdefghij " , " abcdefghij " , " abcdefghij " , " abcdefghij " , " abcdefghij " ] ) : ... print x ... Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < stdin > " , line 1 , in ?
File " < stdin > " , line 7 , in fr MemoryError
The typical solution for this is to split every combination into different states .
The typical way to do this in Python is to build an iterator .
Iterator Version
In Python , a class which has a __iter__ method can be used as iterators .
Although iterators are not functionally identical to lists , they can be taken instead of lists in some statements or functions ( for , map , filter , etc ) .
class fi : def __init__ ( self , args ) : self.args = args self .
counter = [ 0 for i in args ] self.carry = 0 return def __iter__ ( self ) : return self def next ( self ) : if self.carry : raise StopIteration r = " " . join ( [ arg 1 [ i ] for arg1 , i in zip ( self.args , self.counter ) ] ) self.carry = 1 x = range ( len( self.args ) ) x.reverse( ) for i in x : self.counter [i ] += 1 if self.counter [i ] < len(self.args[i ] ) : self.carry = 0 break self.counter [i ] = 0 return r def display ( x ) : for i in x : print i , print return
In this program , you can use the constructor of the class fi in the same manner as the recursive version fr as in :
>>> display ( fi( [ " abc " , " def " ] ) )
When this instance is passed to a for statement , the __iter__ method is called and the returned object ( the object itself in this case ) is used as the iterator of the loop .
At each iteration , the next method is called without argument and the return value is stored in the loop variable .
However , this program is not easy to understand .
Algorithmically , it is similar to the non-recursive version I described above .
Each time next method is called , it updates the current state stored in counter variable and returns one result according to the current state .
But it looks even more complicated , since the method is designed to be called in between a loop , which is not shown explicitly here .
Readers might be upset by seeing that it checks carry variable at the top of the next procedure .
They have to imagine an ( invisible ) loop outside this method to understand this .
Generator Version
def fg ( args ) : if not args : yield " " return for i in args [ 0 ] : for tmp in fg( args [ 1 : ] ) : yield i + tmp return
lazy evaluation
Lambda - encapsulation Version
Perhaps functional programmers might prefer lambda encapsulation to objects .
Python also allows us to do this .
In fact , however , this was a real puzzle to me .
I could do things in the same manner as I did the iterator version .
But I wanted to do something different .
After hours of struggles , I finally came up with something like this :
def fl ( args , i=0 , tmp= " " , parent_sibling =None ) : if not args : return ( tmp , parent_sibling ) if i < len ( args [ 0 ] ) : sibling = fl( args , i+1 , tmp , parent_sibling ) return lambda : fl( args [ 1 : ] , 0 , tmp+args [ 0 ] [ i ] , sibling ) else : return parent_sibling def traverse ( n ) : while n : if callable ( n ) : n = n( ) else : ( result , n ) = n print result , print
The idea is indeed to take it as tree traversal .
The function f can be regarded as a tree which contains a partial result at each node ( Fig 2 ) .
A function produced by fl retains its position , the next sibling node , and the next sibling of the parent node in the tree .
As it descends the tree , the elements of the vectors are accumulated .
When it reaches at a leaf it should have one complete solution ( a combination of elements ) .
If there is no node to traverse in the same level , it goes back to the parent node and tries the next sibling of the parent node .
We need a special driver routine to traverse the tree .
Fig 2 . The Function f as Tree Traversal
Of course the generator version can be also regarded as tree traversal .
In this case , you will be visiting a tree and dropping a result at each node .

Emergency rule gives state security sweeping powers of detention
Twenty - two alleged members of an unknown Islamist group , the Victorious Sect , were accused of planning attacks on tourism sites and gas pipelines .
Human Rights
Watch says its research suggests the security forces may have fabricated the group 's name .
It reports claims the case was used to justify renewing emergency laws .
Although the state prosecutor dismissed the charges against the suspects , 10 of them are still believed to be in detention .
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Cairo says this is just the latest in a run of accusations by human rights organisations against Egypt 's police and state security apparatus .
The Egyptian government has consistently denied that torture is used routinely and rejected what it sees as foreign interference in its own affairs .
' Pattern of abuse '
The authorities ' claims made headlines in April 2006 when they said they had smashed a previously unheard - of terrorist group plotting a series of attacks against soft targets including tourists and Coptic Christian clerics .

" Indeed , it appears that SSI ( state security investigations ) may have fabricated the allegations made against at least some and possibly all of them , " its report says .
Detainees quoted by HRW said they had been beaten and kicked by their interrogators , and some were given electric shocks on their bodies , including their genitals .
Most of the testimonies in the report come via third parties , as the detainees themselves were unwilling to talk directly to investigators , for fear of retribution , HRW says .
A spokesperson for the organisation said the case was not unusual , but was part of a pattern of detention and torture by the Egyptian security services in order to obtain false confessions .
The " Victorious Sect " arrests came to light shortly before Egypt renewed its enduring and controversial emergency laws , which give sweeping powers of detention to the security forces .
" State security needs to show that it 's working , that it 's useful , and cases like these are useful politically , around the renewal of the emergency law , " lawyer Muhammad Hashim is quoted as saying in the HRW report .
The group says the Egyptian authorities ignored requests for information about the case and there was no immediate response to publication of the report .
Earlier this year , another human rights group released a highly critical report on Egypt 's record on torture and illegal detention .

' Top Model ' Hopeful Drinks Her Own Breast Milk " America 's Next Top Model " contestant admits to drinking her own breast milk .
Feb. 26 , 2008  -- Tyra Banks ' hit show " America 's Next Top Model " has had its share of quirky contestants , but one of this season 's hopefuls may qualify as the most bizarre of all , after she admitted to the competition 's judges that she drinks her own breast milk .
The contestant , Claire , a 24 - year - old native New Yorker , told host Banks that she wants to keep her breast milk flowing so that she can continue to nurse her daughter after she leaves the show .
But when asked by Banks if she 's FedExing the milk home to her baby – a common practice by mothers who are separated from their nursing children – Claire 's response was surprising .
" Right now I 'm actually drinking it , " said the bikini - clad Claire , whose last name , like that of all contestants on the show , was not revealed by the show 's execs .
" It tastes kind of like light soy milk . "
" Top Model " contestants are prohibited from talking directly to the media before they are eliminated from the competition , according to a show representative , but Claire answered questions via e-mail .
When asked what her reason was for drinking her breast milk , Claire said that she did n't feel right just throwing it away .
" I drank my breast milk only during audition week because I did not want to waste it after putting all my effort into making and extracting it .
Dumping milk just seems wrong , " Claire said , adding that at one point she was drinking two or three glasses of breast milk a day .
" A mother 's milk is like liquid gold , so I also wanted the nutritional value back and to keep my immunity up . "
Many of the other models were getting sick during the grueling competition .
Claire also said that without a refrigerator she could not freeze the milk or ship it back home to her 18 - month old daughter .
While a mother may benefit marginally from the nutrients found in breast milk , according to several lactation experts , a mother who drinks her own breast milk is exceedingly rare .
" I 've never heard of anything like it , " said Dr. Myron Peterson , a pediatrician and director of medical affairs for Cato Research in Boston , who has been in the business for more than 32 years .
" There 's no danger to it , but it 's just kind of strange . "
Milk Good for Mom , Better for Baby
" Breast milk is definitely great nutrition , great protein and great calories , and ounce for ounce it 's low in calories for an adult , " said Cheryl Parrott , a registered nurse and board - certified lactation consultant who runs a private practice in Indiana .
" But it would have to be in addition to a healthy , regular diet . "
But there is no evidence , said Parrott , that consuming more nutrients – like the ones found in breast milk – will improve the quality of a woman 's breast milk in the future .
" What you eat and drink nutrition - wise does n't impact your breast milk , " said Parrott .
" Living on hamburgers and milkshakes wo n't give you better or worse breast milk , and so there 's no advantage for [ Claire ] to be taking in what she 's putting out . "
And while Parrott recognizes and appreciates Claire 's desire to keep her milk flowing so she can eventually continue to nurse her baby , she suggests that the new mom freeze her milk or ship it to her baby – who likely needs it more than she does .
" I can understand her doing it in the sense that she does n't want to waste the breast milk , " said Parrott , who compares the taste of breast milk to the sugary milk at the bottom of a bowl of cereal .
" But my only word of advice is let 's figure out a way to ship this home for the baby . "
Dr. Joan Meek , the academic chairman of pediatrics at Orlando Regional Healthcare , agrees with Parrot that Claire – and other nursing mothers – should continue their breast milk flow for as long as possible but instead of drinking it or discarding it , should freeze it .
" You can freeze breast milk for at least three months , " said Meek .
" That would be a better route [ than drinking it ] . "
Some nursing mothers also choose to donate their extra breast milk , said Meek .
The milk is a hot commodity in neo-natal intensive care units and sometimes even in geriatric care , where doctors capitalize on how easy breast milk is to digest – even for the sickest patients .
Civil libertarians have condemned the New South Wales Government for supporting an expanded use of Taser guns by police .
Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione is preparing a submission for the Government to widen the use of the stun guns , which are currently restricted to three specialist police units .
In the US to assess the way the weapons are used , Police Minister David Campbell has told The Sydney Morning Herald he would back an expansion of their use in principle .
But Council for Civil Liberties secretary Cameron Murphy says Tasers are dangerous and potentially fatal .
" In the United States , there are more than 200 deaths as a result of the use of Taser guns that are under inquiry at the moment , " he said .
" What we ought to be doing is not expanding the use of Taser guns until we know the results of inquiries in the United States . "
Mr Murphy says the Government needs proof that Tasers are safe .
" If [ a stun gun ] is there , then police may use it because it 's easier to pull out the Taser and use that on someone than it is to physically restrain and subdue them , " he said .
" The problem with doing that is that there 's a high risk that someone may have a serious injury or they may in fact die when they 're Tasered . "
Tasers cause severe pain and immobilise muscle contractions by shooting two darts that deliver electrical pulses .
The state Ombudsman is reviewing their use after a number of deaths overseas but the NSW Police Association wants them issued to all front - line officers , saying they can save lives and defuse extreme situations .
The Queensland Government last week announced a trial of Tasers would be widened from selected officers to all the state 's front - line police .
Seventy - four Tasers were also sent to the Northern Territory to be used by some police instead of guns on Friday .
Amnesty International has linked hundreds of deaths to the use of stun guns .
Red Cross workers negotiate access for an injured Palestinian in Gaza
The statement was an unusual departure from its normally non-political stance .
The ICRC said the measures imposed by Israel had denied the Palestinian population the right to live a normal and dignified life .
But the Israeli government insisted it was co-operating with the Red Cross to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid .
" We are committed to making sure that the people of Gaza continue to receive vital humanitarian and medical support , " Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said .
But the Israeli government also said restrictions could not be eased too quickly , because Palestinian militants would then try to carry out more attacks .
The ICRC says humanitarian assistance cannot possibly be the solution in Gaza and the West Bank .
Its statement comes just days before a major donor conference in Paris .
Why do we call for political action ?
Because actually we do not think that humanitarian aid can solve the problem
Beatrice Megevand Roggo
ICRC
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says politics is not usually a word which features in the language of the international Red Cross - the famously neutral organisation tends to work quietly in conflict zones , and when it does speak , it speaks of numbers of injured treated , or numbers of detainees visited .
But the ICRC now says that life in the West bank and Gaza Strip has become so dreadful that no amount of humanitarian aid can really help .
' Situation perpetuated '
" Why do we call for political action ?
Because actually we do not think that humanitarian aid can solve the problem , " said Beatrice Megevand Roggo , ICRC director of operations for the Middle East .

Dignity Denied in the Occupied Palestinian Territories [ 1.41 MB ]

" In Gaza the whole strip is being strangled , economically speaking , life there has become a nightmare .
And for that there is no solution that can be provided by humanitarian organisations .
" We can try to put patches on problems , but we do not have the key to a lasting solution that would address the roots of the problem . "
In fact the Red Cross and other UN aid agencies are pouring money into Gaza ; senior aid officials , our correspondent says , privately fear they may be perpetuating a situation which really should not continue .
' Dignity denied '
Together with its statement calling for political action , the Red Cross has issued a report called Dignity Denied which paints a harrowing picture of life for the Palestinians - suffering an economic blockade which denies them jobs , medical care , and even food .
" The 1.4 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip continue to pay for conflict and economic containment with their health and livelihoods , " the report says .
" In the West Bank , the establishment of Israeli settlements affects every aspect of Palestinians ' lives and leads to the loss of much land and income , together with recurrent violence by settlers .
Exhausting movement restrictions hinder access to work and have led to unprecedented levels of unemployment and poverty .
" Only prompt , innovative and courageous political action can change the harsh reality of this long - standing occupation , restore normal social and economic life to the Palestinian people , and allow them to live their lives in dignity . "
The ICRC says it recognises Israel 's right to take measures to defend itself .
" [ But this ] needs to be balanced against the Palestinians ' right to live a normal and dignified life , " said Ms Roggo .
Also on Thursday , the World Bank said increased aid and Palestinian government reforms will have no real effect unless Israel eases restrictions on travel and trade .
At the donors conference on Monday in Paris , governments are being asked to provide the Palestinians with US $ 5.6 bn over the next three years .

Dennis Kucinich is staying home .
Two weeks after insisting he could run for Congress and president at the same time , his decision Thursday to drop his second bid for the White House suggests he is concerned about winning a seventh term in Congress .
He faces four candidates in the Democratic primary , including Cleveland Councilman Joe Cimperman , who has become his chief rival by raising hundreds of thousands of dollars and winning media attention .
Kucinich , 61 , who has easily won re-election , would n't say Thursday what influenced his contested congressional race had on his decision to drop out of the presidential contest .
Kucinich will hold a news conference at noon today at a downtown union hall to explain his decision .
He cited his exclusion from national debates and the practical strains of running a national campaign as reasons for leaving .
" There is a point at which you just realize that you , look , you accept it , that it is n't going to happen and you move on , " he said during a Congressional endorsement interview with The Plain Dealer editorial board and reporters .
Kucinich stayed in the 2004 presidential race until late summer , when he had little competition for re-election back home .
To hear more of Kucinich 's announcement to The Plain Dealer , listen here :
Or download the MP3 .
Kucinich said he will not endorse another Democrat in the primary .
Kucinich is seeking a seventh term in Congress , but his long - shot bid for the White House has drawn four Democratic opponents .
When he kicked off his congressional re-election bid Jan.
9 , he said he would focus on his local race , but then ratcheted up his presidential bid , campaigning in Michigan and Nevada and filing unsuccessful legal appeals to stay on the ballot in Texas and to win a spot on stage during presidential debates .
He has fared poorly in early presidential contests .
Meanwhile , the congressional race made headlines when Cimperman revealed that Kucinich had asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate a Cimperman campaign stunt .
Cimperman entered Kucinich's Lakewood office Jan. 3 with a camera - toting campaign worker to drop off a " missing " poster mocking Kucinich 's presidential travels .
And this week , Cimperman launched a television advertisement critical of Kucinich 's time away from the 10th Congressional District , which includes Cleveland 's West Side and western suburbs .
Kucinich countered with a video appealing for immediate contributions and revamped his re-election Web site .
Borrowing a page from his days as an populist mayor , he charged that corporations were behind Cimperman 's campaign .
" Right now I 'm under attack by corporate interests , most of them from the city of Cleveland , who have an agenda that has nothing to do with the people of my community , " he said in the video .
Cimperman , referring to money Kucinich raises from Hollywood actors , repeated one of his favorite lines Thursday : " The money I raise is from Cleveland , his is from California . "
Cimperman campaigned for Kucinich two years ago after he was reassured by the congressman that he would not run for president again .
Five weeks after being reelected Kucinich announced he had changed his mind .
Kucinich defended his decision during Thursday 's interview , saying Democrats got elected in 2006 to end the war , and within weeks they voted to fund it .
" When I heard that , I knew that I was going to have to challenge my party nationally and there was only one way to do that , " he said .
Kucinich said he has " zero intention " of getting involved in the presidential primaries by endorsing another Democratic candidate .
Congressional challenger Rosemary Palmer , another supporter of Kucinich 's reelection in 2006 , said Kucinich 's move does not affect her campaign .
" I entered this race in June because I did not feel he was focused on the job , nor able to effect the change we so desperately need .
On issues of job creation , health care , the environment , and the Iraq war , Mr. Kucinich often talks a good game but seldom delivers , " she said in a prepared statement .
North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O'Grady , another challenger , has had little criticism of Kucinich other than to complain about his time away from the district .
He said Thursday that if Kucinich had dropped his bid for the White House sooner he probably would n't be running for Congress .
" It 's my hope that he redirects his interest back to the district , " said O'Grady , speaking from Washington D.C. , where he is attending the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
O'Grady said he has no plans to drop out .
Candidate Barbara Ferris , former Peace Corps and United Nations worker who was trounced by Kucinich two years ago , said the Congressman has n't done much .
" He was unable to achieve anything running for president ; he was unable to achieve in 11 years in Congress , " she said .
Always coy about his political plans , Kucinich described his departure from the presidential race as " transitioning out " but would not say what that means .
Nor did he address the criticisms of his opponents .
" I want people to know that I love this community and that have repeatedly put my career on the line for this community , " he said .
" I want to make sure there is no confusion in this district about what my intention is .
I want to be the congressman . "
DIGG THIS
When the spring semester at the University of Colorado let out several weeks ago , I called a good friend ( and fellow Denver Barbarian ) to see if I might be able to work for him during my summer break as I had done last summer .
My friend , who owns a residential and commercial roofing company in Denver , agreed to reinstate me on one of his crews , and I began working for him five days after my last final exam .
It has been my habit since my freshman year in high school to take a summer job in one of the various landscaping or construction trades , and my return to this type of work felt inexpressibly refreshing and liberating after fifteen weeks of physical idleness and monotonous study in graduate school .
It was , moreover , intensely satisfying to be earning a regular paycheck once again by means of the strength and skill of my hands under the clear summer sun — despite the total physical exhaustion that the roofing profession entails .
There is perhaps nothing more personally satisfying than the paycheck that is earned by means of physical labor that , while backbreaking , produces a tangible product that so thoroughly satisfies one 's customers .
( The same can not be said of the graduate student , whose teaching " services " — if they can rightly be called that — are usually detested by the supposed consumers / undergraduates , and who lives , in a public university , solely at the taxpayer 's expense ) .
It only took several weeks of roofing however , before I noticed that my paychecks were much less satisfying to me this summer than they were just one year ago .
The problem was not that my wages were nominally any lower than they were last year , or that I was working fewer hours .
On the contrary , I was actually working more hours now at a slightly higher nominal rate .
The problem was ( and is ) that the greenbacks I 'm unfortunately paid with are buying me fewer and fewer goods ( which is , in effect , equivalent to receiving a concealed pay - cut for the same amount of backbreaking work after just one year ) .
What awakened me to the precipitous decline in my greenbacks ' value ( and the pay - cut this decline in value entailed for my standard of living ) was a simple tallying of my expenses for one ordinary Friday afternoon .
After perusing my bank records , I noticed that I had spent $ 70 in the course of six hours one Friday , and I sought to discover how I could have spent so much money on a totally unexceptional weekday .
Here is what I discovered my hard - won $ 70 had been exchanged for :
Two cheeseburgers , French fries , and a small drink ( lunch )
$ 6.50
Four tins of Skoal snuff $ 22.50
Two chicken sandwiches and a small French fries ( dinner ) $ 7.50
One twelve - pack of cheap beer ( it was Friday , after all ) $ 14.50 Six gallons of regular gasoline $ 19.00
Imagine the disgust and frustration I felt after surveying the sum of these appalling prices , when my average pre-tax income as a roofer is approximately $ 120 per day .
More than half of my income , ( i.e. , around five hours of labor ) , that Friday was required to purchase only four ounces of tobacco , 144 ounces of cheap beer , six gallons of petrol , and less than two pounds of low - quality , greasy food .
I felt very much like young Tom in Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath , who finds himself in the hopeless position of working all day at a backbreaking job only to find that his meager wages will scarcely purchase enough food and gasoline to allow him to get to work the following day .
Last summer these same quantities of tobacco , cheap ale , gasoline , and low quality , greasy food cost me approximately 20 % less than they do today .
Put even more starkly , after just one year , these same quantities of beer , tobacco , food and gasoline now require an additional hour of backbreaking labor on a roof to procure !
What is even worse , when I first started working in the construction trades twelve years ago , a gallon of gasoline cost me 98 cents , a tin of smokeless tobacco cost me two dollars ( including the ridiculously high and totally unjustifiable taxes on the then - newly - demonized smokeless tobacco ) , and a greasy cheeseburger cost me 50 cents .
I could buy a twelve - pack of decent beer ( i.e. , Fat Tire , for a Colorado boy like me ) for only nine dollars .
My frustration and disgust only increased after I tallied the total number of additional hours that were required to purchase my new Springfield M1A rifle , which cost me 1,500 greenbacks two weeks ago ( after the revoltingly high sales tax was tacked on ) .
This same rifle only a handful years ago was running around $ 1200 , which means that my new rifle cost me an additional 20 hours of labor to procure ( i.e. , an additional half - week of grueling labor on a roof ! ) , compared to what it would have cost me only a few years ago .
What made these rising prices all the more frightening and maddening to me is the fact that I am only 28 years old .
I 'm not a 96 - year - old veteran of World War II , regaling my grandchildren with tales of $ 500 Model T's , five - cent candy bars , and ten -cent cigars .
Nor am I a veteran of the Vietnam War , who remembers that M14's could be had in the 1970's for only a couple of hundred dollars .
In fact , I 'm probably young enough to be the grandchild of many of my readers — I was n't even born until the Vietnam War was over !
Inflation is not a far - off and now obsolete threat to our wealth and standard of living .
It is , on the contrary , an all - too real , yet often forgotten and more often misdiagnosed , drain on our hard - won paychecks and savings accounts .
The perpetrator of this wretched decline in my paychecks ' value is the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
This unelected and almost completely ungoverned institution continues to flood the U.S. and global economies with ever more green pieces of paper every year , which inexorably causes each individual unit of currency to fall in value .
For those of us who are not able to renegotiate our wages every week or month to keep pace with this irresponsible inflation , the deluge of currency literally results in continuous pay cuts .
The consequence of this fall in the value of the greenbacks with which I am paid every week should also be obvious : I have either to work more hours on a roof to obtain the same amount of goods as I did just one year ago , or I have to make do with the fewer goods the depleted green paper with which I am paid will purchase .
While either one of these options represents a fall in my standard of living , I am usually forced , due to the physical exhaustion from roofing , to make do with fewer and fewer goods , since I can only physically work so many grueling hours of overtime in a single week .
Another baneful consequence of this deluge of currency caused by the Fed is that certain sectors of the economy get bloated with the new currency ( i.e. , a bubble ) , pushing the prices of the products of those industries even more out of reach of average wage earners like myself .
In the recent housing bubble , for example , ( which was caused by a massive and long - lived release of new currency into the mortgage lending industry ) , the price of almost all homes and building materials in Denver soared to unfathomable levels .
The average worker like myself saw the price of a home skyrocket almost completely out of reach — to the point where a hard - working young roofer like myself can scarcely dream of purchasing even the dumpiest little shack in Denver without sacrificing literally half a lifetime of grueling labor ( despite the fact that I , ironically , posses every single skill necessary to build my own home from foundation to rafters ) .
The lesson for me , as I perused my bank statements for the last few years , was that hard - working Americans in the private sector , like myself , can ill afford to take their increasingly worthless green paper for granted any more .
We can no longer simply skimp and save in the naïve hope that we can live off a pile of emerald paper in the future , because the value of these pieces of paper continues to rapidly fall against the goods that we desire and which make our lives comfortable and happy .
We need to take a cold , hard look at our un - backed currency and seriously consider exchanging these ridiculous green pieces of paper with which we are paid ( and which the Fed continues to recklessly pump out at a record pace ) , for goods that retain their value over time .
We need , in other words , to exchange our paper for the scarce and irreproducible goods that have been used as currencies since the dawn of civilization ; namely , gold and silver .
As I thumbed through my bank statements with my left hand , sipping the low - quality , sour , American ale that cost me an hour 's worth of grueling labor , ( when only a few years ago the same amount of green paper would have bought me a fine micro - brewed lager ) , I felt unrelenting pricks at my pride for being the dupe of this ruse for so long .
I felt irrepressible resentment and disgust toward the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve for the depreciation of my and every other hard - working American 's hard - earned wages and savings for their own selfish benefit ( not to mention the nauseating level of taxation extracted from us by the U.S. Congress and their henchmen in the I.R.S. ) .
These agents of the federal government were stealthily taking more and more of the money I was earning with the sweat of my brow and the strength of my tired and sunburned arms , while they sat back in their plush leather chairs in New York and Washington printing ever more green paper and arrogantly extracting more taxes from me .
Under my right hand , however , lay my new M1A and a small pile of 22 - carat gold coins .
I felt a measure of consolation from the fact that there were doubtless tens of thousands of similar Americans who were not fooled by this unconscionable decline in the value of our currency , who were also exchanging green paper for gold ( what better deal has there ever been in the history of the world ? ) , and who also felt the sting of this mendacious ruse on their pride .
I also felt a measure of consolation from the knowledge that this completely un-backed , and thus intrinsically worthless and infinitely replicable , green paper could depreciate only so long before millions of other Americans catch on to the ruse , and revolt against the pitiless plundering of their wages and savings by the Federal Reserve , the U.S. Treasury , and the U.S. Congress .
When that day of reckoning finally arrives , woe to those who have so mercilessly robbed us of the just fruits of our backbreaking labor for so very long .

The Best of Mark R. Crovelli
Stock market crash in action
London share prices continue in freefall this morning , continuing the losses already seen during last week .
Already over 200 points have been wiped out , sending the FTSE 100 into 5600 figures , and momentum continues , threatening a crash in share prices across the board .
While predictions of an investor bubble has long plagued equities , news that the US is in recession seems to have finally pricked prices in a way even the first salvoes of the Credit Crunch could not hammer down .
While there is expectation of a rally this morning , the trend suggests that the rally will weaken , and shares will close sharply down on the morning opening .
It even remains possible that prices will collapse significantly further , resulting in a some commentators will declare a stock market crash of some degree .
In the meantime , while composing this piece the FTSE seems to have stabilised around 5685 between 11:15 - 11:30 , but it remains to be seen whether this will be a brake or a mere breather on the falls .
14:00 UPDATE 1 : The first rally happened over lunchtime , bringing losses on the FTSE to around 200 points , but the rally is currently fading and points are down over 250 again .
Ironically , Northern Rock shares are up over 40 % so far .
16:00 UPDATE 2 : The FTSE has seen a few minor rallies , with the fall moving between 200 - 250 points , but now falling to nearer a 300 - point loss .
The perception is trusts grabbing shares while hunting for bargains and profit taking during volatility .
However , with Morgan Stanley predicting the FTSE 100 could drop to 5350 over the next 12 - 18 months , shares purchased now may not be the bargains they appear to be , at least in the short - term .
16:15 UPDATE 3 : The FTSE 100 is now 285 points down .
16 more and it will go below 5600 .
If it does , it will mean an overall fall of 5 % today .
17:15 UPDATE 4 : The FTSE 100 closed down 323 points : now 5578.2 points .
SWEETWATER , Tex . 
The wind turbines that recently went up on Louis Brooks ’s ranch are twice as high as the Statue of Liberty , with blades that span as wide as the wingspan of a jumbo jet .
More important from his point of view , he is paid $ 500 a month apiece to permit 78 of them on his land , with 76 more on the way .
“ That ’s just money you ’re hearing , ” he said as they hummed in a brisk breeze recently .
Texas , once the oil capital of North America , is rapidly turning into the capital of wind power .
After breakneck growth the last three years , Texas has reached the point that more than 3 percent of its electricity , enough to supply power to one million homes , comes from wind turbines .
Texans are even turning tapped - out oil fields into wind farms , and no less an oilman than Boone Pickens is getting into alternative energy .
“ I have the same feelings about wind , ” Mr. Pickens said in an interview , “ as I had about the best oil field I ever found . ”
He is planning to build the biggest wind farm in the world , a $ 10 billion behemoth that could power a small city by itself .
Thinking about Scala recently ( trying to grok now self types are used ) , I found it interesting to note that there are many features of a language 's semantics which must play together well .
E.g. there several types of polymorphism .
I wonder how best a language design can make all the semantics usable ( as in usability ) in the three contexts of : writing code , compiling code , and running code ?
I think for me Scala might have gone too far , as others have said .
Sounds like Fortress is considering self types as well .
I guess I wonder if there will some day be a way to abstract the semantics somehow to keep the usefulness but lower the mental load on the developer .
I expect some people think this sounds like a weak developer looking for an easy way out ; that is n't totally true in my case . :-)
At the very least I think a devil 's advocate could suggest that something complicated wo n't get far in industry .
[ edit : hm , apologies if this sounds too much like already discussed thoughts .
I guess I am ( re ) asking the question how far along the strict typing path to go before things collapse under their own weight , and people wo n't use it . ]
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush said on Thursday Americans would receive checks that are part of the $ 152 billion economic stimulus package in May .
“ We anticipate that the checks will start being sent in the second week of May and that is going to be very positive news to consumers , ” Bush told reporters after meeting with his economic team .
Cheney has warrantless wiretapping documents , wo n't turn them over Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday August 21 , 2007
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney 's office has in its possession more than 50 documents related to a congressional investigation of the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping program , but Cheney 's lawyer on Monday refused to hand over the documents in response to a subpoena .
In a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , the vice president 's lawyer , Shannen W. Coffin , identified dozens of presidential authorizations of the program and Justice Department memos on its legal justifications in Cheney 's possession .
Coffin refused to hand over the documents , citing a president 's right to keep deliberations with his advisers private .
" The Office of the Vice President possesses copies of documents ... that we understand to be of the most interest to the Committee and with respect to which a claim of Executive Privilege if made would clearly be valid , " Coffin wrote in the letter Leahy released to reporters Monday .
Among the documents are " copies of Top Secret / Codeword Presidential Authorizations " issued between Oct. 4 , 2001 , and Dec. 8 , 2006 .
President Bush approved the warrantless wiretapping program , which allows the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on foreign calls without prior court approval , in response to the Sept. 11 attacks .
He was required to issue reauthorizations every 45 days .
The documents also include 10 Justice Department memos related to the program , including some that could shed more light on a March 2004 dispute over the program .
Justice Department officials threatened to resign over aspects of the program they thought were illegal , but the details of the dispute have not been made public .
In her letter to Leahy , Coffin asked for more time to comply with the subpoena and insisted the vice president 's office wanted to work out " an accommodation that protects the constitutional interests of all concerned . "
The Judiciary Committee earlier this summer authorized subpoenas to the White House and Justice Department related to its wiretapping investigation .
So far it has received none of its requested documents , and Leahy threatened to begin contempt proceedings if the administration continues to withhold the documents .
White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding also requested more time to comply with the subpoena , but the administration insists it is trying to cooperate with Congress .
" We have approached these discussions in a positive way that will not take us down the path of confrontation , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement , according to the Washington Post .
However , Leahy blasted the White House 's claims of negotiating in good faith during a Capitol Hill press conference Monday .
" The only accommodations we tend to get from the White House is , ' Do it our way and we 'll be happy , " he said .
Stanford enhances undergraduate financial aid program
Stanford University today announced the largest increase in its history for its financial aid program for undergraduates .
Under the new program , parents with incomes of less than $ 100,000 will no longer pay tuition .
Parents with incomes of less than $ 60,000 will not be expected to pay tuition or contribute to the costs of room , board and other expenses .
Students will still be expected to contribute their earnings from work during the summer and academic year .
The program also eliminates the need for student loans .
Other significant enhancements have been made to the program that will benefit aid recipients at all levels of income .
" This is the third consecutive year we have allocated substantially more money to financial aid for lower - and middle - income families , " said Stanford University President John Hennessy .
" We are committed to ensuring that Stanford asks parents and students to contribute only what they can afford for an education we believe is among the absolute best in the world .
By devoting more resources to financial aid , we seek to underscore what has long been the case — that no high school senior should rule out applying to Stanford because of cost .
We understand how families face serious financial pressures , and we are doing all we can to assist them . "
These changes bring Stanford 's undergraduate financial aid program for the 2008 - 09 academic year to more than $ 114 million , making it one of the largest programs in the nation .
The amount spent on financial aid next year is projected to equal half the total undergraduate tuition revenue Stanford expects to collect for the year .
To help pay for the enhanced aid program , the university increased its endowment payout last year to 5.5 percent .
It also plans to double the financial aid goal of The Stanford Challenge , its current fundraising campaign , to $ 200 million .
" Although Stanford 's tuition has gone up over the past five years , thanks to our increasingly generous financial aid program , families with incomes less than $ 150,000 will find a Stanford education much more affordable than it was five years ago , " Stanford University Provost John Etchemendy said .
" For most of these students , attending Stanford will cost less than most private and many public universities . "
Three out of every four Stanford undergraduates currently receive some form of financial aid .
When the new financial aid program is taken into account , the average family contribution for students receiving financial aid in 2008 will be reduced by 16 percent this year .
Stanford remains one of the few private universities with a " need - blind " admission policy for U.S. citizens and permanent residents , which guarantees that students will be accepted to the university regardless of their ability to pay — and be offered the financial support they need to attend Stanford .
The National Science Foundation announced today 14 grand engineering challenges for the 21st century that , if met , would greatly improve how we live .
But that 's not all , it wants you to rank them .
The final choices fall into four themes that are essential for humanity to flourish , - sustainability , health , reducing vulnerability and joy of living , the group said .
The committee did not attempt to include every important challenge , nor did it endorse particular approaches to meeting those selected .
Rather than focusing on predictions or gee - whiz gadgets , the goal was to identify what needs to be done to help people and the planet thrive , the group said .
A diverse committee of engineers and scientists - including Larry Page , co-founder and president of products , Google , Robert Langer , Institute Professor , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Robert Socolow , professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , Princeton University Environmental Institute - came up with the list but did not rank the challenges .
Rather the National Academy of Engineering ( NAE ) is offering the public an opportunity to vote on which one they think is most important .
Vote here on the challenges below :
* Make solar energy affordable
* Provide energy from fusion
* Develop carbon sequestration methods
* Manage the nitrogen cycle
* Provide access to clean water
* Restore and improve urban infrastructure
* Advance health informatics
* Engineer better medicines
* Reverse - engineer the brain
* Prevent nuclear terror
* Secure cyberspace
* Enhance virtual reality
* Advance personalized learning
* Engineer the tools for scientific discovery
Perhaps not coincidentally , the NSF this month asked the federal government for a $ 6.85 billion budget for fiscal year 2009 - a 13 % increase over its actual fiscal 2008 budget and a 6.5 % jump over what it requested a year ago - in an effort to fund more research into cybersecurity , advanced processors , new energy technologies and more .
And just last week the NSF requested $ 20 million from the US government for fiscal 2009 to start the " Science and Engineering Beyond Moore 's Law " effort , which would fund academic research on technologies , including carbon nanotubes , quantum computing and massively multicore computers , that could improve and replace current transistor technology .
Moore 's
Law states that the number of transistors that can be placed on silicon , and its attendant computational capability , doubles every 18 months .
Rumours that the terrorist suspect planned to pack an aircraft with explosives and launch it at the Ducal palace containing George Bush have been given weight by the president of Egypt , Hosni Mubarak .
He said Islamist suicide pilots were originally intended to launch an attack on the Italian riviera .
" On June 13 of this year , we learned of a communique from Bin Laden saying he wanted to assassinate Mr Bush and other G8 heads of state during their summit in Italy .
It was a well - known piece of in formation , " said President Mubarak .
On a state visit to Paris , the president told French media that Egypt 's intelligence services had intercepted plans for " an aeroplane stuffed with explosives " to plunge into Genoa .
A warning was passed to the US , he said .
When they installed a missile defence system at Genoa 's airport in July and enforced a no - fly zone , the Italian authorities were derided , but now they feel vindicated .
After President Mubarak went public , Italy 's deputy prime minister , Gianfranco Fini , confirmed that his own intelligence services had briefed him about the threat .
They were expecting a small civilian aircraft with the range to fly from dozens of European airports , not a passenger jet .
" Many people joked about the Italian intelligence force .
But actually , they had information that in Genoa there was the hypothesis of an attack on the American president with the use of an aeroplane .
That is why we closed the airspace above Genoa and installed anti-aircraft missiles .
Those who joked should now reflect , " Mr Fini said .
In addition to President Bush and Vladimir Putin , the July 20 - 22 summit of the seven most industrialised countries plus Russia gathered the leaders of Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Canada and Japan .
Days before the summit the head of Mr Putin 's personal protection force , General Yevgeni Murov , told the Russian news agency Itar - Tass that the US and Russian presidents were at risk .
" Bin Laden utters threats to the US president , " he was quoted as saying .
Italian media at the time also reported that Germany 's intelligence service had relayed to Rome notice of a Bin Laden plot .
That prompted the former CIA chief , Vincent Cannistrano , to hypothesise about an attack at the time deemed fanciful : " It would be simple to put explosives in a toy plane and fly it into a room full of dignitaries . "
The Egyptian president told Le Figaro that his knowledge was based on a video made by Bin Laden on June 13 .
" It spoke of assassinating President Bush and other heads of state in Genoa .
It was a question of an aeroplane stuffed with explosives .
These precautions then had been taken . "
However , in a twist which casts doubt on President Mubarak , the New York Times reported that people who have viewed the tape said there was no reference to stuffing an aircraft with explosives or killing Mr Bush .
The British government was unable to confirm that there had been a threat to attack the Genoa summit .
Dear Hollywood ,
Hi , it 's us !
The people who spend money on your movies .
Please stop making the same ones over and over again .
We 've seen the same recycled formulas year after year after year - and frankly , we 're tired of it .
It 's not that we think you 're completely useless , just ... you know , mostly .
We 'll admit , you 've delivered a few gems recently .
Transformers , for example , stumbled upon a refreshing formula : Namely , Giant Robots Fighting Each Other + Megan Fox Standing Around Looking Awesome : Now that is a formula we can get behind , ( if she 'll let us .
Pow ! ) .
You have our permission and , in fact , encouragement to exploit that particular format for a few more years .
These next six formulas , however , we never want to see again .

英国放送協 会( BBC ) がPerl on Railsを名乗るMVCフレームワークを開発したという話が一部をにぎわしていたので、簡単なまとめ。英語で話を追える人は下記を（コメント欄含めて）順に読んでいけばOKです（これ以外にもスラッシュドット（本家）をはじめ、いくつかのソースに情報が分散していますが、必要な流れはだいたいこの三つで把握できるはず）。
さて、本題。2007年11月30日に「 BBCが自社フレームワークとしてPerl on Railsを開発した」という情報がBBCラジオラボのブログで公開されました。ここでいうBBCというのは「英国放送協会」のこと。訳語をあげておくだけで十分だと思いますが、BBCはフットワークの軽いベンチャー企業ではありません。当然ながら、大企業には大企業の苦労があるわけでして、その記事によると、もともとBBCのサイトの大部分は静的HTMLを本番サーバにFTPでアップするという形で運営されていたのですが、サイトが大きくなって管理も大変になったし、番組表を用意するときに静的ファイルのままでは管理しづらいといった理由から動的生成できるフレームワークが必要になった――のですが、残念ながら既存のフレームワークは機能が足りなかったりBBCのサーバ上では動作しなかったりしたので、各種制約と移行コストの兼ね合いも考えて、すでに内部アプリケーションの開発で十分な利用実績があったRuby on Railsの流儀を真似 たPerlフレームワークを自社開発することにした、と。また、これまでBBC内部では横のつながりが弱くコードの共有が十分に行われていなかったので、このPerl on RailsではBBCとつきあいのある開発チームにも積極的にコードを提供してもらおうと思っているということも語られています。
名前の問題をさておけば、特にどうという話でもないでしょう。そのBBC製Perl on Railsのコードが広く公開されるかどうかはさておき、これに、たとえばJiftyやSoozyのような独自の名前がついていれば、よくある「自社フレームワークを作成しました」という話で終わっていたものと思われます。
ところが、これ にPerl on Railsという名前をつけて公開してしまったがために、一部から「 なんで素直にCatalyst（ないしRuby on Rails）を使わないんだ 」 「なんで車輪を再発明するんだ」という横槍が入ります。実態はぜんぜん違うわけですが、Ruby on Railsに対する対抗馬という程度の意味でCatalystはPerl on Railsであるという評判が立っていた時期があったことも一部の人々に過剰な反応をさせた原因となったのでしょう。
その横槍の根拠はさまざまでしたが、翌日、同じくBBCでエンジニアをしている人が明かしてくれた理由は実に身も蓋もないものでした。
On the live environment we were told at the time we had Perl 5.6 , and a few BBC approved perl modules .
Nothing more !
So that meant that catalyst a other solutions were out .
（本番環境に入っていたの はPerl 5.6とBBC公認のいくつかのモジュールだけだったから、CatalystやJiftyを使うわけにはいかなかったんよ）
念のために書いておくと、BBC とPerlのつきあいはそれほど浅いものではありません。CPANを見ればわかる通り、BBCは少なくとも2004年からCPANにモジュールを提供してくれていますし、初期バージョンがだいたい安定版を越えているところから見てもそれ以前から開発が続けられていたことは容易にうかがえます。モジュールの品質についても、たとえばPod::Xhtmlには星五つがついていますし、星一つのPod::Usage::CGIにしてみたところで評価を読んでみると、ものが悪いというより、一般の用途までは対応し切れていない部分があるという程度ですから、少なくとも現場レベルの技術力に疑問を呈する必要はないでしょう。
また、最新技術に関心が薄いわけでもなく、YAPC::Asia 2006の際に来日してプレゼンテーションしてくれ たLeon Brocard氏（ とLeo Lapworth氏）のMighTyVは2005年にBBCが開催したTV Listings competitionの成果物でしたし、London.pmのワークショップに参加してライトニングトークをしてくれるようなメンバーもいるとのこと。Andy Lester氏の記事によると 、Perl Hacksの共著者でもあ るCurtis " Ovid " Poe氏も現在 はBBCの仕事をしているそうですね。
その辺を承知でなお 「 それな ら Perl5.8にすればよかったんじゃないの」とか「ローカルにモジュール突っ込めばいいじゃないの」と食い下がる人もいましたが、今度はBBCがサーバを含めたもろもろをSiemensに売却・移管してしまっているため、ひとつのモジュールを追加するだけでもえらく苦労させられる（稟議を通してテストしてもらって……で何日、下手をすると何週間、何ヶ月、何年もかかってしまう）という話が出てきます。それもまた大企業の場合はありがちな話ですが、移管先のSiemensが悪いのか、それとも依頼元のBBCのセキュリティポリシーに問題がありすぎるのか、
Yes , that ’s right , Siemens forks Perl to remove features that their engineers do n’t like .
（その通り 、Siemensは自分のところのエンジニアが嫌がる（システムコールやなにやの）機能を全部取っ払ったPerlを作って（顧客に使わせて）いるんだ）
とか
The recent deployment of Template Toolkit to the BBC servers is one such example - Siemens took years and objected to this constantly , and when finally they assented to provide the single most popular template language for Perl , they removed all code execution functions from the language .
（最近で はTemplate Toolkitの例がそうだ。Siemensは何年も駄目だと言い続けていたんだが、ようやく納得してこいつを入れてくれることになったと思ったら、コードを実行できる機能を全部取っ払ってしまったんだから）
という徹底ぶりとあっては、そりゃあ既存のものを使うより自分たちで枠内に収まるものを作った方が早いという気持ちにもなりましょうし、社内や出入りの業者向けにはソースを公開・共有しても、一般にまで公開するかどうかはわからないというのも、結局はその制約がある以上、どんなコミットでも受け入れられるわけではありませんからごく自然な流れでありましょう、と。
もちろん現場の方もただ手をこまねいているわけではなく、亀の歩みながら事態を改善しようとしているようですし、今回のポイントはそのような制約のもとで新しいフレームワークが生まれた結果、BBCのサイトが便利になりつつあるよ、ということですから、部外者のわれわれとしては、名前に苦笑しつつも今後の動向を生暖かく見守っていればよい話です。
Three Romanians were in hospitals in Rome yesterday - one of them seriously injured - after being attacked by a masked , club - wielding gang on Friday night in the latest escalation of racial tension in Italy following the beating to death of a naval captain 's wife .
The violence , condemned by local politicians , came as authorities in Milan carried out the first expulsions of Romanians under new legislation that came into effect on Friday allowing for the removal of EU citizens judged to be a threat to public security .
Italian television showed four men being hustled aboard an airliner by police after nightfall .
Emotions were again running high yesterday at a funeral service in Rome for Giovanna Reggiani , the 47 - year - old woman who was discovered fatally injured in a ditch on Tuesday after being savagely attacked .
A young Romanian has been arrested and jailed .
He has admitted snatching her bag , but denies beating and sexually assaulting her .
A thousand people packed into the church , in a well - heeled district of the capital , for an ecumenical service conducted by a Protestant pastor and the Italian navy 's Roman Catholic chaplain .
Large numbers gathered outside , many of them tearful , middle - aged women .
Ms Reggiani , though married to a Catholic , was a member of Italy 's tiny Protestant community , the Waldensians .
Her husband , the commander of the navy 's minesweeping squadron , arrived at the church holding a single red rose .
Those who sat nearby said that , throughout the service , he muttered over and again : ' It 's not fair ' .
Ms Reggiani's death has profoundly shocked the Italian middle classes .
She was robbed , stripped of most of her clothes and ferociously beaten in a lonely part of northern Rome , but one that was until recently considered safe and respectable enough for officers ' married quarters .
In just a few years , it has become a haunt for prostitutes and pimps , dotted with encampments set up by the latest wave of immigrants from eastern European .
Bulldozers yesterday moved in to destroy the one where Reggiani 's alleged killer , Nicolae Mailat , a shepherd - turned - labourer , lived with his mother .
They and some 50 to 60 other Roma occupied a string of fragile shacks hidden in a copse .
Another makeshift settlement , in a supermarket car park on the other side of Rome , was the target of Friday night 's attack .
Yesterday , there were still pools of blood on the ground .
An eyewitness , who gave her name as Cristina , t said she had come out of the supermarket to see six to eight men arrive , carrying metal bars , staves and knives .
Their faces were concealed by balaclavas and motorcycle helmets .
The most seriously injured was Emil Marcu , 47 .
Doctors said he had a deep stab wound in the back , but his life was not in danger .
A spokesman for a newly founded far - right group , Fabio Sabbatani Schiuma , said he condemned the attack but called it ' the product of a climate of exasperation ' .
Anti-foreigner graffiti on the walls of the surrounding , working - class area echoed his words .
One woman said : ' We 've had enough of them .
My dad was mugged for his pension just at the end of this road . '
The vast majority of the 560,000 Romanians who have poured into Italy since visa restrictions were lifted five years ago have come to work .
But the government says they account for a disproportionate share of crime , including more than five per cent of murders .
Many of the recent arrivals have come to Rome where they live in sub- human conditions , often by the banks of the Tiber river .
Others have made their way to other cities like Milan where the authorities said yesterday that another 12 expulsions had been authorised by judges .
When Raymond Zulueta went into default on his mortgage last year , he did what a lot of people do .
He worried .
In a declining housing market , he owed more than the house was worth , and his mortgage payments , even on an interest - only loan , had shot up to $ 2,600 , more than he could afford .
“ I was terrified , ” said Mr. Zulueta , who services automated teller machines for an armored car company in the San Francisco area .
Then in January he learned about a new company in San Diego called You Walk Away that does just what its name says .
For $ 995 , it helps people walk away from their homes , ceding them to the banks in foreclosure .
Last week he moved into a three - bedroom rental home for $ 1,200 a month , less than half the cost of his mortgage .
The old house is now the lender ’s problem .
“ They took the negativity out of my life , ” Mr. Zulueta said of You Walk Away .
“ I was stressing over nothing . ”
Due to the vagaries of our calendar , every year whose number is cleanly divisible by four is a leap year , and so contains an extra day tacked onto its February .
( Excepting full centuries which , to be leap years , must be divisible by 400 ; if not , they are common years .
The year 1900 , therefore , was not a leap year , but 2000 was .
Leaves one breathless , does n’t it ? )
Because leap years are seen as unusual events that disturb the otherwise orderly progression of days / months / years , certain beliefs have been attached to them .
( One constant in the realm of folklore and superstition is that out - of - the - ordinary events are deemed to have out - of - the - ordinary consequences or properties . )
Leap years , according to folk tradition , were the only times when women could propose marriage to men , with this belief often termed “ The Ladies ’ Privilege . ”
Yet even within this hypothesis there was disagreement as to how far it went — a great many of those who encountered this custom did not see it as applicable throughout the length of a leap year , but only to the extra day itself ; that is , only to Feb. 29 .
Another school of thought held that a man so entreated either had to accept the proposal or pay the refused woman a substantial forfeit for turning her down , such as a silk gown or £ 100 .
( Indeed , it was widely and erroneously reported that a Scottish Act of Parliament from the 13th Century had mandated this , or that this “ agree or else ” proposition had been enshrined in English Common Law .
Often this tidbit of misinformation was presented as a 1288 decree by Queen Margaret of Scotland , under which men who declined the invitation to wed were fined £ 100 . )
In another form of the belief , men who said no were not on the hook to buy expensive presents for the disappointed girls or to pay fines to the Crown , but their refusals attracted ill fortune to themselves .
In yet another twist , if the gal who did the asking had failed to wear a scarlet flannel petticoat , or if a corner of the same were not partly visible under her dress , the man who declined would be spared the ill luck that a turn - down would ordinarily have propelled his way .
The origins of “ The Ladies ’ Privilege ” are not definitively known , but one posited beginning set in Ireland had St. Bridget complaining to St. Patrick about women not being able to ask the men they fancied to marry them .
According to the folktale , he offered the opportunity at a seven - year interval , and she bargained him down to four .
( If this tale is true , it ’s no wonder St. Patrick took to putting the run on snakes , because he sure was n’t doing well against women . )
Though everyone loves a good folktale , the beginning of this custom more likely has to do with Feb. 29 being perceived as a day that does not properly belong on the calendar and thus as a period when the ordinary rules of conduct do not apply .
Other superstitions play upon the underlying theme of “ betwixt and between ” times being occasions especially fraught with peril or periods when the unusual was not only allowed to occur , but was encouraged to do so .
Midnight — the time after the twelve but before the one — was viewed as an interval when the fabric drawn between the ordinary world and the realm of the spirits grew especially thin , its etherealness perhaps allowing a ghost or two to suddenly appear in our midst , or permitting one of us to be sucked into the chaos of the other side .
In similar spirit , it is considered bad luck for betrothed couples to allow themselves to be photographed together since , being neither single nor married , they exist in an in - between state .
Consequently , they must take care to prevent the appearance of presumption of enduring couplehood , lest by seemingly flaunting their togetherness , they may never see it come to fruition .
In earlier days of Western society , relations between the sexes were far more formal and scripted , with each gender being expected to adhere to its assigned roles .
When it came to proposing marriage , men did the asking and women did the accepting or declining — the other way around would have been unthinkable .
Thus a leap year reversal of this ordinary state of things would be seen as something else being turned on its ear during a period when little else made sense anyway .
The U.S. has its own “ women can pursue men ” holiday : Sadie Hawkins Day .
Named for a man-chasing female character in the Al Capp cartoon strip “ Li’l Abner , ” whose father decreed an annual footrace in her name ( with the spinsters chasing the unhitched males of the town and getting to marry any they caught ) , the day purports to grant women the right to propose marriage to unmarried men , or at least to ask them out .
Though there is no set day for this holiday , many communities celebrate it in November , some deeming it to be the Saturday closest to Nov. 9 .
Additionally , some high schools will designate one dance a year as a “ Sadie Hawkins ” event , meaning girls are expected to ask guys to be their dates for that event , not the other way around .
Unlike in earlier times , there is now no societal prohibition against women being the ones to ask on bended knee .
Custom , however , still continues to favor men doing the proposing , but its happening the other way around is no longer seen as shocking or as a challenge to the right way of things .
There is a bit more to leap year lore besides girls suddenly popping up to hold out velvet - covered ring boxes to their beaux .
Superstition decrees leap years are notably excellent for beginning important undertakings or business ventures .
The choice of Feb. 29 itself is deemed particularly astute in that even greater luck will attach to all that is begun on that day , including children conceived during that particular 24 - hour stretch .
Speaking of children , we also note that superstition says those born on Feb. 29 are fated to be favored by Dame Fortune .
Perhaps the last word on the subject of who should offer marriage to whom goes to the much - wed Zsa Zsa Gabor , who proposed to every one of her nine husbands .
“ A woman has to make up a man ’s mind , ” she said .
Hacking the Boeing 787
The news articles are pretty sensational :
The computer network in the Dreamliner ’s passenger compartment , designed to give passengers in - flight internet access , is connected to the plane ’s control , navigation and communication systems , an FAA report reveals .
And :
According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration , the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aeroplane may have a serious security vulnerability in its on - board computer networks that could allow passengers to access the plane ’s control systems .
More press .
If this is true , this is a very serious security vulnerability .
And it ’s not just terrorists trying to control the airplane , but the more common software flaw that causes some unforeseen interaction with something else and cascades into a bigger problem .
However , the FAA document in the Federal Register is not as clear as all that .
It does say :
The proposed architecture of the 787 is different from that of existing production ( and retrofitted ) airplanes .
It allows new kinds of passenger connectivity to previously isolated data networks connected to systems that perform functions required for the safe operation of the airplane .
Because of this new passenger connectivity , the proposed data network design and integration may result in security vulnerabilities from intentional or unintentional corruption of data and systems critical to the safety and maintenance of the airplane .
The existing regulations and guidance material did not anticipate this type of system architecture or electronic access to aircraft systems that provide flight critical functions .
Furthermore , 14 CFR regulations and current system safety assessment policy and techniques do not address potential security vulnerabilities that could be caused by unauthorized access to aircraft data buses and servers .
Therefore , special conditions are imposed to ensure that security , integrity , and availability of the aircraft systems and data networks are not compromised by certain wired or wireless electronic connections between airplane data buses and networks .
But , honestly , this is n’t nearly enough information to work with .
Normally , the aviation industry is really good about this sort of thing , and it does n’t make sense that they ’d do something as risky as this .
I ’d like more definitive information .
EDITED TO ADD ( 1/16 ) : The FAA responds .
Seems like there ’s more hype than story here .
Still , it ’s worth paying attention to .

Since , by pure coincidence , I learnt some LISP and functional programming .
languages like Haskell have intrigued me .
Now , this kind of academic interests happen to have practical ramifications that may be of interest to many of you .
For example , C# 3.0 will have features like lambda functions and type inference which are abilities brought from functional languages , furthermore , Orcas LINQ , the new proposal for integrating generic queries into C# and VB.
NET semantics , is a direct application of functional concepts .
This video is a fascinating conversation on the relevance of such concepts for solving actual problems like using the potential of multi-core CPUs or handling concurrency in transparent ways , people like Anders Hejlesberg feature on the video , so it 's worth downloading .
After watching the video I think many of you will want to learn some more about functional languages and , from the many available options , may be the closest one is F# , which was created at Microsoft Research and runs inside Visual Studio , I suggest to start with this very gentle video which is an eye opener , later on you can watch Don Syme ( the creator of F# ) talking about the ideas behind the language here and then he shows us the language here ( although for starters I prefer the Flying Frog Video ) .
Happy lambda programming !

Transparency International last week published its Corruption Perceptions Index , ranking 180 countries around the world according to their level of corruption .
That sounds like boring goody - goody stuff , suitable only for one of the less - interesting World Bank seminars .
But that 's not the case :
The level of corruption in a society is a measure of the leakage from that country 's economy .
In other words , if you 've invested in a corrupt country , a portion of the profits that should be going into your pocket is being siphoned off somewhere else .
This is a particularly important consideration for international investors , since many of the markets abroad are nowhere near as efficient as ours .
When you 're investing internationally you need to consider this issue ; it 's available at : http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2007/cpi2007/cpi_2007_table
The CPI is n't the only thing you must consider :
If it were , you 'd plunk the entire bundle down in Denmark , Transparency International 's # 1 country ( the truth is , you could do much worse ) .
You can't learn much in general from the small differences between the countries at the top of the list ; after all , the United States is only 20th , and we 're all presumably pretty satisfied that this market is a safe - enough place to invest .
Differences between emerging markets , and between different regions , are much more illuminating , however .
You 'd expect Scandinavia and northern Europe to rank high , and they do , but there are East Asian countries scattered among the Scandinavian nations , a remarkable tribute to places that were very poor only 40 years ago .
Singapore , for example , is at # 4 – ahead of Britain , Germany , the United States and everywhere else , except for New Zealand and a couple of the Scandinavians .
Hong Kong and Japan are both higher on the list than the United States , while Taiwan is at # 34 and South Korea at # 43 , both pretty respectable levels .
The major bad news for Asia from Transparency International 's list is the position of its two great growth stories , China and India .
Tied with Brazil and Mexico at # 72 , they are one place below Senegal .
While a mid-table position is n't disastrous , it indicates that corruption is a very serious problem in both countries .
Typically , this corruption is worst in the public sector , and in the banking system as a whole – both areas in which a modest bribe can secure an altogether disproportionate benefit .
In India , it means that any company dealing with the public sector is likely to get in trouble – think , for example , of the disastrous investment Enron made in the Dabhol power plant a few years back .
In China , pretty well all quoted companies are majority controlled by the public sector , and so is the banking system , while price - earnings ratios are above 30 .
However brilliant are its growth prospects , China is thus a very dangerous place to invest .
Some other Asian countries are even worse – Burma brings up the bottom of the table at # 179 .
But you presumably would n't put money there anyway ; nor probably in Iraq ( # 178 ) , Afghanistan ( #172 ) , or Bangladesh ( # 162 ) .
However , Indonesia and the Philippines are surprisingly low , at # 143 and # 131 respectively , and if you 're an experienced emerging markets investor I 'm sure your broker has shown you investments from those countries .
Both countries are at a level where , as a foreign investor , not only are your investments unsafe , but so are everybody else 's .
In the long term , or even in the medium term , growth from such a base is impossible unless the government produces drastic and long - lasting reforms .
Outside Asia , Transparency International 's table is generally bad news for Latin America .
Some countries are okay – Chile and Uruguay are both well ranked at # 22 and # 25 respectively , pretty well up with European levels ( but there 's little for a U.S. investor to buy in Uruguay ) .
However , Mexico and Brazil are down with China and India , where corruption is a real problem , and Colombia ( # 68 ) is only a little better .
Even worse are Argentina , at # 105 , and Venezuela , at # 162 .
The Middle East is also pretty tough , though the Gulf States of Qatar and Bahrain seem OK .
Africa does n't rank as badly as you might think , though very poor African countries make up most of the bottom - feeders .
Botswana at # 38 and South Africa at # 43 both have perfectly respectable ratings , comparable with Italy ( # 41 ) for example , a country you 'd presumably be fairly happy to invest in .
If you 're interested in natural resources investments , some of Africa should thus not be ruled out .
Southern and Eastern Europe , finally , are a bit iffy but not really disastrous .
Greece at # 56 and Turkey at # 64 are both at levels where corruption is a problem , but they should n't be ruled out as investments .
Most of the Eastern European countries that were formerly communist are more or less OK too – Bulgaria at # 64 and Romania at # 68 bring up the tail .
However , with the exception of the Baltic States , if a country was in the old Soviet Union , you should worry .
Ukraine is at # 118 , which probably does n't surprise you , but the richer and more investable countries of Russia and Kazakhstan are worse , not better ( # 143 and # 150 . )
I should avoid both .
To summarize , Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions Index is useful mainly as a check for investments that may otherwise seem attractive .
If a country is above # 50 on the list , then corruption probably is n't a major problem , except in particularly problematic areas like government contracting .
Between # 50 and # 100 or so , corruption is endemic in the society and a risk to you as a foreign investor .
While it may not prevent the country enjoying good economic growth , it may prevent you as an investor or a foreign company as a direct investor from enjoying the fruits of that growth .
If a country ranks below # 100 , it is very unlikely that it will enjoy any kind of economic takeoff , although with good natural resources ( Russia , Kazakhstan , Venezuela ) it may have a few good years if resources prices are high .
Fake FedEx Trucks ;
When the Drugs Absolutely Have to Get There Smugglers use fake trucks to get drugs , cash , illegal aliens across the border .
Jan. 18 , 2008  --
Savvy criminals are using some of the country 's most credible logos , including FedEx , Wal - Mart , DirecTV and the U.S. Border Patrol , to create fake trucks to smuggle drugs , money and illegal aliens across the border , according to a report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement .
Termed " cloned " vehicles , the report also warns that terrorists could use the same fake trucks to gain access to secure areas with hidden weapons .
The report says criminals have been able to easily obtain the necessary vinyl logo markings and signs for $ 6,000 or less .
Authorities say " cosmetically cloned commercial vehicles are not illegal . "
In August 2006 , the Texas Department of Public Safety , on a routine traffic stop , found 3,058 pounds of marijuana and 204 kilograms of cocaine in a " cloned " Wal - Mart semi-trailer , driven by a man wearing a Wal - Mart uniform .
In another case , a truck painted with DirecTV and other markings was pulled over in a routine traffic stop in Mississippi and discovered to be carrying 786 pounds of cocaine .
Police said they became suspicious because the truck carried the markings or DirecTV and several of its rivals .
An 800 number on the truck 's rear to report bad driving referred callers to an adult sex chat line .
Trucks and vans marked as ambulances or law enforcement vehicles create the greatest concern , according to the report .
A fake U.S. Border Patrol van was found to be carrying 31 illegal aliens in Casa Grande , Ariz .
An alert agent recognized that the " H " in the van 's serial number is a letter used only on U.S. Border Patrol Jeep Wranglers .
It should have been a " P . "
" Neither emergency service vehicles nor any government vehicles are exempt from terrorist or other criminal use , " the report warns its law enforcement readers .

From everything I ’ve heard , Google is a great company to work for .
They get benefits up the wazoo aimed at making them more productive while taking their mind off of every day chores .
According to Eric Schmidt , Google CEO …
“ The goal is to strip away everything that gets in our employees way .
We provide a standard package of fringe benefits , but on top of that are first - class dining facilities , gyms , laundry rooms , massage rooms , haircuts , carwashes , dry cleaning , commuting buses – just about anything a hardworking employee engineer might want .
Let ’s face it : programmers want to program , they do n’t want to do their laundry .
So we make it easy for them to do both . ” ( from Google )
First - class dining facilities ?
You mean like a nice clean cafeteria serving burgers and sandwiches ?
Hardly .
According to Food & Wine …
There are coolers packed with drinks .
We left with Gus Dry Meyer Lemon Soda , Smart Water , Cosmic Cranberry Synergy tea ( an organic , raw Kombucha — a handmade Chinese tea that ’s cultured for 30 days , and that we ’re told Madonna drinks ! ) in our purses ; the drinks are all free to Google employees , and to interlopers like us .
The cafeteria includes the following stations : The Chelsea Grill , a Raw Bar , a Ceviche Station , Antipasti , a Salad Bar , a Soup Station , a Spa Cuisine bar and one for Dessert .
The only one we did n’t hit was a Home Cooking station .
Our plates were full .
Nearly 50 local farms , seafood purveyors and sources of general yumminess are handwritten on a board near the Earth & Water station ( where they serve a different fresh fish every day ) .
There are also baskets of fresh fruit everywhere : yellow kiwis , prickly pears , apples and peaches .
And as for Food & Wine ’s favorite Google cafeteria selections …
From the Raw bar : Shredded carrot and jicama with peanuts , ginger and grapes ( one of the chefs told us she ’d created the recipe that morning ) .
Zucchini “ pasta ” with sweet peas and a creamy pine nut sauce .

There was also cinnamon angel - food cake , green tea madeleines and fresh peach and agave smoothies .
We enjoyed ( read : inhaled ) our It ’s Its on the terrace , which overlooks the city skyline and has amazing views of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings .
So employees get a gourmet lunch ?
Yup .
And if they come to work on an empty stomach or want to work late , they can enjoy a gourmet breakfast and dinner as well .
But what if I get hungry after lunch ?
Got any snacks ?
Employees can snack from free mini-convenience stores filled with everything from organic gummy bears to cereal , yogurt , health bars , pretzels , bottled water and even some seemingly contraband sodas .
Ok , I ’m in .

Now I just need to learn how to do computer programming .

Separated twins shed light on identity issues
Though they share same DNA , the 2 women have vast differences
Paula Bernstein , left , and Elyse Schein are identical twins who were separated at birth and reunited 35 years later .
They have written a book about their lives , Identical Strangers .

PHILADELPHIA —
When identical twins Paula Bernstein and Elyse Schein finally met for the first time at age 35 , they both said the same thing .
It was n't so much like seeing a mirror image but like finding someone who'd lived a different life in your body .
Both women had the same delicate wrists and rounded hips , the same allergy to sulfa drugs .
Both had studied film theory in college and had made a short film .
But Paula was married with a baby , favored lightened , feminine curls and drank cosmopolitans .
Her sister lived alone , colored her hair a sultry dark brunet and preferred scotch .
The two had been put up for adoption and separated in infancy as part of a 1960s experiment .
Identical twins offer a tantalizing window into the power of inheritance , and current twin studies continue to shake up our understanding of mental health , personality , the influence of parenting , and the meaning of identity .
Power of genetics
One thing that has become clear in recent decades is that unless parents are abusive or neglectful , they have much less power to damage their children than previously thought .
" When I was a student , mothers were considered the cause of schizophrenia , " said psychologist Thomas Bouchard , head of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Adoption Research .
The prevailing theory on autism was that it was caused by cold " refrigerator mothers , " he said .
It was easy to ignore genetics in the 1950s and 1960s , Bouchard said , because the field had been tarnished by the Nazis .
Today , the pendulum has swung the other way .
Although identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA , he said , they differ much more than most people would expect .
As Schein and Bernstein found , twins are genetic clones , but they are not copies .
Schein was the first to find out she was a twin .
She always knew she was adopted , and when she turned 33 she decided to seek information about her birth mother .
She was living in Paris and working as a filmmaker .
' A zillion questions '
She found only that her biological mother was Jewish , had been 28 when she gave birth , and had not tried to find her daughter .
Schein thought that was all she would discover when , some months later , she received a certified letter from an adoption agency .
It said that she was the younger of twin girls and that her mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia .
" I had a zillion questions , " she said .
Was she an identical or fraternal twin ?
Why were they separated ?
Had the other twin stayed with the birth mother ?
" I knew I had to find her . "
She flew to New York , where she had been born , and started searching through public records .
Eventually a social worker connected to the adoption agency found her lost twin .
Paula lived in Brooklyn with her husband and young child .
The social worker explained to Schein that the pair had been separated as part of an experiment , but said that she did not know the details .
The social worker called Paula Bernstein to tell her about her sister .
Bernstein 's reaction was similar to her twin's .
" I had a zillion questions , " she said .
Foremost among them :
Why were they separated ?
They talked on the phone first .
When they met several days later , they found they looked alike but were not perfectly identical .
They both had studied and liked French , both had edited their school newspapers , both struggled with acne and depression .
Their continued search for answers led them to Viola Bernard , a renowned New York psychiatrist who believed that identical twins would better forge individual identities if separated .
She had persuaded the adoption agency to send twins to different homes .
They also uncovered Peter Neubauer , a prominent psychiatrist at New York University , who studied the separated twins to compare the forces of nature with nurture .
Bernard had died , but Neubauer , who was in his 90s , met with the twins in his Upper East Side apartment .
They say he revealed nothing about the study or what was learned .
The results are sealed until 2066 , thanks to ethical problems that became clear later .
Study would n't fly now
The twins did find that the study had included five pairs of twins and one set of triplets , and that Schein and Bernstein were dropped early on because one reportedly had grown faster than the other .
The adoptive families were told that their children would be part of a child - development study .
They were never told that they had adopted separated twins .
Neither Schein nor Bernstein expressed bitterness toward the researchers , calling their actions well - intentioned but misguided .
Minnesota 's Bouchard said such a study would be unthinkable now , but ethical standards were different in the mid-20th century .
Bouchard himself believes that twins reared apart could yield scientific insights , though for his studies he chose only those separated through twists of fate — never deliberate intervention .
One of the biggest surprises to come from that work is that twins reared apart are n't any more different than those reared together , suggesting their differences are not forged by family dynamics but by other , subtler factors .
What if roles reversed ?
Schein said she wondered what would have happened had she and Bernstein each been adopted into the other 's family .
" Would she be me and would I be her ? "
Bouchard 's studies would suggest not .
Sensing her inherent difference , she said she wondered whether Bernstein 's parents were relieved that they got the " good , " married twin and not the " bad , " bohemian one .
But each twin said she would not wish for the life of the other .
They were different people , after all .
チーズの栄養 素
お酒と相性のいいチーズ
チーズに含まれているタンパク質は良質なタンパク質で、カラダに必要なアミノ酸をバランス良く含むと言われています。
アミノ酸は、肝臓の機能改善や肝臓疾患治療に効果があるといわれていて、アルコールをすみやかに分解してくれる働きがあります。
ですので、お酒のつまみにチーズを食べれば悪酔いせずのワインを楽しむことができるかもしれません。
タンパク質がガンに効く？
チーズがガンに効くという話は聞いたことはないのですが、制ガン作用があるという研究結果があるそうです。
良質なタンパク質によってリンパ球が活性化して、ガン細胞の増殖を妨げてくれるそうです。
脳卒中にも ？
タンパク質の働きにはいろいろあって、過敏な塩分を体外に出すという働きもあります。
これによって高血圧や脳卒中の防止につながるという訳です。
どれくらいの効果があるのかは人それぞれだと思いますが、チーズのタンパク質が身体をつくるという役割と、健康を守るという重要な役割に役立つ食品の一つだということですね。
カルシウム不足にはチーズが１番
いろいろな栄養素が含まれるチーズですが、実はカルシウムの吸収率が高いことでも有名です。
小魚や海藻類と比較すればそれらの約2倍もあります。
また、牛乳200mgに対してチーズなら20〜30gで同じ量のカルシウムを摂ることができます。
つまり、カルシウムを手軽に摂るにはチーズが最適なのです。
カルシウムは成長期の子供にはもちろんのこと、最近よく言われているのは、中高年女性の骨粗鬆症防止に摂るべきミネラルと言われています。
あまり知られていないのですが、実はカルシウムは精神安定にも深い関わりがあります。
チーズを食べることによって、実はストレスから身を守ってくれるかも知れませんね。
ビタミ ンB2もあるの？
ビタミンB2は疲労回復で有名です。 実はチーズに豊富に含まれる栄養分の１つでもあります。
タンパク質と結びついて脂肪分を分解し燃焼するので、ダイエットにも役立つのがビタミンB2です。 疲れやすいと感じる人、ダイエットしたい人は、チーズを食べるというのも一つの問題解決方法かも知れません。
脂肪は悪いことばかりじゃない
チーズに含まれる脂肪分はすぐにエネルギー源に変わってしまうものばかりです。
脂肪という響きから想像するのは、肥満というネガティブなことが多いですが、熟成している最中に酵素の働きによって脂肪が分解されて、他の食品の動物性脂肪よりもずっと消化されやすいのです。
チーズ料理を食べた後に腹持ちがいいと感じるのは、この適度な脂肪分のおかげなのですね。

At one time I was really worried about Global Warming .
And at the risk of starting a Global Warming debate here ( one that I do n't wish to participate in ) , my position is that the scientific consensus backs the hypothesis that human activity is contributing to Global Warming .
I am not an atmospheric scientist , so in this case I rely on the scientific consensus of the experts .
This is the same standard I apply to other fields in which I lack expertise .
If you put it to a popular vote , and people learned that GHG emissions could be arrested ( hypothetically ) if they were willing to pay $ 7 / gallon of gasoline , what percentage would vote for that ?
My guess is that it would be well less than 20 % , implying that GW concerns will give way to economic concerns .
I understand that the scientific consensus is sometimes wrong .
But that is the exception rather than the rule .
I am familiar with arguments against Global Warming , and I certainly do n't want to see debate quashed .
I also think that it is unfortunate that people who question Global Warming are sometimes shouted down with the kind of anger often reserved for the likes of Holocaust deniers .
But even though I encourage the debate , I think the skeptics are soundly losing that debate .
So , since I do accept the scientific consensus , then why am I no longer seriously worried ?
Because I have come to the realization that we are never going to pay the price that it would take to halt - much less reverse - Global Warming .
This article reiterates my opening comment :
To work , carbon tax must sting
Most Canadians tell pollsters they 're concerned about climate change .
Many insist they 'd like to do something about it , and would even pay for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
But propose actual cash amounts – 25 cents a litre on gasoline , perhaps , or a $ 10 daily commuter toll – and support evaporates .
" Once you put a price on it , people tend to think twice about it and say , ` Maybe not , ' " says Mario Canseco of Angus Reid Strategies , which surveyed about 3,700 Canadians on the issue last March .
The basic idea : Boosting the cost of anything containing carbon – the main greenhouse gas – would compel industries and consumers to seek cheaper alternatives .
They 'd switch to cleaner fuels or consume less – either by adopting more efficient technologies or simply reducing their activity .
Presumably , the alternatives would be better for the environment .
The problem :
No government appears willing to impose a cost high enough to actually change behaviour .
And while several industry groups argue pricing carbon is a good idea , their enthusiasm is less than it seems .
And those excerpts explain the problem in a nutshell .
I know that people are n't willing to pay the price , even though they " want " something to be done about Global Warming .
If it means higher prices or inconvenience , the Western World will wring hands and wish for something to be done , but that 's as far as it is going to go .
Yes , I consider Global Warming to be a problem .
But we simply are n't going to address it , hence I choose to focus my efforts on things that I think we will address .
In the case of Global Warming , I can only try to react and position myself to prepare for what I think the consequences may be .
Now , I do n't mean there wo n't be attempts to address Global Warming .
But I maintain that we wo n't collectively do anything that will reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions .
Despite years of fretting and Al Gore 's efforts and the Kyoto Protocol and all of the words and effort that have gone into action , has there been any measurable tailing off of the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations ?
How many nations that signed on to Kyoto are meeting their targets ?
And how many coal - fired power plants did China and India build since the agreement was signed ?
I think the disconnect is that people do n't see any immediate consequences , and they know that mitigation is going to cost them money .
So , they figure " Let 's just wait and see what happens . "
The average person just does n't see this as a problem serious enough to make meaningful sacrifices over .
I certainly favor mitigation , because solutions generally would also provide mitigation for peak oil .
I want to see us greatly slow the rate at which we are using up our fossil fuels , which is why I favor higher carbon taxes .
I often see the argument that higher gas taxes in the U.S. are n't going to stretch our fossil fuel supplies .
The reasoning is that this will reduce demand in the U.S. , which will lower worldwide prices and spur demand everywhere else .
There may be some truth to that argument , but given that the U.S. is the largest user of crude oil , I think we need to get our own house in order before worrying that China or India will use up the oil that we do n't .
Besides , if we make our economy less dependent on oil - and as a result China uses more oil - is n't that going to be China 's problem as supplies deplete ?

Immune system trained to tolerate transplanted organs .
Transplanting part of the immune system along with an organ can help to prevent rejection .
AJ PHOTO / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
Three independent research teams have successfully performed organ transplantations that do not require the recipient to face a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection .
Instead , the new techniques prevent rejection by training the immune system to recognize the new organ as its own .
The three studies , published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine , are preliminary and involve only a few patients .
But if the techniques can be reproduced in a larger population , they could eliminate one of the most enduring scars of the operation : the need to continue taking sometimes - dangerous immunosuppressant drugs .
Thousands of kidney transplantations are performed every year , and nearly 99 % of patients in the United States are still alive a year after the surgery .
But even when the organ donor is a close relative , the transplant recipient often needs to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives to guard against organ rejection .
But although the drugs help to prevent rejection , they also increase the risk of infection and are very pricey .
Previous work in animals has suggested ways to avoid taking these drugs .
Mice and monkeys given an organ transplant coupled with an infusion of blood stem cells could sometimes be weaned off the immunosuppressant drugs1,2 .
Blood stem cells are made by bone marrow and give rise to white blood cells , including the B cells that produce antibodies , and T cells that are important in distinguishing host from donor .
Researchers found that transplanting these cells into the host created a hybrid immune system .
The transplanted organ was no longer recognized as foreign ; it was partly ‘ self ’ .
Take over
The new reports all follow this principle , although not the same procedure .
Michael Stormon of the Children ’s Hospital at Westmead in Sydney , Australia and his colleagues report on a liver transplantation in a 9 - year - old girl with hepatitis3 .
Her illness , plus a virus she carried called cytomegalovirus , and the immunosuppressant drugs she was given after the operation , had weakened her own immune system so much that her immune cells were almost completely replaced by stem cells brought in by the donated liver .
She even had to be re-vaccinated against the measles and the mumps , as the donor had not been vaccinated against them .
The girl was able to discontinue her immunosuppressant regime a year after the procedure , and has not experienced any complications in the four years since .
Samuel Strober of Stanford University in California and his colleagues created a similar situation in a patient who received a kidney from his brother4 .
The patient was treated with radiation and a drug that destroyed his T cells .
He then received a new kidney and an infusion of blood that had been enriched for blood - producing stem cells , both from his brother .
Genetic tests revealed the presence of the brother 's immune cells still circulating in the host ’s blood more than two years after the procedure .
The patient stopped taking immunosuppressant drugs with no signs of rejection .
Finally , David Sachs of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and his colleagues report on transplantations of kidneys and bone marrow in five patients whose donors were not related to them , making rejection more difficult to avoid5 .
Of the first three patients to undergo the procedure , one patient ’s antibodies rejected the organ in the first attempt ; the second attempt , however , was successful .
Because of this , the researchers added an extra drug to their protocol to destroy the host 's antibody - producing B cells in the following two patients .
All four of the patients with successful initial transplants were able to discontinue their immunosuppressants in less than a year after the procedure .
Surprisingly , these patients did not continue to produce donor immune cells .
Precisely why these patients did not reject their new kidneys is unclear , says Sachs .
Risk–benefit analysis
Bone - marrow transplantation carries its own risk , but the benefits may outweigh that , says Strober .
“ The short - term potential risks have to be put up against the long - term risks and the side effects and costs of the drugs , ” he says .
The researchers are preparing to continue the study in more patients .
Strober says that if all goes well , the technique could be generally available in five to ten years .

All three of these studies illustrate an emerging understanding of how the immune system can be trained to tolerate foreign cells , says Thomas Starzl , an immunologist and transplantation specialist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania .
Researchers have been transplanting organs successfully for forty years without fully understanding how the immune system responds , he says .
“ No one understood what the mechanism of tolerance was , ” says Starzl — nor the way in which organs became knitted into the recipient 's body .
By understanding those mechanisms , it becomes possible to adjust procedures to get the best benefit , he says .
This morning I sent to my Arkansas Congress people - House Rep Mike Ross , Senators Blanche Lincoln and David Pryor , the following message about a Read the Bills Act ” :
“ This bill is as American as Apple Pie .
And the bill enforces Fidelity and Morality of our Government .
To pass any legislation without having read what you are voting for , or against , is inexcusable .
And yet , our Representatives have adopted this practice with gusto .
It's
time to put a stop to it .
I am asking you to introduce this at your first
opportunity , preferably at your next session .
Anything less than adopting the stewardship that we have entrusted in you is an indication that you do not have our best interests as your priority .
If you wo n't represent your people , you do n't deserve our support .
This bill will end Pork and bring honesty back to governance ” .
I sent it because after reading the Draft and many words about the proposed bill , I have come to the conclusion that nothing will happen unless I do my part , small as it is .
But if I could be joined by the many millions that would be affected by the Bill , and if they would do the same thing as I have just done , we would ultimately get such a bill as law .
I guess what really pushed me to action this morning was an article by Brian Riedl , of the Heritage Foundation .
The article “ Oink !
Oink !
Oink !
Listed three instances of the disdain your elected representatives have for you .
Those three were :
Item 1 : Last month , the Senate had to choose how to spend $ 400 million : Health insurance for 173,000 children , or 1,056 pork projects .
Pork won 68 - 26 .
Item 2 : Following the I - 35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis , senators had to choose between spending $ 1 Billion repairing structurally deficient bridges , or on pork projects .
They voted 82 - 14 in favor of pork .
Item 3 : Congress recently overrode a Presidential veto for the first time .
And what finally brought Republicans and Democrats together to override the president ?
Iraq , Health care , Immigration ?
NO .
It was a massive $ 23 billion water bill overflowing with pork projects .
Thank you Brian for those eye openers .
Most of the excuses coming from Congress , when such excesses are revealed , boils down to “ I did n’t know it was in there ” , or the old “ I voted for the good , not the bad ” .
Surely they can do better and so can we .
The Read the Bills Act ( find it on Downsizer , DC and many other places on the Net ) would go a long way to cutting out the pork .
What the bill would do , if passed as drafted would require that any Congressperson who votes on a bill must have read the bill , otherwise the bill would become null and void .
I have copied the following brief summary from the Downsizer page explaining the proposed bill .
Each bill , and every amendment , must be read in its entirety before a quorum in both the House and Senate .
Every member of the House and Senate must sign a sworn affidavit , under penalty of perjury , that he or she has attentively either personally read , or heard read , the complete bill to be voted on .
Every old law coming up for renewal under the sunset provisions must also be read according to the same rules that apply to new bills .
Every bill to be voted on must be published on the Internet at least 7 days before a vote , and Congress must give public notice of the date when a vote will be held on that bill .
Passage of a bill that does not abide by these provisions will render the measure null and void , and establish grounds for the law to be challenged in court .
Congress cannot waive these requirements .
Riedl goes on in his article to examine many instances of Pork , but the increase of the largess caught my eye .
Riedl points out that in 1996 there were 958 earmarks , but in 2005 the earmarks totaled 13,491 an increase to 14 times greater than 1958 , and yet the number of Congress people remained the same .
He points out that the 1982 highway authorization bill contained 10 earmarks , the 2005 version had 6,371 .
We have let our elected Government get out of control .
We have to absolutely rein them in .
This bill would be a start but by no means the end .
We need to go on to turn out the crooks in 2008 and impose transparent oversight on their replacements .
Looking at the increase in corruption and the rate of the increase , it ’s not something we need to do , its something we have to do .
As writer Thomas Friedman explains , we only have energy POLITICS .
Shame on us for screwing around with an issue that has massive repercussions for national security .
In September 2007 , Tom Friedman gave a succinct ( 11 minute ) speech to the Rocky Mountain Institute .
Friedman is a Pulitzer prize - winning journalist with the New York Times .
His speech contained many important take - away messages .
The main message is that the green revolution has finally reached Main Street , even though we are just getting started .
Friedman bemoans the lack of any real policy paradigm .
We do n’t yet have the means for connecting lots of capital with lots of technology yet .
He explains that we need a coherent and correct enabling government policy in order to have things take off , yet “ there is no discussion by government leaders . ”
He bluntly argues that “ we do n’t have an energy policy .
We have energy politics driven by the richest lobbies . ”
The decisions currently being made by the federal government have nothing to do with making strategic and smart decisions .
This massive corruption of the political process was recently exposed in detail by Rolling Stone .
In some state governments , things are starting to change .
For instance , in California utilities are paid by how many kilowatts they say , not for how many they sell .
Friedman argues that we need a galvanizing principle in order to make green “ the new red white and blue . ”
He argues that until we start making smart decisions regarding energy and environment , the United States cannot be healthy , innovative , secure or respected around the world .
The reason we ca n’t cheat the environment is that “ you ca n’t fool mother nature , because she “ always bats last and she always bats 1000 .
Is there enough time remaining to make the necessary changes ?
Friedman ended his speech by quoting Dana Meadows : “ We have enough time , just enough time , starting now . ”
I agree entirely with Friedman .
See here , for example , where I criticize the way politicians and the media present ethanol as a pancea so that we do n’t need to talk about changing our wasteful and destructive ways .
The undeniable dwindling of oil and other natural resources are inconvenient truths for a media that seeks only drummed up conflict and happy news .
It ’s the same type of disingenuousness used by politicians who tout coal as a “ solution . ”
Consider some of the real ways to make a long - term sustainable difference , like solar .
And here are dozens of things we can do right now , here ( No Impact Man ) and here , courtesy of the Rocky Mountain Institute .
The penis is as unpredictable as some other piece of the human body , in spite of a deceivingly straightforward appearance .
In addition , since the two elements of the penis are outstanding to people the same , there is a propensity to feel that everyone knows it all worth thinking about it .
In any case , there are constantly a couple of inquiries left unanswered or some dark piece of data that no one tries to recall and which may get fascinating in a specific setting .
So here ’s a general portrayal of the penis whose point is to give a far reaching introduction of this organ .
Essentially , the human penis is comprised of two sections : the pole and the glans ( otherwise called the head ) .
The pole is n’t a muscle as some have recommended .
It is made of three segments of tissue , one of which proceeds ahead to shape the glans .
The three segments are called Corpus Spongiosus , which frames the underside of the penis and the glans , and Corpora Cavernosa , which are two areas of tissue situated by one another on the upper side of the penis .
The pole is shrouded in skin , while the glans bolsters the approximately connected overlay of skin known as the prepuce .
The prepuce is connected to the underside of the penis , in a zone called the frenum .
Furthermore , finally , the penis is crossed from one end to the next by the urethra .
This waterway fills in as an entry for both pee , delivered in the bladder , and the sperm , created in the balls .
Erection is accomplished by filling the two Corpora Cavernosa with blood .
In contrast to some different vertebrates , people have no erectile bone and need to depend rather on engorgement with blood to arrive at erection .
At the point when the erection is activated by sexual incitement , the conduits that carry blood to the penis widen so as to build blood stream .
The wipe like Corpora Cavernosa tops off with blood , which makes the penis hardened .
The stiffer tissues choke the veins that divert blood from the penis so as to keep up the erection .
Each male child is brought into the world with a full arrangement of conceptive organs .
In any case , these organs are not completely created and remain so until the kid enters adolescence .
At adolescence , as a rule between the ages of 10 and 14 , the pituitary organ begins emitting hormones that prompt the balls to deliver testosterone .
Testosterone is the hormone that controls all the physical and a considerable lot of the mental qualities that characterize man .
Its essence guarantees the advancement of greater bones and higher bulk in men .
It is additionally liable for the enlargement in penis and balls size , the spirit of pubic hair and the more profound tone of the male voice .
The penis quits developing toward the finish of adolescence , which comes around the age of 18 .
In any case , there are numerous condition factors that may defer or quicken the beginning or the finish of pubescence .
This implies a few men may encounter penis enlargement past the age of 18 .
A typical urban legend that nearly anybody has known about is that penis size is connected to the size of another body part .
The most widely recognized adaptations of this legend center around the size of hands , feet , nose or generally speaking stature to decide the size of the penis .
As a matter of fact , there is no such connection .
Despite the fact that the advancement of the penis in the incipient organism is constrained by indistinguishable qualities from the appendages , penis enlargement at pubescence is completely represented by testosterone and has nothing to do with different pieces of the body .
A few men are brought into the world with huge penises .
This is an undisputed unavoidable truth whose causes are as yet a secret to science .
As expressed above , there is no connection among ’s penis and body size .
Studies directed on bats have demonstrated that the sexual organs and the mind require enormous amounts of vitality to create .
Eventually , the creating undeveloped organism chooses whether it needs a greater mind or a greater arrangement of sexual organs .
In any case , science is still at a misfortune to see how the choice is made and why .
Also , ultimately , a word on penis works out .
The activities that PenisHealth elevates are intended to drive the sections of tissue to extend in both length and bigness .
This is finished by applying pressure on the pole and helping the cells that make up the tissues to increase .
Clearly , the point of these activities is to make the Corpora Cavernosa hold more blood so as to build the size of the erect penis .
As opposed to what numerous cynics think , the cautious and continued practicing of the penis is a sheltered and successful method for expanding length and circumference .
In a recently released Harris Poll survey , 21 % of American adults believe the sun revolves around the earth .
I am not making this up .
By comparison , less than 15 % of the population believes tobacco companies , oil companies , HMOs and health insurance companies , phone companies , and pharmaceutical and drug companies are “ generally honest and trustworthy : ”
These are remarkable numbers .
It is very hard to get this degree of agreement about anything .
The Harris results are not an aberration .
The results have not varied considerably over the past five years — although overall trust levels actually declined from the already very low threshold in 2003 .
Also , they are in line with an array of polling data showing deep concern about concentrated corporate power .
An amazing 84 % told Harris that big companies have too much power in Washington ; by contrast , only 47 % percent said that labour unions have too much power in Washington .
These results have proven durable .
Every year since 1994 , the year Republicans took control of Congress , at least 80 % of the public has ranked big companies as having too much power in Washington .
The new poll also asked about support for measures to control corporations .
These results are eye - opening as well , though perhaps not in the expected way .
When polls present specific regulatory proposals for consideration , U.S. public support is typically strong and often overwhelming — even when arguments against government action are presented .
For example :
· After hearing arguments for and against , 76 % favour granting the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco .
· After hearing arguments for and against , 75 % favour legislation that would significantly increase energy efficiency , including auto fuel efficiency standards and the use of renewable energy .
· Eighty - five percent favour country - of - origin labelling for meat , seafood , produce and grocery products , and 75 % favour a legislative mandate requiring it be done .
· Some 71 % say it is important that drugs remain under close review by the FDA and drug companies after they have been placed on the market .
· Harris found that those who think there is too little government regulation in the area of environmental protection outpaced those who think there is too much by a more than 2 - to - 1 margin .
What the Harris findings on attitudes to regulation show is that the business campaign against regulation as an abstract concept has been very successful .
It highlights the need for all of us - consumer , environmental , labour and other corporate accountability advocates - to defend the concept of regulation .
At the same time , there 's a need to connect rampant corporate abuses with the deregulation and non-regulatory failures of the last three decades .
One needs look no farther than the " sub - prime mortgage crisis " as a top - flight example .
There ’s little doubt that the general public attitude toward regulation significantly affects the willingness of politicians to take on corporate power .
The poll also goes far in explaining two things :
First , if one out of five Americans think the earth revolves around the sun , something is terribly wrong with education in the country .
Of course , we also have a serious presidential candidate who states flatly that he does not believe in evolution and that Earth is but 8,000 years old , so what does that say about American education ?
Second , it explains why the populist messages of candidates such as Edwards , Obama and even Huckleberry Huckabee strike a resonant chord with voters this primary season .

Says ' Weird Things ' Going On as Party Stops Counting Votes at 87 % , Declares McCain ' Winner ' with Just 242 Vote Margin out of nearly 14,000 Reported Tallied So Far
Paul Currently in Third Place , Just 427 Votes Behind Huckabee as Louisiana GOP Race Shows Even Slimmer Margin for ' Winner ' Huckabee by less than 1 % , Tallied on Fully Unverifiable Sequoia Electronic Voting Machines ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/10/2008 , 4:09 pm PT
[ Updated at bottom of article with an " explanation " from the WA state GOP chairman .
This story gets more bizarre by the minute .
Be sure to check the updates if you read this story earlier . ]
" The Huckabee Presidential Campaign will be exploring all available legal options regarding the dubious final results for the state of Washington State Republican precinct caucuses , " according to a statement posted today on their official campaign website .
It was 2:30 am on the West Coast last night as we noticed CNN was reporting only 87 % of precincts counted from Washington state 's Republican Caucus yesterday .
Just over 200 votes separated the leader John McCain from Mike Huckabee in a very close second , with Ron Paul coming in a very close third .
Throughout the day , according to Josh Marshall at TPM , Huckabee had been leading in the returns until very late , when McCain pulled just ahead of him by just a few votes .
" With 87 % of the returns counted , " writes Marshall , " the Washington state GOP , which runs the caucuses stopped releasing results .
That left us and a lot of other news organizations in a bit of a quandary last night since it looked like McCain was going to pull it off .
But as late as 1:30 AM on the east coast promised new results kept failing to materialize . "
And then , in the middle of the night , the state GOP posted a press release declaring McCain the winner , even with some 13 % of the votes still unreported , and just 242 votes --- out of 13,745 reported so far --- separating McCain from Huckabee who 'd finished a " strong second " according to the GOP release .
" In other words , " Huckabee campaign chair Ed Rollins says in their statement this morning , " more than one in eight Evergreen State Republicans have been disenfranchised by the actions of their own party . "
" Now , I think it would be borderline for a media organization to declare one candidate a winner when the margin separating first and second was 1.8 % with 13 % of the results still uncounted , " writes Marshall today .
" But for the officials holding the election to declare the result on that basis is simply bizarre .
But that 's what they did . "
Of course , none of that kept the always - responsible Reuters news service from declaring " McCain wins Washington state Republican contest " at 8:10 am ET this morning .
This afternoon , the Huckabee camp is announcing they are prepared to go to court if necessary , as the candidate himself declared that " weird things " are going on in Washington while on NBC's Meet the Press .
At the same time , the results of the GOP Louisiana Primary , as announced by the state , are even closer than those so far released in Washington .
Though because the election was held on wholly unverifiable electronic voting machines , everyone will simply have to settle for whatever numbers the faith - based systems reported to them , no matter how close the margin ...
Promising their " lawyers will be on the ground in Washington State soon , " and that the campaign is " prepared to go to court " and " prepared to take our case all the way to the Republican National Convention in September , " Rollins notes ( ironically , or otherwise ) in the campaign 's official statement ...
" It would be a disservice to every voter in Washington State to not pursue a full accounting of all votes cast .
...
" All Republicans should unite to demand an honest accounting of the votes , so that Republicans can have full confidence in the results , and full confidence in the eventual Republican nominee .
...
" Our cause is just .
We must reemphasize the sacred American principle that all ballots be counted in a free , fair , and transparent manner . "
This morning , on Meet the Press , Huckabee made it clear he was not yet ready to concede the state , alleging some " weird things " going on , and that they were " looking at some legal issues up there . "
Though host Tim Russert , little surprise , seemed less than interested , since he was already instructed by the party who had " won , " and far be it from him to question anybody or anything .
From this morning 's Meet the Press ( video clip at right ) :
HUCKABEE : Washington state , it 's not quite yet over .
Still too close to call .
RUSSERT : But the party has declared it over .
HUCKABEE :
They have , but there 's some weird things ...
We 're looking at some legal issues up there and we 're not ready to concede that one until we understand how it's ...
Washington state , it 's not quite yet over .
Still too close to call .
But the party has declared it over .
They have , but there 's some weird things ...
We 're looking at some legal issues up there and we 're not ready to concede that one until we understand how it's ...
[ RUSSERT INTERRUPTS TO DISCUSS TUESDAY'S RACE IN VIRGINIA ...]
As of 2:15 pm PT today ( Sunday ) , the Washington GOP website lists only percentages , not vote tallies , which is therefore not quite as demonstrative of how close the race really is at this hour , with even current third place finisher Paul coming up just behind Huckabee ...
CNN 's graphic is a bit more helpful ...
We 're not clear on the precise rules for the state 's GOP caucus , but if they 're anything like the Democratic Caucuses also held there yesterday , caucus goers show up and fill out a form , in person , with their name and address , stating who it is they are supporting .
The Democrats tally up the votes then and there in front of everyone and then call the results in to the county party , which , in turn , reports them up to the state party .
Given that the number of caucus goers on the Democratic side --- where counting was 96 % reported by today --- seems to have exceeded Republican turnout by approximately 17 % ( almost 5,000 votes ) , it 's quite odd that the GOP counting seems to have simply stopped at 87.2 % .
On that note , the differences in turnout yesterday on the " D " and " R " sides may also be illustrative of what 's going on in the country , if Washington , which had previously been nearly evenly divided --- the state 's hotly contested 2004 gubernatorial race was ultimately decided by just over 100 votes --- is any indication .
With 96 % of the returns reporting , according to CNN , some 32,000 caucus goers on the Democratic side gave Obama a clear 68 % to 31 % victory over Clinton in the Evergreen State .
Obama also reportedly won handily yesterday in Primaries held in both Nebraska and Louisiana , though , as we reported last night , his campaign had " submitted an urgent request for assistance to the Secretary of State " after " widespread reports from Democrats across Louisiana who reported that they were not allowed to vote because their party affiliation had been switched . "
A campaign statement posted to his website just after 7 pm ET last night declared that " Hundreds of Louisiana democrats went to the polls to vote in today ’s presidential primary , and found that they were now on registration lists as Independent or Unaffiliated voters . "
On the Republican side in Louisiana , with 100 % of the precincts reporting , according to the state 's website , the margin separating first place Huckabee from second place finisher McCain is even closer than the Washington State contest , at least according to percentages .
Huckabee is shown with 43 % to McCain 's 42 % , with just 2056 votes separating them .
We 've yet to hear reports of registration problems with Republican voters in yesterday 's Primary .
But the day is young .
And in the recent Republican Caucus in the state , held at the end of January , allegations of registration irregularities emerged , leading to a challenge of the results by the Paul campaign who alleged that " due to mistakes by the Louisiana GOP , hundreds of voters were forced to file provisional ballots , including nearly 500 that could change the outcome of the election . "
Attempts to reach both the Louisiana Sec. of State 's office , as well as the state Republican Party , for additional comment , were unsuccessful this afternoon .
As to the result numbers from yesterday 's primary , as reported by the state of Louisiana , while McCain might be wise to contest such a narrow margin , they are derived from unverifiable Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE ) push - button voting machines ( similar to touch - screens ) as made by Sequoia Voting Systems , which has had similar machines decertified in state after state .
There is absolutely no way to verify that a single vote cast on any of them was recorded as the voter intended .
So the election results in that state , even in a race as close as the one on the Republican side was , are 100 % faith - based .
Sorry , John .
You 'll just have to take your slim loss on faith , since there 's nothing to recount .
ARE YOU FRICKIN ' KIDDING ME ?
UPDATE 9:49 pm PT : Apparently , the head of WA state 's Republican party just decided to stop counting votes from the GOP Caucus last night when he'd had enough and figured he could decide on his own who the winner would be .
No need to waste more time and actually count the rest of the votes .
According to the Seattle Times ' David Postman , state GOP Chair Luke Esser just made the call on his own , and claims today that he " would have done the exact same thing if Governor Huckabee had the same lead , and the same number of votes were outstanding . "
...
“ Maybe it would have been safer if I had n't said anything .
But it was an exciting and historic day for the state and I thought if I was confident about what the outcome would be I should share that with the people who had gone out to their caucuses . ”
Esser said he declared McCain the winner after calculating what Huckabee would have to win in the remaining precincts in order to take the lead .
And even with being generous with a forecast of Huckabee votes , and purposefully assuming McCain 's support dropped significantly in the late counts , McCain still looked like the winner ....
Seriously , that 's what he said .
TPM's Josh Marshall adds these thoughts , along with a " Late Update " :
So it was just such a rollicking good time Esser figured he owed the participants a decision as long as he was confident what the outcome would be .
I 'm really not sure I 've ever heard anything that ridiculous .
...
I still find it pretty hard to imagine these bozos would try something quite this brazen .
And it may well be an electoral tempest in a teapot .
But this one looks and quacks like a duck .
So someone should give it a much closer look .
...
Late Update :
It seems that Washington State GOP chair Luke Esser spent most of the day avoiding calls from the Huckabee campaign .
And when he finally got back to them he told a lawyer for Huckabee 's campaign that they 'd probably count the rest of the votes some time next week .
When the lawyer , Lauren Huckabee , the candidate 's daughter - in - law , requested that a Huckabee lawyer be present when the remaining votes were counted , Esser hung up on her .
Before the hang up , Huckabee also asked Esser about the DIY statistical analysis he did to conclude that he should call the race ( Esser 's expertise in statistics apparently stems from previous work as a state prosecutor and a sports writer ) .
Was there an analysis of what precincts the remaining votes came from ?
According to Huck campaign manager Ed Rollins , Esser admitted that he did n't [ know ] which precincts the remaining votes came from .
Mind you this is the state that Republicans still point to when they wish to make the case about Democrats committing " voter fraud . "
They reference the state 's razor thin 2004 Gubernatorial election where no fraud was ever found in the court case filed by the GOP up there , in no small part , because the GOP neither ever actually alleged fraud in their case , nor offered evidence for any ... yet the phony folklore lives on .
As usual , the facts and the GOP 's own behavior , as demonstrated by the state party 's own outrageous behavior , tells the real story here .
UPDATE 2/11/08 8:55 am PT : 93.3 % of the votes now counted in the WA GOP Caucus , according to the WA GOP website which shows only a slight increase in Huck 's percentage , though they still list no actual vote counts .
Just percentages .
CNN still shows the same 87 % precincts reporting ( with vote counts ) that they did as of late Saturday night , with no update since then .
No idea who , if anyone , was there during the GOP 's additional counting .
Will try to find out ...
UPDATE 2/11/08 12:07 pm PT : Wow !
Get a load of this : Esser the Suppressor !
UPDATE 2/11/08 7:14 pm PT : Seattle 's NBC affiliate reports " inconsistencies " in votes as reported by Snohomish County .
ALSO : Esser the Suppressor 's ties to McCain 's state campaign chairman .
Details now here ...

A young mother has missed out on a life - saving bone marrow transplant because her health deteriorated while bureaucrats argued over who should fund the operation , it has emerged .
Samantha Cousins , 34 , who suffers from Hodgkin 's lymphoma , was initially denied the £ 100,000 operation because of the ' postcode lottery . '
Scroll down for more ...
Only after six months of wrangling did health bosses in Wrexham , north Wales , where she lives , finally agree to pay for her treatment - even though she would have been automatically eligible if she lived just eight miles over the border in England .
But the delay , it has emerged , has left Miss Cousins , who has two young sons , aged eight and 11 , facing an uncertain future .
Today she revealed that she was forced to undergo more sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and limit the spread of her cancer while she waited for officials to give the go ahead for the surgery .
But the treatment has damaged her kidneys and last week doctors delivered the news that the former care worker is now no longer well enough to undergo the transplant .
" I 'm devastated , " Miss Cousins said .
" I should have had the transplant in March or April , but because of the hassle and all the waiting I 've had to have more treatment and that 's ended up damaging my kidneys .
" Now the doctors have said I 'll have to carry on having radiotherapy .
They 're giving me a rest over Christmas to be with the family and then I will have radiotherapy again in January and we 'll have to see how the kidneys get on ,
" I 've just got to wait and see if they clear on their own .
I 've worked all my life and paid my taxes , but when I needed the NHS the most they abandoned me .
" The doctors have said that I can't go on having chemotherapy to treat the cancer , I will die if I do n't get a bone marrow transplant .
It was all down to money .
It is so upsetting that a bureaucrat can decide whether people live or die . "
Miss Cousins , who lives with her partner , Simon Jones , 41 , a fireman , first fell ill in July 2005 when she discovered two lumps under her right arm and neck .
After a series of tests doctors said she was suffering from Hodgkin 's lymphoma - a blood cancer which is prevalent in younger people .
She underwent two gruelling sessions of chemotherapy , before being referred to Christie 's Hospital - the specialist cancer centre in Manchester - for a stem - cell transplant , followed by radiotherapy .
Initially , doctors believed the stem - cell transplant had been successful , but shortly before Christmas last year Miss Cousins discovered another lump close to her chin .
Once again , doctors decided to give Miss Cousins chemotherapy and , although it appeared to be helping her fight the disease , decided a bone marrow transplant was her only hope of a cure .
Her consultant wrote to the Health Commission in Wales ( HCW ) requesting they fund the expensive operation , but was staggered when they refused to pay for her life - saving treatment .
They claimed that , following an evaluation of Miss Cousins ' case , she did not meet their criteria for a transplant .
They said that only in ' exceptional circumstances ' were transplants offered to Hodgkin 's lymphoma patients but refused to elaborate on exactly what those criteria or exceptional circumstances were .
Only when Welsh health minister Edwina Hart intervened and requested an urgent review of Miss Cousins ' case did the HCW finally agree to overturn the decision in September .
Last night Mr Jones , 41 , said he was furious with the HCW for the delay which could cost his partner her life .
" You could n't print what I think , " he said .
" I would just like the guys at Health Commission Wales to have the bottle to come and talk to me .
" There 's no way we can prove it but we 're convinced the delay has put us in this position . "
Last night a spokesman for the HCW said he could not comment on Miss Cousins ' case .
However , he added : " HCW has an individual commissioning patient panel where clinical advice in complex cases is considered .
Exceptional circumstances have to be defined in relation to the individual patient and the treatment required . "
From HaskellWiki
Obviously , do n't run code in the IO monad , just show pure results ( or possibly make your own monad that is a restricted subset of IO ) .
But it 's a lot more complicated than that ...
Verifying safety : lambdabot 's approach
Since 2004 , lambdabot has executed arbitrary strings of Haskell provided by user's of various IRC channels , in particular , the Haskell channel .
In order to do this , a particular security policy is required .
The policy , and its implementation , is described here .
The policy
Only allow execution of pure Haskell expressions .
The implementation
Note :
This section refers to the old Lambdabot evaluator ; as of 2009 , lambdabot calls out to mueval , which while it uses many of the same techniques , is structured differently .
The evaluator is essentially a function , eval :: String ->
IO String , which takes a random Haskell string , verifies it , compiles it , and evaluates the result , returning a String representing the result , back over the network .
This function is implemented as two separate processes :
The driver reads a String from the network , and then subjects it to a simple test :
The expression is parsed as a Haskell 98 expression , hopefully preventing code injection ( is this true ?
and can any string that can parse as a valid Haskell expression become something more sinister when put in a particular context ? )
If the string parses as a Haskell 98 expression , the ' runplugs ' process is then forked to evaluate the string , and the following checks are put in place :
Only a trusted module set is imported , avoiding unsafePerformIO and unsafeIOtoST and such like .
Module imports are disallowed
Time and space limitations on the runplugs process are set by the OS ' rlimit ' facility
The expression type checked , enforcing lack of memory errors
Because the user code is not at the beginning of the file , malicious {-# LANGUAGE #-} and {-# OPTIONS #-} flags are ignored
Only - fextended - default - rules are allowed , as language extensions over H98 .
The resulting .o file is dynamically linked only into the throw - away runplugs instance
Even if all went well , the first 2048 characters of the shown string are returned to the caller ( no infinite output DoS )
A few other niceties are provided :
The expression is bound to a random identifier ( harmless to guess ) , in order to allow nice line error messages with line pragmas .
The expression is wrapped in ' show ' .
A catch - all instance of Show in terms of Typable is provided , to display non-displayable objects in a more useful way ( e.g. putStrLn --> <[ Char ] -> IO ( ) >)
It is compiled to native code with - fasm for speed ( compilation time is neglible compared to IRC lag )
The value is evaluated inside an exception handler ; if an exception is thrown , the first 1024 characters of the exception string are returned .
Exploits
A variety of interesting exploits have been found , or thought of , over the years .
Those we remember are listed below :
using newtype recursion to have the inliner not terminate
using pathological type inference cases to have the type checker not terminate
code injection of code fragments that are n't Haskell expressions
Template Haskell used to run IO actions during type checking
stToIO to convert a safe ST action , into an IO action that is run
large strings returned in exceptions
unsafePerformIO , of course
unsafeCoerce #
throwing a piece of code as an exception , which is evaluated when the exception is shown
non-terminating code , in a tight loop that does n't allocate , ca n't use GHC 's threadDelay / scheduler ( let f ( ) = f ( ) in f ( ) ) to timeout ( must use OS resource limits ) .
large array allocations can fill memory
very large array allocations can integer overflow the storage manager , allowing arbitrary memory access ( this appears to be fixed in GHC 6.8.x )
creating class instances that violate assumed laws ( cf EvilIx )
various literal strings that print IRC protocol commands could be printed using exceptions .
if a user guesses the top level identifier the expression is bound to , it can be used to print a silly string
zombies could be created by multiple runplugs calls , leading to blocking on endless output .
the resulting zombies accumulate , eventually leading to DOS .
( if wait ForProcess was broken )
Template Haskell
We believe that Template Haskell can be made safe for users by hiding runIO and reify .

The people of Nanjing paused to remember those killed
Survivors attended the reopening of a memorial hall , built to remember an act that has come to symbolise imperial Japanese aggression in China .
Japanese soldiers carried out the killings in a six - week period after Nanjing was captured in December 1937 .
Beijing says 300,000 Chinese civilians were killed , but some Japanese historians dispute this figure .
In the city , air sirens were sounded as people paused in silence to remember the victims .
The memorial hall which details the violence has been reopened after two years of renovations .
Its purpose is " to better preserve history ... to never forget the past ... to treasure peace and open the way to the future " , Xu Zhonglin , a provincial Communist Party chief , told the French news agency AFP .
Alongside the officials and thousands of residents attending the ceremony were a number of survivors .
Twenty - five - year - old Xia
Lu came with her grandmother , who lived through the massacre .
" Her father was killed by Japanese in 1937 and then her mother had no ability to raise her children , so she sent her children to other families , " she told the BBC .
One elderly woman described how she had been five years old when a Japanese soldier gouged out her eyes with a bayonet .
The BBC's Michael Bristow , in Nanjing , says the anniversary is more than a commemoration of past events , and remains fresh in the minds of many .
He says that is partly because many Chinese people see history as a guide to the future - but also because of continuing research into the atrocities .
A new monument has just been unveiled to mark a previously unknown incident during the massacre in which 1,300 Chinese people died .
That story came to light only because a Japanese researcher persuaded former soldiers to tell their stories .
Japan plea
In Japan , the anniversary of the assault on Nanjing is not being commemorated officially .
Japan was not officially marking the anniversary
Holding a photograph of his father , who was killed in the violence , Mr Chen told Reuters : " We hope that the Japanese government , especially those in the nationalist factions , will admit the truth in history and learn from the Germans .
" They should not cover up their crimes anymore . "
Japanese prime ministers have apologised for the country 's former militarism , but , according to the BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo , there are fringe elements in Japan who get a lot of publicity for their repeated denials that Japan committed atrocities during its military campaigns in Asia .
Some even deny that the events in Nanjing ever took place and , our correspondent says , this frustrates mainstream historians who try to give a more balanced view of what happened during the assault on the city .
Younger Japanese are frustrated , too , that their country is criticised still for events that took place more than half a century ago , he adds .
Many know little about what went on in Nanjing and care even less .
Those who know my work of 6 years in the forefront of the 9/11 truth movement , know my focus is action that exposes ever larger segments of the public on the need for a new 9/11 investigation .
I do NOT spend time attacking other activists , but applauding the ones breaking truth OUT to the public .
Many of you will know I 've invested countless hours applauding YOU and YOUR EFFORTS , and urging others to support YOU and YOUR EFFORTS .
HOWEVER , I feel compelled to address the issue of movement infiltration , and how we can all avoid being manipulated by it .
It is really much simpler than you might think .
Those hired to create chaos in a movement will always make things seem complicated .
But , in the simplest terms the 9/11 truth movement is a collective of people who want a new 9/11 investigation .
PERIOD .
Anything more than that is beyond the point , although they 'll try to tear us apart with fine points .
This article is written to illuminate the patterns , so we can end them .
We are too near truth breaking out to remain unconscious of the machinations of movement infiltrators .
Libby was sentenced to two - and - a - half years in jail
Libby was convicted for perjury and obstruction of justice in a probe into the leaking of the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame .
A former chief of staff to Vice - President Dick Cheney , Libby was the only person charged in the case .
US President George W Bush commuted Libby 's 30 - month prison term earlier this year .
Libby was still ordered to serve two years of probation and pay a $ 250,000 ( £ 123,000 ) fine .
Tactical
" We remain firmly convinced of Mr Libby 's innocence , " the former aide 's lawyer Theodore Wells said .
" However , the realities were that after five years of government service by Mr Libby and several years of defending against this case , the burden on Mr Libby and his young family of continuing to pursue his complete vindication are too great to ask them to bear . "
WHAT IS CIA LEAK CASE ABOUT ?
Libby was found guilty of lying to the FBI and a grand jury over revelations about CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity Critics said the White House leaked Ms Plame 's identity to undermine her husband , ex-ambassador Joseph Wilson
He had publicly cast doubt on the Bush administration 's case for war in Iraq
The alleged cover - up , rather than the leak itself , was the subject of the Libby trial
Q&A : CIA leak case
The decision to drop the appeal is also a tactical one , correspondents say .
Even if a federal appeals court overturned Libby 's conviction , that would lead to another long and costly trial .
If he was convicted again , Mr Bush 's commutation would not apply and the president is likely to have left office .
Mr Bush has not ruled out a full pardon for Libby .
No -one was charged with the leaking of Ms Plame 's identity .
Ms Plame alleges that the leak was politically motivated .
Her husband had criticised the Bush administration 's decision to go to war in Iraq .
Santa 's Got Nothing on These Guys Memphis is the new North Pole : inside FedEx 's record - breaking night .
MEMPHIS , Tenn. , Dec. 17 , 2007  --
You think Santa has a hard job delivering millions of packages on a single night ?
Well , he only does it once a year .
FedEx does it every day .
FedEx is constantly moving packages around the world .
At any given moment a container of fresh fish from Japan might be heading to a sushi restaurant in New York while a crate of car parts from Detroit travels to a mechanic in Houston .
Getting millions of packages from point A to point B — and having them arrive on time — is a mammoth challenge on the quietest of days .
But no day compares to today , when those items are moving across the planet in addition to all of your Christmas gifts .
It is expected to be the busiest shipping day in FedEx 's history .
Consider this :
It takes 669 airplanes , 75,000 trucks and 280,000 workers to move an astonishing 11.3 million pieces of cargo .
And if any of it is late , there will be some very upset children Christmas morning .
Click here for tips for shipping your gifts .
Memphis , Tenn. , is the home of Elvis , the blues and the keystone of FedEx 's global network .
From the moment you arrive , you know this place is different .
Signs at the airport point passengers to gates and baggage claim , but also announce : " Memphis — America 's Distribution Center . "
An ad in the terminal 's hallways reminds you that more cargo goes through this airport than any other airport in the world .
A package sent from Miami to Seattle or Houston to Denver will most likely go through here .
Each night hundreds of airplanes land in Memphis , and roughly 9 million pounds of cargo is unloaded , sorted and then put back on the planes and sent out around the world .
At peak times , one plane is landing or taking off every 30 seconds .
The volume of packages makes it one of the most complicated logistical operations in the world .
The Memphis hub covers the space of about 370 football fields and has more than 300 miles of conveyor belts .
Touring the massive facility , it 's easy to get dizzy .
Something is always moving , whether it be an airplane , baggage cart or the packages .
Everything happens with incredible speed .
A package traveling from the West Coast to East Coast will spend just 90 minutes on the ground in Memphis .
Personalized Weather Forecasts
Tucked away in a nondescript office park near the Memphis airport is a building that looks like just about any other in corporate America .
But inside is a complex network of computers constantly tracking and communicating with each airplane in the massive FedEx fleet .
" There is not a minute of any day where there is not a FedEx jet in the sky somewhere , " said Paul Tronsor , managing director of the FedEx Global Operation Control Center .
" Whether it be Des Moines , Iowa , or Dubai , [ United Arab Emirates ] we know exactly where that airplane is and what its route of flight is and when it 's supposed to get to its destination . "
Projected on video wall — think of NASA 's Mission Control — is a map of the world showing the current whereabouts of every plane , the detailed flight and maintenance schedule of each jet for the next six days and a look at developing weather problems .
In this room , last - minute decisions are made to divert a plane from one airport to another because of fog , snow or any other reason .
FedEx employs 15 full - time meteorologists who constantly monitor thunderstorms , blizzards , hurricanes and typhoons around the world .
The weather forecasts most people are familiar with target a large area , typically a city and all its suburbs .
FedEx wants something different : a forecast pinpointed to within five miles of its airports , said Melvin W. Bradley , manager of weather services .
The only thing that matters to FedEx is whether or not it can land at the airport when it needs to .
Bradley and his staff work to predict exactly what time rain will turn to snow or sleet , a key piece of information needed to know when scheduling a flight .
Bradley said he can't just predict sleet " later this evening . "
" That 's not good enough , " he said .
" We have to be as precise as we can be . "
Preparing for the Unexpected
Each night 's game plan changes by the minute .
If a video game supplier shows up moments before the shipping deadline with 10 times its normal shipment , somehow FedEx has to accommodate the extra cargo .
And that means the shipper has to be ready for just about anything .
Each night a half dozen planes are sent up into the sky almost completely empty .
These " overlift flights " zig and zag a strange route across a region , ready to touch down at a moment 's notice and pick up extra cargo that would not fit in the regular flight .
One such flight leaves Duluth , Minn. , each night and then flies out of its way — over Chicago , Detroit , Indianapolis and St. Louis — before landing in Memphis .
Having an airborne plane prepared to easily divert to another city saves FedEx precious minutes and allows for unexpected shipments to arrive on time .
" We fly it like a big Z , " Tronsor said of the path of the overlift flights .
" At FedEx , minutes matter to us . "
Largest Customer Will Surprise You
The lifeblood of FedEx 's operations is its 669 airplanes , which serve 375 airports around the world .
Simply based on the size of its fleet , FedEx is the second - largest airline in the United States , surpassed only by American Airlines .
Each night , flights from Paris , London and Sao Paulo , Brazil , land in Memphis .
The shortest flight — just 27 minutes in the air — comes from Nashville , Tenn. , 200 miles away .
The longest is from Tokyo , roughly 6,600 miles and 13 hours away .
Flights like the one from Tokyo require a second crew on board who sleep until it is their turn to fly .
By 10:30 p.m. each day , passenger flights at the Memphis airport cease and the airport essentially is turned over to FedEx .
During ideal conditions , FedEx can land 82 planes an hour , using three of the airport 's four runways .
But weather is a big factor .
One night last week a dense fog lowered that number to 56 planes an hour .
Each plane is parked around the massive sorting center building .
The giant cargo containers carrying packages are quickly unloaded and pulled over to the sorting facility , just like your luggage at the airport , only on a larger scale .
More than 8,000 workers then take over in a process called " the sort . "
Incoming packages are turned so their shipping labels are facing up .
Workers touch a package for less than a second to do this .
They do n't even have a moment to guess what is inside .
Scanners then read the bar codes and computers take over .
The boxes disappear into a maze of conveyer belts , pushed left or right and down various chutes , depending on their destination .
Human hands only intervene when there is a jam .
Within a few short minutes the packages arrive at the large airplane containers , where workers do a final sort , separating packages into various routes within a destination city .
The containers are then loaded back onto the planes .
By 4 a.m. , just about all the planes are back in the air , spreading around the world .
Similar operations are also going on in other FedEx locations — including Indianapolis ; Anchorage , Alaska ; Oakland , Calif . ; and Paris — but none come close to the size of the operation in Memphis .
On a night where Memphis gets 150 flights , Indianapolis will see only 50 .
The FedEx system deals with 6.5 million packages on an average day .
But today , with the added volume of Christmas gifts , it will handle 11.3 million .
It 's the busiest day in the company 's 36 - year history .
Driving some of this additional traffic are online purchases .
This holiday season , $ 42 billion in online retail sales are expected , up 18.5 percent from last year , according to consulting firm TNS Retail Forward .
But it 's not just gifts and supplies moving through FedEx 's network .
There is also plenty of regular mail .
For the last six years , the U.S. Postal Service has hired FedEx to move its express mail across the country .
Enough mail now moves though the system that the Postal Service is FedEx 's largest customer .
Missing Boxes ?
FedEx says it rarely loses a package .
" It 's pretty hard to lose something when it's all within your system , " said Mike Pigors , the FedEx senior vice president who oversees all the hubs in the United States .
But on the rare occasion that a package is found without a shipping label — FedEx blames poor packing — the Overgoods Department takes over .
The staff there will tear apart the box and do everything possible to find the owner , Pigors said , including looking at the content 's serial number and calling the manufacturer to see who bought the product .
That 's nice , but exactly how many packages are lost ?
Pigors would n't give a number .
His answer was just : " Not very often . "
On this Valentine ’s Day , give the gift people really want – complex key chords !
In other news , I ’ve got fans !
Well , at least one anyway .
A lot of the feedback I ’ve received on this site so far has been from experienced Lispers who appreciate my enthusiasm and contributions for new users .
Yesterday , I got the first ( I think ) comment and reply from another new Lisper who ’s actually getting some use out of my stuff .
Aaron
Feng wrote up my SLIME movie reference , and he even caught my later reference to my upcoming “ Ultimate N00b SLIME / Emacs Cheat Sheet ” .
Well Aaron , wait no more !
I ’ve been using it for a week or so , and I ’m sort of pleased with it .
First the positives :
It includes all of the SLIME commands from the SLIME manual
It includes all of the Emacs commands from the built in tutorial
It includes the main Emacs help keys
The commands are sorted and grouped by functional area
It ’s all fits on one page
Here are some of the things I ’m not so pleased with :
It has very few Emacs commands , relative to what ’s available
It does n’t include any advanced text manipulation options
It does n’t have the sexp - based manipulation commands .
I could n’t find standard bindings for these and I ’m not up to Emacs tweaking yet .
Adding a key for the slime - selector was enough for me at this point .
It ’s pretty crowded ( ~100 commands and descriptions on one page )
The Emacs section is weak mainly because I have n’t dived into Emacs the way I have into Lisp / SLIME .
I figure for now I can use it as a standard , powerful IDE for writing , testing , and debugging Lisp , and I can add Emacs wizardry later .
I think I hit the point of diminishing returns where focusing on my tools will help me learn to code in Lisp .
Now I need to get my coding up to par with my tools !
I need to improve to the point where it ’s worth getting a copy of Learning GNU Emacs .
So without further ado , here is my unfinished yet eminently usable cheat sheet :

As usual , feedback is appreciated .
If you ’ve got an Emacs trick that you use a jillion times a day that you think a new user could use , this is a great way to share !
( PS I hope it goes without saying but there is n’t any kind of beta process .
Just that I consider it a work in progress and that it will definitely change in the future , hopefully in response to useful criticism . )

WASHINGTON , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency figured it would lose a lawsuit filed by California if the agency turned down the state 's request to toughen vehicle emissions standards to fight global warming , according to documents released on Wednesday .
The suit the documents envisioned was filed on Jan. 2 , after the agency rejected a petition by California seeking a waiver from federal law to impose more stringent standards for greenhouse gas emissions from cars , light trucks and sport utility vehicles .
Fifteen other states were poised to follow California 's lead , if the waiver had been approved .
In EPA briefing documents released by the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , the agency listed the likely impact of granting or denying a waiver .
The documents accurately predicted what would happen next if the EPA rejected the waiver :
The agency would face an " almost certain lawsuit by California . "
The EPA also said it was " likely to lose ( the ) suit . "
The federal appeals court in San Francisco has yet to issue a ruling .
If the EPA had granted the waiver , the documents said the agency would likely face a legal challenge from automakers .
But the agency calculated it would almost certainly " win such a suit . "
The documents concluded that granting the waiver would " likely allow ( California ) standards to go into effect " and that this would be " generally consistent " with federal rules on greenhouse gases .
AUTO FIRMS
Auto companies , especially struggling U.S. - based manufacturers , fiercely opposed the attempt by California to impose new emissions regulations , which would sharply increase mileage requirements for their vehicles in that state and any others that adopted the change .
Automakers and their allies in Congress believe the California standard would be too tough to meet .
The measure was included in a 2002 state law that would force automakers beginning next year to cut tailpipe emissions by 30 percent over eight years .
That translates into average fuel efficiency of more than 40 miles per gallon .
Industry , backed by the EPA , favors new federal fuel efficiency regulations that will require fleets to average 35 miles per gallon by 2020 -- a 40 percent increase over today 's level but less stringent than California 's plan .
The Senate committee released the documents the day before EPA chief Stephen Johnson was scheduled to testify about the decision .
The documents were obtained from committee staff , not the EPA , which earlier had offered heavily redacted versions , with large portions whited out .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who chairs the committee , was outraged : " This unbelievable brush - off by the EPA only makes me more determined to get to the truth . "
Johnson was given a wide array of information on which to base his decision and he stands by it , said agency spokesman Jonathan Shradar .
Shradar confirmed the documents released by the committee were those created by the EPA .
California has for years been permitted to set its own targets on pollutants and has gotten EPA waivers in other cases .
This is the first bid to limit carbon emissions from autos .

In your post How does one invest for inflation and deflation ?
you addressed investment themes for hyperinflation and deflation .
What about the middle ground ?
How about a scenario of mild , but higher than market - predicted inflation .... inflation rates of 5 % to 10 % per year .
That would be troublesome to retirees and others , and is far more probable than the much rarer , and more extreme , disastrous scenario of hyperinflation .
All I care about is the inflation of the prices of the goods and services I use .
This is much higher than the official rate of inflation , though it is certainly not hyperinflation .
How linked is the world economy to the U.S. consumer ?
Would global stocks still roll on , if the U.S. economy stagnated ?
Would commodity prices stagnate ?

Continuing onÂ its epic journey around the Sun , Ulysses has reached the Sun ’s north pole just in the nick of time .
In fact , its timing could n’t be better , just as the Sun begins “ Solar Cycle 24 ” .
The probe is in a unique orbit , passing over the solar north and south poles , out of the ecliptic plane of the solar system , giving it an unprecedented view of parts of the Sun we cannot observe on Earth .
“ Graveyards for sunspots ” and mysterious coronal holes lurk in these regions and Ulysses will be perfectly placed , directly above .
The joint NASA and ESAÂ Ulysses mission has been a resounding successÂ in its 18 years of operation since launch on board Space Shuttle Discovery ( STS - 41 ) in October 1990 .
The intrepid spacecraft was helped on it ’s way by a gravitational assist by the planet Jupiter which flung it over the poles of the Sun .
Quietly travelling in a perpendicular orbit ( space missions and the planets usually orbit around the Sun ’s equator ) , Ulysses has been measuring the distribution of solar wind particles emanating fromÂ latitudinal locations for one and a half orbits .
As Ulysses passes over the north polar region , the Sun will be observed during a period of minimum activity at this location for the first time .
The poles of the Sun are of particular interest to scientists as this is where the fast solar wind originates from open magnetic field lines reaching into space .
The dynamics of solar material in this location provides information on how the Sun interacts with interplanetary space and how the solar wind is generated .
Observing the solar wind at “ solar minimum ” will be of massive interest as it may provide some answers as to why the solar wind is accelerated hundreds of kilometers per hour even when activity is at its lowest .
“ Just as Earth ’s poles are crucial to studies of terrestrial climate change , the sun ’s poles may be crucial to studies of the solar cycle . ” – Ed Smith , Ulysses project scientist , NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The dynamics of low altitude magnetic fields in polar regions are also a focus for interest .
As 11 - year solar cycles progress , sunspot population increase near the solar equator .
As the magnetic field is “ wound up ” , sunspots ( and their associated magnetic flux ) drift toward the poles where they slowly disappear as the old magnetic field sinks back into the Sun , quite accurately described as sunspot graveyards .
Understanding how this cycle works will help to reveal the secrets of the solar cycle and ultimately help us understand the mechanisms behind Space Weather .

1. Maria Ozawa – French - Canadian Bikini BabeMaria Ozawa !
We ’re a sucker for hapas , and Maria Ozawa aka Miyabi has the perfect mix to get our blood boiling .
Born January 9 , 1986 in Hokkaido , Japan , Ozawa is half - Japanese and half French - Canadian , giving her an exotic look that ’s made her a huge success in Japan .
Vivid colors , flowing silk ribbons , and glittering bits of mirrors - the Vikings dressed with considerably more panache than we previously thought .
The men were especially vain , and the women dressed provocatively , but with the advent of Christianity , fashions changed , according to Swedish archeologist Annika Larsson .
" They combined oriental features with Nordic styles .
Their clothing was designed to be shown off indoors around the fire , " says textile researcher Annika Larsson , whose research at Uppsala University presents a new picture of the Viking Age .
She has studied textile finds from the Lake MÃ¤laren Valley , the area that includes Stockholm and Uppsala and was one of the central regions in Scandinavia during the Viking Age .
The findings , some of which were presented in her dissertation last year , show that what we call the Viking Age , the years from 750 - 1050 A.D. , was not a uniform period .
Through changes in the style of clothing we can see that medieval Christian fashions hit Sweden as early as the late 900s and that new trade routes came into use then as well .
The oriental features in clothing disappeared when Christianity came and they started to trade with the Christian Byzantine and Western Europe .
" Textile research can tell us more about the state of society than research into traditions .
Old rituals can live on long after society has changed , but when trade routes are cut off , there 's an immediate impact on clothing fashions , " says Annika Larsson .
She maintains that Swedish Viking women in the pre-Christian period probably dressed much more provocatively than we previously believed .
She bases her theory on a new find uncovered in Russian Pskov , close to Novgorod and the eastward trade routes then plied from Sweden .
The find consists of extensive remnants of a woman 's attire , which Annika Larsson claims does not square with the traditional picture of how Viking women dressed .
Previously it was thought that Viking women wore a long suspender ( brace ) skirt , with both the front and back pieces consisting of square sections , held together by a belt .
Clasps , often regarded as typical of the Viking Age , were attached to the suspenders roughly at the collar bone .
Under this dress they wore a linen shift , and on top of it a woolen shawl or sweater .
" The grave plans from excavations at Birka outside Stockholm in the 19th century show that this is incorrect .
The clasps were probably worn in the middle of each breast .
Traditionally this has been explained by the clasps having fallen down as the corpse rotted .
That sounds like a prudish interpretation , " says Annika Larsson .
She maintains instead that the Birka women 's skirts consisted of a single piece of fabric and were open in front .
The suspenders held up the train and functioned as a harness that was fastened to the breasts with the clasps .
Annika Larsson 's theory is strengthened by that fact that a number of female figures have been preserved whose outfits both have trains and are open in front .
But if we are to believe the archeological finds , this style of clothing disappeared with the advent of Christianity .
" It 's easy to imagine that the Christian church had certain reservations about clothing that accentuated the breasts in this way and , what 's more , exposed the under shift in front .
It 's also possible that this clothing was associated with pre-Christian rituals and was therefore forbidden , " she believes .

At the beginning of last year , I mentioned a prediction made by Pat Robertson :
As reported by Americans United , Pat Robertson has joined in the fun , predicting “ mass killings ” to occur on American soil due to a terrorist attack sometime this year .
( Robertson said he expected this to come in the form of a nuclear attack , but emphasized that this was only his educated guess – as opposed to the rest of this prophecy , which was clearly straight from God ’s mouth and not at all just made up . )
The video of this prediction can be viewed here .
The prophecy in question comes around the two - minute mark , where Robertson forecasts “ very serious terrorist attacks ” against America , resulting in “ mass killings … possibly [ of ] millions of people ” , and “ major cities injured ” .
By now , I think we can safely assume that this is another prophetic failure .
The only question is , was Pat Robertson making up prophecies on his own initiative and attributing them to God , or was it God himself who blew it ?
In either case , Robertson does not have a good track record as a fortuneteller .
This latest embarrassment joins a long string of failures chronicled by AU ( see also ) :
In 1980 , Robertson predicted the start of World War III , telling his audience that God said the year would be full of “ sorrow and bloodshed that will have no end soon , for the world is being torn apart , and my kingdom shall rise from the ruins of it . ”
He also prophecied in the same year that the Soviet Union would invade the Middle East to seize its oil reserves .
In 1988 , Robertson claimed that God told him to run for president .
He did not win the Republican primary .
In his 1991 book The New World Order , Robertson forecast that U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller would be elected president in 1996 .
, Robertson forecast that U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller would be elected president in 1996 .
In 1998 , Robertson threatened that , as punishment for flying rainbow flags during Disney World ’s annual Gay Days event , the city of Orlando would be struck by “ earthquakes , tornadoes and possibly a meteor ” .
In 2004 , Robertson predicted that George W. Bush would win reelection in “ a blowout ” .
Although Bush was reelected , it was by 50.7 % to 48.3 % – the closest ever margin for a sitting president .
In January 2006 , Robertson forecast that the U.S. midterm elections would leave the Republican party in control of Congress .
He also predicted that the Iraq war would “ come to a successful conclusion ” that year and U.S. troops would begin withdrawing .
Robertson also predicted in 2006 that devastating storms and hurricanes would lash the U.S. coast .
He must have thought this a particularly safe guess , but in fact no hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. in that year .
Of course , Robertson has suffered no fallout from these repeated failures .
Like most religious phonies , he can count on his followers never doing any follow - up work .
He can make whatever absurd guesses he likes , and his devoted true believers will oblige him by forgetting about all the ones that fail to pan out .
( Or , like many other failed apocalyptic prophets , he can claim that the disaster was going to occur but was averted just in time by the prayers of his followers – a time - tested excuse hinted at in the video . )
The usual pattern is , if any prophecies do come true , for the prophet to endlessly remind his followers of that fact and counting on their being awed and amazed .
However , I ’m not aware of any major predictions made by Robertson that turned out successful .

' Piracy ' is Often Fair Use , Study Says
When homemade videos appear on YouTube bearing snippets of copyrighted works , is it piracy or fair use ?
Much of what gets tagged as the former is actually the latter , suggests a new study from the Center for Social Media at American University 's School of Communication .
The study , Recut , Reframe , Recycle , says that new forms of creative satire , commentary and other homegrown videos are being inhibited by industry - imposed filtering standards and legal threats that fail to fully consider the boundaries of fair use .
Fair use may be far more relevant than has previously been assumed in discussion of user - generated content , even though the community of online video makers is sprawling and protean .
In some cases , these creators use copyrighted material in ways that have long been seen in filmmaking as fair use -- for media critique , for example , or when copyrighted material is incorporated into a moment being documented for another purpose , or for short illustration .
In other cases -- in mashups , among others -- video makers may quote extensively .
Even extensive uses may well be legal and within fair use under certain circumstances , if analyzed within context .
What is needed , the study concludes , is a blue - ribbon panel of scholars , makers and lawyers to develop a code of best practices around fair use in online video , both to educate new makers and to provide guidance for public and private regulators .
Today ’s makers -- feckless , impudent , brash , and extravagant as they often are -- in fact are the pioneers of an emerging media economy and society .
Recognition of the importance of fair use , within the copyright law toolkit for cultural creation , is both prudent and forward - looking for those concerned with maintaining an open society .

US Court shuts down leaked doc emporium
by Nick Juliano
Wikileaks , the Web site that has revealed countless government secrets , has been forced offline by a California judge .
The site , which allows whistleblowers to post documents anonymously , is being sued by a Swiss banking group implicated in money laundering in documents obtained by Wikileaks .
The BBC reports :
However , the main site was taken offline after the court ordered that Dynadot , which controls the site ’s domain name , should remove all traces of wikileaks from its servers .
The court also ordered that Dynadot should “ prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page , until further order of this Court . ”
Other orders included that the domain name be locked “ to prevent transfer of the domain name to a different domain registrar ” to prevent changes being made to the site .
Versions of Wikileaks from Great Britain and other countries are still accessible .
In taking Wikileaks offline , the US joins China and Thailand in censoring the watchdog site .
In its report on the injunction , Wikileaks compares the case to the New York Times being ordered not to publish the Pentagon Papers .

This model circle almost led to a major political and mathematical embarrassment for the Indiana legislature . *
Image : Henning Makholm * 1897 : Egged on by an amateur mathematician , the Indiana General Assembly almost passes a bill adopting 3.2 as the exact value of pi ( or π ) .
Only the intervention of a Purdue University mathematician who happens to be visiting the legislature prevents the bill from becoming law , saving the most acute political embarrassment .
What became known as the Indiana pi bill was sponsored by Rep. T.I. Record at the behest of Edwin J. Goodwin , a physician and math dilettante who claimed to have figured out how to square circles .
House Bill 246 , proposed as " an act introducing a new mathematical truth , " went through three reads before being passed unanimously by the House , presumably to avoid having to endure a fourth .
Although it comes down to us as the " pi bill , " pi itself is never mentioned in Record 's bill , which was , in fact , intended to confirm Goodwin 's formula for squaring the circle .
The value 3.2 for pi was a prerequisite for making that formula plausible .
House 246 was sent on to the state Senate and was on the verge of passage when everyone 's bacon was serendipitously saved by C.A. Waldo , a Purdue mathematics professor who happened to be in the Statehouse on another matter .
Shown the bill and offered an introduction to the genius whose theory it was , Waldo declined , saying he already knew enough crazy people .
Waldo stuck around long enough to educate the senators , and the bill eventually went away .
Incidentally , pi is an irrational number – its value can be worked out in infinitesimal detail , never ending and never repeating – but calculated down to 50 decimal places it is 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 .
Squaring the circle remains a mathematical impossibility .

Credit card companies are in business for one reason – to make money .
Sure , they will tell you they offer you a chance to enjoy life now , or have an emergency line of credit , but rest assured – the thing they are more concerned about is whether or not you make your minimum payment on time .
Do n’t get me wrong , I have nothing against credit cards , and I think there are many reasons to use credit cards .
In fact , many people actually make money by using rewards credit cards .
But for a credit card company to pay me that money , it has to come from somewhere .
That money comes from the killer fees they charge .
Credit card companies are always creating new and innovative methods of extracting fees from their customers .
I have n’t seen raw numbers , but I would venture to say credit card companies make the majority of their money from miscellaneous fees , penalties , and other charges they assess their customers .
I ’m sure the credit card companies do n’t want to make these numbers readily available if they are not already .
How to Avoid Credit Card Fees
Application and Annual Fees :
You want me to pay you for the honor of applying for your card , then you want me to pay you an annual fee for the privilege of using said card ?
No thanks !
Not when I can use a rewards card and have the credit card company pay me !
Avoid these fees by only applying for cards without annual fees or application fees , or ask for the fee to be waived .
Sky High Interest Rates :
There is no federal law to limit interest rate charges ; those laws are covered at the state level .
In fact , many credit card companies incorporate in Delaware or other states that have a high interest rate ceiling or none at all .
This allows them to charge such high rates !
Avoid these fees by paying your bill in full every month or opening a 0 % interest credit card .
Double - Cycle Billing : Some credit card companies have found a way to charge more interest to their customers and force them to pay interest for debt they have already paid !
Double - cycle billing , also called two - cycle billing , charges interest for the average daily balance for two cycles : the current cycle , and the previous cycle .
With this practice , credit card companies can charge their customers for debt they have already paid .
Avoid these outrageous fees by paying your bill in full every month and shopping for a card provider who does n’t charge these fees .
No one should have to pay interest twice .
Universal Default Interest Rate Ladder : The Universal Default Interest Rate Ladder raises your interest rates to a ‘ default ’ level when there is the perception that lending money to you takes on a higher amount of risk for the credit card companies .
Credit card companies regularly screen their current customers ’ credit reports for universal default triggers which may include exceeding your credit limit on another card , a single late payment any debt , a decline in your credit score , a high debt utilization ratio , adding additional lines of credit such as a home mortgage or auto loan , or even applying for more credit , whether it is approved or not !
The universal default rate can cause your interest rates and payments to skyrocket !
The worst part is , you wo n’t even know it was applied until you get your next bill .
Avoid these fees by paying all your bills on time , maintaining a good debt utilization ratio , and not exceeding your credit limits .
Late Fees : According to Consumer Action , a California consumer group , late fees averaged $ 28 per month in 2006 .
The highest was $ 39 .
That is a lot of money to add to a credit card bill – especially because the person receiving it likely can’t afford it in the first place .
Also , pay attention to your due date .
Credit card companies have been known to change them without notifying their cardholders , resulting in late fees and higher interest rates .
Avoid these fees by paying your monthly bill on time .
Cash Advance Fees :
You know those little checks your credit card company sends you in the mail every month ?
They are n’t the same as swiping your card .
You have to pay a 1 - 3 % fee each time you use these checks , and pay the interest if you do n’t pay them off in full !
You can also get a cash advance at an ATM machine .
Avoid these fees by not using the checks or a cash advance from an ATM .
Shred the checks as soon as they arrive , or better yet , have the credit card company stop sending them to you !
Balance Transfer Fees : Sometimes you can transfer your existing credit card debt to a card with a lower APR such as a 0 % balance transfer offer .
This can save you a lot of money in interest payments , but it may cost you 1 - 3 % of the balance transfer or more .
Some companies cap the charge , and others have a minimum charge .
Avoid these fees by asking them to waive the fees , or using a card that does n’t charge balance transfer fees .
Over the Limit Fees : Oops !
You went over your limit !
That ’s too bad , because not only did that cost you about $ 20 - 40 dollars in over the limit fees , but it may have triggered the universal default interest rate ladder – which may affect the interest rates you pay on other credit cards .
Avoid these fees by keeping track of your credit limits and utilization and do n’t exceed your balance .
Rate Jacking : Apparently , some credit card companies add some small print to the agreement you sign that gives them the ability to raise rates , “ just because . ”
They sometimes give you the option to opt out , but this requires action on your part .
Avoid credit card fees
Most of these fees can be avoided by paying your balance in full every month .
If your are working your way out of debt , then the best way to handle these killer credit card fees is to read and understand the fine print in your cardholder agreement and act accordingly .
If there is something in the agreement you do n’t like or understand , do n’t apply for the card .
If you already have the card , you have to be diligent to make sure your actions do n’t cause these extra fees or penalties .
You can also try contacting your credit card company to try and have some fees reduced or the terms of your contract changed .
This may work once or twice , but I would n’t rely on this as a long term solution .
Rule by fear or rule by law ?
“ The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law , and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers , is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist . ”
– Winston Churchill , Nov. 21 , 1943
Lewis Seiler , Dan Hamburg
Since 9/11 , and seemingly without the notice of most Americans , the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law , arrest a wide swath of dissidents ( citizen and noncitizen alike ) , and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of “ an emergency influx of immigrants in the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . ”
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees .
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott , the KBR contract is part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of “ all removable aliens ” and “ potential terrorists . ”
Fraud - busters such as Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , have complained about these contracts , saying that more taxpayer dollars should not go to taxpayer - gouging Halliburton .
But the real question is :
What kind of “ new programs ” require the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the union with the capacity to house perhaps millions of people ?
Sect. 1042 of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , “ Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies , ” gives the executive the power to invoke martial law .
For the first time in more than a century , the president is now authorized to use the military in response to “ a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , a terrorist attack or any other condition in which the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order . ”
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , rammed through Congress just before the 2006 midterm elections , allows for the indefinite imprisonment of anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on a list of “ terrorist ” organizations , or who speaks out against the government ’s policies .
The law calls for secret trials for citizens and noncitizens alike .
Also in 2007 , the White House quietly issued National Security Presidential Directive 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , to ensure “ continuity of government ” in the event of what the document vaguely calls a “ catastrophic emergency . ”
Should the president determine that such an emergency has occurred , he and he alone is empowered to do whatever he deems necessary to ensure “ continuity of government . ”
This could include everything from canceling elections to suspending the Constitution to launching a nuclear attack .
Congress has yet to hold a single hearing on NSPD - 51 .
U.S. Rep. Jane Harman , D - Venice ( Los Angeles County ) has come up with a new way to expand the domestic “ war on terror . ”
Her Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( HR1955 ) , which passed the House by the lopsided vote of 404 - 6 , would set up a commission to “ examine and report upon the facts and causes ” of so - called violent radicalism and extremist ideology , then make legislative recommendations on combatting it .
According to commentary in the Baltimore Sun , Rep. Harman and her colleagues from both sides of the aisle believe the country faces a native brand of terrorism , and needs a commission with sweeping investigative power to combat it .
A clue as to where Harman ’s commission might be aiming is the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , a law that labels those who “ engage in sit-ins , civil disobedience , trespass , or any other crime in the name of animal rights ” as terrorists .
Other groups in the crosshairs could be anti-abortion protesters , anti-tax agitators , immigration activists , environmentalists , peace demonstrators , Second Amendment rights supporters … the list goes on and on .
According to author Naomi Wolf , the National Counterterrorism Center holds the names of roughly 775,000 “ terror suspects ” with the number increasing by 20,000 per month .
What could the government be contemplating that leads it to make contingency plans to detain without recourse millions of its own citizens ?
The Constitution does not allow the executive to have unchecked power under any circumstances .
The people must not allow the president to use the war on terrorism to rule by fear instead of by law .
Lewis Seiler is the president of Voice of the Environment , Inc. Dan Hamburg , a former congressman , is executive director .
The Administration Must Rewrite The Rules
To Restrict Private Security Contractors
Assessment Needed To Examine Blackwater ’s Failures WASHINGTON - September 18 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , released the following statement after news reports today detail that Iraq ’s Interior Ministry revoked the license of Blackwater USA .
The American security firm was blamed for a Sunday gun battle in Baghdad that left eight civilians dead .
“ The Administration needs to be called before Congress to see if Blackwater ’s failures are provoking more conflict in Iraq , ” Kucinich said .
“ We should n’t have mercenaries in Iraq or any other war zone .
Not only should the State Department launch a full and complete investigation into this incident , but Congress should also hold Blackwater accountable .
“ Congress needs to examine whether the United States should even use security contractors in war zones .
A thorough and comprehensive examination is needed to know the true implications of American security firms in Iraq . ”

Constructing Artificial Emotions : A Design Experiment
Bacchus : The Orgiastic Ritual Game
By Daniel Cook
Bacchus is a multiplayer dancing game with a religious theme .
The selling point is its ability to evoke intense emotions .
Imagine if you will , a decrepit theater filled with writhing , dancing people .
The lights flare and swoop in time and the people chant in unison .
A massive screen shows a mirror image of the hall like some surrealistic portal into an alternate universe .
Instead of blokes and lasses in street clothes , the onscreen spirits are clad in ornate ritualistic garb .
The movements on each side of screen are eerily synchronized .

Bacchus : The Gedankenexperiment
The game Bacchus is a thought experiment , not a real game .
It exists merely to explore , in one design , several effective , yet rarely - used techniques for inducing emotion through gameplay .
It happens to have a religious theme , but I ’m primarily interested in exploring how designed experiences can yield intense player emotions .
The game designer ’s palette of emotion has traditionally been limited to boredom , frustration , and triumphant mastery .
There is very little published research on how to evoke a broader range of emotions and designers have very few practical or theoretical tools at their disposal in the quest to create meaningful , emotional experiences for their players .
Designers interested in evoking emotion fall back on :
Stealing techniques from non -game media .
“ And then we show a movie of the faithful heroine being stabbed by the evil villain ! ” Copious handwaving .
“ See , this pink pulsating blob represents ‘ Feelings ’ ” , explains the designer to the confused player .
The resulting experiences are far more emotionally simplistic than we might dream of creating .
To expand beyond the present constraints , I set forth a personal challenge .
What if you wanted to create a game that pushes the player through a sequence of emotions , from joy to sorrow , to perhaps even religious ecstasy ?
What current or future techniques would you use ?
Is it even possible for a game to evoke a rich palette of emotions ?
In order to build a game that induces such a complex emotional spectrum , we need to dig into the fundamentals of evoking emotions in games .
It turns out that many folks in the scientific community have been studying tangentially related problems for quite some time .

The Two Factor Theory of Emotion
Let ’s begin with some basic cognitive science .
The framework I ’ll be leaning on throughout our investigation of artificial emotions is a well - known cognitive theory called the Two Factor Theory of Emotion , by psychologists Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer .
The theory states that in order for an emotion to be felt , two factors must be present :
Physiological change :
The person feels elevated heart rate , sweaty skin and other elements of physiological arousal .
The person feels elevated heart rate , sweaty skin and other elements of physiological arousal .
Cognitive label of the physiological change : Based off the context of the situation , the person assigns a label to the physiological change .
Simply put , when your body reacts physically to some stimuli and you mind assigns meaning to your physical state , you synthesize an emotional response .
An intriguing experiment
The Two Factor Theory of Emotion is certainly mildly intriguing as an analytic description of how emotion works , but it has a far more practical application in the realm of game design .
In the process of proving their theories on emotion , researchers spent much of their effort on figuring out how to dissect the component aspects of emotion and reassemble them into new emotions of their choice .
In effect , they figured out how to reconstitute artificial emotions within their subjects .
Their experiments provide us with practical examples of how we might build our own systems of generating artificial emotion in our players .
It turns out that the physiological changes that accompany many emotions , such as fear and lust , are remarkably the same .
There is a wide range of stimuli , including loud noises , intense memories or even a fear of heights that activate the sympathetic nervous system , prepping the body for action in the face of stress .
Your heart rate elevates .
Your palms become sweaty .
Your alertness increases and body hair stands on end .
Different stimuli , same response .
Due to the ambiguity of the physical response you rely on your brain to determine what all this activity actually means .
Should your run , should you fight , should you laugh ?
In a heartbeat , you brain need to figure out what is happening and synthesize the correct response .
In this moment , your carefully calibrated gray matter can be tricked .
One of the colorful experiments that demonstrate this effect was performed by psychologists Dutton and Aron in 1974 .
They wanted to see if they could alter the context of a situation so that the subject would instead experience lust instead of fear .
In their study , a highly attractive young woman approached a sample of young men and asked them to fill out a survey .
The experiment had two components .
Inducing the appropriate physiological response :
Two survey situations where tested .
The first was a safe location on a trail .
The second was the midpoint of a very narrow bridge overlooking a deep crevasse .
The researchers knew that merely standing on the bridge elevated the heart rate and caused anxiety .
Standing on the path induced no anxiety .

The first was a safe location on a trail .
The second was the midpoint of a very narrow bridge overlooking a deep crevasse .
The researchers knew that merely standing on the bridge elevated the heart rate and caused anxiety .
Standing on the path induced no anxiety .
Setting the desired cognitive label :
At the end of the survey , the woman passed each young man her phone number and encouraged them to give her a call if they had any further questions .
Almost twice as many men ( 60 % ) gave the girl a call if they had been surveyed on the dangerous bridge than on the safe path .
Due to the strong contextual signals in the form of presence of the attractive woman , the men misinterpreted the fear - driven activation of their sympathetic nervous system as authentic lust .
A potion for emotion
Other experiments validated the theory by inducing both happiness and anger in their subjects .
These studies suggest the following general recipe for concocting artificial emotions .
Inducing the appropriate physiological response :
Put the player ’s bodies in the appropriate physical state associated with the desired emotion through any means necessary .
Put the player ’s bodies in the appropriate physical state associated with the desired emotion through any means necessary .
Setting the desired cognitive label : Provide strong contextual clues that make the user misinterpret the physical sensation as the designed emotion .
By evoking both states in the player , the mental and the physical , designers can greatly increase the likelihood that players will experience the desired emotional response to a game .
With our theory in hand , let ’s look at the set of practical techniques that help us generate the artificial emotions at the heart of Bacchus .
Technique 1 : Active recall of emotional memories
“ Each word she utters shimmers on screen , merging with ghostly photos from her past .
In a beat , the entire room witnesses her sorrow over the death of her mother , her time alone in an empty apartment , and her first kiss . ”
In Bacchus , the player recalls intensely personal emotional moments as part of a public confession .
It turns out that this is a great technique for evoking a both a physiological response and a set of cognitive labels .
Theory :
When you experience an intense emotion , a primitive portion of the brain called the amygdala kicks in and ensures that you store a vivid , emotionally charged memory .
When you recall the memory , your brain also ensures that you remember the emotional element .
Remembering an emotional event causes that you to re-experience that associated emotion .
The recollection of an emotional memory triggers the recall of the emotions associated with the event .
This in turn activates the physical reactions associated with that memory .
You understand what the physical reactions mean in context of the memory and the labels you have assigned to the emotions within .
You experience that emotion .
For example , when war veterans recall a traumatic experience , they often experience elevated heart rate , perspiration and other signs of panic .
The memory of the veteran ’s traumatic event triggers a replica of the physiological response that occurred during the event .
The emotional panic they feel is very real , very physical and easily measured .
Other extreme examples of this phenomenon include many phobias such as fear of small spaces , flying , etc. , all of which are typically rooted in some traumatic experience .
The basic system of recording and recalling emotional memories that underlie these reactions is present in every single one of us .
In normal circumstances , the recall of emotional memories is a healthy and helpful aspect of basic human cognition .
Storing emotions in good and bad times and then recalling them instantaneously if a similar situation occurs is a great evolutionary benefit .
When you see the mountain lion the second time around , your body is instantly primed for flight .
You do n’t have to think or analyze the situation .
You simply feel the correct course of action .
The upside of all those millions of years of evolution for game developers ?
Your players have spent their lives collecting a deep pool of strong emotional memories that is just waiting for you to tap into with the appropriate game design .
Technology : In Bacchus , the confession is a game mechanic that encourages the players to tap into their emotional memories .
Confessions are effective because the player self - selects memories with strongest , most pertinent emotional content and voluntarily shares them .
For most people , this has the effect of turning on an emotional fire hose .
In order to make the recall as intense as possible , we want to augment the verbal recall with a few simple technologies .
Human memory is stored like a sparse set of data points in a connected network .
When a person remembers , they pull on related data points to flesh out the memory .
You can increase recall by feeding the user related data points , thus lighting up more bits of their memory and increasing the clarity of the final result .
The classic example is a group of people remembering an event .
A single person might remember a few key elements and have a fuzzy memory of the event .
However , when a group of people gets together , each one contributes a small piece of additional information that helps light up a highly detailed map of the memory .
Technology can serve a similar role .
Voice recognition : Publicly stating the confession allows voice recognition software to turn phrases into something the computer can understand .
Publicly stating the confession allows voice recognition software to turn phrases into something the computer can understand .
A database of tagged photos :
In the next twenty or thirty years , it is easy to imagine that many younger people will have lived a highly documented life .
An individual will be associated with a massive archive of thousands of photos , videos and electronic messages that track almost any important aspect of their emotional and social life .
: In the next twenty or thirty years , it is easy to imagine that many younger people will have lived a highly documented life .
An individual will be associated with a massive archive of thousands of photos , videos and electronic messages that track almost any important aspect of their emotional and social life .
A free form association algorithm :
Once we have a list of what the person is saying , we can start pulling up pictures that reference people , places and key times .
When the player views these pertinent images , additional neural pathways are triggered that ideally enhance and clarify the recall of the memory associated with the confession .
The result of this particular system is the intense recall of very personal memories .
With intense recall comes the highly desirable stronger physiological reaction .
Benefits :
The main benefits of using the recall of personal emotions is that you are almost always going to get a solid emotional response , especially in newer players .
You are digging up the raw materials of their most personal emotions and the results can be explosive .
Limitations :
The downsides of using emotional memories to generate physiological responses are substantial .
Responses tend to be context - specific :
The subject activates numerous cognitive labels in the process of activating the memories .
When you are feeling sad about the death of your first dog , it can be hard to transfer those feelings to another topic .
This can cloud any authorial intent on the part of the game designer when they try to introduce their own labels into the game .

This can cloud any authorial intent on the part of the game designer when they try to introduce their own labels into the game .
They become less powerful upon repeated recall :
If emotional memories are recalled in safe environments , they start losing their emotional power .
The brain learns that maybe it is n’t worth getting all worked up about a false alarm .
Many therapists use this fact to decondition those with phobias , but it becomes problematic for repeat players who are actively seeking the jolt that comes from recall .

Risk of trauma :
Some people have severe psychological issues that are exacerbated by free form recall .
Games that make people cry are n’t always healthy for the players that have serious issues to cry about .
Technique 2 : Evoking emotional memories with relevant stimuli
“ [ T ] he onscreen spirits are clad in ornate ritualistic garb …
The room takes up her words and amplifies them , giving them god - like resonance .
Bass mixed with reverb mixed with primal , guttural passion .
An inhumanly beautiful electronic chorus rises , matches and turns her words into a song .
Her movements become a blur .
Her glowing eyes are ecstatic .
At the peak , her spirit on the large screen explodes in light … ”
In Bacchus , the player is surrounded by rich , evocative visuals and symbols .
These also play an important role in priming the player to feel emotion .
This technique builds upon some of the elements of emotional memories , but uses relevant stimuli instead of the blunt trauma of actual recall .
We broadly evoke the player ’s existing experiences with religion .
Theory :
Once upon a time , I had a workmate that had an irrational fear of house plants .
When she was a child , an aunt played tag with her in a greenhouse .
At some point , the game stopped being a game .
The girl desperately wanted the aunt to stop , but the aunt assumed the girl was still playing .
The intensely emotional memory of being hunted , terrified , and surrounded by clinging , suffocating plants was seared into my workmate ’s memory .
This is in keeping with our discussion of emotional memories .
What I found fascinating is that recalling the specific event was not the only trigger for her phobia .
Instead , stimuli peripherally connected with the memory , such as particular shades of green , a swaying vine , or a delivery of flowers with a bit too much leafy foliage on Valentine ’s Day could set off a panic attack .
Emotional memories need not be triggered by recalling the exact event that embedded them .
Instead , rich contextually coherent descriptions of similar situations can trigger those same pathways , though perhaps to a lesser degree .
You may feel joy when you remember your first kiss with that shy girl from next door .
But you may also feel joy if you hear the story of someone much like you who kisses the shy young princess .
Enough nodes in your memory are triggered for you to react to the related story .
There is a rather broad cognitive theory of media at play here .
In short :
The contents of media , be they sounds , images , physical or social situations inevitably intersect with rich existing palette of emotional memory found within almost any human being .
In order to process new stimuli , we tap into our memories and experiences relevant to the new experience .
The nodes associated with intense emotional memories given priority during the act of recall since these are likely to contain the most relevant information to survival .
An image of a hammer is more likely to generate the recall of that time you drove a nail through your thumb than the thousand previous nails you pounded successfully .
The result is a real emotional response to the stimuli , even though we may not be able to consciously make the connection with the original memory .
It can be a strange concept to wrap your head around .
When you read a romantic book , your response is as much due to your past experience with romance as it is to the contents of the book .
It is very likely that another person , one who has led an unnaturally lonely life , might read the same book and not be moved at all .
As a traditional author , your goal is to describe experiences that are relevant or highly correlated with experiences that your audience might possess .
This is one very powerful technique for creating meaningful , emotional impactful media .
This is n’t anything new .
Much of what game artists and writers do involves the creation of relevant stimuli ..
All those detailed graphics , booming sound effects and cliched story lines ?
That ’s relevant stimuli , baby .
Technology : According to our little theory and building up on the lessons of emotional memories , you can predict the characteristics of highly effective relevant stimuli :
Detailed :
The more detailed you can be , the more likely you ’ll light up a rich network of nodes .
: The more detailed you can be , the more likely you ’ll light up a rich network of nodes .
Personal :
The more you can get someone to empathize with an experience , the more likely they ’ll link it to their own personal memories .
Bacchus does n’t rely on plot or well - rendered NPCs for its relevant stimuli .
Instead it focuses on making the fantastical ‘ spiritual ’ experiences in the game personally relevant and highly detailed .
The detail comes in the form of traditional imagery and sound effects that references common culturally relevant spiritual symbols .
The ornate costumes worn by the player avatars are intentionally laden with various religious icons , glowing colors , angel wings , etc .
The choral sounds are intended to recall childhood experiences with church choirs or even pop culture representations of spirituality found in movies or on TV .
Movies and books are typically limited to piling on the detail and hoping that it strikes a chord .
Games have the opportunity to make all these details much more personal and relevant to the moment at hand .
The primary technique you see in Bacchus is known as " avatar mapping " , where the player 's actions are mapped onto an in - game character .
It stops being about watching a costumed religions icon and much more about interacting and participating on a personal level with a religious situation .
Capturing movement data :
In the next twenty years it should be feasible to build high dynamic range digital cameras that take crisp 20 megapixel shots at high framerates .
Add in range - finding technology , a beefy processor and some multi-person image processing software and you have a system capable of tracking the subtle movements of an entire crowd in real time .
Simple versions of this are already happening with the hardware like the EyeToy or Nintendo Wii-mote .

Mapping movements onto an avatar :
All that detailed movement information can be mapped onto a 3D model in real - time .
This technology exists today and will only get better .
Check out the video below and extrapolate the fidelity that will be possible a decade or two into the future .
Fix8 example
Voice mapping : Just as your visuals can be altered , so can your voice .
When a hundred people yell out the same phrase in a crowded room full of pumping noise , the computer isolates a single voice .
That single voice is converted to text , timing , inflections , emphasis and volume information .
It is broken down its components and reconstituted .
If an old man wishes to sound like a young boy , a middle aged woman , or a monster ripped from the studios of Hollywood , all it takes is the flip of digital switch .
You talk and someone else instantly says your words .
All this is a crapshoot .
If I ’m lucky , I ’ll actually trigger the recall of an actual spiritual experience .
Benefits :
The use of related stimuli is the gold standard for inducing artificial emotions across practically every media known to man .
Great novels , paintings , movies , and poems rely on their intense portrayals a human experience that is not our own , but close enough to tap into our personal experiences .
As a creator , this is technique is quite cost effective and most of us have been trained in its application .
You can craft a single static experience that is broadly applicable to your audience .
You do n’t have to worry about customizing your message .
They ’ll expend the effort to find meaning .
.
You do n’t have to worry about customizing your message .
They ’ll expend the effort to find meaning .
You can rely on your personal experience for inspiration .
This is n’t because you are special .
Instead , it is because whatever you come up with will likely be close enough to what someone else has experienced .
Humans are limited in what they can experience .
If you describe how you are feeling when you are sad or happy , you are likely also describing how others are feeling when they experience those same emotions .
This greatly reduces the need for detailed customer feedback , an expensive activity .

You can be sloppy .
Relevant stimuli is like using a shotgun .
Whatever you make is likely to be meaningful to someone in the audience .
A wide range of modern art and music plays on this loophole by showering people with ambiguous messages .
A small percentage ‘ gets it ’ and that is enough to pay the bills .

A small percentage ‘ gets it ’ and that is enough to pay the bills .
Setting up cognitive labels .
If all else fails , relevant stimuli can still at least set up the appropriate context for interpreting the experience .
Even if the player does n’t tap into existing spiritual experiences , they at least understand from the overload of religious symbols that they participated in some sort of religiously - themed activity .
Limitations : Relevant stimuli is amazingly powerful , but has some limitations when it comes to use in games .
High burnout .
After a very short period of exposure , players start ignoring relevant stimuli .
Techniques like avatar mapping and other user - generated content strategies can keep content fresher , but replacing consumed content is still a costly issue to consider .

Limited interactivity .
Traditional forms of relevant stimuli do not change with the user ’s input .
Movies , narratives and images are all about evoking a response , but they have no ability to adapt once the player responds .

Unpredictable .
It is hard to guarantee that relevant stimuli will produce the desired emotional response .
Look at the case of Harry Potter .
Most saw the first book as a charming schoolboy romp and identified with its stimuli targeting their own feelings adventure , mystery and coming of age .
Others saw it as an obvious promotion of witchcraft and Satanism .
They reacted with anger and fear .
What your audience brings to the work has a huge impact on how it is interpreted .
Technique 3 : Biofeedback
" She begins to dance .
At first her movement is controlled and intricate .
The screen pulsates and she yells to its beat . "
Not all techniques at our disposal create both a physiological response and cognitive labels .
There are some that just do one or another .
Such techniques can be used as building blocks in a larger system .
One well - studied technique that affects that body is bio feedback .
This is particularly interesting to game developers since it is a fundamentally interactive technique and offers deep opportunities for mastery - focused gameplay .
: In the classical model of human behavior , there is the somatic nervous system which controls voluntary actions like moving your arm and the autonomic nervous system which attempts to maintain homeostasis by automatically adjusting such things as body temperature or heart rate .
A surprising number of automatically controlled systems can in fact be influenced consciously .
The most obvious one is breathing , as seen by pearl divers holding their breath .
Other systems can be controlled indirectly by consciously adjusting related systems .
For example by staying stationary , slowing your breathing and thinking calming thoughts , you can slow heart rate .
If only we could encourage the player to directly control their physiological state , they could
consciously put themselves in a state that was conducive to feeling the desired artificial emotions .
Unfortunately , people are generally quite poor at recognizing and attaining mastery over systems such as the autonomic nervous system that have poorly - visible second order effects that are only loosely connected to the original action .
Most people could n’t tell you their heart rate and even fewer could tell you how they could consciously speed it up or slow it down .
We see this problem of controlling second order effects pop up in games all the time .
Suppose you add a switch that unleashes an AI monster , that then steps on a switch that opens a door off screen .
The end result is that users complain that they have no idea why things are happening .
The chain of events between cause and effect is too long and confusing for the user to form a testable mental model of the system .
In order to teach the user how to control second order interactions , the game designer has to provide lots of clear , concise feedback and plentiful rewards for the right actions .
Biofeedback applies these game design principles to the task of influencing the autonomic nervous system .
Clear , concise feedback through biometrics .
Most people are not conscious of their pulse .
By instrumenting it with a simple heart rate monitor , we can turn an invisible outcome into a clearly visible outcome .
If the player jumps up and down , they see their heart rate increase .
Biometrics take a little of the mystery out of the player ’s physiological state .

Plentiful rewards .
Players will stumble upon the techniques that make the metrics change .
Once the player jumps up and down and their heart rate increases , you want to let loose the fireworks .
The player needs to know that whatever they just did is a good thing , even though it may not be obvious why it was a good thing .
At the heart of Bacchus are the biofeedback monitors that each player uses .
Heart rate monitor :
To reach certain sets of rewards in the game , the player needs to get their heart rate up .

Skin conductance :
You can measure skin conductance ( EDA or electrodermal activity ) to track a wide variety of emotional signals .
Patterns of electrodermal activity correspond to identifiable physical states .

Facial recognition :
When the player experiences certain emotions , the emotions tend to show on their face .
We can make use of our cameras to detect is people are smiling or grimacing as they play the game .
You can see the basics of this facial recognition technology already in action with a title like the one shown , Otona no DS Kao Training ( Grownup DS Face Training . )

Voice analysis :
A person ’s voice changes depending on the amount of stress they are feeling .
There is interesting research going on right now in detecting ‘ phone rage ’ and it is possible that this can also be extended to the detection of joy or sorrow .
Technology :
All of these are additional control mechanisms for the game that can be used to help facilitate the feeling of emotions .
Instead of pressing a button to advance the game , the player instead focuses on putting their body in a state that statistically correlates with happiness .
The game recognizes the hint of a smile , the increased heart rate , the increased pitch of the repeated phrases and the avatar on the screen responds with grand flourishes of sparkles and other visible indications of success .
We use biofeedback to create short , tight feedback loops that reward the activities we , as the designer , desire .
First - time players would simply be astonished that the game knows that they are feeling bored or irritable .
More advanced players know that the pulsing lights on the big screen are meters showing them key indicators of their physical state .
They use these as feedback that guide them towards reaching the appropriate state to enjoy the game .
Limitations :
There are several major limitations of biofeedback as a control mechanism
Secondary control mechanisms are difficult to learn :
Many users have difficulty finding a consistent set of behavior that reliably affects the biometrics .
It can be highly frustrating when the player ’s actions seem to yield random results .
: Many users have difficulty finding a consistent set of behavior that reliably affects the biometrics .
It can be highly frustrating when the player ’s actions seem to yield random results .
Secondary control mechanism are ‘ loose ’ :
Due to the long chain of events that occurs between the user ’s actions and the result , biometrics can be difficult to use in a reflex - based action game .
There are exceptions to the rule .
One recent study used biometrics to predict when a player would jump up to two seconds before they jumped .
It is fun to image a game design where the player simply anticipates jumping in order to move .

The instruments for gathering information can be unreliable : Devices based on skin conductance can be prone to noise due to movement , poor placement and bad contact with the skin .
The current rule of thumb is that the more subtle the information you gather , the less reliable your measurement devices .
The good news is that heart rate monitors are generally very reliable and much of the technology in the field is constantly being pushed forward by the behemoth medical industry .
Technique 4 : Setting social norms
“ Later , the girl writes to her online friends that the night she danced was the single most powerful spiritual and emotional experience in her entire life .
It was the night she was touched by a higher power while playing a video game . ”
Ultimately , the player attempts to understand the maelstrom of experiences that they ’ve undergone during a night of playing Bacchus .
The context of the event matters immensely .
Someone who sees Bacchus as just a game will have very different memories of the event than someone who goes into the evening expecting a holy experience .
In order for the designer to affect the critical step of synthesizing desired emotions , we need systems that ensure the player has access to the correct cognitive labels .
By influencing the language players use to comprehend an experience , you can control how they end up remembering the experiences .
One of the more powerful techniques for ensure people use the language you desire is taken from the propagandist / change agent ’s cookbook : the small group discussion .
Theory :
In the 1940s , Edward Schein , one of the founding fathers of organization psychology , was brought in to help the government market its rationing plans to the public .
In particular , they were interested in convincing people to eat ‘ sweetmeats ’ , the indescribable innards of animals that were typically tossed into the rubbish heap .
Schein conducted two experiments .
The first was a traditional lecture that described all the benefits of sweetmeats in terms of nutrition , patriotism , etc .
The audience listened attentively and then filled out a survey asking if they would change their consumption habits .
Only a small percentage agreed to try sweetmeats in order to help the war effort .
In the second experiment , the format changed .
Schein gathered together small groups of people and sat them down with a facilitator to discuss the option of eating sweetmeats .
The facilitator presented the topic and periodically interjected facts that might help the discussion or clarify misconceptions .
Most of the conversation , however involved people talking about their fears , their questions and the group weighing together the benefits of sweetmeats .
When this same group filled out the survey , the vast majority said that they would change their eating habits and start cooking with sweetmeats .
Schein ’s critical observation of this process is that that new groups go through a process in which they set group norms , expectations of social behavior and common beliefs .
In the second experiment there was ample time for the group to negotiate the new set of norms .
In the first , due to the one way communication , there was no opportunity , so the audience left with their existing beliefs intact .
This process of creating new social norms happens remarkably quickly and can result in people doing things at the end of the process that they would never have contemplated before the process begins .
We like to think that our behavior and beliefs are fixed , immovable and formed by great deliberation and moral character .
In reality , they are heavily influenced by the normative behavior of the group we participate in .
Given the right group circumstances , the behaviorial code of most individuals can be rewritten to an amazing degree .
You can witness this daily in most corporate environments , but more extreme examples are the tales of brainwashed prisoners of war or even the brutal behavior of U.S. troops when placed in an environment like Abu Ghraib .
Small group discussions can be used to seed a group with positive new concepts .
You can build up a vocabulary of new cognitive labels that are then triggered at a later point during gameplay .
Technology :
By creating controlled social environments , we can encourage and influence the norm - setting process .
Online games with their absolute control over social connections , language filtering and feedback mechanisms offer an ideal voluntary environment for norm resetting .
Concepts , terminology and even desired behavior can be seeded in a group by putting them together , present those new ideas and discussing them in a positive , constructive light .
Imagine that our Bacchus players have an online hangout .
They meet up after each bout of group dancing .
They discuss what they ’ve felt , discuss concerns and how they can improve .
A higher level character acts as a moderator and feeds the group more refined descriptions about what they have experienced .
It is , in many ways , no different than a Bible study group .
The setting provides an effective manner of setting up the context for the next encounter and seeding the players with language to describe the physical experience in emotional or spiritual terms .
Benefits :
If you look at the social trends in the United States , a growing percentage of the population prefers to live alone .
This naturally limits the amount of ambient socialization by that individual .
They have no spouse to share the events of the day with , nor do they know their neighbors .
Outside of the workplace , community and culture has less and less practical meaning to the modern man .
If these isolated individuals turn to online communities in order to fill out their social network , there is an enormous opportunity to create a new set of designer virtual norms that are rarely if ever challenged by outside forces .
The individuals that buy into the game will behave according to the standards of their dominant social group , fellow gamers dancing through life in an artificial , designer - manipulated culture .
Limitations :
One of the biggest limitations with using small group discussions is that norms set in the group tend to deteriorate outside of the context of a group .
You can see this phenomenon occur with the ubiquitous company offsite .
A team comes together in a new environment and agrees to change the world and their behavior .
As soon as they get back to the office , the hothouse atmosphere of the offsite dissipates and the regular rhythms and expectation of families , bosses and existing processes take hold again .
It takes repeated indoctrination , especially at a young age , to embed social norms deep enough that they can be relied upon to the produce the desired results .
Isolating the group from external normative forces is also highly effective .
There is a good reason why cultists pragmatically isolate their believers in walled - off compounds .
The other issue that comes up with setting up a new collection of social norms is that existing groups react defensively against those who step out of line .
Protection of group boundaries is an impressively powerful social force that must be tampered with using great care .
A title like Bacchus , with its overt religious theme and focus on resetting social norms , would likely raise at least an eyebrow or two .
The near future
The four techniques demonstrated in the Bacchus design will hopefully provide some food for thought .
The question that occurs to me is “ how realistic is any of this ? ”
Let ’s put aside the navel - gazing for a moment and look into the future with our crystal ball .
Technology : Some of the technologies I ’ve discussed are already beginning to make their way out onto the market .
We ’ve seen a couple of generations of video cameras built into consoles .
Voice recognition software is readily available to PC users .
The Wii and the Wii Fit balance board are continuing the trend towards more physical game play .
It is a natural evolution to add heart rate and skin conductance monitors .
As the years unfold , there is immense opportunity for hardware designers to differentiate their platforms by increasing the accuracy with which games can track the player ’s conscious and unconscious actions .
Game design :
Though the availability of the appropriate technology does not worry me much , the lack of proven , field - tested game design techniques for inducing emotion does .
Bacchus is a thought experiment and though it may stimulate discussion , I hold no illusions about its practicality as a blueprint for a working title .
For emotional game design to truly blossom , there are several obvious areas of investment .
Fundamental research into the biometric patterns that allow computers to distinguish various emotions .
Labs within game studios that allow designers to identify the flicker of emotions that run through their test subjects to a degree not offered by simple observation .
This data allows the game design to iterate on and perfect how the games affect the player ’s emotions , not just whether or not they made it through the latest boss battle .
Designers trained on group psychology and practical techniques for influencing and manipulating populations .
We are slowly starting to see some of this expertise emerge in the online game design community , but it has yet to become a major focus .
The techniques I ’ve mentioned in Bacchus are really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of possible design tools .
There is a wealth of research on using intense sounds or visuals , sleep and food deprivation and of course , various drugs to alter the player ’s physical state .
Every year , novel and effective biometric techniques continue to improve in accuracy , cost and usability in the field .
Setting appropriate cognitive labels is perhaps less well studied , but we can draw heavily upon the realms of advertising , propaganda and organizational psychology .
At first blush , the success of a game design like Bacchus seems bizarre and unlikely .
Yet , when I look out into the market and see the success of emotionally rich games as diverse as World of Warcraft , Spin the Bottle or Survivor , it seems that such games are inevitable .
Conclusion
Let ’s review what we ’ve covered so far .
Two factor theory of emotion .
Emotions are synthesized out of two parts , a physical state and a cognitive label .

Emotional memories .
Recalling personal memories can trigger both the physical and cognitive elements necessary to induce emotion .
In Bacchus , the confession mechanic makes use of this technique .

Setting social norms .
Creating isolated groups that build up socially acceptable interpretations of events can have strong influence on setting the appropriate cognitive labels for an experience .
Bacchus uses online social groups and discussions with planted moderators to create an atmosphere where players are encouraged to interpret their experience as a spiritual one .
Each of these techniques attempts to use applied psychology to evoke artificial emotions .
This is a fundamentally different tactic than you find used by most novelists , scriptwriters or musicians .
It is worth exploring further .
Instead of looking at emotion in media as a reflection of the artist ’s internal muse , we can treat the player ’s emotion as a system that we can model , interact with , and through the use of strong feedback systems , push toward desired states .
To simplify the situation immensely , most media , be it music , movies or books taps into emotion by rehashing pre-existing experiences .
Games , though they may fall back on rehashed experiences occasionally , are uniquely capable of creating new emotionally powerful experiences .
In a novel , you can read about someone falling in love .
In an MMOG , you can actually fall in love .
Real experiences generate vivid , new emotions .
Here is a thought .
When trying to create emotion in your players , tone down with the fixation on Hollywood , camera techniques and in - game narrative .
It is n’t our unique strength as a medium .
Instead , explore what would happen if we , as designers , actively attempted to create and manipulate the social , psychological and physical environments of our players in order to induce artificial emotions .
Toss the storyboards and scripts .
Game design becomes an exercise not so dissimilar from the movie The Truman Show .
You provide the carefully balanced system that sets up the appropriate physiological states and cognitive labels .
The players react with predictable , measurable human drama .
In this brave new world of emotional experiences , you design interactive systems that play the player like an instrument .
Except instead of tunes , they are belting out tears .
Take care ,
Danc .

The fascinating topic of Psychophysiology
What is the effect of certain cognitive stimuli on the human body ?
This is a topic fundamental to game design and happily for us , there is an existing body of work in the academic world .
As with most such areas , existing research is focused on medical issues as opposed to entertainment .
“ Psychophysiological measures are often used to study emotion and attention responses in response to stimuli .
Loud startle tones , emotionally charged pictures , videos , and tasks are presented and psychophysiological measures are used to examine responses ”
Techniques for measuring emotional arousal
“ [… ] there are several psychophysiological measures that may be used to capture player ’s emotional and attentional responses .
First , tonic and phasic HR can be used to index emotional arousal and attention , respectively .
Second , EDA is also a very sensitive index of emotional arousal .
Third , facial EMG measured from the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscle areas can be used to index positive and negative emotions , respectively ( i.e. , the valence of an emotional experience ) .
Finally , EEG can be used to measure both emotional valence and attention . ”
How the mere memory of electric shocks makes hearts race
“ In conditioning experiments performed by Joseph LeDoux at New York University ( 2 ) , rats were administered a mild electric shock in conjunction with an auditory tone .
The rats soon responded to the tone alone with a fearful response : increased blood pressure , faster breathing , and motionlessness . ”
Triggering increase salivation through detailed descriptions
Here is an example exercise that demonstrates how a detailed description can trigger a physical reaction due to relevant stimuli .
It is somewhat more controlled than your typical movie - goers experience , but the same principles apply .
Instruct another person to close their eyes and then read her the following passage .
Ask her to focus on visualizing each detail as clearly as possible .
Some subjects experience increased salivation and report being able to ‘ taste ’ the lemon .
Imagine a pure white plate with a lemon on it , resting on a table .
See the glossy yellow of the lemon ’s skin against the whiteness of the china plate .
Notice the texture of the lemon .
It looks clean and fresh .
There is a knife on the table , next to the plate .
Now imagine that you ’re picking up the knife .
You hold the lemon on the plate with one hand , and with the other , using the knife , you cut the lemon in two , hearing the knife cut through the lemon and hit the plate .
The citrus odor immediately hits your nose : sharp , clean , pungent , delicious , invigorating .
Now you pick up one of the lemon halves , with the juice still dripping onto your fingers and onto the plate .
Using the knife again , you cut a wedge from the lemon half , raise the wedge to your mouth , and touch your tongue against it gently .
Every taste bud in your tongue is drenched with the tangy lemon juice as your mouth puckers instinctively .
A shiver goes up and down your spine , and your shoulders shake .
Picture for a moment the lemon , the cutting , the tastes , the smells …
Whenever you are ready ; you can bring this image to a close .

ABU DHABI ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s largest energy consumer the United States on Monday called for a global push for increased energy efficiency to help meet rising demand and alleviate the impact of high prices on economic growth .

The U.S. consumes about 21 million barrels per day of oil , around a quarter of the world ’s supply .
Record oil prices have cooled U.S. appetite for gas guzzling cars and , along with increasing environmental concerns , leant weight to calls for more sparing use of energy .
The country last month passed a bill requiring increased fuel efficiency in vehicles for the first time in over 30 years .
“ We must promote increased energy efficiency , ” U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said in a speech to a green energy conference .
“ The biggest source of immediately available ‘ new ’ energy is the energy that we waste every day . ”
Energy efficiency measures “ will not only take some pressure off demand , but also improve the health of our shared environment , ” he said .
The challenge of meeting growing energy demand was global and required huge investment in both conventional and alternative energy sources in the developed and developing world alike , he said .
New technology needed to be rapidly deployed to diversify the global energy supplies .
“ The world needs safe , reliable , clean , affordable and diverse energy supplies - and in considerably greater numbers than it now has ... to do that we need a global response ... and , by that I mean all nations , including those that produce our world ’s oil supply . ”
Bodman earlier repeated his call for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to boost output at its February1 meeting .
To encourage investment in clean and efficient oil and gas production , Bodman called for an end to “ market interventions ” , without specifically mentioning OPEC .
“ It is time to stop doing the things that we know will not help , ” he said .
“ We know that purposeful market distortions - such as rationing supply , cutting production , or creating price floors and ceilings - do not work . ”
Bodman was on the third stop of a trip to the Middle East taking in Jordan , Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates , Qatar and Egypt .
LAS VEGAS  Parking was plentiful right by the door , there was no one to wrestle with for use of the slot machines , and Paris Hilton would not have been caught dead anywhere near this joint .
As casino openings go , this one was underwhelming , and intentionally so .
For eight hours on Tuesday , Station Casinos opened a nondescript 40 - by - 10 - foot trailer on a vacant 26 - acre plot about six miles east of the Strip with just 16 slot machines .
The sole purpose was to comply with a state law that requires public gambling to occur on a property for at least one shift every two years in order for the landowner to retain the valuable zoning designation needed to conduct wagering .
“ It just has to be open to the public , ” said Lori Nelson , a spokeswoman for Station Casinos , which owns 16 casinos in Nevada and one in California .
“ You do n’t need to promote it .
You do n’t need to really have people gamble here .
But you do need to have that option . ”
As of midday , nobody but reporters had turned out for the event , which had been publicized by only a few bloggers on the Internet .
The biggest payout on the bank of video poker and blackjack machines was $ 2.50 .
On Thursday , the FDA approved a test that doctors can use to quickly diagnose twelve different types of viral infection – including those which cause the common cold , pneumonia , and several varieties of flu .
With only a cotton swab from their patient 's nose or mouth , the new diagnostic panel will allow physicians to make better decisions about which medications will be effective .
Some drugs , such as Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) , only work on certain types of viruses .
" This speeds up the usual process of detecting and identifying respiratory viruses , which can take up to a week , " Daniel G. Schultz , director of FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health .
" And , because this multiplex viral panel tests for 12 viruses at once , it uses less of a patient 's test specimen . "
Based in Texas , Luminex Corporation has a long history of building instruments that can check for almost anything – bacteria , viruses , antibodies , disease genes .
The key to their technology : tiny beads .
The biotech company produces color - coded spheres that latch onto telltale biological molecules .
Each microscopic orb can only attach to molecules from one particular type of organism .
In this case , Luminex scientists made beads that can grab onto amplified genetic material from viruses .
A special scanner can read which beads have DNA stuck down to them – and thus identify the virus .
You can see a step - by - step explanation of how the new test works here : Link
From the Luminex Website :
With a non-invasive , painless swab , xTAG RVP tests for : Influenza A , influenza A - H1 , influenza A - H3 and influenza B , which cause the majority of flu cases in the U.S. ;
Adenovirus , which is responsible for approximately 10 percent of respiratory infections and a subtype of which the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) have recently identified as causing multiple deaths
Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) A and B , the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children
Metapneumovirus , a recently - discovered virus that causes flu - like symptoms and is thought to be the second leading cause of respiratory infection in children
Parainfluenza 1 , 2 , and 3 , which can cause upper or lower respiratory infections in adults and children and , are thought to be responsible for about half of croup cases and 10 - 15 percent of bronchiolitis and bronchitis cases ; and Rhinovirus , which causes the common cold .
...
It is the first multiplexed nucleic acid test for respiratory viruses cleared for in vitro diagnostic use by the FDA .
It also is the first test of any kind cleared to detect human metapneumovirus , the first test cleared for influenza A subtyping , and the first molecular test cleared for adenovirus .
When I spoke to Luminex CEO Patrick Balthrop at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry meeting in San Diego this spring , he said that their newest equipment can check for five hundred different chemical signatures at once .
At that meeting , and on other occasions , he has also indicated that personalized medicine will be a major thrust for his business .
In my book , the new test is a really big deal .
Here 's why : Last year , a New England Journal of Medicine study showed that when young children with the flu were brought in for a typical medical examination , their physician got the diagnosis wrong 83 percent of the time .
Although the new diagnostic tool is not a panacea , I see it as a sign of what is to come in medicine : a lot less guesswork .

AS they seek to document and demystify one of life ’s great thrills , scientists have run across some real head - scratchers .
How , for example , can they explain the fact that some men and women who are paralyzed and numb below the waist are able to have orgasms ?
How to explain the “ orgasmic auras ” that can descend at the onset of epileptic seizures -- sensations so pleasurable they prompt some patients to refuse antiseizure medication ?
And how on Earth to explain the case of the amputee who felt his orgasms centered in that missing foot ?

No one -- no sexologist , no neuroscientist -- really knows .
For a subject with so many armchair experts , the human orgasm is remarkably mysterious .
But today , a few scientists are making real progress -- in part because they ’re changing their focus .
To uncover the orgasm ’s secrets , researchers are looking beyond the clitoris , vagina , penis and prostate , to the place behind the scenes where the true magic happens .
They ’re examining the central nervous system : the network of electrical impulses that zip to and fro through the brain and spinal cord .
In an orgasm orchestra , the genitalia may be the instruments , but the central nervous system is the conductor .
Armed with new lab tools and fearless volunteers , scientists are getting first - ever glimpses of how the brain lights up ( and , in places , shuts down ) when the orgasmic fireworks go off .
They ’re tracing nerves and finding new pathways for pleasure that help explain how people with shattered spinal cords can defy sexual expectations .

A few labs are even tinkering with devices that could put patients directly in touch with their orgasmic abilities by letting them observe their sexual brain patterns and “ train ” themselves to find the elusive frisson , or ( in something akin to the Orgasmatron in Woody Allen ’s 1973 movie “ Sleeper ” ) letting them zap a sweet spot in their spinal cord with toe - curling electrical pulses .
“ There ’s a tremendous amount we do n’t know about orgasms , ” says Barry R. Komisaruk , psychology professor at Rutgers University and coauthor of the 2006 book “ The Science of Orgasm . ”
“ But we ’re on the verge of getting a lot of very important information and really understanding what to do with it . ”
It ’s not just the pleasure principle driving this research , says Julia R. Heiman , director of the Kinsey Institute , a nonprofit organization at Indiana University .
Sex is an important part of human relationships , she says , which in turn can affect psychological health .
“ An awful lot of illness , or treatments for illnesses , interfere with people ’s orgasms , ” she says , including multiple sclerosis , cancer , Parkinson ’s disease , depression and diabetes .
Indeed , if surveys are to be believed , this most delightful of experiences is elusive for many .
About 43 % of women and 31 % of men in the U.S. between ages 18 and 60 meet criteria for sexual dysfunctions , according to a 1999 report on the sexual behavior of more than 3,000 U.S. adults .

Orgasm researchers hope their efforts will help some of these people -- eventually .
For now , reports are more likely to include the words “ parasympathetic nervous system ” than “ try this at home tonight . ”
A difficult subject
It has never been easy to study any aspect of sexuality , let alone one so erotically center - stage as an orgasm .
“ Almost everybody is interested in orgasms , but it is also very difficult to start this kind of work , ” especially in the U.S. , says Dr. Gert Holstege , a neurologist at University of Groningen in the Netherlands .
“ The Victorian time is still not over . ”
So it ’s not surprising that some of the most impressive discoveries in the field of orgasm science were stumbled upon by accident .
For example , Viagra originally was a drug being tested for treatment of high blood pressure and heart disease .
Advertisement
Other touted aids lack formal proof .
No doubt most of the nostrums available from pharmacies or the Internet derive their power from the “ oh - please - please - make - this - work ” power of the placebo effect .
And though sexologists as far back as Alfred Kinsey have tallied people ’s orgasmic habits in exquisite detail , only now are researchers beginning to understand how it all works .
Orgasms are difficult to define , let alone reverse - engineer .
A few blueprints , however , have already been sketched out .
First , stimulating the genitals sends electrical impulses along three main paths -- the pelvic , hypogastric and pudendal nerves .
Next , these titillating signals enter the spinal cord at the base of the spine and zip up to brain regions that respond to genital sensations .
Then other parts of the brain leap into action .
Some send signals back down to the body with certain instructions -- lubricate the vagina , stiffen the penis , pump blood harder , breathe faster .
Advertisement
The intensity builds to a crescendo , and just like a long - awaited sneeze , tension is released in an explosive rush .
The heart rate doubles .
In women , the uterus contracts rhythmically ; in men , sperm - carrying semen is propelled out of the body .
And somehow , by mechanisms not yet understood , the brain perceives all this activity as a darn good feeling .
Such a signaling pathway would seem to rule out orgasms for anyone whose spinal cord is completely severed , because people with such injuries cannot feel the brush of a finger across the penis or clitoris .
But about two decades ago , anecdotal evidence started accumulating to the contrary .
This was as a bit of a surprise to the medical profession , which for decades had told patients with damaged spinal cords to give up hope of a sex life .
Researchers began to investigate .
Advertisement
One , Dr. Marca Sipski-Alexander , published studies in 2001 and 2006 reporting that about 50 % of 45 men and 44 % of 68 women -- all with varying locations and degrees of spinal cord injury -- had orgasms in the lab , with the help of adult videos and genital stimulation by hand or vibrator .
The findings show that the normal genitals - to - spine - to - brain route for an orgasm is not the only one .
The best explanation may be that a touch unperceived by the brain can still be doing its work , says Alexander , a rehabilitation medicine professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine .
Alexander thinks that an orgasm , like urination , is a reflex .
Both functions can be controlled partly by willpower .
But just as voiding your bladder does n’t require the say - so of your higher brain , she says , maybe orgasms do n’t either .
Maybe all that ’s needed is some chit - chat between pelvis and spinal cord .
Some studies , mostly in animals , support this line of thought .
In the brain stem and spinal cord , researchers have found hard - wired programs -- clusters of cells acting as primitive mini-brains of sorts -- that produce rhythmic movement without any higher brain input .
These so - called central pattern generators are what let mollusks swim , rats crawl , tadpoles breathe and perhaps human males thrust their pelvises and ejaculate .
Rat studies suggest that females , too , have these muscle - contracting proto - brains .

But orgasms are more than just muscular contractions .
They feel good .
So how do the brains of spinal - cord - injured people sense the pleasure ?
“ I do n’t know .
No one knows that yet , ” Alexander says .
An alternate route
Rutgers University ’s Komisaruk and retired Rutgers professor Beverly Whipple , coauthor of “ The Science of Orgasm ” and “ The G Spot and Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality , ” believe they do know .
But they do n’t think an orgasm is a reflex .
Through studies of spinal - cord - injured women , they ’ve found evidence of what appears to be a new orgasmic pathway , one that bypasses the spine completely .
The proposed detour makes use of a vast highway of nerves called the vagus nerve network .
Like the vagabonds for which they were named , vagus nerves wander throughout the body .
They start at the base of the brain , slide down the neck ( but not the spinal cord ) and stretch to all the major organs , and ( at least in female rats ) to the uterus and cervix .
If vagus nerves reach human pelvises , genital signals could hopscotch over the spinal cord and still reach the brain .
Advertisement
Animal experiments support the idea .
Female rats with intact vagus nerves but snipped genital nerves ( cutting off their signals to the spinal cord ) still respond to vaginal stimulation in their normal , albeit rodent - like , fashion : enlarged pupils , rapt attention and a tendency to ignore painful stimuli applied to their paws .
But when the vagus nerves in the pelvises are also severed , all these sexual responses stop .
To investigate further , in a 2004 study , Komisaruk and Whipple worked with four women with shattered spinal cords .
Each stimulated her cervix with a phallus while the researchers used fMRI scanning to measure brain activity .
Despite their severed spinal cords , all women reported feeling the touch of the stimulator , Whipple says .
The sensation at the cervix was reaching the brain .
What ’s more , in the fMRI scans their brains lighted up in an area where vagus nerve signals are processed .
And three of the volunteers experienced an orgasm .
Komisaruk and Whipple have compared these brain images with those of women who are able to have orgasms by thought alone ( who thus provide a clean brain image of a person reaching climax ) .
Advertisement
They found that orgasms elicit strong activity in the nucleus accumbens , the reward center , which also lights up in response to nicotine , chocolate , cocaine and music ; in the cerebellum , which helps coordinate muscle tension ; and parts of the hypothalamus , which releases oxytocin , the trust and social - bonding hormone .
Intriguingly , areas of the cortex that respond to pain also responded during orgasm .
“ Perhaps it ’s related to the fact that people often have pained expressions at the time of orgasm , ” Komisaruk says .
The amygdala , the brain ’s emotional center , and the hippocampus , which deals with memory , light up too .
This helps explain a medical mystery :
When epileptic seizures start in these areas , the electrical frenzy can triggers euphoric feelings called orgasmic auras .
Most patients find the experience displeasing .
But in one published case , a 51 - year - old woman said her auras were so pleasant she would n’t consider antiepileptic drugs or surgery .

Role of inactive regions
Holstege ’s group has also studied the sexually stimulated brain , and his findings suggest that orgasms are not just about how the brain lights up but also about where it shuts off .
In the late 1990s , his team recruited volunteers plus their sexual partners , who would stimulate them in the lab .
To measure brain activity , the researchers used PET scanners , which require obsessive attention to timing .
The stimulators were asked to induce an orgasm in their receivers within a two - minute window , with an eight - minute advance warning .

Results from men and women were fairly similar , says Janniko R. Georgiadis , a neuroscientist at the University of Groningen and a study coauthor .
There were several regions of activation , but the most striking result , Georgiadis says , was how certain regions in the front of the brain shut down during orgasm , especially one just behind the left eyeball .
Researchers have long noticed that damage to this area -- the lateral orbitofrontal cortex -- can leave people with wildly antisocial and impulsive tendencies , including hypersexuality .
Shutdowns in the brain ’s prefrontal cortex appears crucial , Georgiadis adds .
“ It ’s the seat of reason and behavioral control .
But when you have an orgasm , you lose control . ”
Regions called the temporal lobes also showed damped activity .
In fact , the less activity these regions showed , the more sexually aroused the women felt .
These deactivations might explain the appeal of autoerotic asphyxiation , the researchers say .
Depriving a brain of blood during sex not only provides a dangerous thrill but also shuts down key brain regions , leading to addictive orgasmic euphorias .
Unsticking the brain

Back in New Jersey , Komisaruk is trying to apply some of this new brain knowledge .
He is studying two extremes : women who complain of constant sexual arousal and find no relief in orgasms and those who can never have an orgasm .
He hopes to reveal where their brains are “ stuck ” and help them alter their brain patterns .
The setup is simple : Women lying in an MRI scanner watch a computer display of their brain activity .
Scans of women with persistent genital arousal disorder reveal unusually high activation in regions that respond to genital stimulation .
It shows , Komisaruk says , that the women ’s complaints are real .
Their brain thinks the genitals are constantly being stimulated .
Komisaruk is coaching them to use neuro - feedback -- mental strategies such as counting or imagery -- to alter their brain activity .
If they see those genital brain regions cooling seconds after their mental exercises , they can refine their techniques and eventually do it without the scanner , whenever these brain areas again slip into hyperdrive .
Fire rather than ice might be the trick for anorgasmic women , whom Komisaruk plans to study next .
For some women , clitoral stimulation might travel along the spinal cord but then is somehow blocked so they do n’t travel to the brain regions they need to .

“ We want to see if there ’s a blockage somewhere and if that blockage is susceptible to a change in mental activity , ” he says .
Anorgasmic women might practice in a lab with a vibrator , trying to mimic other women ’s successful brain patterns .
The brain is surprisingly plastic , Komisaruk says .
Witness the curious case -- described by UC San Diego neuroscientist Dr. V.S. Ramachandran -- of the man who had orgasms in his phantom foot .
When the man ’s foot was amputated , cells in the “ foot ” part of the brain were suddenly deprived of stimulation .
They died , leaving prime cerebral real estate vacant .
Then , like an opportunistic roommate , a neighboring region in the man ’s brain likely sent sprouts to commandeer the vacated landscape .
That region ?
One that processes input from penis and vulva .

The result :
The man felt foot - sized orgasms in a foot he no longer had .
Nothing quite so drastic is expected to occur with a bit of orgasmic neural training in the lab , Komisaruk says .
But the anecdote points out that the brain is indeed capable of some very imaginative tricks .

In the United States of America today , churches and religious groups are treated with enormous sensitivity and deference by politicians and the media , a deference they have not earned .
Far too often , the government and society in general bends over backwards to accommodate and encourage religious beliefs even when there is no rational reason why they should do so .
The most egregious example of this is the sweeping tax exemptions granted to religion .
It is not just one tax that religious organizations are excused from paying , but an entire constellation of them .
Clergy are exempt from federal taxes on housing and can opt out of Social Security and Medicare withholding .
Religious employers are generally exempt from federal and state unemployment taxes , and in some states , religious publications are exempt from sales tax .
Church benefit and retirement plans do not require the church employer to match its employees ’ contributions .
Churches are automatically exempted from filing annual public informational reports on their financial status and activities , and donations made to churches are eligible for income tax deductions .
And , of course , the two major tax breaks : church groups do not have to pay income tax and do not have to pay taxes on property which they own .
It is time to end this unfair and unjustifiable special treatment .
Religion has done nothing to deserve it , and has done much to disqualify itself .
There are compelling reasons to tax the churches , and this post will examine them .
Repealing churches ’ tax exemption prevents unnecessary and complicated legal tangles .
At the moment , the tax - exempt status of a church gives groups a strong incentive to declare themselves to be religious organizations , which inevitably leads to protracted legal battles over whether a given organization is a church or not .
( The space alien cult of Scientology ‘s multi - year legal battle with the U.S. government to win tax - exempt status is a case in point . )
This policy puts the government in the unenviable position of having to set policy on exactly what constitutes a religion .
As part of its tax - exempt status , a recognized church may not endorse candidates from the pulpit .
However , it can speak out without restriction on issues , a loophole large enough to drive a truck through , and one which has been exploited to the hilt by church groups of every political faction .
Any church leader with an ounce of intelligence can figure out how to use this as a backdoor strategy to make it exceedingly clear which candidate his parishioners are expected to vote for , and again the government is placed in the unenviable situation of examining church leaders ’ statements and trying to figure out whether they only concern issues or whether they are about candidates ( and if a church leader takes all the same positions on the issues as a candidate , how is this any different from endorsing that candidate directly ? ) .
If anything fosters an “ excessive entanglement ” between church and state , this does .
Eliminating the tax - exempt status of churches would neatly slice these two Gordian knots and solve both of these problems in a single stroke .
If churches paid taxes like any other group , there would be no reason for anyone to fight over whether a particular group is “ religious enough ” to constitute a church or not , and no reason for anyone to affect that status as a tax strategy .
And if churches could endorse candidates the ludicrous loophole that currently allows them to do so free of charge would be closed .
They are already doing so anyway ; they might as well pay taxes for the privilege like everyone else .
Repealing churches ’ tax exemption threatens no one ’s freedom of religion .
If a church sought to rent property from a private owner to conduct religious services but could not afford the rent that the owner was asking , would the church members ’ freedom to practice their religion have been destroyed ?
Obviously not : the freedom to practice religion that is guaranteed by the First Amendment does not mean that a religious group has an absolute right to take any property they want for their own use .
Church taxation is the same .
If a religious group could not afford to pay taxes on property that they owned , this does not mean that this group has been prevented from practicing its religion ; it means that the group must seek out a new location to do so , one which they can afford .
In the highly unlikely scenario that a church could not find any property whose taxes they could afford to pay , they would still be free to hold services on public property , such as a park , or in their individual members ’ residences .
Even in such a case , no one ’s freedom of religion has been infringed in any way .
The only “ right ” that is threatened by church taxation is the facetious and imaginary right of a religious group to do anything they want just because they are religious .
Repealing churches ’ tax exemption makes sense , given that they are unlike not - for - profit organizations .
Churches are fundamentally unlike the other kinds of groups that usually declare not - for - profit status .
Charities and educational institutions , for example , serve all people equally .
However , churches do not .
They are free to discriminate , and do discriminate , against people who do not share their beliefs ( this is called the “ ministerial exemption ” ) .
They can and do discriminate against people for being gay , for being women , for being unmarried , for their age , for having health problems , or for virtually any other reason .
( A recent New York Times article , “ Where Faith Abides , Employees Have Few Rights “ , gives more information on the liberties given to churches that would never be granted to any other employer . )
At the very least , these groups should pay taxes if they intend to treat their employees in this way .
Even better , this special treatment should end , and they should be held to the same anti-discrimination rules as any other business .
In addition , unlike other tax - exempt entities , churches can and very often do make a substantial profit .
A great number of church leaders enjoy wildly expensive and lavish lifestyles .
What is so objectionable about asking these incredibly wealthy groups to pay taxes on the money they take in ?
Repealing churches ’ tax exemption ends their unfair free ride .
Most of all , churches should be taxed because it is the right thing to do .
There is simply no good reason why churches should be tax - exempt .
The common assertion that churches provide a necessary inducement to morality fails to find support in the evidence : multiple studies have found that nonbelievers are at least as moral as religious people , and possibly more so .
For example , in The God Delusion , Richard Dawkins discusses a study which found that there was no statistically significant difference between the answers of atheists and the answers of religious people to a variety of moral dilemmas .
Additionally , the tax exemption given to churches harms the rest of us : because they do not pay taxes on the assets they own , all the rest of us must pay higher taxes to make up for that lost revenue .
This ought to irk believers enough , knowing that they are paying more because of the vast assets owned by rival churches , but atheists are harmed worst of all .
Having no equivalent organizations that are free to raise money and acquire assets with such abandon , we are in effect subsidizing all tax - exempt religious activity , to the tune of millions of dollars per year .
( An aside : If , as some apologists say , atheism is a religion , does that mean those apologists would support giving atheist groups the same tax exemption given to churches ? )
This baseless and unconstitutional discrimination should be ended immediately by taxing the churches .
Church tax exemptions also tilt the playing field and violate the principles of the free market .
Allowing churches to buy up as much land as they want , and hold it forever without paying taxes , stifles the ability of other people to make meaningful use of that property in the future and grants churches an unfair advantage when providing social services that compete with other businesses .
Even worse , churches are also unfairly exempt from many licensing and regulation requirements that all other types of businesses must comply with .
Churches are even exempt from taxes on side assets like parking lots .
There can be no justification for this special treatment .
Religious groups have been given a free ride for far too long just because they are religious .
If churches want to take part in our society , they should contribute to its upkeep just like everyone else .
It is time to tax the churches .
DAVOS , Switzerland
THE future looks bleak in much of the developed world .
It looks bright in the developing world .
Two opinion surveys released in connection with the World Economic Forum here showed optimism among corporate chief executives and the public in many emerging markets .
But there are doubts in many of the world ’s leading economies .
In the United States , just 27 percent of the people questioned in the Gallup International Voice of the People survey said they expected the next generation to be more prosperous than the current one , while 43 percent expected less prosperity .
Fear that the future will be worse is even greater in some other countries .
In France , only 11 percent of respondents said they expected a more prosperous future .
The figures in Japan , Germany and Italy were almost that low .
It was on the fourth anniversary of my wife 's death that I got to thinking about trying internet dating .
We had lived together very happily for 10 years and married just before her untimely death .
After the inevitable grieving process , my life was slowly starting to come into focus again .
Dating after losing someone you love is strange : you feel unfaithful to their memory , but , at the same time , have been given an all - too - bitter lesson in life 's shortness .
So I dated a few women - we'd be introduced by friends - but none made me think about settling down again .
I did miss having someone special to share things with but , like many men in their late 40s , my opportunities to meet women were limited .
My business - in the world of commercial trucks - could hardly have been more male - dominated .
And I have never been a fan of going into smoky pubs and nightclubs to pick up the lady of my dreams .
So I decided to give the computer a chance to find a woman for me : if it was as smart as it was always telling me it was , it should be a piece of cake .
I have never had any problem with women : thankfully , they like me .
But I could not have guessed what I would be letting myself in for when I enrolled on a dating website ; it was my introduction to a modern phenomenon , the older woman in search of sex .
After signing up , I looked at the profiles of the competition and concluded that most of them lacked humour .
I decided that honesty would be the best policy .
This is what I wrote : " Difficult , this bit , a little daunting , but here goes ... I did a poll among my friends and asked for no more than five words to describe me .
This is what topped the voting : 1 Very funny .
2 A good friend .
3 Loves ' a bit of a do ' .
4
Extremely good - looking ( only kidding , I put that one in myself ) 4 b Terrible loser .
5 Too cheerful by half . "
I 've got an ego as big as the next man , but even I was surprised to see that within 24 hours I had received 82 replies .
It quickly became clear that many of the profiles on these sites are total fabrications .
Take education .
All claimed a college education or a degree : do n't women who went to secondary modern use dating sites ?
So I resorted to what we used to do at the youth club all those years ago : went for looks .
That should have been the easy solution , but you try relating the 5ft 1in slender blonde to the dumpy , dark - haired figure waiting at the meeting point and looking impatiently at her watch .
I had been on the site only a couple of weeks before I met the first of what was to become a steady procession of correspondents whom I quickly named POWs - Predatory Older Women .
She was waiting for me in the car park of the country pub , standing next to her car , enjoying the late autumn sunshine .
She had the new version of the Beetle in a loud yellow .
The vehicle , I soon came to understand , is your first clue to being in the company of a POW .
( If she has a personalised number plate , you are normally in double trouble . )
Mary , as I will call her , appraised me carefully while saying hello .
I was doing the same .
She was immaculately dressed in a black Armani trouser suit - a seriously attractive woman .
She had specified her age as 49 but swiftly admitted she was 52 .
Men , she explained , want younger women , so you get more replies if you are under 50 .
I know men are shallow - but please .
We had been in each other 's company for a good 10 minutes when my next surprise came .
We were sitting in a quiet corner of the pub , and I was sipping orange juice , when Mary told me in no uncertain terms that she was not looking for a serious relationship : what she wanted was uncomplicated sex three or four times a month .
I must have looked shocked , because she raised a querying eyebrow .
I recovered and asked if she was joking .
Her reply still makes me smile .
She said I looked like a man who would be " up for it " .
For a second , I thought I was being set up , and looked around for the inevitable mate with a camera .
There was none .
Mary had children and grandchildren , was financially secure and enjoyed taking holidays with female friends .
To my astonishment , we started a passionate affair within days .
I had signed up to the website in the hope of starting a serious relationship and this was n't really what I was looking for , but I am no idiot , and you do n't look a gift horse in the mouth .
Fair play to your modern grandmothers - they know exactly what they want in bed , and are not afraid to demand it .
If I had been a less stalwart man I would have felt intimidated .
Thinking about it , I suppose it makes sense .
Most single women over 50 will have had at least one long - term relationship .
By that age , they 've got rid of the kids , got rid of the man they do n't want , and now it is time for them .
Going to bed with them is often a double - edged sword : for the women I dated , sex was recreational .
Their needs mattered to them more than mine .
But the sex was almost always terrific , they take care of their bodies , are not afraid to tell you exactly what you should be doing at any given time , and you know that if they give you a compliment in bed , they mean it .
I was just getting to the nearly falling in love stage with Mary when she dumped me .
That was another shock .
The last time I had been dumped , I was wearing flares and had a 30 - inch waist .
Mary had class : she told me she was getting too fond of me ( we were in bed at the time ) , so I had to go before I complicated her life .
But it had been a great couple of months ; we would meet for a drink , go to each other 's houses .
She was a lovely and formidable woman , very funny and excellent company .
I would have been up for more commitment .
I think it is more than likely that she had received a better offer , although I do n't like to dwell on that .
Being dumped was the spur I needed to take the shutters from my eyes and enter the fray forearmed .
I realised these women were not looking for a serious relationship , they were looking for fun .
I decided that is how I would treat it .
And if I met a special one along the way , so much the better .
So I licked my wounds , jumped in again and met " Kay " , a sales director .
She drove a Saab convertible with a personalised plate .
Kay told me she was 48 .
I believed her until I saw the photos of her 50th birthday party on my first visit to her swanky home ( terrific divorce lawyer : it was like Southfork in Dallas , only larger ) .
She laughed at her gaffe , then distracted me by seducing me on the stairs .
We did not even make it to the bedroom .
That is another thing about the predatory women I met : they have developed exhibitionist tendencies late in life .
After Kay there was " Alice " and then there was " Sue " - all beautiful , good - looking women .
And , to be honest , I have been amazed that these gorgeous creatures found me attractive enough to want to use me physically .
They pay lip service to romance - but I seriously believe that these women are not looking for intimacy and commitment .
I am something of an expert on non-commitment , so feel able to judge .
I was well into my 30s before I did commit to someone .
Since then , dating has changed completely .
Women are frequently taking the lead .
Us older men have to adapt as well , so I now let a woman buy me a drink , and talk me into bed .
As for the dating website , I have n't been on it for about a year .
But I am ever optimistic , and still hoping to find the special person .

The results of the " Dining in 2015 " contest hosted by designboom are in and my , oh my , are there some fascinating finds .
Over four thousand aspiring designers from ninety - eight countries participated , and I must say we humans really are a creative bunch , especially when it comes to food and the partaking thereof .
But do n't let me convince you -- check out these noteworthy picks for yourself .
10 . " Cutlery in a Wallet "
Italian designer Alberto Ghiradello has come up with a creative solution to carting around cutlery .
I do n't know about you , but somehow I tend to find spoons hanging out in my bag all the time , and it can get quite annoying , especially when there 's none in the kitchen drawer .
This " Cutlery in a Wallet " set can be assembled whenever you need them , and then can be reinserted into the flat mold and housed in your wallet again , hopefully after a cleaning .
9. " Musical Dining "
This piece , entitled " Musical Dining " was envisioned by Fumiaki Goto from the Netherlands and promises to bring some musical entertainment to your dining experience .
It 's made like a marimba , so when you place plates , glasses or different items on it at various points , different tones will emerge , transforming dinnertime into a jam session .
8. " Bubble "
I always like when everyday objects take on new life with a different function , such as this unique crystal " china " modeled after bubble wrap .
" Bubble " is made of cast polyester resin and looks like it would be a real pain in the butt to clean .
This was a collaborative effort by U.S. artists .
7. " =DEAR "
If this actually worked it would be pretty handy , as I often find myself unintentionally drinking " iced " coffee around 11 AM .
" ' = DEAR ' looks like an ear " and is meant to keep your food and drinks hot far longer than usual .
Designed by James Liao from Taiwan , this would work via a high efficiency battery that plugs into the cup , plate or whatever , thereby heating the ceramic layer via a series of thermo-conductive wiring .
A color - coded LED light would indicate what state the plug was in , be it hot , warm , or recharging .
Unfortunately , our technology today is not powerful enough to provide sufficient battery power to sustain the electric heating process , so we can only hope that by 2015 we 'll have it together enough to be able to keep our dang drinks and pizzas warm for hours .
6. " Hot Plate "
This " Hot Plate " is similar in intention to the previous one , but with a different flair .
An Israeli duo came up with this idea , using the conductive properties of metal films serving as decoration to keep food warm .
The plate is hooked up to an electrical source ( via a cord - not the most convenient ) and the decorative elements on the plate are given a second function as transmitters of heat .
But what 's up with that egg ?
Does it get hot enough to actually cook it , or is that just to illustrate a lukewarm point ?
5. " Fingersticks "
This one is pretty funny .
I do n’t know how I ’d feel about busting these out at my local Asian eatery , for fear of the stares and general mockery .
These wacky instruments are titled “ Fingersticks ” and are allegedly a fine substitution for chopsticks .
Designed by Zoltan Djeke from Croatia , they work by slipping onto your pointer finger and thumb like coiled rings , saving you from the hassle of figuring out the proper form for dining with chopsticks .
Now that 's class .
4. " Pop -Out Cutting Board "
This is really pretty handy .
Designed by U.S contestant Kenneth Johnson , it ’s a bowl and cutting board in one .
Once you ’ve finished chopping and slicing , you can just push the cutting board through and like magic , a bowl is formed to hold the stuff you just chopped .
I ’d like to see these in various sizes and colors .
And forget the future , we need these NOW .
3. Salt & Pepper Mills Set , Plus Minus F
As I 'm a big fan of all things levitating , I had to include this salt and pepper shaker in the mix .
These are the brainchild of Italian designer Son Mocci , and could quite possibly be included on the dinner table of the future .
They work via Neodymium magnets and are composed of two bodies - the floating base plate and the shaker .
2. " Flostick "
The " Flostick " designed by Korean Hak - Byoung Kim , is a peel - away chopstick that has four different lifetimes .
Made from branches and covered in a special , decomposable vinyl , these are not only eco-friendly but also pretty .
When you 've maxed out their function as eating utensils , you can just stick them in the earth and use them to help climbing vines grow .
Or impale a vampire , if that 's your thing .
1. " Exhaust Burger "
And let me tell you : I am so happy to be a vegetarian some days , especially when I see bizarre ideas like this .
Designed by an Iranian team , the " Exhaust Burger " transforms the tailpipe of your car into a mobile grill of sorts .
Wow .
Now that 's creative , and also a little disturbing .
The idea is that you stop the car when you are hungry , install the device ( and pack some ground round into it - so hygenic ) and you 're on your way to a delicious hamburger , ready for you at your next destination .
So those are my personal faves , but there are several other fine ideas for you to peruse and come to your own conclusions about , should you feel like investigating the results yourself .
One thing 's for certain :
Dining in the future is sure to feed not only our appetites but also our hunger for innovation .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
After most scientists had given up the search , a Belgian team said on Thursday they found elusive pancreatic stem cells in adult mice , a finding that could lead to treatments for people with type - 1 diabetes .
A mouse is seen in a file photo .

Scientists have long hunted for adult cells with the capacity to make insulin - producing cells known as beta cells , which help regulate the body ’s blood sugar levels .
If coaxed into reproducing , adult stem cells or progenitor cells could offer a way to replace beta cells lost or destroyed in people with diabetes .
“ For many years people believed that progenitor cells existed in the adult pancreas but were not able to trace or isolate them , ” Harry Heimberg , a diabetes researcher at Vrije Universiteit Brussels and the Beta Cell Biology Consortium , said in an e-mail .
More recent studies found that under normal circumstances , adult progenitor cells had little to do with the process of making beta cells , he said .
“ Most people gave up looking because they were so few and so hard to activate , ” Heimberg , whose study appears in the journal Cell , said in a statement .
Currently , there is no cure for type - 1 diabetes except rare pancreatic cell transplants done under what is known as the Edmonton Protocol , involving transplanting pancreatic cells from cadavers into the liver .
But these transplants are fragile and it takes several donors to make one transplant .
Researchers are also looking to stem cell therapies , including embryonic stem cells , as a way to have a more ready supply of cells to transplant .
Heimberg decided to see if they could get the body ’s own progenitor cells to make beta cells under abnormal circumstances , such as significant injury .
STRESS AND INFLAMMATION
His team clamped off a duct that drains digestive enzymes from the pancreas in laboratory mice .
This led to a doubling of beta cells in the pancreas within two weeks .
These animals began to produce more insulin , suggesting the new beta cells were working .
Heimberg suspects the cells began to regenerate as part of an inflammatory response .
He said the study suggests that progenitor cells exist in the adult pancreas of mice and they can be induced to make new insulin - producing cells .
Now scientists must look for these same cells in human adults , and find a way to activate them that does not involve injury to the pancreas .
But if they could figure out how to generate large numbers of beta cells this way , they might be used as beta - cell transplants .
“ The most important challenge now is to extrapolate our findings to patients with diabetes , ” he said .
But , he added , “ There is a long way to go before we can talk about a potential cure . ”
Type - 1 diabetes affects an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the 20 million Americans with diabetes .
Also called juvenile diabetes , it has different causes from the more common type - 2 diabetes that is linked with obesity , poor diet and a lack of exercise .
Type - 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease , caused by the mistaken destruction of insulin - producing cells .
Most type - 1 diabetics must take insulin daily to control their blood sugar levels .

Estimates of the number of genes in the human genome have ranged wildly over the past two decades , from 20,000 all the way up to 150,000 .
By the time the working draft of the human genome was published in 2001 , the best approximation stood at 35,000 , yet even that number has fallen .
A new analysis , one that harnesses the power of comparing genome sequences of various organisms , now reveals that the true number of human genes is about 20,500 , thousands fewer than what is currently listed in human gene catalogs .
The work , led by researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , has implications beyond merely settling the debate over how many genes are in the human genome .
An accurate gene count can help identify the locations of genes and their functions , an important step in translating genomic information into biomedical advances .
Ironically , the way genes are recognized has triggered much of the confusion over the human gene count .
Scientists on the hunt for typical genes — that is , the ones that encode proteins — have traditionally set their sights on so - called open reading frames , which are long stretches of 300 or more nucleotides , or “ letters ” of DNA , bookended by genetic start and stop signals .
This method produced the most recent gene count of roughly 25,000 , but the number came under scrutiny after the 2002 publication of the mouse genome revealed that many human genes lacked mouse counterparts and vice versa .
Such a discrepancy seemed suspicious in part because evolution tends to preserve gene sequences — genes , by virtue of the proteins they encode , usually serve crucial biological roles .
But like it or not , the 25,000 DNA sequences were already listed in the catalogs of human protein - coding genes , and skeptics had no systematic way to remove them .
“ At that point , no one had gone through the gene catalogs with a fine - toothed comb to find evidence that they were n’t valid , ” said Michele Clamp , first author of the study and senior computational biologist at the Broad Institute .
Far from blatant mistakes , non -gene sequences can masquerade as true genes if they are long enough and happen by chance to fall between start and stop signals .
Despite having gene - like characteristics , these open reading frames may not encode proteins .
Instead , they might have other functions or possibly none at all .
To distinguish such misidentified genes from true ones , the research team , led by Clamp and Broad Institute director Eric Lander , developed a method that takes advantage of another hallmark of protein - coding genes : conservation by evolution .
The researchers considered genes to be valid if and only if similar sequences could be found in other mammals – namely , mouse and dog .
Applying this technique to nearly 22,000 genes in the Ensembl gene catalog , the analysis revealed 1,177 “ orphan ” DNA sequences .
These orphans looked like proteins because of their open reading frames , but were not found in either the mouse or dog genomes .
Although this was strong evidence that the sequences were not true protein - coding genes , it was not quite convincing enough to justify their removal from the human gene catalogs .
Two other scenarios could , in fact , explain their absence from other mammalian genomes .
For instance , the genes could be unique among primates , new inventions that appeared after the divergence of mouse and dog ancestors from primate ancestors .
Alternatively , the genes could have been more ancient creations — present in a common mammalian ancestor — that were lost in mouse and dog lineages yet retained in humans .
If either of these possibilities were true , then the orphan genes should appear in other primate genomes , in addition to our own .
To explore this , the researchers compared the orphan sequences to the DNA of two primate cousins , chimpanzees and macaques .
After careful genomic comparisons , the orphan genes were found to be true to their name — they were absent from both primate genomes .
This evidence strengthened the case for stripping these orphans of the title , " gene . "
After extending the analysis to two more gene catalogs and accounting for other misclassified genes , the team ’s work invalidated a total of nearly 5,000 DNA sequences that had been incorrectly added to the lists of protein - coding genes , reducing the current estimate to roughly 20,500 .
In addition to suggesting a major revision to the human gene count , this work provides a set of rules for evaluating any future proposed additions to the human gene catalog .
It also underscores the benefit of genome sequencing projects .
“ Without several primate genomes , we would n’t have been able to put the final nail in the coffin of these putative genes , ” said Clamp .
More broadly , the research reveals that little invention of genes has occurred since mammalian ancestors diverged from the non-mammalian lineage .
“ There ’s no real creativity going on in the mammalian genome , ” explained Clamp .
That means that the number , structure , and function of protein - coding genes are not expected to differ very much from mammal to mammal , so what makes humans different from mice and dogs likely lies outside this realm of the genome .
Clamp and her Broad Institute colleagues are now peering into the genomes of many other mammals , in an attempt to explain what parts of our genome truly make us human .

The quake had a magnitude of 7.2 , according to an official from the country 's geophysics agency .
Indonesia suffers from frequent earthquakes and lies on the so - called Pacific Ring of Fire , one of the world 's most seismically active areas .
An earthquake off Indonesia triggered the 2004 Asian tsunami , which killed approximately 220,000 people .
The US Geographical Survey measured the earthquake at 7.3 - magnitude and said it occurred at a depth of 35 km ( 21.7 miles ) .
A government official in the town of Bengkulu , about 295 km ( 180 miles ) from the epicentre , said there did not appear to be any visible damage so far from Monday 's earthquake .
" Everyone rushed out of buildings , but this has become sort of a habit for us all , so there was not panic , " she told Agence France Presse .
Hassanudin , a police officer in Bengkulu , also said he had not heard of any casualties or damage so far .
But he added : " We still need to check with the police station on Muko - Muko ( nearest to the epicentre ) . "

I ’d been hearing plenty of consistent rumors that Ron Paul was polling poorly in his congressional district , but did n’t publish any of them because there was no way to verify the sources — and some of the reports I had heard seemed a bit suspect .
Ballot Access
News has just linked to data which suggests that the opposite is true .
Additionally , Dennis Kucinich seems safe in his district , as well .
Dennis Kucinich leads his Democratic opponents with 55 % , over 29 % for Joe Cimperman .
Three other candidates register 5 % or lower .
From the Public Policy Polling Texas release :
Just 18 % of likely Republican primary voters intend to cast their votes for President next week for Paul , compared to 49 % for John McCain and 27 % for Mike Huckabee .
Paul is at least doing better in his own district than his Democratic counterpart Dennis Kucinich , who fared at just 4 % in a similar survey conducted earlier this week .
Facing a challenge on the right from Friendswood City Councilman Chris Peden in the Republican primary , Paul looks safe for reelection though .
He leads Peden 63 -30 .
“ Ron Paul basically suspended his active candidacy for President earlier this month to go home and focus on getting reelected , ” said Dean Debnam , President of Public Policy Polling .
“ If he had continued to spend most of his time campaigning out of state he might have been in trouble , but it does n’t appear he ’s facing too much damage on the home front for his national candidacy . ”
Peden has particularly tried to attack Paul on issues like the war and moral and family values , but the poll shows he ’s not getting much traction .
Paul leads 64 - 27 among voters who said Iraq was their biggest concern , and has a 65 - 28 advantage with people who listed moral and family values as their top issue .
The poll also shows Paul popular with young people , a trend that has held across the country .
He gets 29 % of their votes for President , and leads Peden 75 - 11 with that group for Congress .
PPP surveyed 468 likely Republican primary voters on February 27th .
The survey ’s margin of errors is +/-4.7 % .
Other factors , such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting , may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify .
Nintendo's
Wii is world famous for its quirky controller and games that send players swinging their arms dangerously close to living - room furniture .
But late last month , Nintendo released " Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , " the first in - house game made from the ground up that is designed for hard - core gamers .
It 's the first one not meant to threaten the furniture or get grandmas to play .
What was it like making such a game for the system ?
How did the " Prime 3 " main creators — Retro Studios , which is owned by Nintendo and based in Austin , Texas — deal with an unconventional controller and a system not as graphically powerful as the machines that run most of this year 's most - hyped games ?
" Developing for the Wii made us adjust our way of thinking in terms of what the game was going to be , " said Mark Pacini , game director of " Prime 3 " and its immediate predecessor , " Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes , " on the GameCube .
" We knew it was going to be a ' Metroid ' game ... but most of all , beyond anything else , we really had to prove the controller , and I think that 's what this project became . "
The Wii did n't start with tailor - made , complex games .
Yes , the system launched with one hard - core gamer 's game , " The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess . "
But that title was initially designed for the GameCube ( a version was eventually released for the older system ) .
Most other Nintendo - made games for the system made simpler demands of the player : a swing of the arm to hit a baseball in Wii Sports , a press of the D - pad and tap of two different buttons to control most of " Super Paper Mario " and so on .
The " Prime " games were first - person - shooter or first - person - adventure titles ( depending on who was asked ) and used two control sticks and every button on the GameCube controllers .
The Wii's remote and nunchuck , streamlined as they were , presented Pacini and his team with problems .
" When we went to Japan and first saw the controller for the first time I got really concerned because there were n't a lot of buttons , " Pacini said .
They would be able to map the player 's movement to the control stick on the nunchuck device in the player 's left hand .
Pointing heroine Samus ' gun would be accomplished by pointing the remote at the screen .
There were enough buttons for jumping and a couple for shooting , but not as many as on a GameCube controller — or a 360 controller or a PS3 controller for that matter .
" Luckily it just seemed to be a coincidence that in [ planning for ] ' Metroid Prime 3 ' we were already talking about a system where everything stacked : your beam , your missiles , the grapple beam — all the additional abilities you get for those weapons stack so you do n't have to switch between beams , for instance .
We definitely kept that in mind going forward because with limited buttons , we did n't want to make this game overly complicated . "
Simplifying the weapon design of the series suited the Wii controller .
That controller , however , compelled the Retro team to make other things more complex .
" When we first started developing ' Metroid Prime 3 , ' we started getting a little cute with the controller ideas , " Pacini said .
They considered elaborate gestures that would trigger Samus ' grappling hook .
At one point they had the player rotating their left hand clockwise and counter - clockwise to either emit or siphon electricity from Samus ' left hand .
" That was one of those clever things that sounds good on paper but in practice was n't so good . "
They simplified the gestures to pointing and some shakes of the nunchuck to toss and recoil the grapple beam .
One controller option they did n't consider was using the Wii Zapper , the upcoming peripheral announced in early summer that turns the system 's controllers into a two - handed light gun ( see " Nintendo At E3 : Mad ' Mario ' Titles On The Way ; Wii Zapper Could Be A Future Shock " ) .
" We actually found out about the Zapper the same time everyone else did , " Pacini said .
" We were a few months from completing the game , so it was never really considered . "
If the Wii controller posed one formidable challenge , it 's reasonable to assume that the system 's graphical prowess , reputedly not far from the original Xbox 's , would frustrate a Retro team known for pushing game visuals .
" The Wii is a fairly decently powerful game system as far as polygons go , " art director Todd Keller said , refraining from making any serious complaints .
" We do n't have a lot of depth with shader stuff , but we can make really good color palettes . "
Keller , who has been overseeing art in the " Prime " series , said the system can graphically surpass the achievements of " Prime 3 , " noting " you can definitely do more stuff that will be way beyond that . "
But he also shared a philosophy about game graphics that suggests there 's plenty of ways to impress players ' eyes that do n't involve pushing tech .
Instead , he talks about pushing talent to some interesting extremes .
" We 'll do crazy stuff , " Keller said .
" You can ask any artist here what the first ' Prime ' was about and they 'll say cracks .
All we did was put thousands of cracks everywhere .
For some reason at the time I was real big into cracks and everything had to be beveled .
Every crack was custom .
There is not one crack that was copied around .
I made them chop up everything .
We chopped up every stone that was unique on the game .
Every pebble . "
So what is " Prime 3 " about ?
" Texture detail . "
Keller said that in the Wii game , every texture — the flat pieces of art that coat every side of every figure , object and piece of terrain in any 3 - D game — was handmade , ideally at 512 pixels wide , double the resolution of textures in the two earlier " Prime " games .
Not only is he proud of the level of detail his art team achieved , but the amount of variety in the game .
Consider the mushrooms that appear in the " Prime 3 " jungle planet .
" All those mushrooms in the Bryyo world — those big , spiky mushrooms — those are n't really copied around at all , " Keller said .
" They 're kind of made new each time , just because we did n't want the mushrooms to be similar .
We would take all the vertices and move them different places or extrude , pull out new polygons to make the mushrooms fit into the hill differently .
When we get closer to [ the toxic energy called ]
Phazon they are a little more corrupted . "
What his team did for mushrooms they tried to do for everything in the game , from the enemies to the chambers on each of the game 's planets .
" Our focus is to make every room its own custom stage , " Keller said .
" We think it 's up to us to present something that 's very high - quality for the player to enjoy .
We do n't want to copy our own rooms or textures if we can .
Because we want it to be new for you every time you walk in one of those doors . "
" Prime 3 " has been out for three weeks .
It sold more than 200,000 copies in the U.S. in its first four days of release and has earned reviews close to those of the two earlier games in the series ( though the first " Prime " is still the best - ranked on GameRankings.com ) .
Pacini , Keller and the rest of Retro are already focused on their next project , which is not another " Metroid Prime " game .
What is it ?
They 're coy .
But some Retro fans have pondered the studio going casual and making the kinds of games Nintendo's Japan studios are emphasizing , the " Wii Sports " and " Wii Fit " of the world .
Are those fans right ?
" One of the things we 've always been told by Nintendo of Japan is they say they appreciate us as a studio because we make games they can't make , " Pacini said .
" Their specialty is in the casual market .
Their specialty is in the platforming and more traditional games . "
But will Nintendo make Retro go that route too ?
" I 'm really excited about what we 're working on next , " he said .
" If people enjoy the kinds of games Retro makes , I do n't think they 're going to be disappointed about what we 're doing . "
And what of those first - person controls they just made for the Wii ?
" I honestly feel with ' Metroid Prime 3 ' we 've at least set a platform where other people could take it from here , " Pacini said .
" It 's very viable and it 's fun to play .
Hopefully all I can wish for is [ that ] people look at what we did and improve it . "
Retro Studios shared a lot more " Metroid " and Wii talk with MTV News in a wide - ranging interview that also tackled the reasons for their game 's unique online connectivity , the studio's sometimes controversial approaches to the first and final hours of the " Prime " titles , and the hint to a future " Metroid " game that some fans claim to have spotted in " Prime 3 . "
The developers ' thoughts on those topics and more will be published over the next several days in the MTV News Multiplayer blog .
The tiny principality of Liechtenstein , nestled between Switzerland and Austria , rarely attracts the attention of the international media .
However , a major investigation in Germany into allegations of tax evasion has turned the spotlight on Liechtenstein 's strict banking secrecy laws , and heightened tensions between the two countries .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , has demanded greater financial transparency ; Liechtenstein 's politicians point the finger at Germany 's convoluted tax system .
The fallout from the scandal could have wider implications for Germany 's political scene , with growing voter discontent at the country 's business elite provoking a further shift to the left .
A model of secrecy
Last week German prosecutors launched the country 's largest - ever investigation into alleged tax fraud , raiding homes and offices nationwide for evidence of those suspected of avoiding their tax obligations by channelling up to € 4bn ( US $ 5.9bn ) into secret foundations set up by LGT Group , Liechtenstein 's largest bank .
The German finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , has accused the tax dodgers of defrauding the state of millions of euros in lost revenue .
The most high - profile casualty so far is Klaus Zumwinkel , a well - known figure among Germany 's corporate elite , who resigned as chief executive of Deutsche Post and chairman of Deutsche Telekom on February 15th , amid claims that he had evaded payment of around € 1 m in taxes due on a Liechtenstein trust .
As many as 1,000 members of Germany 's social and business elite are now believed to be in the prosecutors ' sights .
The scandal has sent shockwaves across Germany and also sparked a heated political row , with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , accusing Liechtenstein 's banks of " encouraging lawbreaking " and demanding an easing of the principality 's strict banking secrecy rules so as to provide greater financial transparency .
The head of the governing Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , Kurt Beck , went so far as to charge the Alpine tax haven of employing " robber baron " policies , while Ms Merkel warned that the German parliament could block Liechtenstein 's entry into the EU 's border - free Schengen zone later this year unless reforms were implemented .
Not to be outdone , the principality responded by pointing the finger at Germany 's " bullying tactics " , with Crown Prince Alois denouncing the " unprovoked attack " on Liechtenstein , and suggesting that Germany should concentrate on doing more to sort out its own flawed tax system .
The growing tensions between the two countries stem in part from revelations that the tax investigation was initiated only after Germany 's foreign intelligence agency , BND , had paid € 4 m to a suspected former employee of LGT for a list of the bank 's tax - evading clients .
Concerns have been voiced in both countries that the actions taken by BND were outside the agency 's national security ( and constitutional ) remit , with attention also focusing on the wider ethical debate as to whether BND was justified in paying a € 4 m bribe to a bank official in a foreign country ( with financing and approval from both the German chancellery and finance ministry ) .
A need for transparency
Tight banking secrecy rules have long made Liechtenstein an attractive place for investors seeking to avoid tax , but its continued status as a tax haven has drawn increasing attention and criticism from larger countries seeking to clamp down on alleged tax dodgers .
Since 2000 the OECD has achieved some success in its efforts to promote greater banking transparency and more effective information exchange across 35 jurisdictions — mostly small islands and states such as Jersey , the Cayman Islands , San Marino and Bermuda — identified as tax havens .
This partly reflects a growing concern in many offshore centres that tight banking secrecy rules could be disproportionately aiding money - laundering , terrorist financing and corporate fraud .
Within the EU , a political agreement was reached in 2003 to introduce a system of information exchange in a bid to reduce savings tax evasion within member states .
Countries eager to retain a tax haven tag such as Austria , Luxembourg and Switzerland were allowed to keep their banking secrecy laws , but were required to impose a withholding tax on interest - bearing assets .
However , Liechtenstein is one of three tax havens , along with Monaco and Andorra , that the OECD has blacklisted as being " uncooperative " .
Indeed , the Alpine principality is regarded as being the most reclusive of all the tax havens monitored by the organisation .
In a Financial Times article on February 21st , the secretary - general of the OECD , Angel Gurria , stated that " jurisdictions characterised by strict bank secrecy and a policy or practice of non-cooperation prosper … to the detriment of the integrity of the world financial system and such behaviour is no longer acceptable " .
The Liechtenstein prime minister , Otmar Hasler , has sought to dampen the current ill feeling with Berlin , stressing that its standing as a financial centre is currently undergoing a process of reform .
A toughening of controls has been promised , although it is unclear what changes , if any , will be made to improve financial transparency .
The principality has rejected Ms Merkel 's accusations that investing in its system of secret foundations actively encourages tax evasion .
A need for simplicity
The argument in Liechtenstein that Germany should look closer to home in analysing the reasons behind the breaking scandal should not be overlooked .
Germany 's tax structure remains one of the least attractive feature of the country 's business environment .
According to OECD data , tax and social security contributions for an average single earner in manufacturing account for over 50 % of labour costs , second in the OECD only to Belgium .
Top income tax rates were reduced from 53 % in 1998 to 42 % at the beginning of 2005 , but then increased again in 2007 to 45 % for those earning above € 250,000 .
The tax burden on companies is also high , even after a reduction of the corporate tax rate in 2001 , while the tax base for capital income is set to be broadened next year by the inclusion of capital gains .
The major concern , however , is that German tax laws have become increasingly complex , reflecting politicians ' fondness for micro-management .
Tricking the taxman is now widely considered a national pastime in Germany , with the number of tax advisers having risen sharply over the past decade , as those on even modest earnings seek to find a potential loophole in the sprawling tax code .
According to the national tax collectors ' union , DStG , revenue losses amounted to around € 30bn last year through tax avoidance measures .
Before the last election in 2005 , opinion polls had indicated a strong preference among most voters ( and business leaders ) for simpler tax rules rather than lower rates .
However , the government has made little progress in addressing such concerns , and with the momentum for reform in Germany having slowed sharply , any new initiatives are likely to remain on hold until after next year 's federal election .
Wider discontent
Ms Merkel will be conscious of the potential domestic fallout from the spiralling tax fraud inquiry , not least with a regional election taking place in Hamburg on February 24th .
Traditionally a northern stronghold for the chancellor 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) — the senior partner in Germany 's federal " grand coalition " — opinion polls suggest her party is unlikely to gain a majority this time around .
On a broader front , the CDU will be concerned that the scandal could trigger a rise in public dissatisfaction with the business establishment in the midst of a banking crisis and a long - running debate in Germany over executive pay , and in the process drive voter sentiment further to the left .
There is a commonly held belief among labour unions and the wider electorate that the benefits of the robust period of economic activity in recent years have not been enjoyed by the majority , at the same time as booming profits have led to excessive " fat cat " pay .
The chancellor will be keenly aware that a protest vote in Hamburg would provide further momentum for parties on the left of the political spectrum .
A clear message from recent regional elections in Hesse and Lower Saxony in late January was that reform - weary Germans are moving in greater numbers towards parties who oppose further economic liberalisation , with the small Left Party , a radical left - wing grouping , strengthening its position as a real player in German politics .
With this trend seemingly set to continue — polls show a rise in support for the Left Party in Hamburg — the outcome of the federal election next September will remain wide open .

Patriots running back Kevin Faulk has been charged with marijuana possession after he was found with four hand - rolled cigars filled with the illegal substance while attending a concert in his home state of Louisiana , Capt .
John Babin of the Lafayette ( La. ) Metro Narcotics Task Force said today .
Faulk , who has played nine seasons in the NFL , all with the Patriots , was issued a citation after he was found with marijuana while attending a Lil ' Wayne rap concert last Friday night at the Cajundome in Lafayette .
Faulk , 31 , was not taken into custody , but as part of the citation agreed to appear in court to face the charge of simple possession of marijuana .
No court date has been established yet .
Faulk is the second Patriots player to be cited for marijuana possession this off - season .
Two days after the Patriots ' stunning 17 - 14 upset loss to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII , reserve defensive back and special teams contributor Willie Andrews was caught in Lowell with three bags of marijuana on Feb .
5 . Andrews pled not guilty to charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute and is due back in court on March 18 for a pre-trial conference .
According to Babin , Faulk was with friends and on his way to a suite at the Cajundome when he was searched in the administration office of the building by an in uniform , off - duty Lafayette Parish Sheriff 's deputy who was providing security for the event .
" It was n't a random search , everybody going into the building was searched that night , " said Babin .
Babin said that Faulk was very cooperative .
A phone call to Faulk 's representative , Raymond Brothers , has not been returned .
" We 're aware of the report , but we do n't have any additional comment at this time , " Patriots spokesman Stacey James said .
The incident was first reported by KATC - TV in Louisiana .
Faulk was named a team captain for the first time in his career this season .
The Patriots ' all - time leader in receptions by a running back with 323 , he is the team 's top option out of the backfield in passing situations and third - down sets .
He had 47 catches for 383 yards and a touchdown this season and added 62 rushes for 265 yards as the Patriots went 18 - 1 , including the playoffs .
His lone touchdown reception came against the Indianapolis Colts and capped the Patriots memorable comeback from a 20 - 10 deficit to seize a 24 - 20 victory .
Faulk squeezed into the end zone on a 13 - yard catch - and - run with 3:15 remaining against the Colts .
Babin said that Faulk was not a specific target , but said that the narcotics task force does usually have a heavier presence at events at the Cajundome where they feel drugs may be present .
They work those events undercover , although it was an in -uniform deputy who caught Faulk .
Marijuana was found on Lil ' Wayne 's tour bus in both New York , last July , and in Arizona earlier this year .
" It 's a large venue in town where events are held throughout the year and based on the type of event and whether we would think there would be a narcotics presence we would work it undercover , " said Babin .
" Kevin just happened to have marijuana . "

“ And if I want to burn and buy and emit more , then acquiring more money naturally gives me the right to do so . ”
If our economy fails to charge us the “ true cost ” of denying future generations the fossil energy they might need to feed themselves 50 years hence ; if our economy suffocates vast swathes of bio-productive land beneath highways and parking lots for our Happy Motoring convenience , if our economy fails to extract “ flood money ” from us to recompense millions of coastal dwellers for the loss of their ancestral homelands beneath rising oceans ; well … perhaps the solution is to internalize those costs somehow .
“ How big a house – how many houses – should I be able to buy ?
Just as many as I can afford . ”
Somewhere along the way , we - the - people seem to have reached a consensus that when it comes to allocating natural resources , money should do the talking .
In fact many true believers contend money is the only legitimate communicator .
Tellingly , the specific methods politicians might use to sneak such price - boosting tariffs past hyper- vigilant business interests and an unsupportive consuming public are seldom explained .
But in any case it is deemed essential that we remember the distribution of natural resources is not – and cannot be – a “ moral ” issue .
We do not challenge Billy Fourwheeler to find ways to amuse himself that require no fossil fuel .
We do not warn Mr. Manor that monuments to covetousness make us worse rather than better human beings .
We do not broach carbon footprints when family members or friends return from their flight to Park City to play on world - class ski slopes .
If the unenlightened masses are to wake up , then prices must serve as alarm clocks .
As despite the fact that major gasoline price increases ( from less than $ 2 a few years ago to more than $ 3 today ) have failed to put any appreciable dent in our consumption , again and again we are reassured that , “ When gas prices go up , ( other ) people will conserve . ”
It would be an understatement to say that our plutocratic caste is particularly fond of the fiscally - based resource entitlements program .
Millionaires and billionaires overwhelmingly prefer a system of governance which represents dollars rather than souls , and quite naturally $ 10 gas and $ 4000 airline tickets wo n’t crimp the style of any self - respecting Washington insider or Fortune 500 CEO ( in fact chauffeured motoring and flying might become pleasant again without the rabble clogging highways , airports , and flight paths ) .
When confronted by the abject failures of the market system to distribute Earth ’s finite bounties to the most needy , or to restrain present consumption so some essential resources are left for future generations , the “ money talks ” faithful often counter with the bizarre contention that burning up Nature ’s one - time gifts as fast as possible may be the best way to deal with them – a kind of wild - west “ bring it on ” bravado .
True believers do not trouble themselves with niggling trifles like entropy ; they harbor unshakeable faith that a scarcity of resource “ x ” will inevitably spur The Market to develop an even better substitute in the form of “ y ” .
If pressed on the central matter of usable energy , the economic cornucopians will usually point to the transitions from wood to coal and thence oil and natural gas as incontrovertible proof that the process can continue ad infinitum .
But despite billions spent on research into petroleum alternatives over many decades , we have uncovered no evidence that any practical “ new ” form of energy will ever approach the abundance and convenience of petroleum .
Oil once offered a rate of energy - return - on - energy - invested exceeding 100 - to - 1 .
Now we lavish billions on subsidies for corn ethanol which yields at best 1.7 units of alcohol energy for every unit of invested natural gas , diesel , and coal .
Now we rip off whole mountaintops to expose seams of low - quality coal , and claw even more savage scars into Earth ’s living skin to extract the dilute tar sands of Alberta , in the process burning about one unit of high quality natural gas to produce two or three units of low - quality crude .
The combination of our economic paradigm with our willful ignorance of finite realities is a curse upon future generations .
Treacherous slopes lie beyond the extraction peaks for all of our major energy resources , but we - the - people have not begun to assemble the ropes and belays we will need to descend them securely rather than tumbling into catastrophe .
And so long as we remain silent and allow money to do the talking , we never will .
