The British government has refused to allow an Iroquois lacrosse team to travel to England using passports issued by the Iroquois Confederacy .
The decision Wednesday means the team will miss a world championship lacrosse competition in Manchester .

( ( Bebeto Matthews / Associated Press ) )
A British Consulate spokeswoman says the team would be able to travel only with documents the United Kingdom considers valid .
Tonya Gonnella Frichner , a member of the Onondaga Nation who works with the team , says it was told by British officials that members would have to use U.S. or Canadian passports to travel to Britain .
The decision was announced hours after the U.S. cleared the team for travel on a one - time waiver at the behest of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The team needed to get on a Wednesday flight to make a Thursday evening game .
The Iroquois helped invent lacrosse and , in a rare example of international recognition of American Indian sovereignty , participate at every tournament as a separate nation .
The 23 players have passports issued by the Iroquois Confederacy , a group of six Indian nations overseeing land that stretches from upstate New York into Ontario .
The U.S. government had said it would only let players back into the country if they have U.S. passports , a team official said .
The British government , meanwhile , would n't give the players visas if they could not guarantee they'd be allowed to go home ..
New travel rules
Iroquois team members born within U.S. borders have been offered U.S. passports , but the players refuse to carry them because they see the government - issued documents as an attack on their identity , Frichner said earlier this week .
" It 's about sovereignty , citizenship and self - identification , " said Frichner , who also is the North American regional representative to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues .
The Iroquois have used their own passports in the past , but U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the new dispute can be traced to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative , which went into effect last year .
The new rules require , among other things , that Americans carry passports or high - tech documents to cross the country 's borders .
" Since they last travelled on their own passports , the requirements in terms of the kind of documents that are necessary to facilitate travel within and outside the hemisphere have changed , " Crowley said .
" We are trying to help them get the appropriate travel documents so they can travel to this tournament . "
Tribes ' efforts to meet the new security requirements have been ongoing .
A group of American Indian leaders requested funding from the Department of Homeland Security in 2009 to develop cards that would comply with the new rules , according to an agency document .
Idaho's Kootenai tribe and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agreed last year to develop the first enhanced tribal card acceptable under the new guidelines .
' That 's our identity '
One Iroquois player , Brett Bucktooth , said he would rather miss the tournament than travel under a U.S. passport .
" That 's the people we are , and that 's our identity , " he said .
Bucktooth , 27 , also spoke of his deep cultural and personal connection with lacrosse — first played by Iroquois and Huron about 1,000 years ago .
" My father put a wooden lacrosse stick into my crib when I was a baby , and now that I have a son , I put a lacrosse stick into his crib , " he said .
" In our culture , we all start playing lacrosse young . "
Bucktooth and other Iroquois see lacrosse as a gift to the tribes from their creator .
Lacrosse was played by American Indians as a preparation for war and " to resolve conflicts , heal the sick , and develop strong , virile men , " according to US Lacrosse , the American governing body of the sport .
Today , the Iroquois Nationals , as the team is called , is ranked No. 4 by the Federation of International Lacrosse and represents the Haudenosaunee – an Iroquois Confederacy of the Oneida , Seneca , Mohawk , Tuscarora , Cayuga and Onondaga nations .
About 90,000 Haudenosaunee , or " the people of the longhouse , " live today in New York , Wisconsin and Oklahoma , as well as Quebec and Ontario , said Onondaga Chief Oren Lyons .
The team has been travelling on Iroquois passports for the past 20 years , and Iroquois passport holders have been using them to go abroad since 1977 , said Denise Waterman , a member of the team 's board of directors .
Within the last year , colleagues used their Iroquois passports to travel to Japan and Sweden without any problems , she said .
In the past , U.S. immigration officials accepted the Iroquois passports when they obtained visas — including for trips to Britain in 1985 and 1994 , and as recently as 2002 to Australia .
Sharon Jones and the Dap - Kings were a funk soul band , founded in Brooklyn , NY , USA ( 1996 ) .
They were signed to Daptone Records , where the Dap - Kings are the house band .
They are widely thought to be spearheads of a revivalist movement that aims to capture the essence of funk / soul music as it was at its height in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s .
Part of the way this is achieved is to shun modern digital recording methods in favour of using traditional analogue recording equipment .
The type of instruments used by the band may also be considered limited to those that would have been availabl… read more
When New York Press critic Armond
White panned the universally admired Toy Story 3 , the disapproval he expressed and the backlash it inspired were so “ predictable ” that they were , well , predicted .
Bumping TS3 from its briefly “ 100 % Fresh ” standing at the critical aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , White ’s piece ( entitled “ Bored Game ” ) channeled a steady stream of pissed off Pixar loyalists to the Press website .
“ Registered just to say I think you are a massive twat and I feel really sorry for you , ” user woahreally weighed in .
“ Whoever ur boss is should be slapped for allowing you to publish this disaster of a review , ” opined the inventively pseudonymed usuckballs .
The comments - section calls for White to be fired are occasionally hilarious in their venom and vulgarity , all the more so for being so spectacularly self - defeating — could the Press have mounted a more successful campaign to increase their web traffic and user registrations ?
And there ’s the rub .
White ’s detractors accuse of him being a “ contrarian , ” someone who bucks the critical establishment and defies popular taste out of little more than cynical self - promotion and antisocial perversity .
( This highly circulated chart of Armond ’s pans and praises has been offered as definitive “ proof ” that his opinions are reflexively reactionary . )
But if this is true , any principled stand against White paradoxically rewards and enables him .
“ Do n’t feed the trolls , ” as the saying goes .
For what it ’s worth , White insists these are n’t his motives : “ I do n’t say these things to call attention to myself or to get a rise out of people .
I say them because I believe them . ”
And he is not without his supporters ; check out House contributor Steven Boone ’s celebratory profile .
More common are the agnostics who abstain from passing judgment on White ’s sincerity but object to the mob - like mentality manifested in , say , a petition to have White ’s byline expunged from Rotten Tomatoes .
Everyone ’s entitled to their own opinion , the anti-backlash argument goes , Tomatometers be damned !
Even if Armond is a contrarian , his consensus - busting reviews make for a useful kind of thought exercise , forcing readers to look “ beyond the hype . ”
Now honestly : does this whole post already sound a little blah blah blah ?
Armond - fueled flare - ups have attracted progressively larger crowds of commentators and rubberneckers , but the ( let ’s be charitable ) dialogue has n’t advanced in any meaningful way .
Each new controversy , dominated by culture - war caricatures and the politics of personality , feels increasingly manufactured for its own sake .
Substantive insights tend to get lost in a sea of snark , ad hominem and empty polemics .
New York magazine ’s 2009 profile of White was admirable in its way for lowering the temperature of the debate , but its even - handed insistence on balance ( that there are two sides to every argument and each must be presented in an equally sympathetic light ) was ultimately just as mystifying .
Is Armond White a principled critic or an opportunistic crackpot — or something in between ?
Here ’s what I ’d like to do in this post .
Let ’s concede
White his de gustibus however much he insists on the disputandum .
With all due respect to Cinema Blend ’s Joshua Tyler , there is no such thing as a film “ so self - evident[ly ] good ” that arguing “ the opposite is n’t just a different opinion , it ’s a wrong opinion . ”
To counter an evaluative judgment with an “ objective ” consensus is simply untenable — critical orthodoxy evolves over time and even the most rarefied masterpiece can be productively critiqued .
But Tyler is right in his belief that not all opinions are equal .
We can evaluate the evaluations .
Reviews should be challenged on the grounds of descriptive accuracy , clarity of expression and intellectual consistency .
More ephemeral qualities like fairness , usefulness and originality can be grounded in textual evidence and comparative criticism .
No one ’s opinion is more objectively right than any other , but there ’s no question that some are better argued , better supported and ultimately more interesting .
So let ’s go through White ’s TS3 review one paragraph at a time .
( There are five total . )
Maybe you think this is a tedious waste of time .
It ’s one thing to retweet “ What an idiot ! ” but to offer a comprehensive close - reading may seem pointless , even pretentious .
My feeling is that if the subject is worth discussing , it ’s worth discussing well .
At a time when fuzzy think pieces repeatedly wonder “ Do critics still matter ? ” , Armond has been one of the few professional reviewers whose arguments have inspired popular debate — for better or for worse ?
White will no doubt find himself mired in future dust-ups and the same arguments will be trotted out yet again .
So what ’s the harm in a piece that tries to tackle the topic systematically ?
We all know how White has been judged by his peers .
What interests me more is how he will be judged by history .
The core of White ’s critique is right in the lede ( somewhat predictably packaged in one of his better - than tropes ) :
“ Pixar has now made three movies explicitly about toys , yet the best movie depiction of how toys express human experience remains Whit Stillman ’s 1990 Metropolitan .
As class - conscious Tom Townsend ( Edward Clements ) tries fitting in with East Side debutantes , he discovers his toy cowboy pistol in his estranged father ’s trash .
Without specifying the model , Stillman evokes past childhood , lost innocence and Townsend ’s longing for even imagined potency .
But Toy Story 3 is so besotted with brand names and product - placement that it stops being about the innocent pleasures of imagination — the usefulness of toys — and strictly celebrates consumerism . ”
Metropolitan is a film that White likes a lot ; he refers to it regularly in his reviews and last year introduced a screening of the work at New Directors / New Films .
So how can he so categorically misremember this moment ?
The scene involves Clements and Stillman stand - by Chris Eigeman , and it ’s the latter who discovers the junked toys and lets loose a wistful reverie : “ It ’s incredible the things some people throw away : Steiff stuffed animals , an Aurora model motoring set , a Derringer !
Do you remember the Derringer craze ?
These are the toys of our generation .
The childhood of our whole generation is represented here . ”
The toys are not Eigeman ’s own and yet he too has an immediate emotional connection with them , one that hinges explicitly on brand - name nostalgia ; the “ specif[ic ] model ” of cap gun is not only named , it ’s named twice .
There ’s something of the connoisseur in Eigeman ’s reaction — these are collector ’s items !— but his monologue mainly speaks to the ways that our childhood memories are inextricably ( trade - ) marked by the corporate past .
So it ’s not surprising that recognizable brands provide the models for several of TS3 ’s main characters ( Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head , Barbie and Ken , Slinky the dog ) and a few minor ones ( the Barrel of Monkeys , the Farmer Says See - n - Say , Chatter Telephone ) .
White ’s complaint that this is commercially crass “ product placement ” misconstrues a much more interesting reality .
As a subsidiary of Disney , Pixar could have best maximized the ancillary profits from prefabricated toy sales in one of two ways : limiting themselves to the Disney pantheon ( like in the Kingdom Hearts video - game series ) or the roster of a single , highest - bidding manufacturer .
The TS3 lineup is instead drawn from the stables of many companies : Milton Bradley , Hasbro , Tyco , Mattell , Fisher Price .
By licensing individual properties from multiple agencies , Pixar is making far less money than they could ; their choices have little to do with the financial imperatives of corporate synergy .
So what do the above toys have in common ?
I ’d say they are all iconic brands , perennial favorites that have transcended their historical specificity to become timeless classics .
They are brands in the way that “ Kleenex ” and “ Band - Aid ” are brands .
In that sense they are not that different from the original characters based on generic models : Woody ( the cowboy ) , Buzz ( the spaceman ) , Hamm ( the piggy bank ) , Lots - O’ - Huggin ’ ( the teddy bear ) and the majority of TS3 ’s characters , instantly identifiable but non-proprietary .
Of the vast array of playthings on display at the Sunnyside Daycare Center , only a handful correspond to trademarked designs .
There are literally dozens of opportunities for product placement that are not capitalized on .
The branded exceptions are of a piece with the film ’s world - making and with the Pixar team ’s layered homages to their creative predecessors .
In an era of productions that mechanically monetize preexistent properties ( Alvin and the Chipmunks anyone ? ) ,
White ’s canned anti-corporate critique is embarrassingly misdirected .
You ’d never know it from Armond ’s review , but the entire plot of TS3 is a self - evidently explicit critique of commercialism ’s two complimentary principles : endless novelty ( Andy ’s emotional connection to the toys is based on his life - long relationship with them ) and disposability ( the idea of simply junking old toys is made horrifying , that of donating them to a younger generation elevated to a moral good ) .
One could argue that these themes are insincere or hypocritical in the context of a commercial mega-production , but this is not an argument White makes .
He dismisses the film as “ strictly a celebration of consumerism ” without any reference to these tropes .
That ’s either oblivious or dishonest .
Paragraph two is primarily plot synopsis , with a second better - than thrown in :
“ I feel like a 6 - year - old having to report how in Toy Story 3 two dolls — Sheriff Woody ( Tom Hanks ) and Buzz Lightyear ( Tim Allen ) — try to save a toy box of childhood playthings from either disuse or imprisonment as donations to a daycare center because their human owner , 17 - year - old Andy , packs them up as he heads off to college .
The toys wage battle with the daycare center ’s cynical veteran cast - offs : Hamm the Piggy Bank pig , Lotsa Hugs and Big Baby .
But none of these digital - cartoon characters reflect human experience ; it ’s essentially a bored game that only the brainwashed will buy into .
Besides , Transformers 2 already explored the same plot to greater thrill and opulence . ”
As many commenters have noted , Toy Story mainstay Hamm is not one of the daycare ’s denizens .
It ’s a small but glaringly obvious mistake that your average “ 6 - year - old ” could have caught , and arguably a testament to how little attention White was able to muster .
The comparison to Transformers ’ “ greater opulence ” seems beyond dispute — one may prefer the cartoonishly simplified Pixar aesthetic to Michael Bay ’s retina - searing CGI , but on a purely descriptive level the latter ’s greater visual complexity is undeniable .
The question of “ thrills ” is more subjective .
Transformers ’ cinematic spectacle is more viscerally overwhelming , but one could counter that TS3 ’s investment in characterization enables a deeper emotional investment in the action .
White ’s criticism about a lack of “ human experience ” is somewhat nebulous , but preceding an unfavorable comparison to Transformers , it seems willfully perverse .
Bay ’s Autobots were barely differentiated characters ; one could generously describe them as “ archetypal , ” but even that seems like a stretch .
Beyond the literal point of comparison ( visual styles ) , this better - than juxtaposition seems intellectually inconsistent and self - negating .
Paragraph three :
“ While Toy Story 3 ’s various hazards and cliffhangers evidence more creativity than typical Pixar product ( an inferno scene was promising , Lotsa Hugs ’ cannily evokes mundane insensitivity ) , I admit to simply not digging the toys - come - to - life fantasy ( I do n’t babysit children , so I do n’t have to ) nor their inevitable repetition of narrative formula : the gang of animated , talking objects journey from one place to another and back — again and again .
It recalls how Tim Burton ’s atrocious Alice in Wonderland repeated narrative stasis without exercising the famous line : “ It takes all the running you can do just to stay in the same place . ”
Burton ’s omission of that legendary , therapeutic slogan parallels how Toy Story 3 suckers fans to think they can accept this drivel without paying for it politically , aesthetically or spiritually . ”
The breathless run-on sentence that opens the paragraph is syntactically confused ; one of White ’s two parenthetical examples of “ hazards and cliffhangers ” is an unrelated point about characterization , and what exactly does the preposition “ their ” refer back to ?
Lots - O’- Huggin’ Bear
( White both gets the name wrong and tacks on an apostrophe that would be incorrect in any case ) is an emotionally warped and diabolically manipulative character ; to say that he embodies “ mundane insensitivity ” ( everyday thoughtlessness ? ) is just incredibly wide of the mark .
White ’s categorization of the franchise ’s “ narrative formula ” accurately describes the storytelling template , but he then pawns off this descriptive insight as an evaluative appraisal .
Yes , the story is based on a quest scenario — much like the majority of children ’s fantasy .
Another franchise where the characters “ journey from one place to another and back , again and again ” is the Indiana Jones series , which White ( a Spielberg enthusiast ) adored .
Again it ’s a question of intellectual consistency .
As for “ not digging the toys - come - to - life fantasy , ” should one take this as a tacit confession that White never gave the film a chance ?
But how would you then square this with his enthusiasm for Small Soldiers ( below ) ?
The Alice in Wonderland analogy is indefensibly incoherent .
The “ legendary ” line White quotes is from Chapter Two of Lewis Carroll ’s Through the Looking Glass , where it appears in an exchange between Alice and the Red Queen .
After running at high - speed to the point of collapse , Alice discovers that she is in exactly the same place as she started :
Alice looked round her in great surprise .
“ Why , I do believe we ’ve been under this tree the whole time !
Everything ’s just as it was ! ’ ”
“ Of course it is , ” said the Queen , “ What would you have it ? ” “ Well , in our country , ” said Alice , still panting a little , “ you ’d generally get to somewhere else — if you ran very fast for a long time , as we ’ve been doing . ”
“ A slow sort of country ! ’ said the Queen .
“ Now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place .
If you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! ”
“ I ’d rather not try , please ! ” said Alice .
That line manifests the impossible logic of a maddeningly illogical world .
How can
White possibly construe this as a “ therapeutic slogan ” ?
It suggests to me that he is far less familiar with the Carroll works than he pretends .
As for the criticism that Burton ’s film “ repeated narrative stasis without exercising that famous line ” — what could this mean ?
That Burton ’s stasis was static when it should have been dynamic ?
And what is the logical point of comparison in the final sentence ’s “ parallel ” between Burton ’s narrative structure and TS3 ’s refusal to challenge audience complacency ?
It seems completely apples and oranges to me .
Maybe there ’s an interesting insight buried there , but it ’s lost in White ’s sloppy prose .
Here are paragraphs four and five :
“ Look at the Barbie and Ken sequence where the sexually dubious male doll struts a chick - flick fashion show .
Since it serves the same time - keeping purpose as a chick - flick digression , it ’s not satirical .
We ’re meant to enjoy our susceptibility , not question it , as in Joe Dante ’s more challenging Small Soldiers .
Have shill - critics forgotten that movie ?
Do they mistake Toy Story 3 ’s opening day for 4th of July patriotism ?
“ When Toy Story 3 emulates the suspense of prison break and horror films , it becomes fitfully amusing ( more than can be said for WALL - E or Up ) but this humor depends on the recognition of worn - out toys which is no different from those lousy Shrek gags .
Only Big Baby , with one Keane eye and one lazy eye , and Mr. Potato Head ’s deconstruction into Dali ’s slip - sliding “ Persistence of Memory ” are worthy of mature delectation .
But these references do n’t meaningfully expand even when the story gets weepy .
The Toy Story franchise is n’t for children and adults , it ’s for non-thinking children and adults .
When a movie is this formulaic , it ’s no longer a toy because it does all the work for you .
It ’s a sap ’s story . ”
The fashion show sequence is most definitely satirical ; one could arguably find its satire witless or excessively broad , but to declare that it is not satire is descriptively inaccurate .
Nor is it a “ time - keeping ” digression but rather a narratively integrated episode in the final act ’s escape scenario .
And the connection
White makes between these two points is still more dubious — why ca n’t a narrative interlude be satirical ?
The comparison to Joe Dante ’s Small Soldiers is another self - defeating comparison .
In Dante ’s enjoyable and underrated film , a toy company is acquired by a conglomerate that specializes in Defense contracting .
Using microchips from missile guidance systems , the company creates a series of action figures with artificial intelligence who can fully interact with children .
Where TS3 is a tale about the “ secret life of toys ” who become inanimate whenever their owner plays with them , Small Soldiers is a wish - fulfillment fantasy about cutting - edge playthings , ones that come preprogrammed with their own narratives and personalities .
It ’s the latter who “ do all the work for you . ”
White ’s comparison gets it completely backwards .
And if Small Soldiers has a critique of commercial culture , it ’s that corporations should n’t be marketing violence and militarism to children — a critique that extends more logically to Transformers 2 than Toy Story 3 .
The opening sentence of the final paragraph is logically confused .
The generic parody in the third - act prison break has nothing to do with the cartoon cameos made by old toys — not only are these separate discourses , they barely overlap ( only one new character , Monkey with Tambourines , is introduced in the final act ) .
It ’s a total non sequitur .
The suggestion that Big Baby references the work of Barbara Keane seems like a stretch ; her eyes looks like perfectly average - sized doll eyes to me , nothing like Keane ’s waifs .
The Dali analogy is interesting ( the materialist inversion of softness and hardness is apt ) , though I ’m not sure this is really a “ reference . ”
( If the animators were referencing anything , I ’d think it was the facial disarticulations of late - period Picasso ) .
The rest of the review is comprised of empty invective .
There ’s an obligatory swipe at the “ shill critics ” who have praised the film .
In characteristic fashion , White rails against his colleagues en masse but does not substantively engage a specific argument by a specific writer .
Ultimately though , it ’s the swipes he takes at the audience that are most objectionably nasty : viewers who enjoyed TS3 are “ brainwashed , ” “ suckers , ” “ saps , ” and ( my personal favorite ) “ non-thinking children . ”
Take that , kids !
So where does this leave us ?
By my count there are about three declarative statements in this entire piece that are not categorically inaccurate .
The rest is a seething tissue of factual errors , self - negating examples , glaring elisions , logical inconsistencies , specious industrial analysis , mystifying rhetorical constructions and basic grammatical errors .
It speaks for itself .
As White ’s critical hero and much invoked “ mentor ” Pauline Kael once said in an interview , “ No one should trust any critic who does not take the art form he is writing about seriously enough to write a decent paragraph .
I simply do not trust the observations of people who write sloppily or in illiterate hyperbole . ”
Of course , all of these mistakes would be far less objectionable if they were n’t used to prop up some of the most misanthropic mudslinging that any “ professional ” reviewer has passed off as criticism since , well , the last outrageous thing Armond wrote .
Is White being sincere ?
I think so .
I think he sincerely despises his “ shill ” colleagues and the “ brainwashed ” audience .
I think he sincerely sees himself as a maverick outsider to the media establishment ( “ They do n’t see what I see , where I ’m coming from — they could n’t ” ) and that he is sincerely invested in this narcissistic fantasy to the exclusion of most everything else .
Reading
White , I am constantly reminded that the human intellect , which we often analogize to a courtroom judge dispassionately weighing arguments and evidence , actually operates much more like a lawyer - for - hire , rationalizing and enabling our emotional narratives .
What makes Armond ’s reviews perversely fascinating is that he is so obviously intelligent , yet this intelligence has been harnessed to the warped imperatives of an increasingly frustrated personality .
Where your average critical hack job is just banal , White ’s ability to disconnect the dots exerts a kind of bizarro brilliance .
Try to take any of his recent reviews as seriously as he insists and you ’ll find yourself , like Alice and the Red Queen , running in hermeneutic circles , getting nowhere fast .
It makes for mediocre criticism but lurid psychodrama .
Most readers enjoy critical controversy for its own sake and there ’s nothing necessarily wrong with that .
Spirited debate leavened with a little bit of vitriol is a guilty pleasure I would n’t begrudge anyone .
Personally I find
White ’s dependably combative stance emotionally exhausting , but I recognize that the polemic is a rhetorical form like any other , and I read him in the hope of gleaning substantive ideas .
Unfortunately , his work has yielded progressively diminishing returns .
His TS3 review contains practically nothing ( nothing ! ) in the way of analytical insight or emotional truth .
It ’s little more than a hate letter to humanity — ca n’t say I ’m surprised that humanity has been hating him right back .
But I have to object on principle to the movie - mad mobs who would like to see Armond banished from Rotten Tomatoes .
The anger they ’ve expressed may be perfectly justifiable , but their underlying insistence that critics affirm public taste is absurd and even ( I ’ll concede you this one , Armond ) fascistic .
It ’s about much more than the reviewer ’s freedom of expression .
It ’s about the reading public ’s right to access materials in an open - source culture .
I value the free exchange of ideas above and beyond the desire to see White punished for his antisocial agitation .
If Armond can be digitally deleted from a public forum , who ’s next ?
The Internet age must insist on its own civic virtues .
That said , I think White is only worth engaging if the response expresses more than the reader ’s indignation .
Where there is smoke , there is not necessarily fire .
One need n’t provide an exhaustive analysis like I ’ve attempted here ; this was really more of a one - off exercise .
But the above paragraphs on “ product placement , ” for example , could productively stand as an autonomous blog post .
In disagreeing with White on this point , I tried to provide my own take on a material issue raised by the film , one that has interest in and of itself .
If this scores Armond ’s review a few extra “ uniques , ” so be it .
We can afford to extend
White the generosity that he so stubbornly refuses everyone else .
After all , is n’t it easy to be kind knowing that the history books wo n’t ?

Because of privacy reasons information in regards to location and date have been omitted .
Here ’s the deal : I ’ve only recently become immersed in the hardcore scene , and because I feel I do n’t know the scene or the music well enough to give a fair and accurate depiction of each of these band ’s sounds , my most accurate means of conveying my experience , apart from a general description of the show , is through my photos , as well as those of photographer Nathan Congleton .
The show space was perfect .
Wide and open enough that you could see the stage from wherever you stood , but small enough so the room did n’t feel half - empty .
The selection of bands was great , ranging from a collection of younger , less established bands , to bands with a secure following , pretty much in that order .
As an outsider , I was intrigued to see the difference between the younger bands and the older bands , in regards to stage presence , confidence , and the crowd reaction they inspired , but this is something that applies to most genres of music .
It seems like a key part to becoming a successful hardcore band is writing lyrics striking and effective enough that fans can remember them and sing along , because as anyone will quickly realize at a show , hardcore is very much a crowd - inclusive kind of music .
The more that kids can sing along and become a part of the performance , the more they ’ll get into it , and the more effective your music will be .
As far as how to write the most effective lyrics , you should probably ask one of the guys from Ceremony .
One thing I ’ve noticed that ’s different about hardcore though ( and this applies to a certain extent to punk and metal as well ) , is the trend of having an overwhelming number of acts , in this case 6 , but in many cases , much more than that .
I can only imagine that this is a virtue of the shorter length of the average hardcore song as well as the shorter lifespan of the average hardcore band .
The bands , in the order that they played , are as follows : Results , True Life , Hardside ( same line up as Results minus one guitarist and with a different singer ) , Stick Together , Skin Like Iron ( who shares two members with Ceremony ) , and Ceremony .
A few key elements of the show before my little photo montage :
The drummer from Results and Hardside , who had been on tour for three weeks at this point , had been playing the entire tour with a broken foot .
And he did n’t just play , he fucking killed it .
This kind of dedication and guts is what continues to blow my mind about the hardcore scene .
I would definitely recommend keeping your eyes on this kid , he ’s got balls as big as my head .
Stick Together ’s singer Hoodrack ( also of War Hungry ) , on top of having a great presence and a good handle on what it means to be a frontman , is a funny , funny , son of a bitch , who tells the most random , tangential , but still pretty entertaining stories in the middle of sets .
Ask him how the ride down to Richmond went .
Ceremony ’s frontman is fucking nuts in the best way possible .
Period .
Here ’s some pictures :
Many , many thanks to those that put on the show , your spot is great .
Thanks also to the bands that work their dicks off so we can enjoy their music , and to Nathan Congleton for the great photos and for letting me use his bad ass fish - eye lense .

Building a life form in the laboratory - piece by piece from DNA building blocks - is as groundbreaking as it sounds .
And this is just what the American scientist , Dr Craig Venter , has announced on Thursday evening .
Dr Venter is the controversial scientist who famously developed a " short cut " for decoding the human genome a decade ago .
And the creation of his synthetic microbe is being compared with Dolly the sheep in genetics , and Microsoft 's operating system in computing .
" Synthetic life " is new science and a new technology rolled into one .
The aim is to create a whole new biological toolkit - organisms with artificially added DNA instructing them to exude cleaner oils , or novel drugs or vaccines .
Dr Venter has been promising this for years , and now that he has succeeded we 'll be hearing a lot about how he has " created life in the lab " .
It 's not quite that - not yet - but it 's close .
Dr Venter and his team built " Synthia " , as their new life form is nick - named by some , from snippets of DNA called " cassettes " .
But he is still relying on a naturally - occurring microbe to act as a host - with its own DNA stripped out .
Do n't misunderstand me .
What Dr Venter has done is incredible science .
I 've already heard it described as Nobel prize - winning , " landmark " , work .
But there is always an element of razzmatazz surrounding Dr Venter 's research that makes it harder to sift fact from hype .
It will certainly raise the profile of a whole new field of science Synthetic Biology - less than decade old .
Filming at the Royal Society this morning - where coincidentally they were hosting a meeting on Synthetic Biology , a portrait of Charles Darwin gazed down the corridor towards the library .
I wondered what he would make of the discussion among a couple of dozen of today 's brightest scientists and thinkers - gathered to ponder the latest in Synthetic Biology .
They are in no doubt that the potential is there for a new industrial revolution .
Dr Venter 's microbe is just the start .
Others will be inspired to build on it .
This is how Dr Venter sees his team 's success : " This is an important step we think , both scientifically and philosophically .
It 's certainly changed my views of the definitions of life and how life works . "
But just as Dr Venter unveiled his work , the critics lined up to call a halt .
There are calls for a moratorium until society can better understand the implications .
And even some of the scientists who work in the field have told me they worry that we lack the means to weigh up the risks such novel organisms might represent , once set loose in the real world .
They are by definition so new that we cannot simply compare them with the risky microbes and pathogens we know about .
The Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and western Florida Panhandle beaches affected by the oil spill are as different as Venice , Laguna and Solana beaches are from one another .
In years past , finding a good fit here was easy .
And perhaps it will be one day again .
But for now , visitors will have to navigate the effects of the spill , which often vary from day to day .
Beaches that have been touched by tar balls and oil from the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion that killed 11 men April 20 extend 550 miles , from the Texas coast to the Florida Panhandle .
It ’s almost impossible to say which beaches will be pristine by the time you are ready to take your vacation here because the situation is so changeable .
We can say that Grand Isle , La. , has been damaged .
We can say that others have been too but have managed to clean up .
For now .
When they do come back — and they will , given the resilience of the people — here ’s some of what will await you .

The fishing village of Grand Isle , La. , for instance , draws serious anglers who stay in its camps and unpretentious accommodations .
Casino hotels dominate the eastern end of Mississippi ’s beaches .
High - rise condos and pastel houses on stilts , music clubs and a couple of honky - tonks attract families and couples to Gulf Shores , Ala .
A little farther east are Florida ’s resorts , where water often is varying shades of green .
There ’s Pensacola Beach on skinny Santa Rosa Island ; Destin , which has seemingly every conceivable type of lodging , restaurant and activity ; Sandestin , with 1,800 houses , hotels and condos and four 18 - hole golf courses stretching over 2,400 acres from the Gulf front to Choctawatchee Bay ; the original planned beach community of cottages in Seaside , Fla. , praised by Britain ’s Prince Charles and copied the world over ; and busy spring break favorite Panama City at the eastern end of the panhandle .
About 90 % of the visitors drive here , but the rest fly in from all over the country — yes , even from California , some combining a beach stay with a few days in New Orleans .
In winter , Canadians , especially from Ontario , call Southeastern U.S. beaches their own .
As a native New Orleanian and a Florida State University alumna , I feel as though these places are part of my backyard .
Most notably , I ’ve seen Destin grow from two motels that fit its self - description as “ the luckiest fishing village in the world ” to a destination with 14,800 “ lodging units ” ( as travel industry folks call them ) that draw 4.5 million annual visitors and economic tourism - related activity of $ 1 billion .

Grand Isle , La .
No one comes to Grand Isle by accident .
About 50 miles due south of New Orleans , this fishing hamlet with fewer than 1,600 full - time residents is a 2 1/2 - hour drive to the end of the road at Barataria Bay and the Gulf of Mexico .
Only 7 1/2 miles long and a mile wide at its broadest point , Grand Isle is an angler ’s dream , with 280 species off its shore .
There are a few basic motels , rental houses ( most houses are built on stilts to protect them from hurricane surges ) , RV grounds and five restaurants .

Some avid anglers have second homes here ( locals call them camps , though some are fancy ) , and others enjoy the non-commercial beach and birding .
The only inhabited barrier island off Louisiana , Grand Isle is the focus of cameras when residents evacuate during a hurricane warning and during the summer tourist season , especially the annual Tarpon Rodeo the last weekend in July , one of the country ’s oldest and biggest competitive fishing events .
It often draws 20,000 or more visitors who descend on the island to play and angle for the silver game fish , which can weigh up to 200 pounds .
The dollars those visitors spend help locals make it through the slow winter season .
But not this year , when Grand Isle is most visible for the oil spill .
It has been a center for cleanup , with journalists covering the attempted cappings .
Four days before the rig explosion , I visited Grand Isle .
Jean Landry , director of the Nature Conservatory , showed us this birders ’ paradise , a 500 - mile flight from Mexico ’s Yucatán Peninsula for migratory birds in spring and fall .
That afternoon , birders were excitedly comparing their sightings in the woods .

The oil hit the island about a month after the explosion , washing onto the beach , drenching birds and turtles .
The government closed oyster beds and fishing grounds and swimming in the offshore waters .
Most events have been canceled , though a daylong Grand Isle Alive concert is scheduled for Saturday during what would have been the Tarpon Rodeo .
Performers include Three Dog Night , LeAnn Rimes and Little River Band ; the aim is to raise $ 1 million to rebuild fishing and tourism here .
Landry is hoping visitors will return in the fall to walk the nature trails , look for bald eagles in nearby Golden Meadow and Morgan City and see birds on their way south .
“ They really are our snowbirds , ” she said .

Biloxi , 90 minutes east of New Orleans , is at the far end of the 26 miles of Mississippi beaches .
New Orleans and its failed levees received most of the attention after Hurricane Katrina , but the Mississippi coast caught the brunt of the storm , which killed 236 and caused about $ 125 billion in damages .
Near Biloxi , beachfront cottages , shaded by oaks and magnolias , were ripped off their pilings .
Rebuilding continues .

There are a few casinos along the Mississippi coast , beginning in Bay St. Louis , less than an hour east of New Orleans , but Biloxi is casino central , with eight casinos and gambling revenue of $ 833 million in 2009 .
The 1,740 - room Beau Rivage , which underwent a $ 550 - million renovation after Katrina , is queen of the Mississippi coast .
Next to it is the 318 - room Hard Rock Hotel & Casino , originally scheduled to open three days after Hurricane Katrina ; it finally opened two years later and made headlines when Bret Michaels had his first post - brain hemorrhage performance on May 28 .
On Biloxi ’s back bay is the 32 - story , 1,000 - plus-room IP Casino Resort & Spa , where Wanda Sykes , Donna Summer , Billy Idol

and Larry the Cable Guy have upcoming dates .
The sand on the beaches along the Mississippi coast is white , but silt from barrier islands colors the water the shade of coffee with skim milk .

Western Florida
About 3 1/2 to four hours east of New Orleans , Perdido Key really is an extension of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach , Ala .
But once you cross the state line , the ambience changes .
It ’s quieter .
Pensacola Beach is 45 minutes to an hour farther east , has fewer than 3,000 full - time residents and is just a quarter - mile wide .
The biggest news in Pensacola Beach is the Margaritaville Beach Hotel , which opened at the end of June .
Singer - songwriter Jimmy Buffett joined the ownership of the $ 50 - million , 162 - room beachfront hotel this spring .

I walked in on opening night , admiring the open spaces overlooking the Gulf , the snazzily informal lobby restaurants where tables were filled and the exterior lap pool .
“ It ’s the best hotel on the beach now , ” Tommy Grice , a resident and business owner in Pensacola Beach , said on opening night .
Grice has lived here since he was 18 and does n’t want to imagine being elsewhere .
Millions of travelers who vacation on these Southeast beaches feel the same way .
Amanda Phillips , a New Orleanian whose family comes to Pensacola Beach in August every year , is one .
Ten will make the trek again this year , she said .

“ We usually spend our days at the beach and pool , so this year we are going to spend them by the pool , ” Phillips said .
“ It ’s all about being together by the water , chlorinated or salt , and enjoying each other . ”

MOSCOW — The 14 alleged spies deported from Russia and the U.S. remained out of public view over the weekend amid uncertainty over where they had been taken and how they would restart their lives .
Relatives said they heard brief reports from two participants in Friday 's spy swap , one of the largest since the Cold War , Russian media said .
Nuclear ...
Moscow communicated with a ring of alleged spies in America by encoding instructions in otherwise innocent - looking images on public websites .
It 's a process called steganography .
And it 's one of a slew of high - tech and time - tested methods that the deep - cover agents and their Russian handlers used to pass information – from private Wi-Fi networks to buried paper bags .
Steganography is simultaneously one of the oldest methods for secret communications , and one of the more advanced .
The process dates back to the fifth century B.C. , when the Greek tyrant Histiaeus shaved the head of one of his servants , tattooed a message on his head , and waited for his hair to grow back before sending the messenger out .
When the courier arrived , his head was shaved and the missive was read , giving information about upcoming Persian attacks .
Later on , secret inks were used on couriers ' backs .
Morse code messages were woven into a sweater that was worn by a courier .
As information went digital , steganography changed .
Messages could be hidden in the 1s and 0s of electronic files – pictures , audio , video , executables , whatever .
The hidden communications could even be slowly dribbled into the torrent of IP traffic .
Compression schemes – like JPEG for images or MP3 for audio – introduce errors into the files , making a message even easier to hide .
New colors or tones can be subtly added or removed , to cover up for the changes .
According to the FBI , the image above contains a hidden map of the Burlington , Vermont , airport .
Both before and after Sept. 11 , there were rumors in the media that al - Qaida had begun hiding messages in digital porn .
That speculation was never confirmed , as far as I can tell .
The accused Russian spy network started using steganography as early as 2005 , according to the Justice Department 's criminal complaint against the conspirators , unsealed yesterday in Manhattan .
In that year , law enforcement agents raided the home of one of the alleged spies .
There , they found a set of password - protected disks and a piece of paper , marked with " alt , " " control , " " e , " and a string of 27 characters .
When they used that as a password , the G - Men found a program that allowed the spies " to encrypt data , and then clandestinely to embed the data in images on publicly available websites . "
The G - Men also found a hard drive .
On it was an address book with website URLs , as well as the user 's web traffic history .
" These addresses , in turn , had links to other websites , " the complaint notes .
" Law - enforcement agents visited some of the referenced websites , and many others as well , and have downloaded images from them .
These images appear wholly unremarkable to the naked eye .
But these images ( and others ) have been analyzed using the Steganography Program .
As a result of this analysis , some of the images have been revealed as containing readable text files . "
These messages were used to arrange meetings , cash drops , deliveries of laptops and further information exchanges .
One of the steganographically hidden messages also directed the conspirators to use radiograms – a decades - old method to pass information , long discredited in spooky circles .
" The FBI must have been clapping its collective hands when it discovered the primitive radio techniques the Russians were using : high - speed ' burst transmissions , ' " writes SpyTalk 's Jeff Stein .
" The Cold War - era technique requires the sending party to record a coded Morse code message on a tape , then shoot it through the air in a millisecond .
They were easy picking for the FBI , once it knew where to listen . "
According to the FBI , bugs in the spies ' homes picked up “ the irregular electronic clicking sounds associated with the receipt of coded radio transmissions . "
" Likewise , you ’d think the Russians would have moved beyond buried paper bags to pay their agents .
Moscow Center did supply them with ATM cards , according to the FBI ’s affidavit .
But it also seems stuck with the old ways , " * SpyTalk *adds .
But maybe not .
“ METSOS secretly buried some of the money in upstate New York , ” the FBI affidavit says , referring to one of the defendants , “ and two years later , in 2006 , the Seattle Conspirators flew to New York and dug it up . ”

Plenty of parents try to instill their values in their children and shield the little ones from the perils and temptations of the outside world .
The mother and father in “ Dogtooth , ” a Greek festival - circuit conversation piece directed by Yorgos Lanthimos , present an extreme case of this kind of protectiveness .
Their idea of home schooling is to provide their children with daily tape - recorded vocabulary lessons , which would not be unusual if the definitions were less idiosyncratic .
The three kids  two daughters ( Aggeliki Papoulia as the elder , Mary Tsoni as the younger ) and a son ( Hristos Passalis )  are taught that “ excursion ” refers to a kind of flooring material and that a “ sea ” is a kind of armchair .
Odd .
Odder still is that the children , who have never been given names or left the grounds of the quiet , green family estate , appear to be in their late teens or early 20s .
Their father ( Christos Stergioglou ) is a factory manager , and he and his wife ( Michelle Valley ) have turned their home , its swimming pool and lush lawns surrounded by high wooden fences , into a sanctuary and prison for their dreamy offspring .
Those three wander about in their underwear , speak in monotones and seem perpetually on the verge of either incest or fratricide or both .
They think Frank Sinatra ’s version of “ Fly Me to the Moon ” is a recording of their grandfather sending out a message of paternal love and that ferocious cats who live beyond the gate have killed an invisible fourth sibling .
“ I ’m going to give birth to two children and a dog , ” their mother announces one night .
Then again , if her son and daughters behave themselves , they may be spared further human siblings .
The dog is nonnegotiable , though .
Are mom and dad conducting some kind of perverse behaviorist experiment ?
Are they determined to shelter the younger generation in a world gone mad ?
That protective impulse , you may or may not recall , was the motive for similar grown - up behavior in “ The Village , ” the preposterous M. Night Shyamalan shocker from 2004 .
“ Dogtooth ” supplies no such explanation and at times seems as much an exercise in perversity as an examination of it .
Mr. Lanthimos ’s ends may be obscure , but his means can be seductive .
The static wide - screen compositions are beautiful and strange , with the heads and limbs of the characters frequently cropped .
The light is gauzy and diffuse , helping to produce an atmosphere that is insistently and not always unpleasantly dreamlike .
You might think of paintings by Balthus or maybe Alex Katz , though the implied stories in those pictures are more genuinely evocative and haunting than the actual narrative of “ Dogtooth . ”
Have we reached the Facebook saturation point ?
That 's one possibility suggested by monthly growth data from Inside Facebook , which reports that Facebook gained only 320,000 new U.S. users in June after a blockbuster gain in May of more than 7.8 million .
Moreover , the net 's dominant social networking site lost active users in the 18 - 25 , 26 - 34 and 35 - 44 demographic ranges , while gaining users in their mid-teens and middle years .
One possibility is that the May and June controversies over Facebook 's privacy policies and dominance have kept the company from tremendous new growth and even led some to curtail their use .
Another possibility is that it 's just a statistical aberration , or a result of changes to the advertising system , where Inside Facebook says it gleans its numbers .
But there 's also the possibility that almost every American who has any interest in joining Facebook already has .
Facebook says it has about 125 million active U.S. accounts and is likely closing on half a billion accounts worldwide .
According to Inside Facebook , approximately 41 percent of Americans have Facebook accounts , a rate surpassed only by the U.K and Canada , which clock in at 44 percent and 48 percent , respectively .
What would peak - Facebook mean for the company ?
Certainly not irrelevance , since Facebook is now the second most visited site in the world after Google and is the largest photo - sharing site on the net .
However , it 's yet to prove that it can create a money - making machine like Google found in tiny search advertising tied to what users search for , not who they are .
Facebook 's ads , by contrast , are all about knowing what you are interested in , according to the data you tell it .
Advertisers have powerful ways to target ads at users .
One techie even created an ad specifically for his wife by targeting his ad at very select criteria – geography , degree , gender and interest .
As a private company , Facebook 's revenues are not publicly disclosed , but the company has confirmed that they are close to $ 1 billion .
That 's a pittance compared to Google 's $ 25 billion in annual revenue .
Investors , including Microsoft , have been valuing the company at $ 15 billion .
But if Facebook has hit its peak in terms of U.S. users , the company will have to turn its attention to finding ways to make money off the site , not just add more users .
It 's increasingly weaving itself into the fabric of the web , and it now seems odder to see a news story without a Facebook Like button than with one , even though that feature has only been around a few months .
The other problem with the possibility of hitting peak - Facebook ?
There 's only one way to go from there and that 's down .
Users are finicky , and Facebook could find itself caught in a battle of just trying to retain users who might jump ship to Google 's rumored new network or who just decide they are tired of maintaining a social networking profile .
Facebook did not immediate respond to an e-mail seeking comment .

Maneuvering through New York City as a person with cerebral palsy can be a constant irritation .
Just making my way down subway stairs at rush hour , with people breathing down my neck , is holy terror .
But it is not the physical strain of steps and crowds that is my main source of anxiety .
It is the naïve , inappropriate and sometimes downright mean comments that people make .
Because the umbilical cord was wrapped around my neck at birth , I have an awkward gait and slurred speech .
In the disability realm , mine are relatively minor .
I do n’t use assistance devices .
I have two master ’s degrees and have been a professor and poet for many years .
I am married ( to an able - bodied man ) and have one child ( also able - bodied ) .
Other than my inability to spell , I ’m a completely functioning , productive member of society .
Most people , however , have no experience with successful people with disabilities .
They are left to rely on the old stereotype that we are all sitting in our apartments alone collecting Social Security checks and watching soap operas — or should be .
People who would otherwise mind their manners feel they have carte blanche when it comes to commenting on my condition .
Bus riders have referred to me as mentally backward ( while I was reading James Joyce ) , and waitresses routinely ask my companion what I want to order .
In a club , once , an older man asked me to dance .
Upon hearing my voice , he commented to his friend , “ She ’s some kind of retard , ” and walked off .
Three times , I have been brushed off by the police when reporting suspicious behavior , like nearly being attacked by a homeless man .
Now , if I see something , I think twice before saying something , since probably no one will pay attention anyway .
Strangers routinely mistake me for a drunk or ask God to bless me .
The other day on the subway , while one man criticized my son for being too loud , another pointed out that I was disabled , so he should make an exception .
The problem is n’t exactly that people have these reactions .
The problem is that they have no tact .
It ’s as though they have some kind of disconnect and think I do n’t hear , or ca n’t process , their comments .
Sometimes I feel like screaming : “ Hello !
There ’s a human being in here .
And she ’s registering your stupidity . ”

Why are the hoppin’ - mad Teabaggers so oddly quiet these days , ever since the BP oil disaster ?
That ’s what Thomas Frank , author of What ’s The Matter With Kansas ?
asked last week in his column , “ Laissez - faire Meets The Oil Spill . ”
Ideologically , it ’s painfully obvious why the Teabaggers are now the Teagaggers : their free - market gospel got mugged by oil - drenched reality — a reality so horrific that even pollster Frank Luntz could n’t spin the BP disaster as the government ’s fault .
Best to just shut up when you ’re that wrong .
But there ’s another , more concrete reason why the Tea Party revolutionaries melted back into their suburbs as soon as the enormity of the Gulf spill disaster hit :
The Tea Party evolved out of the pro-offshore drilling astroturf movement in 2008 .
They even share some of the same organizers and front groups , from PR operative like Eric Odom , to advocacy groups like FreedomWorks , whose combined efforts on the “ Drill Here !
Drill now ! ” astroturf campaign succeeded in opening up all of America ’s coastlines and waters to offshore drilling , overturning a 27 - year ban thanks to threats of “ a Boston - style Tea Party , ” as one Republican put it in the summer of 2008 .
We have been following this movement from the beginning .
Back in February 2009 , on the eve of the first Tea Party protest , we published the first investigative article exposing the hidden relationship between the fake - “ spontaneous ” Tea Party protests that month , and the Republican machine that backed and promoted the campaign .
Our research led again and again to the right - wing Koch brothers , who are worth a combined $ 32 billion as owners of the largest private oil company in America , Koch Industries .
Koch - linked front groups like FreedomWorks and the Sam Adams Alliance ( named after the leader of the original Boston Tea Party ) played key roles in both the 2008 campaign to deregulate offshore drilling , and in the Tea Party movement .
Eric Odom , the PR flak who launched the Tea Party in February 2009 , is the same Eric Odom who in August 2008 organized Republican Twitter - mobs who crashed Capitol Hill chanting “ Drill here !
Drill now ! ” to force Congress to open up American coastlines to unrestricted offshore oil drilling .
Odom used the same Twitter front group , “ DontGo Movement , ” in both campaigns : Twittering the pro-offshore drilling mobs in 2008 and Twittering the first anti-Obama teabaggers in early 2009 .
Odom was listed as the “ New Media Coordinator ” for the Sam Adams Alliance until a few days before the very Tea Party Protest in 2009 .
If these organization names get confusing , then just remember this :
What really matters is the money behind them — namely , the billionaire Koch money .
Since we first broke the Koch - Tea Party links , other media and research outlets have confirmed the Kochs ’ key funding and organization role in the Tea Party campaign , as well as defeating climate change legislation and defeating health care reform .
The Kochs are the largest oil & gas contributors to the last few electoral campaigns , and their network of fronts and think tanks is daunting .
One Koch - linked front group is The Sam Adams Alliance , led by a longtime Koch aide named Eric O’Keefe .
Back in 1980 , when David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket , Eric O’Keefe served as the National Coordinator for Koch ’s Libertarian Party .
O’Keefe has been sucking on the Koch teat ever since — moving from the Libertarian Party to the Koch - funded Cato Institute , and finally , to the Sam Adams Alliance , where O’Keefe is the CEO .
At first the Kochs denied they were behind the Tea Party campaign , but by the end of 2009 , David Koch finally owned up and told an audience how he had planned and funded the Tea Party movement .
It ’s important to understand just how close the Tea Party campaign is tied to the campaign pushing for unlimited offshore drilling , because the media has consistently misunderstood and misrepresented the Tea Party movement at every step of the way , treating the Tea Party like a legitimate political movement , rather than what it really is : a well - funded and highly - manipulative PR campaign , paid for and led by right - wing billionaires looking to protect their riches from government regulators and taxes .
The Tea Party only exists as long as the Kochs need it to run ; once the billionaires ’ needs change , they ’ll close the account out and get onto other business , dumping all the suckers who volunteered their time and Ayn Rand - inspired placards until they ’re needed again sometime in the future .
To understand how this works , let ’s go back again to the summer of 2008 , the last time there were still restrictions on offshore oil drilling in America .
How did it happen that we lifted all offshore drilling restrictions less than two years ago ?
Strange to believe now , but two summers ago , drilling became the “ wedge issue ” for the presidential campaign , the way gay marriage was in 2004 .
In August 2008 , for reasons unclear at the time , nothing got the Republican base more quickly worked up for a fight than the fight to open up all of America ’s coasts and waters to all the drilling that Big Oil wanted .
Before it turned Tea Party , the pro-offshore drilling campaign was led by the disgraced Newt Gingrich , via his billionaire - sponsored foundation , American Solutions .
It was a pretty typical lobbying effort until August 1 , when the Republicans seemed to go off the handle , and a bunch of DC Beltway foundation trolls took to the streets threatening tea party revolt .
By mid-August 2008 , the Wall Street Journal asked , “ Why Does Offshore Drilling Dominate the Debate ? ” :
How on earth , in the middle of a war and an economic slowdown , did a handful of offshore oil rigs come to be the wedge issue of American politics ?
And make no mistake–new oil drilling is the wedge .
Republicans have shown 80 - 90 % support for any drilling proposal ; Democrats are equally opposed .
Bob Herbert in the NYT compares drilling ’s wool - over - the - eyes allure to the persistent belief in Iraqi involvement in Sept. 11 .
Offshore drilling has resuscitated [ sic ]
Newt Gingrich , and ruined Nancy Pelosi ’s summer .
It made Sen. Barack Obama , the “ agent of change , ” change his mind .
And it derailed the Straight Talk Express .
Suddenly , the entire election hinged on offshore drilling , and the Democrats got it in their heads that if they did n’t compromise , they ’d lose the 2008 election .
It must have seemed strange to them — the Republicans dragged America into two military defeats back - to - back , and left the economy destroyed on a scale not seen in almost a century .
But the Democrats were scared as they usually are , and by the end of September , both the House and Senate voted to lift the ban on offshore drilling for gas and oil .
Mike Huckabee jams to “ Drill Here Drill Now ” with Aaron Tippin
The last part of the campaign happened so fast , it seemed plausibly spontaneous and grassroots .
Before Odom and the Twitter mobs , the push for offshore drilling was much more traditional : several months of Newt Gingrich ’s backroom efforts and mailers and ads pushing for offshore oil drilling .
And then came the surprise : On August 1 , 2008 , Republicans staged a publicity stunt to take over the floor of the House just a few hours after lawmakers had voted to adjourn for their five - week summer break .
The Republicans said they were protesting Speaker Pelosi ’s decision to go home without voting on offshore drilling .
According to an AP report from the time :
Republicans occupied the House floor for a rare , and at times bizarre , protest against Democratic energy policies .
Unlike a normal session where the rules of decorum are strictly enforced , GOP lawmakers and their aides who filled the chamber clapped , chanted , gave standing ovations and booed the Democrats .
In a grand finale , lawmakers led a roomful of aides in a rendition of “ God Bless America ” and walked off to chants of “ USA , USA . ”
The event , said Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona , one of the organizers with Reps .
Mike Pence of Indiana and Tom Price of Georgia , was “ the equivalent of the Boston Tea Party over the energy issue . ”
Republicans are angry that Democrats blocked them from a vote on allowing more offshore oil drilling and increasing domestic oil supplies .
This was the launch of the first Tea Party .
And a key figure in the August campaign was Eric Odom , new media coordinator from the Koch - affiliated Sam Adams Alliance .
Odom also used DontGo Movement to twitter together “ grassroots ” supporters to back the Republican sit-in on August 1 .
Odom ’s job was to make it look like a spontaneous outburst of middle - class support was joining forces with the Republican politicians in Congress , who fused together in one great oil - drilling movement .
This way it would appear to out - of - touch Democrats that the pro-oil - drilling movement was really catching on with regular Americans angry at high gas prices , which they blamed on liberal eco-elitists in Washington , rather than on Bush ’s two lost wars , and the trashed American economy .
Twittering was new at the time ; and Odom ’s twitter - campaign worked better than anyone could have expected .
He launched his DontGo Movement on August 1 , and a few days later , it was already on CNN :
Conservative online activists launch ‘ DontGo ’ Web site Posted : August 5th , 2008 ( CNN ) – A group of conservative online activists launched a new Web site Tuesday to support a call by House Republicans to reconvene Congress and vote on an energy bill .
The site , dontgomovement.com , is intended to be a clearinghouse for information about a protest House Republicans began Friday soon after Congress adjourned for its August recess .
More than 1100 people have signed up for an e-mail distribution list associated with the site since a preliminary splash page for it went up on the Internet Monday , according to Eric Odom , one of the organizers behind dontgomovement.com .
From there , more Koch - connected groups piled in , including FreedomWorks , the lead Tea Party organizers .
In early August , FreedomWorks employees hit the Washington streets carrying signs reading , “ Drill ! Drill ! Drill ! ” telling reporters “ that most Americans support expanded domestic drilling . ”
Nan Swift , Campaign Coordinator for FreedomWorks , was so psyched about protesting for offshore oil drilling that day that she quickly posted a “ stay tuned ! ” announcement on the FreedomWorks site :
GAS PRICE PROTEST PROTEST
By Nan Swift on Aug 06 , 2008 On Tuesday FreedomWorks joined with area allies to counter MoveOn ’s demonstration for an “ Oil - Free Presidency . ”
Try Economy - Free .
At any rate , the whole write - up will be on up over at FreedomWorks.org soon as part of our weekly campaign update .
In the meantime , I wanted to make sure you got to see these great links to other people who wrote , took pictures , and great video .
Enjoy .
By late September , the pressure was too much for Pelosi to bear , and Congress caved to Nan Swift ’s “ Drill ! Drill ! ” protest .
The triumphant story of how the GOP forced Congress to “ Drill Here ! Drill Now ! ”
The campaign was a boon to Eric Odom and to FreedomWorks and gave them the know - how to run the bigger Tea Party campaign later .
Gingrich the public face of the “ Drill Here Drill Now ! ” campaign , was the only figure in that campaign who got mugged by reality : on September 23 , 2008 — the same day Gingrich published his pro-offshore drilling manifesto Drill Here , Drill Now , Pay Less — Republican heavyweights led by Vice President Dick Cheney were marching around Capitol Hill scaring members into passing a bill far more urgent than the offshore drilling bill championed by Newt , FreedomWorks , and the Koch brothers : the $ 700 billion Bush Bailout bill .
Just to refresh your memory , here ’s a quick excerpt from the Wall Street Journal that day :
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said top administration officials — Vice President Dick Cheney , White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and National Economic Council Director Keith Hennessey — were lobbying members of Congress Tuesday , including the House of Representative ’s conservative Republican Study Group .
The economic collapse and Bush - Cheney billionaire bailouts put Gingrich ’s big comeback on hold .
But ironically enough , the Bush - Cheney bailouts provided Bush - Cheney supporters something new to protest in 2009 : the Bush - Cheney bailouts now that President Obama claimed them as his own , and piled trillions more of his own bailouts on top of it .
For some reason , the story of how the Tea Party began as the Offshore - Drilling Party has been forgotten or ignored by the media .
But the people inside the movement sure know where the Tea Party started , and until the BP disaster , they were damn proud .
For example , a leader of the St. Louis Tea Party , Dana Loesch — known as the “ female Michael Savage ” by her Tea Party admirers — triumphantly recounted the oil - drilling beginnings of the Tea Party movement last year on Andrew Breitbart ’s Big Government site :
The Tea Party Movement : How We Got Here
by Dana Loesch Something curious happened during the summer of 2008 .
Democrats , led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi , shut down the House and C - SPAN cameras with a resolution that passed by just one vote , smack in the middle of an energy crisis .
Afterwards , Madame Speaker jetted off on a week - long book tour while gas prices soared .
The Republicans stood in the dark and refused to leave .
A few officials , including John Culberson , took out their phones and began Twittering the action to America , this spawning the #dontgo movement .
It was the first nudge to the hibernating conservative constituency who were excited about having something over which to be excited in their party .
Netroots activists seethed at the realization that Democrats left America in limbo rather than vote against reducing energy costs and drilling stateside – though the majority of the population approved of such .
They rallied around the legislators that had the brass to stay and urged them to “ Do n’t go ! ”
Taxpayer fury over these offenses grew to a shriek in February when Rick Santelli delivered his famous diatribe on the floor of the Chicago exchange .
The feelings of angry disenfranchisement felt by so many conservatives coalesced following Santelli ’s speech .
On February 19 , 2009 , the DontGo Movement morphed into the Tea Party thanks to the “ Tea Party Rant ” by CNBC ’s Rick Santelli , a self - described follower of Ayn Rand , who suffered a spaz attack on live television after hearing that President Obama was proposing bailout funds to non-billionaire Americans facing foreclosure .
Santelli was fine with the trillions in bailout funds wired to the Wall Street Galts whose shoes he shines for a living .
But when Obama offered a bailout of $ 75 billion in mortgage relief to middle - class Americans , Santelli had a freak - out .
Standing in the Chicago exchange floor with all of his derivatives - trading pals , the CNBC tool shouted that he and his casino traders were “ fed up ” and called for a “ Chicago Tea Party ” to protest the federal government ’s bailout of struggling homeowners .
“ This is America ! ” Santelli screamed , pointing to his rich derivatives - trading broker friends — who trade the same derivatives that brought down the American economy and pushed millions of Americans into foreclosure .
At the time , we called into question the “ spontaneity ” of Santelli ’s rant , seeing instead a typical “ launch event ” in a coordinated PR campaign designed to look spontaneous .
We also wrote about all the links between Santelli ’s rant , the fan -sites that popped up registered to various Republican fronts including Eric Odom , and further up the chain , familiar Republican free - market operatives , from Dick Armey ’s FreedomWorks to the Sam Adams Alliance , and Eric Odom ’s Twittering DontGo front .
Many of the instantly - activated sites promoting Santelli ’s rant that we traced were registered in Chicago — where Santelli , Eric Odom , and the Sam Adams Alliance were all based .
Within days of our expose , Santelli was forced to post an excruciating apology to President Obama on CNBC ’s , site , and he canceled his appearance on the Jon Stewart Show .
He ’s kept his tea to himself ever since .
The money link between the campaign for offshore drilling and the Tea Party campaign was the billionaire Koch brothers and their private oil behemoth , Koch Industries , America ’s second - largest private company and one of the country ’s worst oil polluters .
The Kochs had good reason to back both offshore drilling and the Tea Party movement , and then want to hush it all up after the BP spill : that ’s because Koch Industries has a history of horrific oil spills right here in America .
Greenpeace recently published a list of Koch Industries disasters , which reads like a crime dossier on deregulation .
Last year , for example , a Koch subsidiary was ordered to pay out half a billion dollars to fix environmental violations ; while a decade ago , in 2000 , Koch was fined for causing 300 spills and charted with releasing 91 tons of a known carcinogen from a Texas Refinery , leading to a $ 350 million fine ( which Bush Attorney General John Ashcroft discounted down to $ 20 million ) .
And just a few weeks ago , the Dallas Morning News reported that the EPA took over the licensing process from Texas for a Koch refinery , which is accused of gross violations of the Clean Air Act .
So let ’s go over this again : Not only was the Tea Party movement supported by oil industry money , especially Koch Industries , but it was organized by the same people who Tea Partied Congress into opening up America ’s coastline to unlimited oil drilling .
The Tea Party did that — they manipulated and frightened Washington into giving them all the pristine American coastline that a billionaire could ever dream of poisoning , and then some .
On top of that , the free - market advocacy groups at the center of the Tea Party movement are responsible for the systematic destruction of government regulation , which made a disaster like the Gulf spill inevitable .
So remember that when you look at the poisoned Gulf of Mexico , and the ruined beaches of Florida :
That ’s the Tea Party Vision turned into our reality .
The gang running the Tea Party movement has some direct responsibility for the catastrophe unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico , maybe more so than BP itself .
No wonder the Tea Party crowd is staying out of sight and hoping everyone ’s forgotten .
They ’ve been talking about dumping tea , but all along they ’ve been dumping oil , and now we ’re finding out just how “ maverick ” and “ anti-establishment ” their movement really is .
Keep this in mind the next time the mainstream media sucks up to the Teabaggers as some sort of “ authentic America ” anti-establishment movement : it was born in offshore oil drilling , and America is now dying from offshore drilling .

Sony Patents Suggest Non-split Screen Multiplayer Using Stereoscopic Technology
The technology would operate under the same principles as stereoscopic 3D , which displays two alternating images to the left and right eyes , but requires double the framerate of a 2D picture .
In this patent , Sony describes using this alternating to instead split the picture to two different players , instead of two different eyes .
It is possible that the effect would be a distinct scene for each player , eliminating the need for splitscreen .
The glasses detailed in the patents are LCD shutter glasses , similar to those used already , but would include attached headphones so that two separate audio feeds could be delivered to each player .
By doing so , two full experiences could be presented to different players using a single console and 3D capable display .
I do n't know if this is something for this generation , however , as Sony is already having some difficulty with image quality and framerate with some 3D games .
As for replacing splitscreen , each player 's rendered scene would be much larger than what it would be on a splitscreen , doubling the pixels needed to display fullscreen scenes for both players .
It is likely that image quality would suffer with current technology .
It is also unclear if the same issues affecting some 3D viewers would also affect viewers of this technology .
In any case , I 'm much more supportive of stereoscopic technology for this purpose than for 3D .

Christians Protesting At Pride
It 's not often that a post on a Christian blog makes me tear up .
A group of Christians got together last weekend and went to the pride parade in Chicago .
They were there to wave signs and make their presence known and expose the homos to message of Jesus Christ .
But unlike most self - identified Christians who show up at pride parades , these guys did n't come to condemn .
They came to apologize .
I spent the day at Chicago ’s Pride Parade .
Some friends and I , with The Marin Foundation , wore shirts with “ I ’m Sorry ” written on it .
We had signs that said , “ I ’m sorry that Christians judge you , ” “ I ’m sorry the way churches have treated you , ” “ I used to be a bible - banging homophobe , sorry . ”
We wanted to be an alternative Christian voice from the protestors that were there speaking hate into megaphones .
What I loved most about the day is when people “ got it . ”
I loved watching people ’s faces as they saw our shirts , read the signs , and looked back at us .
Responses were incredible .
Some people blew us kisses , some hugged us , some screamed thank you .
A couple ladies walked up and said we were the best thing they had seen all day .
I wish I had counted how many people hugged me .
One guy in particular softly said , “ Well , I forgive you . ”
Watching people recognize our apology brought me to tears many times .
It was reconciliation personified .
Then he got it .
He stopped dancing .
He looked at all of us standing there .
A look of utter seriousness came across his face .
And as the float passed us he jumped off of it and ran towards us .
In all his sweaty beautiful abs of steal , he hugged me and whispered , “ thank you . ”
Here 's the whole post .
I 'm almost afraid to dig into this story — the Marin foundation 's website is here — because I do n't want start clicking around only to discover that these guys came to pride to deliver the same old love - the - sinner - hate - the - sin message , only with a smiley face this time instead of a " God Hates Fags " sign .
More info and " I 'm sorry " t- shirts available at the " Love Is An Orientation " website .
If this catches on — if repentant Christian bigots start showing up at pride parades across the country and they do n't believe that being gay is a sin — these guys are gonna be the new PFLAG moms .
Thanks to Slog tipper Wayne .
UPDATE : It was too good to be true .
It 's the same old love - the - sinner / hate - the - sin bullshit in a brand new bag .
From God Hates Fags ... to God Hugs Fags — but
He 's still gonna send 'em to hell to be tormented by demons for all eternity unless they repent , blah blah blah .
It 's progress , I guess , but I doubt that guy in the underpants realizes just what he 's wrapping his arms around .

Washington ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday his plan to improve America 's education system includes charter schools , intense teacher education and parent involvement .
" Now , I know some argue that during a recession , we should focus solely on economic issues ... but education is an economic issue , if not the economic issue , of our time , " Obama said at the National Urban League 's 100th Anniversary Convention in Washington .
" We 've tolerated a status quo where America lags behind other nations . "
On the issue of higher education , he noted that America used to be first and is now 12th globally when it comes to college graduation rates .
Middle - schoolers continue to fall behind in math and science , and the income gap continues to widen between white and African - American students , he said .
" It 's essential that we put a college degree that 's in reach of everyone ( who ) wants it , " he said , adding that the college graduation rate needs to increase by 2020 .
He also noted that the federal government has increased scholarships and other loan money to achieve that goal , " so young people do n't graduate like Michelle and me with such big loan payments every month , " he noted to an applauding audience .
Obama said his administration wants to reform and strengthen historically black colleges and universities , but " even if we do all this good stuff for higher education , too many of our children see college as a distant dream because their education went off the rails long before they turned 18 , " he said .
He said he is challenging states to offer better early learning options so children can enter kindergarten ready to learn .
" Knowing colors , knowing shapes ... knowing how to sit still .
You gotta learn that , especially when you 're a boy , " he said smiling .
He acknowledged heavy criticism from civil rights groups about the education reform plans .
" Part ( of the criticism ) reflects a general resistance to change .... the status quo is not working , " he said .
" We 're lifting up quality for all our children ...
You can't win grants unless you 've got a plan to ... deal with schools that have been forgotten . "
The Obama education plan champions better teacher pay , but also asks for tangible results .
He noted that his sister is a teacher .
" I'm here because of great teachers , " he said .
" Teachers are the single most important factor in a child 's education from moment they step into the classroom .
I want higher salaries .
I want more support .
I want them to be trained like the professionals they are ... with rigorous residencies like doctors go through .
" I do n't want talented young people to say , ' I 'd love to teach , but I can't afford it . '
Instead of a culture where we 're always idolizing sports starts and celebrities , I want some teachers on the covers on some of those magazines , " he said .
The president has demanded accountability in his plan .
" As we applaud teachers for their hard work , we need to make sure we 're seeing results in the classroom , " he said .
" Let 's work with teachers to become more effective . "
If that does n't work , Obama said officials need to find the right teacher for that classroom .
" Our goal is n't to fire or to admonish teachers , it 's to provide accountability . "
Obama noted that the administration 's Race to the Top program has sparked 32 states to reform their education laws " before we even spent a dime , " he said .
" In each round we 've leveraged change across the country ... sown the seeds of achievement . "
He said the program is different from the No Child Left Behind reform that he said caused states to lower standards .
" They are now raising those standards back up partly because of Race to the Top , " he noted .
Obama said sometimes a school 's problems are so deep , they need a complete overhaul .
He said he 's challenging states to turn around 5,000 of the lowest - performing schools , and $ 4 billion has been earmarked for those schools .
" It 's not about labeling a troubled school as a failure , it 's about investing in that school 's future . "
" In some cases that means restarting the school under different management as a charter school , " he said .
" Some people do n't like charter schools ... but I want to give states and school districts the chance to try new things .
If charter schools does n't work , we 'll hold it accountable and shut it down . "
Obama called Race to the Top " the single most ambitious , meaningful reform effort we 've attempted in this country in generations .
We wo n't see results overnight .
...
It may take a decade for these changes to pay off . "
The last ingredient to Obama 's education reform effort is parent involvement .
But the president said children should take responsibility for their education , too .
" Parents are going to have to get more involved in their children 's education , " he said .
" Our kids need to understand nobody 's gonna hand them a future .
Education is n't something you just tip your head and they pour it in your ear .
You 've got to want it . "
Obama acknowledged that some families are dealing with unemployment , substance abuse and violence .
" I know the character of America 's young people .
I saw them volunteer on my campaign ... ask questions in town hall meetings and ... write me letters . "
Race to the Top is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to reward states for aggressively reforming their education systems .
The $ 4.35 billion is being awarded in two phases .
Tennessee and Delaware were the only two states to receive funds in the first round of the competition .
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia were selected as finalists this week to receive more than $ 3 billion in the second round of funding for the program .
The second - round finalists will travel to Washington in early August to present their plans to the reviewers who scored their applications , according to the Education Department .
The winners will be announced in September .
Not all of the finalists , however , will be awarded grants from the nearly $ 3.4 billion remaining in program , Education Secretary Arne Duncan said , adding that Obama has requested $ 1.35 billion for the program in the administration 's fiscal 2011 budget .
Tennessee received nearly $ 501 million , allowing the state and all 136 school districts to move forward in implementing comprehensive school reform plans over the next four years .
Delaware has received about $ 100 million .
The two states earned high marks for the commitment to reform from elected officials , teacher 's union leaders and business leaders .
Federal education officials said Delaware and Tennessee also have aggressive plans to improve teacher and principal evaluation and turn around their lowest - performing schools .
In addition , both states have put in place strong laws and policies to support their reform efforts .
Executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Thursday defended the investment bank ’s aggressive pursuit of billions of dollars in payments from American International Group Inc. in 2008 , which critics said added to the deep financial problems of the insurance giant and led to a $ 182 - billion federal bailout .
Goldman and AIG sparred over the value of mortgage bonds behind complex financial derivatives for more than a year before the government rescued AIG in September 2008 , executives from the two companies told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
And Goldman ’s later push to recover all the money it was owed by AIG on the derivatives , known as credit default swaps , eventually cost taxpayers billions of dollars , according to members of the commission , which spent Wednesday and Thursday examining the role of derivatives in the financial crisis .
“ You got 100 cents on the dollar and the only people who were out money were the American people , ” said Commissioner Brooksley Born .

As part of the bailout , the government took an 80 % ownership stake in AIG .
After the rescue , federal officials decided to pay Goldman the entire $ 13 billion it was owed by AIG on credit default swaps .
At the time , the swaps were worth about half their face value , said Bill Thomas , the commission ’s vice chairman .
“ The government paid 100 cents on the dollar for something that was going for 48 cents at the time , ” Thomas said .
But Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the company was not trying to gouge taxpayers .
“ All we were paid was what we were due under a contract , ” Viniar said .

Goldman had insurance for the money owed by AIG and would have received all it was owed had the government decided not to pay off AIG ’s debts , he said .
A representative from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a key player in the AIG bailout , called Goldman at one point to ask whether top executives would think about taking less than all that was owed , but there were no other conversations , Viniar said .
Federal officials , including former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson — a onetime Goldman chief executive — and current Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , who was head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , have been strongly criticized for not forcing Goldman and other large financial firms to take reduced payments to save taxpayers some money .
In all , AIG paid $ 62 billion to those counterparties , including financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch & Co. , France ’s Societe Generale and Germany ’s Deutsche Bank .

As the housing market collapsed , Goldman sought collateral payments from AIG for credit default swaps related to mortgage investments .
With the market drying up for mortgage investments , the two companies argued about the value of those investments and the amount of collateral due Goldman based on those values .
“ It seems like you guys are going in and being as aggressive as you can , ” commission Chairman Phil Angelides told Viniar .
Angelides questioned the reliability of Goldman ’s pricing data when it reduced the collateral it was seeking from AIG to $ 1.2 billion from $ 1.8 billion over six days in 2007 .
Viniar said Goldman did the best it could to value the investments in a difficult market .

“ It ’s not a science .
There is judgment involved , ” he said .

Guess Who Wants to Kill the Internet ?
by Maidhc Ó Cathail / June 30th , 2010
It would be hard to think of anyone who has done more to undermine American freedoms than Joseph Lieberman .
Since 9/11 , the Independent senator from Connecticut has introduced a raft of legislation in the name of the “ global war on terror ” which has steadily eroded constitutional rights .
If the United States looks increasingly like a police state , Senator Lieberman has to take much of the credit for it .
On October 11 , 2001 , exactly one month after 9/11 , Lieberman introduced S. 1534 , a bill to establish a Department of Homeland Security .
Since then , he has been the main mover behind such draconian legislation as the Protect America Act of 2007 , the Enemy Belligerent , Interrogation , Detention , and Prosecution Act of 2010 , and the proposed Terrorist Expatriation Act , which would revoke the citizenship of Americans suspected of terrorism .
And now the senator from Connecticut wants to kill the Internet .
According to the bill he recently proposed in the Senate , the entire global internet is to be claimed as a “ national asset ” of the United States .
If Congress passes the bill , the US President would be given the power to “ kill ” the internet in the event of a “ national cyber-emergency . ”
Supporters of the legislation say this is necessary to prevent a “ cyber 9/11 ″ – yet another myth from the fearmongers who brought us tales of “ Iraqi WMD ” and “ Iranian nukes . ”
Lieberman ’s concerns about the internet are not new .
The United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , which Lieberman chairs , released a report in 2008 titled “ Violent Islamist Extremism , The Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat . ”
The report claimed that groups like al - Qaeda use the internet to indoctrinate and recruit members , and to communicate with each other .
Immediately after the report was published , Lieberman asked Google , the parent company of You Tube , to “ immediately remove content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations . ”
That might sound like a reasonable request .
However , as far as Lieberman is concerned , Hamas , Hezbollah and even the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are terrorist organizations .
It ’s hardly surprising that Lieberman ’s views on what constitute terrorism parallel those of Tel Aviv .
As Mark Vogel , chairman of the largest pro-Israel Political Action Committee ( PAC ) in the United States , once said : “ Joe Lieberman , without exception , no conditions … is the No. 1 pro-Israel advocate and leader in Congress .
There is nobody who does more on behalf of Israel than Joe Lieberman . ”
Lieberman has been well - rewarded for his patriotism – to another country .
In the past six years , he has been the Senate ’s top recipient of political contributions from pro-Israel PACs with a staggering $ 1,226,956 .
But what is it that bothers Lieberman so much about the internet ?
Could it be that it allows ordinary Americans access to facts which reveal exactly what kind of “ friend ” Israel has been to its overgenerous benefactor ?
Facts which they have been denied by the pro-Israel mainstream media .
How much faith would American voters have in the likes of Lieberman , who claims that the Jewish state is their greatest ally , if they knew that Israeli agents planted firebombs in American installations in Egypt in 1954 in an attempt to undermine relations between Nasser and the United States ; that Israel murdered 34 American servicemen in a deliberate attack on the USS Liberty on June 8 , 1967 ; that Israeli espionage , most notably Jonathan Pollard ’s spying , has done tremendous damage to American interests ; that five Mossad agents were filming and celebrating as the Twin Towers collapsed on September 11 , 2001 ; that Tel Aviv and its accomplices in Washington were the source of the false pre-war intelligence on Iraq ; and about countless other examples of treachery ?
In his latest attempt to censor the internet , does Lieberman really want to protect the American people from imaginary cyber- terrorists ?
Or is he just trying to protect his treasonous cronies from the American people ?

The vitamin pill trade has been described as the very corporate $ 50bn food supplement industry by Ben Goldacre on the Bad Science blog .
Although there is some regulation of the industry , there will likely always be a way to promote unnecessary pills , powders , and liquids by making claims that do not withstand examination .
Personally , I think I would favour a bullshit box .
Note : not all supplements are unnecessary – just most of them .
The best person to tell you if a supplement is necessary is probably your GP or a registered dietitian .
You should take no more note of the comments of a random blogger than you would those of a media nutritionist .
I ’ve written before about food supplement manufacturers making untruthful and unsubstantiated claims ( for example Equazen and Healthspan ) .
The ASA have done a sterling job in policing the advertising claims of companies flogging supplements , but their remit only extends so far – and some companies have found ways to promote their products that are not within this remit .
One way is to enter into a relationship with a nutritionist .
It is not necessarily wrong for nutritionists to endorse particular supplement firms , but I think it is important that they are at all times transparent about such relationships .
Some of Patrick Holford ’s books include tips on where to buy supplements .
I have n’t read all of his books , but I can tell you that his H Factor book on homocysteine ( more here ) contains not only an advert for YorkTest , but also a directory of supplement companies .
The first entry in this directory is Higher Nature ( who are also high on the list of manufacturers in Holford ’s Optimum Nutrition for the Mind ) .
Patrick Holford “ acted as a consultant to Higher Nature for a number of years ” and his name used to be on some of the bottles of vitamin pills they sold .
As referred to in this post by Gimpy , if it ’s got Patrick ’s name on it , Patrick earns a royalty .
I cannot find the original article on Patrick ’s website , but the Wayback machine has copies of comments Patrick sent to Radio 4 here and here in Q&A format :
Q. Finally , will Mr Holford make clear any commercial relationship to any company past or present that promotes and manufacturers vitamin and mineral supplement pills , food intolerance tests or similar related products ?
A. “ If it ’s got my name on it , be a book or a supplement , I earn a royalty .
I do formulate my own supplements with the scientific experts at Biocare , whom I believe to be one of the best supplement companies in the UK , and for which I do receive royalties , however I do not simply direct people to take my supplements .
I explain , in my books , articles and on my website , what to look out for in supplements , how to make sure you are getting the right levels of the nutrients that the scientific evidence supports as beneficial .
I categorically am not in the business of simply persuading people to take supplements so that I can make money out of them , but advise supplements for many reasons which are apparent from articles on my website and in my books . ”
I congratulate Mr Holford on his openness and honesty in revealing that he earns a royalty from any supplement that carries his name .
In the interests of transparency , it might be worth including such information elsewhere – in the company directories that appear in his books , perhaps .
After all , I am sure that Patrick would agree that competing interests should be declared .
He is so keen on competing interests being declared , he thinks that even those interests that do not exist should be declared .
Perhaps I should write to Mr Holford and suggest the idea to him .

Editor 's Note :
The so - called Scopes Monkey Trial concluded on July 21 , 1925 , making this year the trial 's eighty - fifth anniversary .
HNN is pleased to present two articles , one by an evolutionary biologist , the other by a humanist , to mark the occasion .
On weekend mornings I get up at sunrise and run up the Box Springs Mountains .
Lately there has been a marine layer of clouds that lock in cold , moist air at lower elevations .
As I run up through the cloud layer I can feel the clouds dissipate and see them break up into a fine , particulate mist as the sun shines through , then I emerge into a warm , sunny day at higher elevations .
Since the valleys are completely obscured by the cloud layer , I can run along the crest line and imagine that I am in a remote wilderness , rather than on an island surrounded by suburbs .
Two Sundays ago , as I descended back into the clouds , I saw a man ahead of me wearing a black t- shirt with “ Science Rules ! ” printed on the back in bold , white letters .
I do n’t like to stop , but I could not resist asking about him or the t- shirt .
He explained that he was a member of the Skeptic Society and that they occasional met on Sunday mornings to take hikes together .
When I mentioned that I was an evolutionary biologist , he replied that , while he was a fan of science , he had problems with evolution .
That was the end of my run .
I asked him about his doubts and tried to answer his questions as we walked down together .
Answering all his questions was easy since they were mostly familiar —
“ If evolution is gradual , then why are species so distinct ? ” or “ How can a gradual process explain the origin of complex traits ? ”
A peculiar attribute of evolutionary biology is that , even though it is an arcane science , many people have opinions about it , much more so , I think , than any other science .
Why ?
The occasion of the eighty - fifth anniversary of the Scopes trial offers some basis for reflection on the peculiar status of evolution .
The trial was neither the beginning nor the end of the public debate over Darwin ’s theory .
We could place the beginning at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting that took place in Oxford in 1860 , where Thomas Huxley and Bishop Samuel Wilberforce squared off on a public debate of the newborn theory of evolution by natural selection .
The end of the debate is not in sight .
The Scopes trial instead stands out as a benchmark that adds an American flavor to the controversy , which is to blur the division between science and religion in the public classroom .
The near - term impact was for evolution to recede from science textbooks .
Evolution did not come back in force until the post - Sputnik era , when the U.S. enhanced science and math education .
This renaissance was short - lived and we have returned to the conditions that surrounded the Scopes trial .
So why is there such persistent controversy about evolution ?
At one level , we always hear that evolution is “ just a theory . ”
This descriptor reveals a misunderstanding of the word “ theory . ”
An unabridged dictionary offers several definitions of the word , with the appropriate one being dependent on context .
In colloquial use , theory means speculation , but when used by scientists it means something like the articulation of a general principle that unites a diversity of phenomena under a single explanatory framework , such as Newton ’s theory of universal gravitation .
Darwin ’s evolution by natural selection fulfills this goal .
But the source of skepticism cannot be this simple .
We all have heard of the theory of relativity , but we never see headlines like “ Relativity — fact or fiction ? ”
No one debates how the theory of relativity is taught in physics classes , nor is a physicist ever likely to bump into some stranger who expresses doubts about relativity .
Some argue that skepticism about evolution is instead a measure of the inadequacy of science education .
We can certainly do better in teaching science in our public schools , but this is not a good answer either , since all science can be better taught but no other area of science attracts such scrutiny .
A better answer , for which the Scopes trial is a symbol , is that the theory of evolution has been a consistent target of religiously motivated propaganda campaigns .
Two well - funded institutes — the Creation Science Institute and the Discovery Institute — are devoted to churning out anti-evolution literature .
The former arose in the 1960s and was built on “ creation science , ” while the latter arose to promote “ intelligent design ” after creation science was discredited by repeated court battles .
The Dover trial revealed that intelligent design is just thinly disguised creation science .
A product of the efforts of these institutes and those who support their views is that most people have heard dozens of times that there is something wrong with the theory of evolution , so it is natural to be skeptical about evolution .
The arguments against evolution have changed little over the decades .
A persistent favorite is the mystery of the origin of complex , seemingly perfect structures like the eye .
The argument today is very much the one made by Archdeacon William Paley in his Natural Theology ( 1802 ) , which is that when we see evidence of design in nature , then we also see evidence for the existence of the designer .
Now that the genetic basis of eye development is emerging from the fog , some have shifted instead to the mystery of the bacterial flagellum .
Otherwise , the argument is the same .
These arguments are reinforced by occasional scientists or philosophers and historians of science who argue that natural selection is the product of circular reasoning .
All of these arguments have been refuted , but they persist .
A consequence of the controversy is that every time I step in front of a lecture hall full of students , I can count on many of them being doubters of the theory .
It also means that evolutionary biologists will often encounter people who have thought about and are skeptical of evolution , so evolutionary biologists feel more of a need to explain themselves in a way than those who represent any other branch of science .
One response was to write books that counter the arguments against evolution , to little effect .
The bicentennial of Darwin ’s birth has brought on a different wave of books .
Evolutionary biologists are now more inclined to just write about evolution and to present it in a light that makes it more accessible to a general public .
We are all wondering who the silent majority really is and how to reach them .
Our hope is that some of them are skeptics who are willing to read a well - crafted presentation of science and evaluate its virtues with an open mind .
Some historians and philosophers have helped by articulating how evolution fits in to the development of science , but also by dealing with the relationship between science and religion as a topic for the humanities classroom , rather than the science classroom .
We need the help , so I encourage my colleagues in the humanities to expand these efforts .
HNN Special : The Scopes Trial at 85
Sega is bringing back its beloved Dreamcast this fall — or at least two of its more memorable games , in downloadable form — but what of its predecessor , the sometimes spectacular but relatively unsuccessful Sega Saturn ?
Sega has not forgotten it .

In fact , Sega is " thinking about ports of Saturn games " for future releases .
It has already ported a handful of Saturn era titles to the PlayStation 2 — Nights Into Dreams , Panzer Dragoon , Last Bronx , etc . — but it may abide fan wishes for more recent retro remakes .

" What we announced this time is a project where we will have consecutive releases of titles that were debuted on Dreamcast , " Sega producer Yosuke Okunari told Impress Watch , as translated by Andriasang .
" Separate from this , we 're of course thinking about ports of Saturn games .
It 's the same as how Sega Ages and Virtual Console were separate existences .
It 's not that we have no intention of porting Saturn titles , so please share your requests . "
We 've already made our selfish wishes for Sega 's next batch of downloadable Dreamcast games , but if they 're going to give us an inch , we 're going to take a yard .
So , let 's get this list started .

Rethinking Iran-Contra
The conventional view of the Iran - Contra scandal is that it covered the period 1985 - 86 , when President Ronald Reagan became concerned about the fate of American hostages in Lebanon and agreed to secretly sell weapons to Iran ’s Islamist government to gain its help in freeing the captives .
Email
Printer friendly Supposedly , the scheme went awry when White House aide Oliver North and other participants got carried away , including North ’s decision to divert profits from the arms sales to another one of Reagan ’s priorities , the Nicaraguan contra rebels whose CIA assistance had been cut off by Congress .
The Iran - Contra scandal was exposed in fall of 1986 after the shooting down of a North supply plane over Nicaragua and revelations in Lebanon of Reagan ’s arms sales to Iran .
A White House staff shake - up , including North ’s firing , and some wrist - slaps from Congress for Reagan ’s alleged inattention to details resolved the scandal , at least that was how Official Washington saw it .
The few dissenters who would n’t accept that tidy conclusion – such as Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh – were mocked and marginalized by the news media , including the Washington Post ( which ran an article concluding that Walsh ’s consistency in pursuing the scandal was “ so un- Washington ” and that he would depart as “ a perceived loser ” ) .
But an accumulating body of evidence suggests that the traditional view of Iran - Contra was mistaken , that this conventional understanding of the scandal was like starting a novel in the middle and assuming you ’re reading the opening chapter .
Indeed , it now appears clear that the Iran - Contra Affair began five years earlier in 1980 , with what has often been treated as a separate controversy , called the October Surprise case , dealing with alleged contacts between Reagan ’s presidential campaign and Iran .
In view of the latest evidence – and the crumbling of the long - running October Surprise cover - up – there appears to have been a single Iran - Contra narrative spanning the entire 12 years of the Reagan and Bush - 41 administration , and representing a much darker story .
And it was not simply a tale of Republican electoral skullduggery and treachery , but possibly even more troubling , a story of rogue CIA officers and Israel ’s Likud hardliners sabotaging a sitting U.S. president , Jimmy Carter .
Plus , with Washington ’s failure to get at the larger truth about the Iran - Contra Affair , crucial patterns were set : Republicans acted aggressively , Democrats behaved timidly , and the U.S. national news media was transformed from Watergate - era watchdogs , to lapdogs and finally to guard dogs protecting national security wrongdoing .
In that sense , the Iran - Contra / October Surprise scandal represented the missing link in a larger American political narrative covering the sweep of several decades , explaining how the United States shifted away from a nation grappling with epochal problems , from energy dependence and environmental degradation to bloated military budgets and an obsession with empire .
For all his shortcomings and half - measures , President Carter had begun promoting solar and other alternative energies ; he pushed conservation programs and worked to reduce the federal deficit ; and abroad , he advocated greater respect for human rights and pulled back from the imperial presidency .
More on point , he cashiered many of the freewheeling Cold Warriors of the CIA and demanded land - for - peace concessions from Israel .
Unacceptable Dangers Carter ’s potential second term presented unacceptable dangers to some powerful interests at home and overseas .
The CIA Old Boys ( whom legendary CIA officer Miles Copeland deemed “ the CIA within the CIA ” ) thought they understood the true national interests even if the lazy - minded public and weak - kneed politicians did n’t .
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Likud Party believed in a “ Greater Israel ” and were determined not to trade any more land conquered in the Six - Day War of 1967 for promises of peace with Palestinians and other Arabs .
In 1980 , Begin was still fuming over Carter ’s Camp David pressure on him to surrender the Sinai in exchange for a peace deal with Egypt .
In other words , the deep - seated concerns of many influential forces intersected in 1980 , all with a common desire to sink Carter ’s reelection campaign .
And the best way to do that was to undermine his efforts to gain the freedom of 52 American hostages then held in Iran .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The CIA / Likud Sinking of Jimmy Carter . ” ]
The secret relationships , born of the 1980 hostage dealings , created the framework for the Reagan administration ’s approval of Israel ’s clandestine arms shipments to Iran beginning immediately after Reagan took office in 1981 , just as the American hostages were finally released .
Those initial Israeli arms sales gradually evolved into the Iran - Contra weapons transfers .
Thus , when the Iran - Contra scandal surfaced in fall 1986 , the subsequent cover - up was not simply to protect Reagan from possible impeachment for violating the Arms Export Control Act and the congressional ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan contras , but from exposure of the even darker , earlier phase of the scandal , which would implicate Israel and the CIA .
In authorizing the first investigation of Iran - Contra , Reagan ’s Attorney General Edwin Meese set the chronological parameters as 1985 and 1986 .
Congressional inquiries also focused on that narrow time frame , despite indications that the scandal began earlier , such as the mystery of an Israeli - chartered arms flight that was shot down in July 1981 after straying into Soviet air space .
Only late in the Iran - Contra criminal investigation did Walsh and his investigative team begin suspecting that the only explanation for the futile arms - for - hostage dealings regarding Lebanon in 1985 - 86 – when each freed hostage was replaced by a new captive – was that the tripartite relationship of Iran - Israel - and - Reagan predated the Lebanese crisis , going back to 1980 .
That was one reason why Walsh ’s investigators asked George H.W. Bush ’s national security adviser ( and former CIA officer ) Donald Gregg about his possible role in delaying the release of the hostages in 1980 .
His denial was judged deceptive by an FBI polygrapher .
‘ People on High ’ Nicholas Veliotes , Reagan ’s assistant secretary of state for the Middle East , described his discovery of the earlier Iran connections after the Israeli plane went down in the Soviet Union in 1981 .
“ It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American - origin military equipment , ” Veliotes said in an interview with PBS Frontline .
In checking out the Israeli flight , Veliotes came to believe that the Reagan camp ’s dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 election .
“ It seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980 , as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration , ” Veliotes said .
“ And I understand some contacts were made at that time . ”
Though some two dozen witnesses – including senior Iranian officials and a wide range of other international players – have expanded on Veliotes ’s discovery , the pressure became overpowering in the final years of George H.W. Bush ’s presidency not to accept the obvious conclusions .
[ For details of the evidence , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
It was easier for all involved – surely the Republicans but also the Democrats and much of the Washington press corps – to discredit the corroborated 1980 allegations .
Taking the lead was the neoconservative New Republic .
In fall 1991 , as Congress was deliberating whether to conduct a full investigation of the October Surprise issue , Steven Emerson , a journalist with close ties to Likud , produced a cover story for The New Republic claiming to prove the allegations were a “ myth . ”
Newsweek published a matching cover story also attacking the October Surprise allegations .
The article , I was told , had been ordered up by executive editor Maynard Parker who was known inside Newsweek as a close ally of the CIA and an admirer of prominent neocon Elliott Abrams .
The two articles were influential in shaping Washington ’s conventional wisdom , but they were both based on a misreading of attendance documents at a London historical conference which William Casey had gone to in July 1980 .
The two publications put Casey at the conference on one key date – thus supposedly proving he could not have attended an alleged Madrid meeting with Iranian emissaries .
However , after the two stories appeared , follow - up interviews with conference participants , including historian Robert Dallek , conclusively showed that Casey was n’t at the conference until later .
Veteran journalist Craig Unger , who had worked on the Newsweek cover story , said the magazine knew the Casey alibi was bogus but still used it .
“ It was the most dishonest thing that I ’ve been through in my life in journalism , ” Unger later told me .
However , even though the Newsweek and New Republic stories had themselves been debunked , that did n’t stop other neoconservative - dominated publications , like the Wall Street Journal , from ladling out ridicule on anyone who dared take the October Surprise case seriously .
Peculiar Journalism Emerson also was a close friend of Michael Zeldin , the deputy chief counsel for the House task force that investigated the October Surprise issue in 1992 .
Though the task force had to jettison Emerson ’s bogus Casey alibi , House investigators told me Emerson frequently visited the task force ’s offices and advised Zeldin and others how to read the October Surprise evidence .
Subsequent examinations of Emerson ’s peculiar brand of journalism ( which invariably toed the Likud line and often demonized Muslims ) revealed that Emerson had financial ties to right - wing funders such as Richard Mellon Scaife and had hosted right - wing Israeli intelligence commander Yigal Carmon when Carmon came to Washington to lobby against Middle East peace talks .
In 1999 , a study of Emerson ’s history by John F. Sugg for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ’s magazine “ Extra ! ” quoted an Associated Press reporter who had worked with Emerson on a project as saying of Emerson and Carmon : “ I have no doubt these guys are working together . ”
The Jerusalem Post reported that Emerson has " close ties to Israeli intelligence . "
And “ Victor Ostrovsky , who defected from Israel 's Mossad intelligence agency and has written books disclosing its secrets , calls Emerson ‘ the horn ’ -- because he trumpets Mossad claims , ” Sugg reported .
Yet , the way Washington was working by the end of the 12 - year Reagan - Bush - 41 era , there was little interest in getting to the bottom of a difficult national security scandal .
The House task force simply applied some fantastical logic , such as claiming that because someone wrote down Casey ’s home phone number on another key date that proved he was at home , to conclude nothing had happened .
Between the House task force ’s finding of “ no credible evidence ” and the subsequent ridicule heaped on the allegations by major U.S. news outlets , the October Surprise case was cast aside as a “ conspiracy theory , ” which is how it is still categorized by Washington ’s insiders and by Wikipedia .
However , subsequent disclosures have revealed that a flood of new evidence incriminating the Republicans arrived at the House task force in its final weeks , in December 1992 , so much so that chief counsel Lawrence Barcella says he recommended that task force chairman , Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , extend the investigation for several months .
However , Barcella said Hamilton refused , citing procedural difficulties .
Instead , the incriminating evidence was simply kept from other task force members , and the investigation was shut down with a finding of Republican innocence .
It even appears that a late - arriving report from the Russian government about its own intelligence on the case – corroborating allegations of a Republican - Iranian deal – was not even shown to Hamilton , the chairman .
When questioned this year , Hamilton told me he had no recollection of ever seeing the Russian report ( though it was addressed to him ) and Barcella added that he did n’t “ recall whether I showed [ Hamilton ] the Russian report or not . ”
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Key October Surprise Evidence Hidden . ” ]
According to other recent interviews , dissent within the task force over some of the irrational arguments being used to clear the Republicans was suppressed by Hamilton and Barcella .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Tricky October Surprise Report . ” ]
In other words , Official Washington preferred to sweep this unpleasant scandal under the rug rather than confront the facts and their troubling implications .
Yet , with Reagan remaining a conservative icon and his anti-government policies still in vogue among millions of Americans – slashing taxes for the rich , weakening corporate regulations , rejecting alternative energy , and expanding the military budget – the lost history of this broader Iran - Contra scandal has turned out to be a case that what the country did n’t know did turn out to hurt it .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .

President Obama ’s supporters are divided over challenging his policies .
In 2009 , activists pretty much gave Obama a pass , feeling criticism was premature and that Democratic Party unity was needed to combat Republican obstructionism .
Some still argue that progressive critics weaken Democrats and embolden the right wing .
But holding self - identified “ progressive ” politicians like Barack Obama accountable for fulfilling campaign commitments actually improves the chances for progressive election victories , as it pressures Democrats to satisfy their base .
And as the critical midterm elections approach , ensuring this grassroots base is motivated and mobilizable by holding Obama and Congressional Democrats accountable is even more imperative .
In recent weeks , progressive criticism of President Obama over the BP oil spill , immigration reform , Afghanistan , his focus on deficit reduction and other issues has increased .
In response , many argue that Obama ’s critics on the left are weakening a President already under siege from Republicans , thereby increasing chances for conservative victories in November .
But recent history says otherwise
Progressives Pay Price for Silence
Let ’s quickly look at the previous two Democratic Presidents , Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
In both cases , progressive silence in the face of their betrayals weakened the left and boosted Republicans .
Although neither Carter nor Clinton identified as a “ progressive , ” both actively sought support from progressive constituencies like environmentalists , labor , women , and African - Americans ( Latinos were not yet a major progressive political force ) .
After Carter moved right following the 1978 elections ( if not earlier ) , he so alienated progressive supporters that they backed Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries .
Carter ’s rightward move also failed to enable him to maintain his conservative southern democratic base , paving the way for the Reagan Revolution in 1980 .
After winning the 1992 election , Bill Clinton decided to move to the right and abandon his “ Putting People First ” campaign agenda .
As I describe in The Activist ’s Handbook , environmentalists and other progressives failed to hold Clinton accountable for his broken promises , fearing that it would cost them “ access ” with the first Democratic Administration in over a decade .
The result ?
Republicans won control of the House in the 1994 elections , and from that point on Clinton governed as a “ triangulator ” rather than a Democratic seeking to respond to his party ’s base .
Onetime Clinton backers stayed away from the polls in droves in 1994 , undermining the hopes of Washington DC - based progressives who thought avoiding public criticism of Clinton would help keep his political base intact .
Instead , Clinton interpreted progressive silence as reason to ignore the grassroots , creating the political dynamic that led to the Gingrich Revolution of 1995 .
Failing to hold politicians accountable is a failed strategy .
It did not work under Clinton , and it clearly will not help Obama or the Democratic Party to get their 2008 backers to vote for Democrats in November .
Obama Responds to Progressive Criticism
When I wrote last December that activists were giving Obama a free pass , some responded that there was no evidence that the President would be positively impacted by criticism from the left .
Those still believing this should consider :
After public complaints from the AFL - CIO , Obama finally filled longstanding vacancies at the NLRB with pro-union recess appointees ;
After widespread progressive criticism , Obama renewed pressure for a new jobs bill , and a budget bill designed to aid state and local governments ;
Following criticism of the slow pace and moderate backgrounds of his judicial appointments , Obama appointed openly progressive Boalt Law Professor Goodwin Liu to the prestigious Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ;
In response to progressive criticism over his handling of the BP spill , Obama won $ 20 billion in compensation and renewed pressure to either pass climate change legislation or , if votes not there , to enact as much as possible administratively ;
After intense public criticism for not repealing Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell , Obama – who had done nothing on this issue until activists heightened the pressure – set in motion its repeal in December .
The list could go on and on .
And it does not include Obama ’s implementation of progressive policies without facing pressure to so act .
Progressive Failures
The flip side of the benefits of progressive criticism is that Obama has avoided “ change ” on issues where activists have been silent .
Three obvious examples :
Afghanistan :
Our military mission in Afghanistan appears more pointless if not counterproductive with each status report , and it drains funds that could be used to create jobs or bail out suffering states .
But key progressive constituencies fighting over budget issues are not publicly pressuring Obama over Afghanistan , so nothing will change .
Immigration Reform : Immigrant rights activists allowed Obama to delay progress through much of 2009 , and by the time they publicly criticized his inaction the political climate for comprehensive reform had worsened .
Whether activists could have gotten a bill introduced and passed had they demanded action earlier will never be known , but its clear that delaying public criticism of Obama for not moving on an issue where he made unambiguous campaign commitments to Latinos and unions brought no tangible benefits to either constituency .
Public Transit : Cutbacks in public transit are daily news stories across the United States , all while the President and environmental groups argue that the BP spill shows that Americans must be less car - dependent .
But how can people not drive cars everywhere if there are no alternatives ?
Enviros have rightfully praised Obama ’s commitment to high - speed rail , but the failure to pressure Obama to ensure that funding cuts at the state and local level does not eviscerate public transit has enabled these devastating cutbacks to ( quietly ) proceed .
If anyone has examples of Obama moving against progressives in response to their criticisms , send them over .
In the meantime , a President and Democratic Congress pressured to satisfy their base increases the prospects for a large voter turnout and progressive victories in November .

So , got me a copy of Starcraft II and I started playing with the campaign , which is nice and fun and is yet another quality Blizzard product .
When I finally got to the Hyperion , I was nearly floored when I got to Raynor 's flagship .
First thing I noticed when I went to the Armory was that the technician there , Swan , looked like a cross between a standard Terran future red-neck and a Dwarf : nice facial hair , short and stout , and a bitchin ' mechanical prosthesis for a left arm .
And then , the screen panned out ... Swan 's workshop is in " Bay 12 " !

White House Pushes For Warrantless Access To ISP Records
And expansion of heavily abused ' security letter ' system
While the two administrations certainly have their differences , the Obama administration is following the Bush administration 's lead on a number of fronts -- specifically in terms of surveillance and privacy in the digital age .
According to the Washington Post , the Obama camp is working to make it easier for the FBI to compel your ISP to turn over your online activity records without a court order " if agents deem the information relevant to a terrorism or intelligence investigation : " quote :
The administration wants to add just four words -- " electronic communication transactional records " -- to a list of items that the law says the FBI may demand without a judge 's approval .
Government lawyers say this category of information includes the addresses to which an Internet user sends e-mail ; the times and dates e-mail was sent and received ; and possibly a user 's browser history .
It does not include , the lawyers hasten to point out , the " content " of e-mail or other Internet communication .
Of course the problem has traditionally been that the FBI ( and major carriers ) Update : Amusingly , the Of course the problem has traditionally been that the FBI ( and major carriers ) have n't been particularly good at following the law , and the FBI has consistently faked terrorism emergencies to get access to whatever data they 're looking for .
As the Post notes , the government portrays these desired changes as technical clarification to resolve legal ambiguity , while privacy watchdogs and others note it 's simply an expansion of government power and extended use of " national security letters , " which have been abused extensively by both government and companies like AT&T. : Amusingly , the Los Angeles Times today is running a related piece discussing how the FBI is being investigated for agents cheating on a test designed to help them avoid the kind of privacy and wiretap abuse the agency has been repeatedly called out for in recent years .

SouthAmerica 6 recommendations Noah Vail Premium Member According to Candidate Barack Obama :
Senator Obama , once had this to say on the matter .
said by Senator Obama , Senate Floor , 12/15/05 :
Once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched , they are prohibited from telling anyone about it , and they are even prohibited from challenging this automatic gag order in court .
Even though judges have already found that similar restrictions violate the First Amendment - this Conference Report disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order .
If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice - you have to tell the FBI that you have done so .
This is unheard of - there is no such requirement in any other area of law , and I do n't see why it is justified here .
And if someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document - through library books they 've read and phone calls they 've made - this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law .
No judge will hear their plea , no jury will hear their case .
This is just plain wrong .

No judge will hear their plea , no jury will hear their case .
This is just plain wrong .
Senator Obama added these statements a couple of years later .
said by Senator Obama at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ; on August 1 , 2007 :
This Administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand .
I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom .
That means no more illegal wire - tapping of American citizens .
No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime .
No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war .
No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient .
That is not who we are .
And it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists .
The FISA court works .
The separation of powers works .
Our Constitution works .
We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers , and that justice is not arbitrary .
This Administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security .
It is not .

There are no short - cuts to protecting America
And then a year later , Senator Obama answered the following questions put to all the leading Presidential Candidates .
said by the Boston Globe questionnaire to Senator Obama :
Q : Does the president have inherent powers under the Constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants , regardless of federal statutes ?
A : The Supreme Court has never held that the president has such powers .
As president , I will follow existing law , and when it comes to U.S. citizens and residents , I will only authorize surveillance for national security purposes consistent with FISA and other federal statutes ....
Warrantless surveillance of American citizens , in defiance of FISA , is unlawful and unconstitutional .
Q : Under what circumstances , if any , would you sign a bill into law but also issue a signing statement reserving a constitutional right to bypass the law ?
A : ... While it is legitimate for a president to issue a signing statement to clarify his understanding of ambiguous provisions of statutes and to explain his view of how he intends to faithfully execute the law , it is a clear abuse of power to use such statements as a license to evade laws that the president does not like or as an end - run around provisions designed to foster accountability .
I will not use signing statements to nullify or undermine congressional instructions as enacted into law .
The problem with { the Bush} administration is that it has attached signing statements to legislation in an effort to change the meaning of the legislation , to avoid enforcing certain provisions of the legislation that the President does not like , and to raise implausible or dubious constitutional objections to the legislation .

It looks like the Obama Administration will continue the Bush era practice of using National Security Letters , and will use them to acquire that ISP data .
Senator Obama , once had this to say on the matter .
Senator Obama added these statements a couple of years later .
And then a year later , Senator Obama answered the following questions put to all the leading Presidential Candidates .
I admit to having some trouble reconciling Candidate Obama 's words with President Obama 's actions .

Well well well ..... I do n't like this at all .
However , I 'm wondering where are all the people that bashed Bush over warrant - less wiretapping .
Will they be at the same loud point bashing Obama over this ?

WORKERS IN the U.S. are still getting hammered by the worst economic slump since the Great Depression .
That 's something people in every state of the country understand all too well .
" It 's not like a hurricane loss or a drought or something that 's typically referred to as an 'act of God ' outside the control of the government , " said Nebraska Democratic Sen.
Ben Nelson .
Nelson was explaining why he voted alongside Republicans to try to block an extension of unemployment benefits .
That extension finally did pass in mid-July , in spite of Nelson and the Republicans -- seven weeks after the extra jobless benefits expired , cutting off a total of 2.5 million people who have been without work for longer than the standard 26 weeks for unemployment insurance .
The cost of the legislation is $ 34 billion - - a little over half the amount that the Senate approved for a war spending bill a few weeks earlier .
Nevertheless , Republicans and some Democrats fought the unemployment extension at every turn -- in the name of " fiscal responsibility . "
" Americans are frustrated with the amount of spending and borrowing around here , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) .
" Let 's not wave on through legislation that is going to worsen the deficit and dig an even deeper hole than we 're in . "
For millions of workers and their families , though , the " hole we 're in " is how to pay the bills when there 's no work to be found -- and the extension of jobless benefits that average just over $ 300 a week is little enough help as it is .
Actually , the bill to extend unemployment was even less help after Senate Democrats got done bargaining away several important provisions .
For example , they dropped badly needed funding for state Medicaid programs -- a compromise that will force state governments into more cuts from health care and other spending .
The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warned that dropping the extra Medicaid funding could ultimately lead to the loss of 900,000 public - and private - sector jobs .
The Democrats also sweetened the deal for Republicans by agreeing to cut a $ 25 - a - week increase in benefits allocated in previous bills extending unemployment .
SOME 15 million people are unemployed , according to official figures , and at least that many are involuntarily working part time because they can't find full - time work , or have dropped out of the workforce altogether in despair at ever finding a job .
So why are the politicians so slow to act ?
Public opinion is n't stopping them .
A recent USA Today / Gallup poll reported that 60 percent of people support " additional government spending to create jobs and stimulate the economy . "
A National Employment Law Project survey found that 74 percent agreed with the statement , " With unemployment close to 10 percent and millions still out of work , it is too early to start cutting back benefits and health coverage for workers who lost their jobs . "
Yes , Republicans have continued to pursue their strategy of obstructing every Democratic initiative .
But the problem in Washington is n't just the intransigence of the GOP , but the commitment of the Obama administration and the leadership of the Democratic Party to many of the same neoliberal dogmas and policies of the past .
Obama and the Democrats passed one big economic stimulus package in their first months in power in 2009 - - not as large or as directed at creating jobs as many supporters had hoped , but nevertheless the biggest such measure since the Great Depression .
But since then , the talk has turned steadily to austerity , austerity and more austerity .
Obama himself promised a spending freeze at most government agencies -- not the Pentagon , of course -- for the next three years , and in June , White House budget officials ordered departments to cut 5 percent from their budgets .
Democrats in Congress let several proposals -- a summer job program for teenagers , aid to states to prevent layoffs of teachers , expansion of funding for Pell Grants -- die on the vine at the first whiff of Republican opposition .
With even mainstream economists warning of the threat of a double - dip recession , the Obama administration -- like governments around the advanced world -- is carrying out policies that are the exact opposite of what 's needed .
As it is , the effects of last year 's federal stimulus were drastically undercut by the scale of spending cuts at the state and local level .
If the Democrats were serious about their ritual talk of creating jobs , millions of people could be put to work rebuilding the country 's crumbling infrastructure -- roads , bridges , transit systems and schools .
Those jobs would be certain to pay a living wage if the minimum wage was raised to keep up with years of inflation -- and millions of the working poor could be helped as well .
Rather than bailouts for bankers and more tax breaks for corporations , the government could reverse the cuts in programs that poor and working people depend on .
And while we 're at it , let 's talk about strengthening , not slashing , Social Security to make up for the massive decline in pensions that workers used to receive -- and in retirement savings that vanished during the financial crisis of 2008 - 09 .
UNFORTUNATELY , THE labor movement and liberal organizations have put up very little opposition to the Obama administration 's many disappointments .
But
one positive sign for putting forward an alternative agenda is the plans for an October 2 national march in Washington , D.C .
The AFL - CIO has joined with the NAACP , 1199 SEIU , National Council of La Raza and many other organizations for a demonstration to demand " jobs , economic security , comprehensive immigration reform , a safe and renewable energy policy and a reversal of national priorities from making wars to meeting human needs . "
George Gresham , president of 1199 SEIU , called the planned rally a " massive - - and we believe historic -- march . "
At the group 's convention in early July , NAACP President Ben Jealous announced that the purpose of the march on Washington was to show " that the majority of this nation is ready and willing to fight back and ensure that all of the change we voted for is a reality for all of our children . "
In addition , the United Auto Workers and Rev. Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow PUSH are uniting for a campaign for jobs that will be kicked off at a march on August 28 in Detroit , on the anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his " I Have a Dream " speech .
Detroit was the site of the " Freedom Walk , " a march of 125,000 that King led several months before the March on Washington .
The Detroit event will call for an end to the ongoing U.S. wars in the Middle East and redirect the war budget to rebuilding in the U.S. Organizers say the campaign will focus on foreclosures and call for a moratorium on " the practice that forces hard - working Americans from their homes while at the same time bailing out Wall Street executives and paying them million - dollar bonuses . "
History tells us that the most important social changes -- reforms that improved the lives of working people and expanded democracy and freedom - - did n't come about because of proposals in Washington , but because working people organized and struggled for them .
The spirit of solidarity that we build today -- in our unions , workplaces , schools and communities , in movements to save our schools in California or stop foreclosures in Boston -- will be the basis for a real fight for jobs , and ultimately for real economic justice .

I did indeed let the boy loose with our in - need - of - replacing Canon PowerShot in the Dallas Cityscapes exhibit at NorthPark Center Saturday .
We walked right past it at first -- it 's tucked away inside the old Robb & Stucky next to Barneys on the second floor .
But once in , well , sure , it was worth the eight bucks in admission -- the American Airlines Center - Victory Park reproduction in the front window , though , is by far the most impressive creation , and you can peek it without paying .
( The boy enjoyed , most of all , the trough of LEGOs available for building in the " construction area . " )
The whole exhibit , a fund - raiser for the East Dallas Community School , is not entirely brand - new : Sean Kenney 's Thanks - Giving Square has been making the rounds for years following its completion in September 2007 .
And while he dug the DART train circling ' round Union Station , the 6 - year - old who lives in my house said upon exiting , " It 's not nearly as good as the trains . "
There are a few more photos on the other side , though not enough to give away the entirety of what 's what -- it 's worth a look - see .
Flickr user Chris Jagers was there on Saturday as well and took some pretty nice pics too , especially of Old Red .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Anne Danielsen Aunan kunne verken lese eller skrive da hun gikk ut av skolen .
Hun var en av 400 000 nordmenn som leser for dårlig til å fungere i hverdagslivet .
Skjult problem Å klare å lese om bivirkningene på medisinen , skrive i meldeboka til barnet sitt eller fylle ut et skjema for å melde sykkelen stjålet , er noe alle trenger å kunne .
Men så mange som 15 prosent av nordmenn mellom 16 og 65 år kan ikke det .
De har gått gjennom barne - og ungdomsskolen uten å lære å lese og skrive godt nok til å fungere i samfunnet .
Og de fleste av dem forsøker å skjule problemene .
- 400 000 voksne har så dårlige leseferdigheter at de ikke kan være aktive deltakere i samfunnet .
Det er både et personlig problem og et problem for demokratiet , sier førsteamanuensis på Lesesenteret ved Universitetet i Stavanger , Egil Gabrielsen .
Hann mener det er et samfunnsansvar å informere denne gruppen om at de har rettigheter , og å motivere dem til å søke hjelp .
- Lesekravene øker sakte , men sikkert , både i arbeidslivet og i samfunnet ellers .
Det var nok lettere å leve med dårlige leseferdigheter for tjue år siden , sier Gabrielsen .
Mangler tilbud I 2000 vedtok Stortinget at alle lesesvake voksne har krav på ny skolegang .
De skal få den opplæringa de ikke fikk da de gikk på skolen .
Men nesten ingen voksne har fått fornyet grunnopplæring .
- Halvparten av kommunene her i landet har ikke det lovpålagte opplæringstilbudet til voksne , og de som har det informerer dårlig om det , sier Gabrielsen .
Heller ikke alle fylkeskommunene følger opp kravet til å gi dem som trenger det , videregående opplæring .
I internasjonale leseundersøkelser viser at Norge har så mange som 400 000 voksne på det laveste kunnskapsnivået .
- Samfunnet vårt blir stadig mer leseintensivt og det er mer alvorlig å ikke kunne lese her i landet , enn i for eksempel Chile .
Det er ikke noe poeng i å gi folk skriftlig informasjon , hvis de ikke skjønner hva som står der , sier Gabrielsen .
Han er bekymret over at så mange voksne lever med problemene , uten å få hjelp .
- For mange skyldes problemene at de ikke fikk tilstrekkelig hjelp i løpet av skolegangen , og da er det riktig at de har rett til å få opplæring i voksen alder .
Men i
Norge er man flinke til å lage regler og rettigheter , men er dessverre ikke like flinke til å følge opp , sier Gabrielsen .
Lærte å lese selv
Etter ungdomsskolen turde ikke Anne Danielsen Aunan å gå mer på skole .
I ni år hadde hun sittet i klasserommet uten å lære .
Hun forstod hva som skulle gjennomgås , men trengte lengre tid enn de andre .
Det fikk hun ikke .
- Jeg hadde mange « hull » i kunnskapene , sier hun .
17 år gammel fikk hun jobb som praktikant i en barnehage , og der lærte hun å lese .
- Jeg leste for barna .
Barnebøker med få ord og mange bilder .
Jeg stavet meg gjennom ord for ord , og barna brydde seg ikke om at det gikk litt seint , sier Anne Danielsen .
Tung prosess
Etter det turde hun igjen å begynne på skolen .
Hun tok barnepleie , artium og etter mange år , vernepleien .
Hun ble 35 år før hun fikk diagnosen dysleksi .
- Det var da jeg fikk fem i norsk muntlig , og stryk i skriftlig at jeg skjønte at jeg hadde dysleksi , sier hun .
Etter diagnosen fikk hun selvtillit på at også hun kunne klare en høyere utdanning .
Men det var ikke lett å få NAV med på det .
- Jeg fikk avslag på avslag , men til slutt fikk jeg den støtten jeg trengte for å kunne ta vernepleien på høyskolen , sier hun .
I dag jobber hun som vernepleier , og er glad for at hun orket å ta kampen .
- Jeg lever et godt liv som dyslektiker .
Jeg har mange gode hjelpere , og er åpen om vansken , sier hun .
Flaut Anne skjønner at mange voksne har problemer med å sette seg bak skolepulten igjen .
- Det var så flaut å gi det jeg hadde skrevet direkte til læreren .
Jeg visste jo at det var masse feil der , sier hun .
LESEFERDIGHETER
Den internasjonale leseundersøkelsen International Adult Literacy Survey ( IALS ) har fem ferdighetsnivåer , hvor nivå 1 utgjør de mest grunnleggende leseferdigheter og nivå 5 er det som normalt kreves for akademiske arbeid .
Nivå 3 antas å være minstekravet for leseferdigheter for å kunne fungere i dagens informasjonssamfunn .
Testen måler funksjonelle leseferdigheter på tre skalaer :
Prosaskalaen ser på evnen til å forstå og anvende informasjon fra sammenhengende tester .
Dokumentskalaen består av ikke - sammenhengbare tekster der informasjonen er organisert i tabeller , blanketter eller skjemaer .
Kvantitative skalaen inneholder regneoppgaver av varierende vanskelighetsgrad med utgangspunkt i tall som inngår i prosa- eller dokumenttekster .
Kravene nedenfor er for prosaskalen .
Nivå 1
Leseren skal finne en enkel opplysning i teksten som er identisk eller synonym med den opplysningen det spørres etter .
Et sannsynlig , men galt svar ( distraktor ) står ikke i nærheten av det riktige svaret .
Nivå 2
Leseren skal finne fram til en eller flere opplysninger i en tekst hvor evt .
distraktorer kan være til stede eller hvor det kreves enkle logiske slutninger .
Nivå 3
Leseren må finne fram til informasjon på grunnlag av enkle logiske slutninger eller opplysninger som tilfredsstiller bestemte betingelser .
Nivå 4
Leseren må sammenlikne flere egenskaper ved opplysninger eller avgi flere svar hvor de etterspurte opplysningene bare kan identifiseres gjennom tekstbaserte logiske slutninger .
Nivå 5
Leseren må lete etter opplysninger i en fortettet tekst som inneholder flere plausible , men avledende opplysninger .
Logiske slutninger på høyt nivå og bruk av fagspråk .
I dag er hun aktiv i Dyseleksi Molde , og mener det er viktig å være åpen om lese - og skrivevanskene .
- Man må tørre å snakke om det , sier hun .
Hun skriver ikke så ofte for hånd , men bruker den bærbare datamaskinen sin .
- Jeg får mannen min til å skrive bursdagskort , sier hun .
Skjemaveldet
En rapport fra Riksrevisjonen slakter skoletilbudet til voksne , og finner i en undersøkelse at myndighetene ikke følger opp avgjørelsen om å gi ny grunnopplæring .
« Riksrevisjonens undersøkelse viser vesentlige svakheter i myndighetenes arbeid med å gi voksne et slikt tilbud » .
- Man må være flink til å lese og skrive for å klare å søke om å få hjelp til å lære å lese og skrive , sier Marianne Grønner , generalsekretær i Dysleksi Norge .
- For å få grunnopplæring som voksen må man fylle ut skjemaer .
NAV skriver så tungt at de med lese - og skrivevansker ikke klarer å forstå skjemaene .
De går glipp av mye informasjon , og mister mange rettigheter .
Å be om hjelp til å forst å er heller ikke lett .
Lese - og skrivevansker for voksne er en skambelagt vanske , sier Grønner .
Frykter skolen I tillegg er det mange som ikke orker tanken på å sette seg bak en skolepult igjen .
- Mange voksne skjuler at de har lese - og skrivevansker .
En undersøkelse viste at blant de aller svakeste leserne var det under halvparten som innså at de hadde et problem , sier Gabrielsen .
Svake lesere skjuler problemet med å unngå å lese og skrive .
Hvis de blir bedt om å lese noe høyt kan de si : « Jeg har glemt brillene » , eller « jeg har ikke penn » .
I en ny doktorgrad som heter « Dysleksi og selvoppfatning » viser det seg at mange med dysleksi ikke er motivert for å lære .
De har møtt så mange nederlag at de ikke har tro på at de kan klare noe .
- De fleste voksne med dysleksi har negative erfaringer fra skolen , og ønsker seg ikke tilbake dit , sier Grønner .
Fjerner støtten I revidert nasjonalbudsjett mister dyslektikere rett til økonomisk støtte for å kjøpe datautstyr .
Regjeringa mener at dette har blitt så billig at det har folk råd til å kjøpe selv .
Tilskuddet i dag utgjør 3 350 kroner for bærbar - PC og og 1 850 kroner til stasjonær .
Dysleksi Norge er bekymret over konsekvensene av vedtaket .
- Det viktigste hjelpemiddelet for barn og voksne med dysleksi er datamaskinen .
Når regjeringa nå har valgt å fjerne støtten til den vil det gå ut over mange , sier Grønner .
- Det er ofte flere dyslektikere i en familie , og familier med lav inntekt har ikke råd til å kjøpe bærbare datamaskiner selv , sier Grønner .
We are named after Ella Baker , a brilliant , black hero of the civil rights movement .
Following in her footsteps , we organize with Black , Brown , and low - income people to shift resources away from prisons and punishment , and towards opportunities that make our communities safe , healthy , and strong .

The quiz show first aired in the UK on 4 September 1998
The British firm that created the quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ? has won a multi-million pound legal battle against Disney over unpaid profits .
A Los Angeles jury awarded Celador $ 269 m ( £ 177 m ) after ruling it failed to get a fair share of profits from screenings of the show in the US .
Celador chairman Paul Smith described the verdict as " justice " after an eight - year " David and Goliath " fight .
The Walt Disney Company said it would " aggressively " seek to reverse it .
The jury agreed that Disney 's Buena Vista Television and ABC had breached an agreement that entitled Celador to half of the profits .
The quiz was a huge success when it first aired in the US in 1999 , boosting audience ratings .
We were determined and we were not going to give up Paul Smith , Celador chairman
But Celador , a production company , went to court claiming it had been cut out of profits agreed in its contract .
Mr Smith said the case came down to competing interpretations of that contract .
" It 's been eight years - two years of trying to settle it out of court and then six years in court , " he said .
" It 's a very daunting prospect .
Disney is an absolute giant and we are a tiny little minnow .
" I do n't think they believed a small , independent producer would go after them and indeed be so determined .
" We were determined and we were not going to give up . "
Mr Smith said he screamed when he first learned of the verdict via e-mail from his lawyer .
He added : " As they say , justice has been done .
It 's money to which we were entitled .
We 've had to wait eight years for it . "
' Fundamentally wrong '
Celador lawyer Roman Silberfeld said the quiz , first hosted by Regis Philbin , became a big hit for Disney - owned US network ABC .
" At a time when ABC was ranked last among the networks and desperately needed a hit , it entered into an agreement with Celador to put Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?
on the air and share the profits of success - if there was success - with Celador 50 - 50 , " he said .
It put the network in first place , allowing them to charge more in ad revenues , the lawyer said .
Celador sold its TV division more than three years ago and now concentrates on films , radio stations and theatre productions .
The Walt Disney Company said it believed the court 's decision was " fundamentally wrong " and it would " aggressively seek to have it reversed " .
Britain 's oldest ironmongers is beaten by the recession ( and B&Q ) and closes after 480 years
It survived the English Civil War , two world wars , two depressions and three recessions , but after 480 years Britain 's oldest hardware store is finally having to hang up its pots and pans .
King Henry VIII was on the throne when Gill & Co became the country 's first ironmongers in Oxford in 1530 .
The independent shop has been in business ever since , trading six days - a - week through the reigns of 20 monarchs and 76 prime ministers .
Hard times : Michael Read , 62 , store manager at Gill & Co , Britain 's oldest ironmongers .
The store has been serving Oxford residents for almost 500 years but is having to close next month
Sign of the times :
It has been open since 1530 but the recession and large DIY stores have spelled the end for the ironmonger
But the shop has become the latest victim of the global recession and will close its doors for the final time next month when the current lease on the building runs out .
Gill & Co's owner Victor Hunt , 48 , today blamed the recession and larger chains like B&Q and Homebase for the store 's demise .
He said : ' Gill 's is the oldest ironmonger 's in England , so we are coming to the end of an era .
' Sales have declined in recent years and we are moving out before we start to lose money .
' Our client base is the over - 45s and some customers are considerably older than that .
Inevitably , as time goes by , we lose a few .
' The younger customers seem happier these days to drive to B&Q and other out - of - town stores .
' It is such a shame that the shop must close but unfortunately that is the climate small businesses are facing now . '
Gill &
Co originally provided ironware for the local residents when it opened its doors almost half - a- millennium ago , and through the centuries it it has stocked chimney sweep brushes , scythes , iron nails and hay rakes .
Prime time : Gill &
Co in 1912 during its heyday before the two world wars .
The shop has operated from a number of buildings in Oxford before moving to its current location in the High Street 50 years ago
The shop has operated from a number of buildings in Oxford before moving to its current location in the High Street 50 years ago .
It has added a lot of everyday household items in a bid to compete with the larger chains .
But Mr Hunt , who bought the store ten years ago and also runs a hardware store in Chipping Norton , said that despite the changes customer numbers had gradually fallen .
' A lot of independent stores in Oxford have closed and the city is now full of clothes shops and cafés .
Oxford is full of multiples now , which means it ends up offering the same as any other city . '
Graham Jones , of Oxford High Street Association , said : ' Gill 's is an Oxford institution .
It is a loss not just to the High Street but to the whole of the city centre .
' A lot of the handymen who work for the colleges go in there and they will definitely miss it . '
Michael Read , 62 , who has worked at the shop for the past seven years , is one of the three staff to lose their jobs .
He said : ' I 'm being made redundant , which is quite tough at my age .
All the customers seem very sad to hear we are closing .
It 's a sad loss . '
The American Distilling Institute announced that it ’s bringing its annual ADI Conference and Vending Expo to Portland , Oregon , April 4 - 8th , 2011 .
The event will be held at McMenamins Edgefield Distillery with sponsorship from Rogue .
In a press conference held at the Green Dragon ( one of Rogue ’s brew / distill pubs ) , Jack Joyce , founder of Rogue , talked about the vision of Oregon becoming a fermentation capital of the US with craft beer , wine and spirit making .
At the heart of this drive is the notion that legalizing home distillation is a key to the future of the craft distilling industry , and that he felt Oregon could be a place where such legislation could take place .
Bill Owens , the founder of the American Distilling Institute , and co-author of The Art of Distilling Whiskey and Other Spirits : An Enthusiast ’s Guide to the Artisan Distilling of Potent Potables
, spoke about the growth in micro-distilling in the US ( defined as distillers who produce 65,000 proof gallons ore less per year ) .
In 1993 , Owens visited 60 US micro-distillers when starting the ADI ; in 2010 , that number has grown to over 200 .
Owen ’s remarked on the explosive growth of micro-distillers in Portland , including Distillery Row , a growing collection of craft micro-distillers making their mark nationally as one reason for moving the conference from Kentucky to Oregon .
Beyond Oregon ,
Owen ’s talked about large growth in craft distilling of whiskey in Texas and the south , including Georgia and the Carolinas , with an increasing number of illegal moonshine operations getting their federal licenses and becoming legitimate micro-distillers .
The 2011 American Distilling Institute Conference and Expo will span a week of activities in Portland including 6 restaurant spirit paring dinners , a bus tour of local distilleries and Distillery Row , a trade show with over 250 distilling - related vendors , a pitch and putt invitational on Edgefield ’s golf range , and a “ meet the spirit maker ” evening which will be open to the public .
The event is expected to draw 300 - 400 people from across the country including many notable micro-distillers .
The theme of the 2011 conference is “ Rum & Brandy – Sugar & fruit ”

Fast Foreword
The first thing you should know about the Legend of the Rocket Car is that it 's been around longer than most people think .
It started years ago , as a vague rumor passed from one guy to the next by word of mouth , usually in bars or during lunch - break bullshit sessions .
The kind of story someone hears from a friend who read it in a magazine a long time ago .
It 's a story that comes out of nowhere , gets passed around for a while , then dies out .
And whenever it flickers back to life , it seems to spread like a grass fire .
I used to think it was funny how it managed to spread so fast purely by word of mouth , but now that it 's become a subject of Internet interest , its popularity is downright spooky .
If you 've never heard the legend before , here are the bare bones of it :
Once upon a time , in some out - of - the - way part of the country ( take your pick of locations ) , a maniac took a rocket of some sort and mounted it on the back of a car ( make and model depend on the automotive trends when the story is told ) .
The maniac then sped down a deserted stretch of highway , and when he reached an appropriate spot , lit the rocket ( which was either a JATO bottle , a surplus ICBM engine , or an experimental shuttle booster ) .
The car reached an incredible speed in a matter of seconds ( somewhere between 150 miles per hour and warp 9 ) at which point the brakes and steering became ... ineffective .
This development would 've been bad enough on a straightaway , but through some error in planning or navigation , the maniac found himself hurtling toward a sharp curve .
When the car hit the curve , pilot and car flew like an arrow ( for a distance limited only by the imagination of the person telling the story ) , before crashing into an inconveniently placed mountainside .
Nifty .
I do n't have much interest in urban legends .
I only pay attention to the rocket car story because I 'm 99 percent sure I started the whole thing .
I 'm sure this sounds pretty ridiculous if it's the first time you 've heard the Legend of the Rocket Car , but that 's because I did n't go out of my way to make it sound good .
Most people try to make the story convincing , embellishing it with all sorts of facts and details to make it easier to swallow .
I 've personally heard a dozen versions over the past 20 years , and I 'm amazed at how the story grows , shrinks , and generally mutates with each retelling .
I 'm sure I notice these changes more than most people .
I 'm not a car expert or an aerospace engineer or anything , and I really do n't have much interest in urban legends .
Even if I did , from an intellectual point of view , this story is n't as entertaining as some of the others that have come and gone .
The one about McDonald 's shoveling worms into the grinders that produce Big Macs , for instance , beats it by a mile .
I only pay attention to the rocket car legend because I 'm 99 percent sure that I started the whole thing in the spring of 1978 .
Now , before you draw any conclusions , I do n't want you to get the impression that I , myself , claim to be the maniac who drove the rocket car into the wild blue yonder .
I 'm saying I was probably responsible for the rumor , not that I actually performed the test flight .
As far as I know , the flight in question never happened .
Like all legends , some basics of the story are true , but once the tale started circulating , the truth was lost in the embellishments .
If the Legend of the Rocket Car survives , my great - grandchildren will probably end up talking about a guy from Lunartown who nailed an antimatter pod onto an old Apollo moonrover and flew into the side of Tycho Crater .
That 's how it goes with legends .
But like I said , I 'm not a rocket scientist or a motorhead .
I 'm a high school biology teacher .
And the fact that I 'm a biology teacher is relevant to the extent that it 's responsible for my writing this story down .
Two years ago , a week or so before Thanksgiving , I was taking my class through some of the particulars of evolution ( " How human beings were raised from monkeys , " as one of my students phrased it ) .
We were discussing Charles Darwin and The Origin of Species when one of my students asked me how Darwin 's research ship ever got the name HMS Beagle .
Since I 've been teaching this subject for 11 years , it 's rare when a student asks a question I can't answer .
But this one was a real pisser .
Anyone who 's ever taught in a classroom knows that sometimes you get a student who likes to play Stump the Teacher - a kid who asks questions he does n't really care about , just to see if he can find a gap in the teacher 's knowledge .
Usually these questions are pretty easy to evade or ignore , but sometimes one will catch my interest .
This was one of the latter .
So I told the student I had no idea where the ship 's name came from , but I 'd find out .
Ha .
I could n't find the answer anywhere .
My reference books concerned themselves with headier subjects - the Scopes trial , genetic mutations - than the name of Darwin 's boat .
I looked through every book I could find , but came up dry .
After exhausting all my research options , I was thinking about conceding this particular round of Stump the Teacher when one of my kids asked if I 'd looked for the information on the World Wide Web .
I said , " Of course I looked there .
It 's the first thing I checked .
Go play in traffic . "
Truth be told , I not only had n't checked the Web , I did n't know how to check it .
In addition to being a non-rocket scientist , I 'm not ( or at least I was n't ) very interested in computers or the Internet in 1998 .
I know this is a shameful thing for a teacher to say , but it 's true .
I kept meaning to take a look at the Internet - connected computers in the school library , just to see what all the hoo - ha was about , but I simply had n't gotten around to it .
So the next day I went to the library during my free period and asked the librarian for help , feeling like Crocodile Dundee asking how to work the bidet .
The librarian had obviously dealt with the situation before .
She gave me her 10 - minute " Internet for Stupid Teachers " course , and as soon as she left me alone with Netscape and a search engine , I typed " Darwin " in the space provided .
When the results of my search started filling the screen , the first thing I noticed was that there were more than 2 million sites listed as Darwin - related .
The second thing I noticed was that none of them seemed to pertain to Charles Darwin , the most famous naturalist in history .
Instead , they all seemed to focus on the Darwin Award , an honor ( posthumously ) bestowed on people who 've done the most good for humanity by removing themselves from the communal gene pool .
This was my very first encounter with the story of the rocket car in writing - a description of a 1995 Darwin Award winner .
The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve ....
It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO unit ( or Jet Assisted Take - Off ) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra " push " for taking off from short airfields .
He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long , straight stretch of road .
Then he attached the JATO unit to his car , jumped in , got up some speed , and fired off the JATO !
The facts as best could be determined are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site .
This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt .
The Impala quickly reached speeds well in excess of 350 mph and continued at full power for an additional 20 to 25 seconds .
The soon - to - be - pilot experienced g- forces usually reserved for dogfighting F - 14 jocks under full afterburners .
The automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.6 miles ( 15 to 20 seconds ) before the driver applied the brakes , completely melting them , blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface .
The vehicle became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles and impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock .
Most of the driver 's remains were not recoverable ; however , small fragments of bone , teeth , and hair were extracted from the crater , and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel .
As I said earlier , I 'd heard plenty of stories like this .
But the Darwin Award version was different .
It was chock - full of numbers and specifics , which is always bad news for a legend .
Oh , initially it might make the story more believable , but throwing in a lot of facts and figures also gives the nonbelievers plenty of details they can use to refute the story .
In the case of the Darwin Award version , I 'm surprised that anyone , anywhere , believed the story well enough to repeat it .
Ask yourself this , for instance :
If this story is true , why has nobody ever produced pictures of the crash site ?
And how about the unfortunate " pilot " ?
Nobody was ever able to attach a name to this person ?
If you want to explain these questions away by blaming human error or police indifference or whatever , that 's OK .
But if you look at the physics of the story , you 'll see that the whole pile of bullshit is impossible , regardless of the human angle .
For instance , when the Chevy left the road with its rocket still going full blast , why did it go in a straight line ?
Mount a big rocket on a ' 67 Chevy and it may go straight as long as it's on the ground .
But once it got airborne , the weight of the engine would immediately pull the nose down .
And if the JATO was still blazing away , the car would drill itself into the ground like a tent spike before it got 50 feet from the ignition site .
But the real question about this insane tale is simpler than all that .
The real question is , How did such a story ever get started in the first place ?
Just Desert
When my friends and I set out to build the vehicle we test - fired in the spring of 1978 , a real - life , jet - powered , road - traveling car was exactly what we had in mind .
Craig Breedlove was busy breaking land speed records in the Spirit of America , Evel Knievel had graduated from " biker " to " payload " while attempting to jump the Snake River Canyon a few years earlier .
And rocket - powered vehicles were a pretty popular notion .
Unfortunately , machines like those required a lot of time and money and engineering skill to build and operate .
My friends and I had none of the above .
In 1978 , I was 22 years old and still living with my parents , in a place I wo n't specify except to say it was somewhere in the desert .
My father owned a scrapyard , 22 acres of barren scrub ideally suited to having junk thrown on it .
To be brutally honest , the main yard looked like a cross between Sanford and Son and Apocalypse Now .
The yard was a salvage smorgasbord , covered with everything from dead water heaters to junked airplane cockpits .
And since we lived near a major US Army storage facility , a lot of the scrap my father bought and sold came from government auctions .
He would go to the auctions held at the post from time to time , bid on pre-marked lots of God - only - knew - what , then send me out the next day with the big flatbed to collect his latest purchase .
Plenty of people who went to these auctions ended up with nothing more than tons of unusable junk that was worth less than they paid for it .
The lots for sale were usually measured by the ton , and if a lot had a few items you were interested in , you had to buy the whole mess .
But my dad always seemed to find the lots that contained valuable stuff .
He also knew plenty of people who owned military surplus stores and had some idea of what was in demand and what was n't .
Still , he ended up with an amazing amount of unusable military surplus , things like gas masks and vehicle parts that were worthless in the civilian world .
And from time to time , we also ended up with weapons .
No , we never bought a pile of crap and ended up with a crate full of M - 16s or a Shrike missile .
But every once in a while we did end up with stuff we were n't supposed to have .
The army had a very strict policy toward scrap dealers who found munitions :
You had to give them back .
No two ways about it .
Before even being allowed to place a bid , dealers at an auction were required to sign several forms , one of which stated that they 'd return any " explosive , ordnance , fuse , detonator , or other chemically viable part or assembly of a weapons system . "
I remember that paragraph well , since it 's the only part of the army red tape that ever directly pertained to me .
The penalties for noncompliance outlined at the end of the paragraph sounded pretty scary ( five - figure fines , possible imprisonment , et cetera ) , and were enough to make my dad return the smoke grenades I once found in a crate marked HEATER ASSEMBLY , though not the blank M - 60 rounds he'd found once himself .
These he judged too trivial to warrant a drive to the base , and he kept them as decoration draped over a file cabinet in his office .
Of course I 'm telling you this because it's how I managed to get hold of the JATO bottle we used for our rocket car .
Actually there were four of them , each one lying in its own long , hay - filled crate with BARREL ASSEMBLY stenciled on the side .
Even though I did n't know what the hell they were at first glance , I knew they were n't barrels for anything .
The JATO bottles were round metal cylinders about 4 feet long , and less than a foot in diameter .
Painted on the sides in red were the words M - 23 JET ASSEMBLY UNIT .
And rather than the sort of valve assembly you 'd see on a gas cylinder , the ends of the bottles had an inverted funnel shape to them , with a rubber plug at the funnel 's bottom .
They were obviously rockets of some sort .
And judging from their weight - it took two people to even budge the things - they were still full of something .
Beck must have spent the rest of the night staggering around town , looking for a donor to contribute some hardware to our cause .
I decided I had to call Jimmy .
Jimmy and I met in the third grade ( or thereabouts ) , and were best friends for most of our growing up .
His family lived just down the street , and his father ran an auto - body shop in town .
On more than one occasion Jimmy 's dad and my own traded parts or services , and our families were pretty close .
But while I went to work for my father after graduating high school , Jimmy went to college to study mechanical engineering .
He had a natural talent for figuring out things in the physical world , though he was never much good at putting them into practice .
The campus where Jimmy took classes was almost 150 miles away , so he spent his weekdays in a rented room and only came home on the weekends .
Since I found the JATOs on a Wednesday , I had three days before I could show them to Jimmy .
More than enough time for me to cook up the idea of the rocket car .
As a matter of fact , as soon as I realized what that dull metal cylinder represented , I thought about attaching it to a car and taking a jet - propelled ride .
The principle seemed simple enough .
Nail the rocket onto one of the junkers in my dad 's field , point it down a straight stretch of road , and light the mother up .
When Jimmy came over to the house on Saturday morning , we drove to the yard and I showed him the rocket .
He immediately knew what it was , or at least what it seemed to be : a solid - fuel rocket , the kind they 'd used in Vietnam to give cargo planes a kick in the ass when they needed to take off from short runways .
Very simple , very straightforward .
Also very dangerous .
I described the idea of the rocket car to Jimmy , and at first he was pretty enthusiastic .
But after thinking the thing over for a while , he made me promise I would n't actually do anything with the JATO until he had time to check a few things out .
The following weekend , we sat down at his kitchen table and Jimmy explained precisely why the car would n't work .
The main problem was control .
The JATO bottle would produce something like 2,500 pounds of thrust ( albeit for a very short time ) , which sounded like more than enough to ensure a fun ride .
Unfortunately , this huge amount of thrust would not only be unstoppable once it was started , it would probably have to be applied to a point on the car that was n't designed to handle such force .
Under normal circumstances , a car gets its forward thrust from the back axle , by way of tires against pavement , which means that a normal car will never exceed a certain amount of thrust .
Jimmy described the whole thing using top - fuel dragsters as an example :
When the driver hits the gas , the back end of the car tries to lift into the air due to the sudden force applied to the rear axle .
But as soon as the ass end starts to lift , the tires lose traction , and the thrust decreases .
The back end drops , thrust is restored , and the process starts all over again .
The fact that a car uses driven wheels creates a self - damping system that ensures the wheels will stay on the ground .
The limiting factors are the weight , the distribution of the weight , the size of the tires , and the torque applied to the wheels .
The only reason dragsters and funny cars pop wheelies is that they use oversized tires that screw up the relationship between torque and traction .
A rocket car would have no such fine adjustments .
A massive amount of thrust would suddenly be applied to a point on a car that was n't designed to handle it , and there 's no telling what would happen next .
Maybe the front end would lift off the ground .
Maybe the rear .
Maybe the ass end would slew around sideways .
The only thing certain was that the car would not go in a straight line , and would continue to not go in a straight line at a very high rate of speed .
Naturally I asked how Craig Breedlove managed to drive the Spirit of America at 600 - plus miles an hour , but I knew the answer before I even spit the question out .
He hired a team of aerospace engineers and rocket scientists to design a car that was built to have a jet engine sticking out its ass .
Jimmy did n't even have to outline the rest of the reasons why my idea would n't work , but he did anyway .
There was the fact that store - bought tires could n't handle the sort of acceleration a rocket would provide , which was why all land - speed record cars used custom - made solid - rubber tires .
Simply spinning a regular tire at rocket - car speeds would probably create enough centrifugal force to tear it right off the rim .
There was the problem of stopping the thing once it got rolling .
There was structural stress .
And so on and so on .
I 'd pretty much decided that the whole idea was stupid and suicidal , which was why I was amazed when Jimmy proceeded to tell me exactly how the rocket car could work .
Train of Thought
One thing that remains fairly constant in retellings of the rocket car legend is that it took place somewhere in the southwest United States .
I 've heard versions stating that the whole thing happened in Arizona , Nevada , New Mexico , western Texas , and southwestern California , and in each case , the location seemed to be a critical part of the plot :
The rocket car would have to be launched on a long , flat stretch of road , away from prying eyes .
What strikes me as incredibly silly about the Darwin Award version of the story is that the pilot chose to test his vehicle on a road with a curve in it .
If you were going to test - drive a rocket - powered car , would you choose a section of highway 2.4 miles from a turn in the road bordered by a cliff ?
I poured gunpowder into a small square of newspaper folded around a light bulb filament .
Connected to a battery , it made an impressive flare .
After Jimmy was through demolishing my plans to build the rocket car , he pointed out that the control problem could easily be overcome if the car was actually a rocket sled , run on rails rather than asphalt .
You see , fortunately , highways are n't the only long , straight thoroughfares through the desert .
Mounting the rocket on a railroad car would not only solve the problems of control and traction , but if we used an abandoned stretch of track , we 'd also no longer have to worry about traffic .
And our area of the desert is covered with abandoned railroad track , most of it the old - fashioned narrow - gauge kind used for mining trains near the turn of the century .
I knew of at least three such pieces of track within 5 miles of town .
Finding a railroad car that would actually run on the old - fashioned track was another story , but by the time Jimmy finished explaining his idea , I already had a plan for solving that part of the equation .
The following morning I found myself bouncing across the desert in a battered four - wheel - drive pickup with the two hitherto unnamed members of Team Rocket Car , Sal and Beck .
As kids , Beck and I were almost as close as Jimmy and I , but Beck had a wild streak in him .
During high school it got out of control .
Beck turned into " one of those dope - smoking degenerates " ( Mom 's preferred term ) , and he dropped out a year shy of graduation .
Sal was Beck 's younger brother , junior not only by calendar count but by any sort of IQ measurement .
He was n't retarded or anything , but people tended to use phrases like " not too swift " and " a few bricks short of a load " more often than usual when he was around .
So they were n't exactly Nobel laureates , but I did n't have much choice in my selection of assistants .
I needed their truck .
The truck actually belonged to Beck 's father , who used it in the performance of his job .
Whatever that was .
Nobody knew for sure what Beck 's dad did for a living , but the truck was ugly and battered , sat on huge mud -grabber tires , and came with a massive 454 engine .
Beck 's father would drive the thing out of town occasionally , sometimes staying gone for days at a time .
When he returned , the truck always looked as if it had spent the entire time driving around in the desert .
If Beck knew what his father did for a living , he never said .
But Jimmy and I figured the man used his pickup for transporting something back and forth from remote desert locations .
Contraband vegetation arriving at an isolated airstrip was one possibility , and people desperate to become American residents without a lot of government interference was another .
The only relevant fact is that the truck was very good for cruising the desert , which is why we used it that morning to visit an abandoned silver mine a few miles from town .
Beck knew what to expect when we pried off the old wooden planks covering the mine 's entrance .
Less than a dozen feet into the shaft was a train of three ancient bucket cars , the tiny railcars once used to haul ore out of the mine .
They 'd probably been parked for 40 years or more , but they seemed to be in reasonably good condition .
Shit lasts forever in the desert .
Beck dragged a towchain into the mine , looped it around the hitch on the closest car , then used the pickup to drag the whole train closer to the entrance .
I used a 5 - pound pony sledge to bash the connection between the last two cars until it came free , and Beck threw the pickup into gear and dragged the first two cars clear of the mine .
The metal wheels screeched so loud I thought the noise would bring the shaft down on my head .
The first thing we did when we got the bucket cars into the light of day was turn them upside down and slop grease onto the axles .
After a few well - placed whacks with the sledge , we got the wheels to turn .
A few more whacks , and we had them turning freely enough to push the bucket cars up a ramp and into the back of the pickup .
Luxury at the Speed of Sound
An aspect of the rocket car legend that always tickles me is that no matter how much the story varies , the make , model , and year of the car is always specified .
Sure , this is a nice detail to have on hand , but considering the details left out of the description , it looks sorta silly .
In the Darwin Award version , there 's no mention of which highway the car was on , or even whereabouts in Arizona the story took place .
But the story does specify that the car was a 1967 Chevy Impala .
I think the reason this detail is always supplied is because it 's critical to make the listener think the test pilot at least looked cool when he flew into the cliff .
You 'll rarely hear someone tell a story about a guy in a rocket - powered Volkswagen Bug .
It has to be a car that deserves to have a rocket attached to it .
Our car was n't a 1967 but a 1959 Chevy Impala : bone - white with a red interior .
Once a story starts to mutate into a legend , there 's no telling which parts of the truth will stick .
Obviously the Chevy Impala part made the cut .
But we did n't choose the '59 Impala for its coolness , or for its aerodynamics or structural qualities , but because it was available .
My father happened to have one , resting on cinder blocks , in a forgotten corner of his lot .
Engine , transmission , and wheels were all missing , sold to Jimmy 's father at some point .
The only reason this car was otherwise intact was that Chevrolet used the 1959 style for a single year , which meant the body parts would be usable only on another 1959 Impala .
After I 'd cut the bodies away from the bucket cars , attaching the cut away railcar bases to the Chevy 's suspension was pretty easy .
Jimmy stressed the importance of getting the two sets of wheels precisely aligned , but it was n't that hard .
The old Chevy had plenty of places for bolts and welds , so picking spots where the wheels would line up was a snap .
And since the Impala was already up on blocks , it was no problem to slide the wheel frames underneath and lift them into place with a floor jack .
I 'm sure that these days my students would laugh like hell at the thought of me laying underneath a car with an oxyacetylene torch in my hand , but the fact is , I learned how to draw a bead and cut metal when I was 14 or 15 years old .
Growing up around a scrapyard did have certain advantages .
Within 5 miles of town there were a total of three sections of track long enough to run the rocket car on , and they were all dead losers .
The " propulsion unit " ( ha ! ) consisted of a 5 - foot length of steel water pipe welded to the Chevy 's suspension .
I plugged the end of the pipe facing the front of the car with a slug of scrap steel and welded it into place , and even cut the center out of a threaded cap to screw onto the exhaust end to hold the JATO bottle securely once it was installed .
The end - cap seemed like a good idea while I was doing it , though Jimmy laughed when he came the following weekend and saw my handiwork .
He pointed at the steel cap .
" That rocket is gonna be pushing against the car hard enough to make it fly like a bullet , and you 're afraid it 'll fall out the back end ? "
Tough Brakes
The night Jimmy inspected my work on the Chevy , all four members of Team Rocket Car gathered at a neighborhood bar to discuss the challenge of ... the braking system .
Of course the lack of any way to stop the car was considered a very minor point with Beck .
In his eyes , worrying about something as trivial as brakes was a sign of cowardice .
He was perfectly willing to haul the car out to a long stretch of empty track , get in , fire it up , and hope he slowed down before he ran out of track .
He was out of his fucking mind .
The most popular idea among the rest of us was , naturally , a drogue chute .
The Spirit of America used one , as did a few types of fighter planes , top fuel dragsters , et cetera .
But like the optimal solutions to most of our problems , the question was where to find one .
My father actually had six army surplus parachutes sitting in a storage shed near the office at the scrapyard , the spoils of a particularly good auction years before .
Five of them were standard personnel chutes , and one was a massive cargo - drop canopy .
But Dad also knew he had six of them .
He 'd started out with a dozen , and occasionally sold one to a sky diver or army / navy store .
A good surplus parachute was worth upwards of $ 200 .
There was no telling what the cargo chute would be worth to the right buyer .
If one were to turn up missing , Dad would certainly notice .
Of course we might have gotten away with using a parachute , then returning it once we were finished with it , but even this presented problems .
It might work OK for the first ride , but how about the second ?
I certainly knew nothing about parachute rigging .
All I was sure of was that there was a lot of cloth that had to be stuffed into a very small pack .
Sal suggested outfitting the car with a huge anchor , one that could be heaved out the window at the critical moment .
The rest of us suggested that Sal shut the fuck up and get us another round of beers .
I brought up the idea of stretching a cable across the track and fitting the rocket car with a tailhook to slow it down .
After all , aircraft carriers had been using this system to stop incoming planes for years , and it seemed to work just fine .
But before I could explain the idea , Beck started laughing his ass off , then asked if I wanted to use a rubber innertube to catch the car , or just tie a rope between two fenceposts .
Here was a guy willing to strap a military rocket onto his back and sit in a rusty railcar while someone else lit the fuse , but he was laughing at my ideas .
Unfortunately , he did have a point .
Putting a tailhook on the car and catching an arresting wire was simple .
But it sure as hell could n't be a stationary wire .
There would have to be some system to absorb the impact of a car moving at high speeds , and we could n't come up with anything .
Jimmy pointed out that rocket sleds usually ended up in a pool of water , which both acted as a brake and cooled the whole contraption down .
Beck pointed out that in the middle of the desert , pools of water are pretty tough to come by .
Overall , we were batting exactly zero .
I remember being pretty damned depressed when Jimmy and I left the bar that night , despite the fact that I was drunk .
Jimmy tried to blow some optimistic sunshine up my ass while we walked up the street toward our houses , saying that one of us might be able to come up with something later , once we were all sober .
I did n't consider it likely .
Beck and Sal seemed to think better when they were drunk .
If they had n't come up with anything at the bar , chances are they never would .
And Jimmy and I had n't nailed the problem that day drunk or sober .
Anyway , there 's no telling exactly how Sal and Beck spent the rest of their evening , but the next morning my dad woke me up by pounding on my bedroom door .
When I finally peeled my eyes open , he asked me who was delivering me car parts in the middle of the night .
Out on the front porch , tied together with twine and lying on the porch swing , was a bundle of four thick metal rods .
When I looked closer , I saw it was a set of heavy - duty air - adjustable shock absorbers .
Jammed under the twine was a note written in what looked like crayon on a crumpled paper bag .
Jimmy was n't suggesting that we scrap the project outright , just that we perform a test run before trying it for real .
An unmanned test run .
It said this :
Problum solved .
Call me later
Major Tom
Heat of the Momentum
Obviously Beck 's creative juices had n't really started flowing until Jimmy and I left the previous night , and he 'd eventually come up with a solution to the braking " problum . "
He must have spent the rest of the night staggering around town with his brother , a bumper jack , and a crescent wrench , looking for a donor to contribute some hardware to our cause .
I never actually asked Beck where the shocks came from , and he never volunteered the information .
His idea was simple , elegant , and easy to put into practice .
I 'd install the air shocks on the rocket car normally , just as if the car would be riding on pavement instead of rails .
But I 'd also bolt a pair of wooden beams onto the belly of the car , runners between the front and rear train wheels .
Each runner would be thick enough to reach almost all the way down to the tracks , and the bottom would be covered with rubber cut from old tires .
The effect would be that the car would roll freely while the air shocks were inflated , with the twin runners suspended inches above the steel tracks .
When it was time to stop the car , the pilot would activate a release valve that would dump the air from all four shock absorbers simultaneously .
The car would drop until its entire weight was resting on the runners , which would be pressing into the railroad tracks .
The runners would function like two brake shoes 3 feet long , pushed against the track under the weight of the car 's body , providing a huge amount of stopping power .
And since the wheel flanges would also still be firmly on the tracks , the car would remain traveling in a straight line .
When Beck finished explaining his idea , I stood there with my mouth hanging open .
We 'd talked about dozens of ways to stop the rocket car the previous evening , but nothing even came close to Beck 's plan .
By the end of the day , I had the shocks installed on the car and a pair of 3 - foot - long runners made from sections of 2 x 4 bolted together to make them thick enough to reach the rails .
All that was left to do was bolt the runners to the car frame and arrange the air hoses for the shock absorbers , and the car would be ready to test .
When Jimmy saw what I 'd done to the car so far , he was impressed .
I think he was also a little pissed off that Beck had come up with the idea , and not him .
But here 's a thought that never occurred to me back in 1978 , and to be honest , I 'm glad it did n't :
We never really had any proof that it was Beck who came up with the idea .
For all we know , it was Sal who dreamed up the notion of using runners to stop the car .
Yes , yes , I know , it 's a ridiculous thought .
Like having your pet hamster wake up one morning with a revolutionary process for splitting atoms .
After all , we 're talking about the guy who wanted the pilot of the rocket car to hoist a goddamned anchor out the window to slow down .
Still , you never know .
Anyway , Jimmy gave the braking system his stamp of approval , and I never had to admit to the team that Dad had a bunch of parachutes stashed in the shed .
The only reservation Jimmy had about the system was one that should 've been obvious to me from the start : heat .
If the car were traveling as fast as we expected it to , rubber - coated planks pressing against metal rails would probably get hotter than hell .
On the other hand , this was basically the same system used by every car on the road .
Drum and disc brakes are essentially nothing more than pads or shoes pressing against moving pieces of steel to stop the car .
The only difference between their system and ours was that standard brakes pressed brake pads against steel that was spinning , while ours used steel moving in a straight line .
And even though our car would be traveling a lot faster than most , we had much more overall braking surface .
As far as the brakes themselves were concerned , all that was left was construction .
Bolting the runners to the car frame was quick work , and even though it took a little doing to get the air - dump valve connected to all four shock absorbers , I had plenty of materials lying around the scrapyard to work with .
After removing the valve stems from the air inlets to the shocks , I attached sections of air - compressor hose to the valves themselves .
The other ends of the hoses ran to an air valve that started life as the door - opening lever on a city bus .
With the lever in the " open " position , all four shocks could be inflated from a single air inlet near the dump lever .
Once the shocks were pressurized , releasing the lever kept them inflated until the lever was pushed again .
I first tested the air - valve system on Tuesday afternoon , and when I saw that it worked the way it was supposed to , I immediately called Beck .
He came to the yard with Sal , and the three of us took turns raising and lowering the car for almost an hour before the novelty wore off .
Of course Beck was now more anxious than ever to " take the car for a spin , " and he actually got a little pissed off when I pointed out that we were n't out of the woods yet .
See , aside from the heat problem - which did n't cut much ice with Beck - we still had n't considered how we were going to ignite the JATO .
There was a rubber plug in the end of the exhaust nozzle of the rocket I 'd inspected , and it seemed logical to assume that some sort of igniter plugged into the hole .
Probably an electrical fuse , something along the lines of the igniters used for model rockets .
Whatever fueled the rocket ( ammonium perchlorate , I later found out ) was no doubt highly flammable , and should n't be too tough to ignite .
But I knew I could come up with something better than a fuse .
A much bigger problem was the launch site .
Beck got sulky and petulant when I pointed out that we had no idea where we 'd actually run the car .
So I put him in charge of finding a suitable spot .
His dad 's four - wheel - drive was the perfect vehicle for location - scouting , and he and Sal were more familiar with the surrounding desert than anyone I knew .
As Beck and Sal headed for the gates deep in conversation , I got back to work .
The last obstacle to running the car was gone .
Suddenly the whole thing seemed insane and dangerous and illegal as hell .
The brake - cooling system I ended up building was pretty cheesy , I 'll be the first to admit that .
But since we were n't even sure it was necessary , I did n't want to spend a lot of time messing with it .
I ran a length of garden hose along each wooden runner , near the point where the runner was attached to the car .
Took the ends near the front of each runner and led them into the empty engine compartment .
I tied off the ends under the car , then punched holes along the sections near the runners with an awl .
Water entering the ends in the engine compartment would leak out through the perforations , soaking the runners and pads .
I told you it was pretty cheesy .
The only part of the cooling arrangement that even came close to sophistication was the result of a brainstorm that came to me while I was strapping a 5 - gallon jerry can under the rocket car 's hood .
I started putting the sprinkler system together with the idea that we 'd simply open a valve before launch , letting water leak out of the hoses and onto the runners for the duration of the run .
But while I was attaching the jerry can , a better method occurred to me .
Instead of attaching the garden hoses to a valve , I drilled a pair of holes directly into the top of the jerry can , and fed the hoses through the holes .
Then I drilled a third , smaller hole , and connected another hose from the jerry can to the air - dump handle for the shock absorbers .
I sealed all the hose connections with massive amounts of rubber cement , then called it quits for the day .
No word from Beck or Sal that night , so I assumed finding a launch site was n't as easy as they 'd thought it would be .
When I checked the rocket car the next day , the rubber cement sealant had dried to the consistency of a hockey puck .
I filled the air shocks from Dad 's portable compressor , then closed the dump valve .
Filled the jerry can with water , and screwed the top down tight .
Said a quick prayer , and hit the dump - valve lever .
There was a slight hiss as the air rushed out of the shocks through the dump valve .
But instead of being vented into the open , the last air hose I 'd installed directed the escaping air into the jerry can full of water under the hood , forcing water out through the sprinkler hoses .
I had no idea how much air the shocks and air lines would actually hold , but since it was highly compressed air , I 'd hoped that when it expanded , it would be enough to displace the water in the can .
When I checked under the car there was an impressive puddle forming and water still jetting out of the holes in the garden hoses .
Eventually the spray trickled to a stop , leaving the jerry can more than half empty .
When Jimmy saw the whole system in action a few days later , he said he was " really impressed with my application of Bernoulli 's principle . "
Hell , I did n't even know the Italians built rocket cars .
Pangs of Conscience
Before I go on , I think I should take a minute to explain why this whole story is getting so lengthy .
Actually , my wife says I should issue a formal apology for inflicting such a long - winded pile of shit on anyone who reads it .
And I halfway agree with her .
But I want to make you aware of one thing : I did not plan it this way .
When I decided to write down the story of the rocket car , I figured it would take all of two pages , maybe three .
Four at the outside .
That 's because I was working from a set of 20 - year - old recollections , and a lot of the details were missing .
I did n't realize that once I started dredging up these old memories , all sorts of bits and pieces would start to fill themselves in , whether I wanted them to or not .
Besides , the technical details of the whole project turned out to be more involved than I initially remembered .
When I started writing , I recalled a simple 1 - 2 - 3 process that took place over the course of a few weeks .
But as I wrote , I realized I had to supply a lot more detail than I 'd originally intended to show that we actually thought about systems to make the car work and to keep the story from sounding completely stupid .
Of course , I 'm still not sure I 've accomplished the not - sounding - stupid part .
Even though the project was executed one step at a time , it had a goofy , ill - planned , Little Rascals feel to it .
Because basically it was a Little Rascals undertaking .
The only thing missing was a sign saying HE - MAN ROCKET KAR KLUB over a treehouse door .
If someone had been hurt or killed , or if we'd been caught trying to run a homemade rocket car through the desert , I 'm sure we'd all have ended up in the pokey .
And even if a judge were willing to overlook the instances of theft and trespassing and illegal possession of military fireworks , we'd have probably been charged with something , just on principle .
Conspiracy to Commit Flagrant Stupidity , maybe .
But nothing like that ever happened .
Having said that , I 'd now like to issue a formal apology for inflicting such a shitty , long - winded tale on you .
Location , Location , Location
The idea of the rocket car sitting on cinder blocks in the scrapyard , just waiting for a place to run it , was driving Beck crazy .
I have to admit , I was getting anxious to take it for a test run myself .
I did n't hear anything from Beck for the rest of the week , and I assumed it was because he had n't found a suitable launch site .
It was actually because his dad had taken the four - wheel - drive out for one of his mysterious desert jaunts , and was gone for the rest of the week .
That left Beck and Sal with only one option , driving Sal 's beat - to - shit Ford Falcon , a car that barely held its own on pavement , never mind the desert .
Meanwhile , the rocket car waited in the field .
I worked at the scrapyard , as I always had .
More than once I thought about what I 'd do if my dad suddenly got a buyer for that 1959 Chevy Impala , but there was really no point worrying about such things .
If it happened , I was simply screwed .
A brake failure would mean the car simply flew into an abandoned mine .
We could declare the experiment a failure and call it a day .
I did take care of one minor detail during the delay : building igniters for the JATOs .
I removed all the taillights and turn - signal lights from the Impala ( no matter what became of the rocket car , signaling for a turn would n't be an issue ) and soldered two wires to each bulb .
Next I carefully cracked the glass on each bulb , leaving the filaments intact .
The bare filaments would heat to white - hot when connected to a car battery , but simply lying a hot filament inside the JATO nozzle did n't seem like it would do the trick .
Maybe it would have , but since Beck and Sal still had n't found a launch site , I had time to come up with something better .
So I pulled a dozen of the blank M - 60 rounds from the ammo belt my father kept in his office as a decoration , tore off the skinny end of each shell , and dumped out the powder .
I poured a little into each of seven squares of newspaper , folded the newspaper squares into packets around the filaments of the light bulbs , and trussed each one up with masking tape .
When I connected one of them to a battery to test the idea , it made an impressive little flare .
When Sal and Beck still had n't reported finding a launch site by Friday morning , I even went through the trouble of putting an old car battery on the charger at the shop , installing it in the rocket car , and wiring it to a switch on the dashboard .
Jimmy came back from college again that weekend , just about the same time Beck 's father came back from who - knows - where with the four - wheel - drive .
During the week I 'd had high hopes that we'd be able to launch over the weekend , but when everyone gathered at the scrapyard on Saturday afternoon , I knew it was n't going to happen .
While Jimmy inspected the rocket car and told us what he'd found out about my JATO bottles ( which turned out to be very little ) , Sal and Beck told us about the launch locations they 'd scouted out over the week .
And the news was bad .
Within 5 miles of town there were a total of three sections of track long enough to run the rocket car on , and they were all dead losers .
Beck and Sal knew the area well enough to realize that most of the modern wide - gauge tracks had been laid either directly on top of , or very close to , the places where narrow - gauge tracks had once existed .
So naturally they had started their search at the switching yard near the city limits .
There they 'd found an excellent set of narrow - gauge tracks roughly paralleling a shiny set of wide - gauge rails .
The old - style tracks stretched for miles - but they ran right through a busy switching yard .
Not a good place to test a jet - propelled boxcar .
Another possibility was a set of rails that started in the desert , continued for five miles or more , and ended in a soft dirt field that would have been ideal for cushioning any crash that might happen .
Unfortunately , this set ran directly through the middle of town , and the field at the end was the Jaycees softball field , right across the street from the police station .
Even though Beck must 've realized we'd never go for that idea , it was obvious he liked it .
I imagine he wanted to set the rocket car on the tracks across from the police station in the dead of night , then blow the horn and scream until a dozen cops came running out of the station to see what the ruckus was .
At that point he'd hang a moon out the window , then light off the JATO and blaze out of town .
The last location Sal and Beck found was even worse .
The Mystery Mine was a bargain - basement tourist attraction a few miles from town that promised to show visitors the " inner workings of an authentic silver mine . "
People who paid the $ 2.50 admission were loaded aboard an ancient , rattling mine car and hauled through a few hundred feet of cavern , while a tour guide in a hard hat and goggles pointed at rusted pieces of machinery and chunks of rock .
We 'd all been on the Mystery Mine tour at one time or another , and everyone agreed that the only thing even vaguely interesting about it was wondering if a cave - in would trap you in the bowels of the mine , forcing you to eat the other tourists to survive .
There was an old song that used to play on the radio that described this scenario , and there was a popular joke around town about being trapped in the Mystery Mine and having to eat your way out .
A discreet sign near the mine 's entrance proclaimed that it was inspected for safety by the US Bureau of Mines on a yearly basis , but everyone knew that ancient mines tended to cave in whether the US Bureau of Mines said it was OK to or not .
Of course , the fact that the Mystery Mine was a tourist attraction presented us with a couple of difficulties .
The land around the Mystery Mine did have plenty of narrow - gauge track , but it also had lots of fences , lots of lights , a couple of security guards , and a handful of vicious Dobermans that patrolled the grounds at night .
The prospects of finding a decent place to launch the car were definitely looking grim .
Then at 6 that Sunday evening , I got a call from Jimmy asking me if I wanted to take a ride with him to " discuss a few things . "
He told me to drive over to his house , and when I got there , he was already in his car .
He signaled for me to follow him .
When he pulled to the side of the road near the abandoned mine shaft where we 'd liberated the two ancient bucket cars , he got out of his car , opened the trunk and took out a tire iron , then headed toward the mine entrance without a word .
When I asked what we were doing , he held up one finger in a wait - a- minute gesture .
I shut up .
Jimmy stopped in front of the boards we 'd renailed over the mine entrance .
Even though the sun was almost down , there was still plenty of light to see by .
I thought he'd brought the tire iron to pry off the boards near the entrance , but he started walking down the tracks away from the entrance .
Ten paces later he'd reached the point where the tracks ended , buried in sand .
He took a few more paces , then bent over and jabbed the pointy end of the tire iron into the sand .
You know what it looks like when you shoot a paper clip with a rubber band ?
One second it 's between your fingers .
The next it 's ... gone .
To my surprise , it clanked .
Jimmy looked at me with a goofy little smile on his face , and when I realized what he was doing , I smiled myself .
He pulled the tire iron out of the sand , walked a few more paces , then stuck it into the ground again .
No clank this time .
But when he stuck it in again , a few inches to the left , he got the same metallic clank .
He was now standing a good 50 feet from the mine entrance , and at least 20 feet from the spot where we all assumed the tracks terminated .
He looked up at me , with that dumb smirk still plastered across his face , and said , " So , how far out do you think these tracks actually go ? "
Safety Second
Why none of us had thought to take a look at the tracks coming out of that abandoned silver mine before this is anyone 's guess .
Beck and Sal and I had stood right on top of them when we got the bucket cars , but none of us considered the possibility that a long section of the track might still be there , underground .
As a matter of fact , " underground " is a pretty drastic term for what we found .
The tracks seemed to be covered by a fairly thin layer of drifted sand and dust .
The outcrop around the mine shaft broke the wind enough to keep the tracks clear near the entrance , but beyond that , the rails must have been a good place for drifting sand to pile up and eventually cover the rails .
When we got back to the cars that night , I realized Jimmy had asked me to follow him in my own car because he was going back to school directly from the mine entrance .
But there was still a matter he wanted to discuss , that matter being the first run of the rocket car .
Without a good launch site the matter could wait , but since it seemed as if we 'd found one , Jimmy figured we 'd better discuss the whole thing immediately .
It turned out that he was very worried about the first run of the car , particularly the idea of having a person inside when we fired it .
Of course I already knew there were plenty of things that could go wrong , since I 'd built the thing in a junkyard .
But when Jimmy started to lay out the possible ways a person inside the car could get hurt or killed , he made it sound a little less safe than going over Niagara Falls in a barrel .
First , we were dealing with a highly volatile chemical propellant we knew nothing about .
We did n't know how old it was , where it came from , or how it was supposed to behave .
There was actually a very real possibility that the JATO could explode like a bomb , reducing the car to flame and shrapnel in a split second .
But even if it did work as expected , the rocket was held in place by a length of water pipe welded to the bottom of a car that was almost 20 years old .
If any of the welds did n't hold , there was no telling what might happen .
Then there was the matter of the brakes .
All we had was a setup that sounded like it might work .
But if someone inside the car found themselves going 100 - plus miles per hour and the brakes did n't work ...
Jimmy was n't suggesting that we scrap the project outright , however , just that we perform a test run before trying it for real .
An unmanned test run .
Rig a system to activate the brakes at some point after the JATO had burned out , point the rocket car down the tracks , and let it run pilotless the first time .
After all , it was n't as if we needed a man at the tiller while the car was moving .
The person we'd been referring to as the " pilot " would actually be the " passenger " anyway , his sole duty being to hit the dump valve before the car ran out of track .
And since we had four JATOs , wasting one for the sake of safety seemed like a prudent move .
I had to admit , he made a lot of sense .
I pointed out that Beck would probably have a bird when he found out we were n't going to let him drive the car on its maiden voyage , but we both agreed that it would n't be a major problem as long as Beck got to drive it on the first manned run .
We 'd just take a second JATO along , and if the car ran successfully the first time , Beck could take it out the second time .
If the car ended up a twisted lump of smoking metal , Beck would be happy we decided to take the precaution .
With these details settled , I said good - bye to Jimmy and headed home .
The next day I was busy at the yard sorting through the latest load of junk my dad had bought over the weekend , but I found time to rig the brakes for our test run .
All I did was twist a screw eye into each brake runner , then run a length of piano wire through the openings in each eye and up through a hole in the Chevy 's floor .
I tied the ends of the wire to a short stick , and used it to prop the brake 's dump valve in the up position .
Then I looped a piece of rubber from a bicycle inner tube over the lever , and tied it under the valve box .
The bike tube pulled the lever toward the dump position , but the lever could n't move with the stick propping it up .
I figured that once we found a good section of track , all we'd have to do was drive a spike into one of the rail ties at the point where we wanted the brakes to kick in .
When the car passed over the spike , the spike would snag the wire , pull out the stick , and the dump valve would snap down , activating the brakes .
Now , if you 're getting tired of hearing about all the Rube Goldberg bullshit I was adding to this machine , take a minute to think about how I felt while I was doing the work .
By the time Jimmy suggested that we rig " some sort of automatic brake system , " I was getting mighty sick of rigging and drilling and bolting and cutting .
And I was tired of trying to figure out ways to make important things happen by using other people 's garbage .
I made up my mind that the auto - brake was the last piece of work I was going to do on the car .
If what I 'd built at that point was n't good enough , I 'd simply turn the whole mess over to Beck and let him drive the fucking thing into the Mystery Mine , or past the police station , or wherever he wanted to blast it .
Meanwhile , I 'd at least assign Beck the job of clearing the rails .
He accepted enthusiastically .
With the help of Sal , he broke back into the abandoned mine , grabbed the last bucket car , and pushed it down the length of the tracks with the bumper of the pickup .
Once the wheels loosened up , the bucket car worked like a snowplow and cleared the tracks with a single pass .
When I drove out to the abandoned mine after work on Thursday , I found two rusty metal rails poking out of the hardpan , starting at the mine entrance and extending out into the distance .
When I banged one with a rock , I heard plenty of good steel under the rust .
And best of all , they were 2 miles long and straight as an arrow .
For me , this was the point when the whole project made the transition from theory to reality .
I squatted next to those tracks and realized that the last obstacle to running the car had been removed .
And to my surprise , it did n't feel good at all .
Suddenly the whole thing seemed stupid and insane and dangerous and illegal as hell .
But it was way too late to stop .
The front half of the car was crushed like a beer can , under boulders ranging from the size of a watermelon to the size of the car itself .
Counting Down
If the track had been ready on Monday , I do n't think I could 've convinced Beck to let the maiden voyage of the rocket car wait until Jimmy came in on the weekend .
As a matter of fact , the only way I was able to get him to wait as long as I did was by agreeing to start getting things ready on Friday .
After my dad and I went home on Friday , I returned to the yard and found Sal and Beck waiting .
We backed the flatbed into the weedy field where the rocket car was docked , set up the ramps , and hoisted the car onto the flatbed with the winch .
I drove the flatbed out to the abandoned mine and down the slope to the tracks , scared shitless that I 'd get the truck stuck in the soft sand .
But I made it down the slope OK , and we lowered the rocket car onto the tracks , its nose facing the mineshaft .
It looked perfectly at home sitting on the rails .
Like that 's where it was meant to be .
But we did n't have time to stand around admiring the thing .
Even though we were 100 yards from a fairly secluded stretch of highway , the sight of a five - ton flatbed , a four - wheel - drive pickup , and a rocket - powered ' 59 Chevy on railroad wheels would 've looked pretty peculiar to anyone coming down the road .
So as soon as the car was on the rails , I climbed into the Chevy 's driver 's seat and Beck pushed me down the tracks with the pickup 's bumper until the car was close to the mine entrance .
We pulled the boards from the entrance again , and Beck used the pickup to ease the Chevy in .
Once it was all the way inside , he took me back to the flatbed and followed me back to the yard .
I parked the flatbed where it usually spent the night , we loaded the portable compressor for the shocks into the pickup , and we returned to the mine to run a test of the rocket car 's brakes .
Since we did n't have a tow chain with us that night , we had to muscle the car far enough out of the mine for Beck to get the truck in front of it and push it back down the tracks .
When we got the car about a mile from the entrance , we let it coast to a stop .
Beck jumped into the Chevy with a maniac grin on his face , and Sal maneuvered the pickup behind him .
Beck gave us a jaunty thumbs - up , and Sal hit the gas .
We picked up speed until we were doing about 50 , and just before I was about to scream at Sal to stop , he hit the brakes .
We watched the rocket car pull away at a goodly clip .
And keep going .
And keep going .
And just as I was wondering if the brake system might have malfunctioned , I saw the ass end of the Chevy pitch up slightly as Beck hit the dump lever .
Sal and I both let out the breath we 'd been holding .
When we got down to where it had stopped , the car was resting on its runners , and Beck was sitting on the hood .
Less than 20 feet from the mine entrance .
I thought he might make up an excuse for waiting so long to stop , that the brakes did n't work or whatever , but he did n't even bother .
When I asked what the fuck was wrong with him , he just said , " Hey , I did n't feel like pushing this fucker all the way to its garage , so I let it coast most of the way .
You have a problem with that ? "
Whoever discovered the car sticking out of the butte did n't make a big fuss about it .
The papers did n't cover it and the cops never came to visit .
The runners had scraped the rust off 10 feet of the rails , and when I looked under the rocket car , water was still squirting out of the hoses .
Leftoff !
The first ( and last ) test run of the rocket car happened on Holy Saturday , 1978 .
For the non-Christians in the house , Holy Saturday is the day before Easter , a day the faithful are supposed to spend preparing for the Easter feast and quietly contemplating the Miracle of the Resurrection .
My family has been Catholic for about a thousand generations , so I suppose this put me firmly among the ranks of the faithful .
Which means the Pope probably would 've frowned on my spending the day before Easter experimenting with illegal military ordnance and trespassing on private property .
But I 'm also confident that nothing in the Bible specifically covers what we were doing that Saturday morning , so I probably had some wiggle room .
We assembled at the abandoned mine early in the morning , just before dawn .
The story for my parents was that Jimmy and I were driving up to ... a big city in the area ( you 'll excuse me if I do n't specify which one ) and wanted to get an early start .
Jimmy was using the same excuse for anyone at his house who was curious .
Dad was n't even going into the yard on Holy Saturday , so I had the day to myself .
I went to Jimmy 's house and found him waiting for me on the front porch , and we left for the mine .
When we arrived , Sal and Beck were already there , sitting on the hood of the pickup , which was parked near the mine entrance .
They even had the boards pulled from the mine entrance and the car pushed out into the open .
Beck got in the truck and drove around to the front of the rocket car , then pushed the car out to the opposite end of the track , with the rest of us riding on the tailgate .
It was n't until the car was stopped at the end of the track that Jimmy asked what turned out to be a very important question .
He said , " So why is it pointing this way ? "
Sal and Beck and I stared at the car for a minute , and although I can't speak for the other two , I was trying to come up with something to say .
To be honest , I 'd never given it much thought .
I suppose when the car was first brought to my dad 's scrapyard , it was towed in front first , because the front end was farther from the path winding through our yard .
When we loaded the car to bring it to the mine , winching it onto the flatbed rear first was simply the easiest thing to do .
And when we got to the railroad tracks the day before , I 'd simply driven the flatbed to the end opposite the mine shaft and parked facing away from the entrance .
It seemed like a good way to avoid driving the flatbed over the tracks themselves , which might have damaged them .
When we had rolled the car down the planks and onto the tracks , it had ended up facing the mine entrance .
Sure , we could 've set it on the tracks facing the opposite way , but ... nobody thought of it .
So the three of us gave Jimmy a shrug , and I asked him what difference it made .
He walked around the car looking thoughtful , and after a while said , " None .
This is good . "
Later on , I figured out what he'd been thinking .
If something went wrong with the car ( specifically the brakes ) , which way would we want it to be pointing ?
If the brakes failed while it was heading away from the mine , the car would eventually run onto the wide - gauge rails at the end of our narrow - gauge track .
And with the flatbed back in the yard , it was n't likely we'd be able to get the car off the tracks if it got stuck there .
But with the car pointed toward the mine , a brake failure would mean the car simply flew into an abandoned silver mine .
We could declare the experiment a failure , nail the boards back up , and call it a day .
Of course , the equation looked a lot different with a passenger on board , but that 's why we were doing a test run first .
Ah yes , the test run .
Once Jimmy was through looking the car over , I broke the news to Beck that the first run would be unmanned .
He did n't like the sound of that a bit , even after I explained to him that it was in his best interest .
He wanted to ride in the car on the first run , and it took a while to convince him that it was n't going to happen .
When he 'd grudgingly accepted our logic , we took one of the JATOs out of its crate and loaded it into the pipe at the rear of the car .
Then Sal drove me down the tracks toward the mine .
When the odometer had ticked off exactly a mile , I made him stop while I got out and pounded an 8 - inch spike into one of the wooden ties , which were still solid enough to hold the spike well .
We drove back to the rocket car and found that Jimmy and Beck had already shoved one of my igniters into the JATO nozzle , attached the leads to the roll of field - phone cable with wire nuts , and were unrolling the cable away from the tracks .
I told Sal to park about 50 feet away from the Chevy , with the broad side of the truck facing the tracks .
I wanted to have the pickup truck between me and the JATO when it was lit .
I filled the can under the Chevy 's hood with water from one of the jerry cans , closed the hood , and rigged the automatic brake .
The wire stretched between the runners was only 5 or 6 inches above the railroad ties , low enough to catch on the spike with no problem .
Beck came over to watch the whole procedure , a little miffed that the unmanned test had obviously been planned out well in advance .
But by then it was too late for him to raise any serious objections .
If the car ran OK , he 'd get his ride .
If not , he'd be grateful we made the test .
Once the brakes were rigged and the water can filled , there was only one thing left to do :
Light the mother and see what happened .
We all gathered around the truck , Beck popped the hood , and I cut the field - phone wire from the roll and stripped the ends .
By then the sun had climbed over the top of the mountains , and we had a clear view of the entire track .
I wrapped one of the wires around the corroded negative post of the truck 's battery , and just as I was about to touch the other wire to the positive , Sal yelled , " Wait ! "
He scared the shit out of me .
When I told my dad , he laughed so hard I thought I 'd have to call the paramedics .
He 'd heard the tale , but he 'd dismissed it as just another stupid story .
I said , " What ?
What ?
What 's the problem ? "
Sal looked slightly embarrassed .
" Should n't we have a countdown ? "
Jesus Christ .
Beck gave him a smack in the back of the head , but I told him sure , if he wanted a countdown , we'd have a countdown .
So Sal counted down from ten , and when he reached zero , I touched the wire to the lead of the battery .
The events that followed happened so damned fast that I 'm surprised my mind was able to record everything .
But even though parts of this story have grown foggy over the years , the memory of the actual Flight of the Rocket Car remains crystal clear .
When I touched wire to battery post , we heard a little fizz .
I knew what it was , since I 'd heard it before : the igniter going off .
I did n't expect to hear it , since I figured the rocket would light instantly .
Instead , it hissed for a second , then stopped .
But before I could start to worry if the rocket was a dud , there was a massive eruption of orange flame from the ass of the Chevy .
Along with the flame was a huge , howling roar , something nobody had counted on .
We 'd all seen the Apollo launches on TV , and we knew that rockets were noisy , but nothing had prepared us for this .
It sounded like ... like a solid - fuel rocket igniting .
I 've been trying to figure out a way to put it into words , but the sight of the rocket car taking off is almost impossible to describe .
You know what it looks like when you shoot a paper clip with a rubber band ?
One second the clip is between your fingers , and the next it 's just ... gone .
You can't track it with your eyes , because it moves too fast .
All you can do is hope to shift your eyes to where it was going , so you can see where it hits .
Think of the same thing happening with a 1,500 - pound car .
In the space of a second , the car jumped down the track , away from us , and we were enveloped in thick , chemical - smelling smoke .
We all ran up the slope to get out of the artificial fogbank , but the roar from the rocket stopped as quickly as it started .
Jimmy'd said the burn time on our JATO was 2.2 seconds .
I staggered up the slope and looked down the tracks , to see that the rocket car was moving along at a rapid pace , toward the spike I 'd driven in the railroad tie .
And although it was moving damned fast , it was far enough away so that I can't even take a guess as to how fast it was going .
My eyes were still burning from the rocket smoke , but I did see it pass the point where I 'd planted the spike , and then ...
Something happened .
Intellectually , I know exactly what happened .
The spike caught the piano wire , pulled the stick out from under the dump- valve lever , and the air shocks lowered the car to the rails .
I did n't actually see the car drop , but it must have .
Because a second later , more smoke started pouring out of the car .
Only this time it was coming from under the car , and it was steam , not smoke .
The runners had heated up , and the water shooting onto the hot brakes was turning into steam .
But the car kept going .
And going .
It did n't seem to be slowing down .
It must have been , since the runners were obviously pushing against the rails hard enough to create a lot of heat .
But the car kept moving , closer and closer to the mine .
It never made it to the entrance .
Later on , Jimmy and I had a long discussion about what happened next , but we were too far away to have a clear view .
Maybe one of the runners burned away and got caught in the ground .
Or on the tracks .
Maybe one of the old axles finally reached its breaking point .
Or one of my welds could n't take the strain .
Whatever it was , the rocket car derailed about 20 yards from the mine entrance and continued moving toward the mine .
Actually it was straddling one of the rails , going 60 or 70 miles an hour , screeching and screaming and kicking up a cloud of sparks .
And it was no longer aligned with the mine entrance , either .
The Chevy slid down the tracks , but instead of driving straight through , it went in at an angle with the ass end canted toward the road .
The front end smashed into one of the huge timbers that outlined the mine entrance , cracking it in half .
After a very short pause , the timber collapsed , immediately followed by the overhead timber it supported .
Those timbers must have been under considerable stress , because a second later the entire entrance to the mine collapsed on top of the rocket car with a huge grinding rumble and a cloud of dust .
I just gawked .
I remember that part clearly , standing there looking at the car in the distance , just before dust obscured the picture .
My rocket car was sitting there like a busted Tonka truck with a mountain falling on it .
Moments later I became aware of voices shouting behind me .
I turned around and saw Jimmy and Sal in the bed of the pickup , and Beck behind the wheel .
They 'd obviously had the sense to get into the truck and chase down the rocket car , while I stood there with my mouth hanging open .
I jumped into the bed , and Beck floored it toward the mine entrance .
Toward the former mine entrance .
During the short ride , I wondered how we were going to haul the car out of the pile of rubble , but when we got closer I saw that it was a foolish idea .
The front half of the car was crushed like a beer can , under boulders ranging from the size of a watermelon to the size of the car itself .
Smaller pieces were still coming down when we got there .
The only way that car was ever coming out was if someone torched off the back end and hauled it out with a winch .
Beck stopped the truck a safe distance from the wreckage , and we all got out to look .
But there was n't much to look at .
The only thing not buried by the cave - in was the last 4 feet of the car .
The trunk lid and rear bumper and rocket were visible , but the rest of the car was buried under boulders and rubble .
Jimmy quickly summed up our situation .
At that particular moment , there was n't much we could do in the way of damage control .
The car was stuck .
The JATO was wedged in too tightly to remove , too .
And if we could n't move it , then it was unlikely anyone else could .
Not without a major effort .
Fortunately , the only thing to show that we'd even been there was the piece of field - phone wire at the other end of the tracks , and the remains of the rocket car itself .
Which meant that it was an excellent time to get the hell out of there .
We needed no more encouragement .
Beck and Sal ran for the cab of the pickup , Jimmy and I piled into the bed , and Beck pointed the truck toward the road and stomped the gas .
I guess he did n't have the four - wheel drive engaged , because the back wheels of the truck threw up rooster tails of sand as we took off up the slope .
But we did n't get stuck .
We shot up the slope , bounced onto the asphalt , and as soon as the rear wheels hit the asphalt they started burning rubber .
Beck only stopped long enough for Jimmy and me to bail out and run to my car .
Then suddenly Jimmy ran back down the slope .
I yelled after him .
He stooped and grabbed something from the ground .
When he reached the car he tossed the wad of field - phone wire in the back seat and jumped in .
I punched the gas , spun the car around , and headed back toward town .
So that 's the whole story of the rocket car .
I never went back to the mine , and neither did Jimmy .
We discussed what we'd do about the wreckage while driving back to town , but nothing we came up with seemed to make a lot of sense .
If we went back to the site later that day , there was a fair chance we'd be spotted .
And now there was a very obvious piece of forbidden military hardware at the site in plain view .
The thing that kept repeating over and over in my head as we drove back to town was that paragraph in my dad 's auction paperwork .
The one about possession of controlled military hardware .
It was then I decided the best way to handle the whole thing would be to not handle it at all .
And that 's exactly what we did .
Actually , timing and nature lent a hand .
The following day was Easter Sunday , and there was no way Jimmy or I were going to avoid spending it with our families .
And even if we wanted to , it was n't a good day to be screwing around out in the desert .
Late Saturday night a windstorm kicked up , strong enough to make the local TV stations interrupt programming with traveler 's advisories in our area .
Nothing very odd about that , not in our area in the springtime .
But this time I was thrilled to hear the reports .
High winds and blowing sand could serve to obscure the signs of what we'd been doing in the desert that morning .
If sand was blowing across the streets in the middle of town , it must 've really been kicking ass in the desert .
Later that morning I saw Jimmy at church , where we exchanged several Significant Looks .
The next day , Jimmy went back to college .
I went back to work at the scrapyard , and I have no idea what Beck and Sal did .
I spent the next few days trying to act as normal as possible , expecting a police car to show up at the yard any minute .
But curiosity finally got the best of me , and I called Beck on Wednesday .
We met that night at the same bar where we 'd discussed brakes for the rocket car , and Beck told me he had been out to the mine , actually a couple of times .
Once he even brought a camera and took a few pictures , because what he saw was so damned funny .
Funny ?
He explained .
The storm that blew through the area on Saturday night had indeed eliminated most of the signs of what we 'd been doing .
The tire tracks made by his dad 's pickup were completely eliminated , and the railroad tracks were almost reburied .
But the rocket car was still exactly the same as when we left , ass end hanging out of a pile of rubble with a rocket sticking out of it .
Beck pointed out what the scene must have looked like to a person driving toward the crash site :
You 're driving down a stretch of road , toward a butte that used to have a mine entrance in the side of it , but now there is no mine shaft - just the rear end of a car sticking out of nowhere .
And then , the twin skid marks on the highway where Beck 's truck leaped onto the roadway .
Skid marks pointing directly at the rocket car .
Aftermyth
Now , I have to admit one thing .
I did n't start hearing rumors right away .
Nobody did .
I did n't see any articles in the paper , the cops never came to visit .
All I can say is that whoever discovered the car sticking out of the butte did n't make a big fuss about it .
And I 'm pretty sure someone did discover it .
I saw Beck once more after our meeting in the bar , at a Memorial Day party a few weeks later .
He was pretty drunk at the party , wanted to talk about the whole thing , and I had a bitch of a time getting him to a private spot so I could listen to what he had to say .
He said he'd gone out to the crash site a few days earlier , and the rocket car was gone .
I said , " What do you mean , gone ? "
But " gone " is just what he meant .
He drove past the spot , could n't see the car from the highway , and went down the slope to take a look .
When he got there , he could n't find any trace of the car ever having been stuck in the mine entrance .
All I could think at the time is that the rubble pile must have eventually shifted to cover the car completely .
Beck seemed doubtful when I suggested it , but like I said , he was pretty drunk .
He said it looked more like the car was pulled out of the hole and taken away .
But that 's a bunch of bullshit .
It has to be .
To start with , none of us were there long enough for the scene to form a lasting impression .
We looked at the wreckage for maybe 15 minutes before we were back in Beck 's truck and hauling ass out of there .
Maybe
Beck saw enough so that he could tell if the car had been moved , but I would n't be able to tell .
Later on I started thinking about what would have happened if the county sheriff had driven by and seen the Chevy sticking out of a rockslide .
Or even if someone had called the sheriff and reported it .
See , the abandoned mine was far enough from town so that it probably was n't inside the city limits , which means that it would n't be the business of the city cops .
And folks who do n't live in town learn quickly who they 're supposed to call when there 's trouble .
Oh , I 'm sure a state trooper would 've stopped to check it out if he'd spotted it while driving past , but the troopers mainly stick to the interstates , occasionally pulling into one of the towns along the way for doughnuts or coffee .
No , if some law - enforcement outfit stopped to investigate the crash site , it almost certainly would 've been the county sheriff .
So what would he have done ?
I honestly do n't know , but the sheriff 's office would n't have called the city cops unless they had to .
My dad always hinted at animosity between the two departments , the city cops considering the sheriff 's department a bunch of hick - assed Deputy Dawgs , and the sheriff 's department thinking the city cops were a gang of self - important pricks .
And neither group liked the state police , who , by all accounts , are self - important pricks .
So I try to think of what the sheriff would 've done if he'd come across the crash site , and it occurs to me that the first thing he'd have seen was what appeared to be a rocket nozzle sticking out of the back end of a car .
If I were the sheriff , I 'd have immediately called the army base where Dad and I got the JATOs in the first place .
Who else would be qualified to deal with such a thing ?
Evel Knievel ?
And if the sheriff did call the army , and they had some DOD people come out and take a look , anything could 've happened next .
The military bomb squad might have taken one look at the expended rocket , told someone at the base to send out a truck with a winch , and they may have yanked the car right out of the rubble and taken it away .
After they determined that there was no corpse in the car , it would n't be the sheriff 's business anymore .
Or anyone else's .
Case closed .
But I never did any serious investigation of these possibilities , for two reasons .
One , I did n't want to do any snooping that might look suspicious .
Two , I did n't hang around town very long after that .
Two weeks after the test of the rocket car , I drove to ... the biggish city I mentioned earlier and took the ASVAB test .
That 's the test they give you before you join the military .
And a few weeks after talking to Beck for the last time , I shipped out for navy basic training .
Before you make any assumptions about my joining the navy to escape the repercussions of the rocket car incident , let me tell you that I absolutely did not .
If the rocket car had anything to do with my joining the navy , it was just to give me a gentle nudge in a direction I was already heading .
Hey , take a look at the situation I was in .
I was 22 years old , living with my folks , and working for my dad in a junkyard at the edge of a shitty little town in the desert .
Not exactly a Future With Promise .
I guess college was a possibility , but Dad did n't really make enough to pay my way , and I did n't feel like repaying student loans until I was 100 years old .
Why the navy ?
Well , because of that song by the Village People , of course .
No , actually , there was never any question about which branch of the service I wanted to join .
I joined the navy because I wanted to get as far away from the desert as I possibly could .
I went home on leave when I got a chance , and I always saw Jimmy whenever I went back .
On my second visit , I found out that Beck and Sal had hauled stakes and split for California a few months after I 'd left for boot camp .
Not on foot , either .
They 'd stolen their dad 's monster pickup , but rumor had it their dad never even swore out a complaint about the theft of his truck .
Maybe he figured it was a small price to pay to get rid of his sons for good .
Or maybe the truck was n't empty when they jumped in and headed west .
Their dad was still up to unknown hanky - panky out in the desert somewhere .
Beck and Sal may have waited for an occasion where Dad brought some work home with him and headed for California with a few bales of Colombian contraband in the bed .
Whatever the case , nobody ever found out .
The next update I got on that situation was the following Christmas .
My dad told me that Beck had been busted in California for God - only - knew - what and had died in prison .
The facts were sketchy , but I did n't press details .
Dad obviously considered it a case of " good riddance " but did n't actually say the words , because he knew Beck had been a friend .
Sal was MIA , and as far as I know , nobody heard from him again .
But without Beck to take care of him , it 's doubtful that he came to a good end .
So that leaves Jimmy .
He finished college , got his degree , and started working for a big company , designing various kinds of equipment .
I do n't want to specify the company , or even the exact type of equipment .
Let 's just say that you 'd recognize the company name if I mentioned it , and Jimmy is head of the department that builds machines for making cold things hot and hot things cold .
If that 's not good enough for you , too bad .
My dad kept the scrapyard , continued going to auctions and making a profit , all the way up until he retired last year .
He and Mom moved to Phoenix , where they 're probably the only retired couple who do n't complain about the heat .
They came up to visit a few months ago , to see my wife and me and the kids , and while they were here I took my dad out one night to shoot some pool .
I told him the story of the rocket car , not knowing what his reaction would be .
He laughed so hard I thought I 'd end up having to call the paramedics .
Seems that over the years he'd heard various bullshit artists mention a car driven into a cliff , but he 'd always dismissed it as just another stupid story .
I 've stayed in touch with Jimmy over the years - he 's met my family and I 've met his , and we 've exchanged the occasional phone call and Christmas card .
He never forgot about the rocket car , and over the years he 's taken great joy in tweaking my balls about it .
Every now and then I get something in the mail to remind me of the whole thing , something Jimmy thinks I 'll find funny .
At first it was just the odd newspaper clipping or magazine article , but once VCRs became popular , he started sending videotapes .
And even though there was never a note or explanation with a tape he sent , I always knew what to look for when I watched the movie .
One was The Right Stuff , and I laughed out loud when scenes of the rocket - sled tests came on the screen .
Another was more recent , a Charlie Sheen flick called Terminal Velocity .
Sure enough , there was a scene where Charlie and some blond bimbo escape from the bad guys in a homemade rocket sled .
The one movie he sent that I did n't find very amusing came a few years ago , at a point where I had n't heard anything from Jimmy in a long time .
This was the third part of a three - movie series .
And although I 'd seen the first one a couple of times , I 'd never seen the second part .
So I had to rent Part II at the video store down the street , which I watched with my family one Friday night .
The next day my wife took the kids to visit her parents , and I stayed home and put Jimmy 's movie in the VCR .
The part at the beginning of the movie , where Doc Brown and Marty McFly find the DeLorean in the abandoned mine shaft was bad enough .
But toward the end , when they mounted railroad wheels on the time machine and pushed it down the tracks with the locomotive ...
When the movie was over , I got up close to the TV and read each and every name in the credits .
After all , we never had found out what happened to Sal after he was left on his own in California .

Spardebatte Staat zahlt 442 Millionen Euro für Kirchengehälter

Negativity can pervade the hipster culture , perhaps as a counteraction to the ridiculously - positive , can - do motivational speaker style attitudes pervading much of the business and consumer culture these days .
However , negativity is not an answer , it 's simply a reaction .
Always try to find balance and peace in your life rather than seeing doom and gloom in everything .
Yes , society is full of problems but being negative about them wo n't solve or change such problems whereas a realistic and pragmatic approach to doing things that make a difference will go part the way to bringing about a better world .
Remember too , that every generation is cursed with thinking things used to be or could be better .
We are time - bound and body - bound creatures who need to accept our limitations while making the most of what we do know and can do .
Constant deconstructing and criticizing of society can all too easily turn into a paralysis - by - analysis lifestyle , in which complaining becomes your modus operandi but actually changing the status quo is not something you 're tooled up to do .
Windscreen wiper water may be the cause of 20 % of cases of Legionnaires ' Disease in England and Wales , the Health Protection Agency says .
Stagnant , warm water is a breeding ground for the Legionella bacterium , which when inhaled causes pneumonia .
Yet adding screenwash kills the bacteria and could save lives , the Agency advised .
The finding came after researchers spotted that professional drivers are five times more likely to be infected .
Legionnaires ' disease is fairly rare .
Most cases are sporadic and a source of the infection is not found .
The number of cases vary from year to year , but in 2009 there were 345 in England and Wales - although some infections were caught overseas .
It mainly affects the over 50s and is generally more common in men .
Early symptoms feel similar to flu with muscle aches , tiredness , headaches , dry cough and fever .
It is fatal in around 10 - 15 % of patients .
Driving
To work out why people who spend a long time driving were at higher risk of infection , the research team in the south - west branch of the HPA carried out a questionnaire of people infected .
They found that those most at risk were those who drove or travelled in a van , those who drove through industrial areas , and those who spent a lot of time in the car or who often had the car window open .
This is a bug which lives in the environment and will take advantage of warm water systems that are not cleaned out Professor Hugh Pennington
In all they found that the biggest risk was associated with not adding screenwash to windscreen wiper water , the European Journal of Epidemiology reports .
In a pilot study carried out by the HPA , traces of Legionella were found in one in five cars that did not have screenwash , but in no cars that did .
Dr Isabel Oliver , regional director of the HPA South West , said more research was needed but people may want to check they have screenwash in their cars as they usually contain agents which would stop the growth of bacteria .
" It does not spread from person to person but is present in water environments and is breathed in when it gets into the air in fine particles or mist . "
Professor Hugh Pennington , an expert in bacteriology , said the advice to add screenwash was very sound - especially as it would also lead to a cleaner windscreen .
" This is a bug which lives in the environment and will take advantage of warm water systems that are not cleaned out .
" Legionnaires ' is rare but it kills people and it's an extremely unpleasant disease .
" If you can prevent it with something this simple then it's a no brainer really . "
The U.S. caused the 1930s deflationary depression and is again the cause of the current contraction .
Although similarities exist between the two , the differences between them insure a far more consequential outcome today than in the 1930s .
[ Indeed , the world ] now finds itself on the edge of a growing deflationary sinkhole created by the sequential collapse of two large U.S. bubbles , the dot.com and U.S. real estate bubbles .
Words : 1535
Lorimer Wilson , editor of www.FinancialArticleSummariesToday.com, provides below further reformatted and edited [..] excerpts from Darryl Robert Schoon ’s ( www.drschoon.com) original article * for the sake of clarity and brevity to ensure a fast and easy read .
Schoon goes on to say :
Global demand is again falling as credit contracts , a sign that debt - driven deflation is back but , today , there is an additional danger as well .
Since 1971 , because of the U.S. default on its gold obligations , money no longer possesses intrinsic value and the consequences will soon become apparent .
Deflationary depressions and a collapse in the value of fiat money have happened before but never simultaneously .
Soon , they will .
The Day of Reckoning Has Arrived
We are in what Stephen Roach , Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia , calls the end - game , the resolution of past monetary excesses and imbalances , excesses and imbalances that reached never - before - seen heights in the last decade .
The Problem
Capitalism cannot function unless its constantly compounding debt is serviced and / or paid down .
Today , the U.S. , the world ’s largest debtor , can no longer pay what it owes except by rolling its debt forward and borrowing more [ in ] what the late economist Hyman Minsky called ponzi- financing , financing common in the final stages of mature capital systems .
The amount of outstanding U.S. debt , according to Martin D. Weiss , www.moneyandmarkets.com, has now reached levels that can never be paid off .
The United States government and its agencies have , by far ,
– the largest pile - up of interest - bearing debts ( $ 15.6 trillion ) ,
– the largest accumulation of unsecured obligations ( over $ 60 trillion ) ,
– the largest yearly deficit ( $ 1.6 trillion ) , and
– the greatest indebtedness to the rest of the world ( $ 4.8 trillion ) .
The unpayable levels of U.S. debt are not just the problem of the U.S. because the U.S. dollar is the lynchpin of today ’s fiat money system , U.S. debt is everyone ’s problem .
The U.S. dollar is the world reserve currency and a default by the U.S. will have far - reaching consequences , especially in China , its largest creditor .
The Solution
Bill Gross , co-founder of PIMCO , the world ’s largest bond fund and an expert in matters of debt , wrote in 2006 that the way a reserve currency nation [ such as the US ] gets out from under the burden of excessive liabilities is to inflate , devalue , and tax .
a ) Inflate
Inflation destroys the value / cost of liabilities by eroding the value of money .
Debts are paid back with inflated currencies , a process which benefits the debtor and injures the creditor .
This is why reserve currency nations usually inflate their way out of debt by printing what they owe .
b ) Devalue
Devaluation is another option afforded reserve currency nations .
By devaluing the value of their currency , the value of what they owe falls relative to other currencies .
Again , the benefit is to the debtor at the expense of the creditor .
c ) Tax
Taxation is another option but is no longer available to the U.S. , as its liabilities are now too high .
It would be like forcing the elderly and morbidly obese to engage in strenuous exercise to regain youth .
Of the three , inflating away debt is by far the preferred option but it is one the U.S. can no longer choose .
Why Inflation Wo n’t Work
It ’s tempting to think that the U.S. can inflate its way out of its fiscal problems .
A faster , sustained increase in prices would erode the real value of past debt , and higher future inflation would – other things equal – reduce the real resources needed to service and pay back the promises we are making today .
However , inflating away U.S. debt wo n’t work because as Richard Berner points out nearly half of federal outlays are [ now ] linked to inflation , meaning that increments to debt would [ also ] rise with inflation .
Inducing monetary inflation would also raise aggregate U.S. debt resulting in a self - defeating cycle of higher prices and higher debt .
However , there is also another more fundamental reason why inflating away U.S. debt wo n’t work , to wit : Inflation is almost impossible to induce during severe deflationary contractions .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke understands this difficulty quite well .
Bernanke ’s late mentor , Milton Friedman , theorized the Great Depression could have been prevented by sufficient monetary stimulus and so in 2008 , faced with the possibility of another deflationary depression , Bernanke put Friedman ’s theory to the test .
Unfortunately , when tested , Friedman ’s theory did n’t work .
Despite Bernanke ’s massive monetary expansion , global credit is still contracting and lending is drying up .
Inflating away debt is virtually impossible in the presence of deflation , but if U.S. monetary expansion is sufficiently large , it could result in the hyperinflation of the U.S. money supply , which would destroy both U.S. debt and the U.S. economy as well .
Managing Director and Chief U.S. Economist at Morgan Stanley , Richard Berner , recently discussed the reasons in We Ca n’t Inflate Our Way Out , February 24 , 2010 .

Will Devaluing The U.S. Dollar Work ?
Devaluation is the U.S. ’ only remaining option but , as pointed out in Comstock Partners ’ special report of February 25th , “ The Cycle of Deflation , Impediments to Debt Relief ” , the major impediment to a U.S. devaluation to reduce debt is China saying :
“ There is a stumbling block to the normal competitive devaluations that typically take place .
In the past , a country that incurred too much debt just did what they could to devalue their currency in order to export their way out of the dilemma by exporting their goods and services to their trading partners … [ but ] the Chinese have linked their currency to ours , so as we debase our currency , one of our major trading partner ’s currency is also declining and China becomes the major beneficiary of the debasement of our dollar . ”
The China peg to the U.S. dollar thus prevents the U.S. from altering its trade deficit by currency devaluation , but it does not prevent the U.S. from devaluing the dollar for other reasons .
If the U.S. does devalue the dollar , it will not be to reduce debt — it will be to maintain its advantage over the world in general and China in particular .
The Influence of China On U.S. Actions
U.S. dominance is being challenged by China .
While it is not possible to know what the U.S. will do , it is naïve to believe the U.S. will do nothing ; but whatever happens , U.S. debt and the U.S. dollar will be affected .
China has now significantly reduced its buying of U.S. debt leaving the U.S. with growing deficits and a virtual boycott by China of new U.S. IOUs .
This will impact future U.S. / China relations .
The tentative but mutual benefits of the past are being replaced by self - interest as U.S. spending and consequent debt is increasingly perceived as being out of control by China .
That perception is correct .
Since the 1980s , America ’s focus has been on borrowing more , not spending less and the implications are clear .
With China moving away from increasingly risky U.S. debt , the U.S. is now far more likely to treat China as a challenger than as a needed creditor and , while devaluing the U.S. dollar would have minimal impact on overall U.S. debt , it would have a significant impact on China .
In December 2009 , total foreign holdings of U.S. government debt equaled $ 3.29 trillion .
With total U.S. obligations now close to $ 100 trillion , a 30 % devaluation of the U.S. dollar would impact only that debt held by foreigners .
China currently owns at least $ 1.7 billion in U.S. dollar denominated securities and , if the U.S. devalued the dollar by 30 % , China ’s losses on its investments would be in excess of $ 500 million .
As stated earlier , it is not possible to know what the U.S. will do but since WWII geopolitical considerations have always outweighed economic factors in U.S. policy decisions and there is little reason to expect this to change — even as the end - game approaches .
The End Game and Sovereign Default
The U.S. is trapped .
Caught between rising expenditures and the need to borrow more , outstanding U.S. debt is incapable of ever being repaid and should the credit rating of the U.S. ever reflect its actual state , sovereign default , not devaluation would be the result .
In 2008 , Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart , in their book “ This Time Is Different : A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crisis , ” reviewed the history of sovereign defaults concluding that the then dearth of defaults was in actuality a warning of more to come .
They were right .
As the end - game progresses it is impossible to know what the U.S. will do .
It is likely the U.S. does n’t know itself .
What the U.S. does know is that it is now trapped by increasing levels of mounting debt from which there is no easy exit .

Tomorrow
Tomorrow , I will sit silently as I hear another rape joke , letting it hit the wall I ’ve put up , blinking hard when my eyes start to prickle .
Tomorrow , I will wait until I ’m around people who agree with me to vent my discontent at the way we ’re treated .
Tomorrow , I will pretend not to notice the hilarious comment about domestic abuse from my classmate .
I ’ll tell myself , “ tomorrow I ’ll say something , ” “ if he does it again I ’ll call him on it , ” but I do n’t .
I never do .
For all my words , all my critical thinking — ( what good does critical thinking do ? ) —
I rarely say anything when it really matters .
Later I will cry to someone , my big sister , my friend , my RA , and they ’ll assure me I ’m not overreacting .
But that wo n’t change anything .
Because the next day , I ’ll hear another “ joke . ”
And it will just be another slap in the face .
How many until I ca n’t take it anymore ?
Am I too afraid of being seen differently in my peers ’ eyes ?
Too afraid of being branded as the girl who ca n’t take a joke ?
Or am I afraid of putting my emotions on display ?
Tomorrow , I will cry inside , and say nothing .
I will promise to be stronger next time .
The day after tomorrow , I will cry inside , and say nothing .
How long until I speak ?
ONE VERY LUCKY CITY
David Gilmour & Roger Waters : 7/10/10
has announced in a Facebook post that fellowalumnuswill join him for one date on the upcoming The Wall Live Tour .
Could this be the start of something more ?
Read on .
From the Roger Waters Facebook Page :
So here ’s what happened .
Last year , ‘ The Hoping Foundation ’ a charity that supports Palestinian refugee kids , ( www.hopingfoundation.org) put on a fund raiser at Ronnie Scott ’s Club in London , the idea of which was to raise money by auctioning karaoke performances by various celebrities .
David was there as a supporter and was moved to perform an impromptu rendition of George Gershwin ’s ‘ Summertime ? ’ which he performed aided and abetted by supermodel Kate Moss .
In the wake of that evening , someone , I think it was David himself , came up with this ‘ Would n’t it be funny ’ , idea .
What if he ( David that is ) were to sing the old Teddy Bears song ‘ To Know Him Is To Love Him ’ with me ( Roger that is ) , what with us having been so famously at each other ’s throats for years and years .
Get it !!!!
Anyway he E - mailed me with this suggestion and I loved it , so then it was just a question of juggling dates and deciding to do ‘ Wish You Were Here ’ and ‘ Comfortably Numb ’ to round out our little set .
Or so I thought , until he sent me a number of very musical and eloquent demos of how we could do the song in two - part harmony .
I listened with a sinking heart , knowing that David , with his superior vocal skills , could sing either part standing on his head , whilst I would have to search for a different key and then struggle through hours and hours of routining a performance that lay way outside my vocal comfort zone .
To my eternal shame I bottled out and told Dave I would happily do ‘ Wish You Were Here ’ and ‘ C[ omfortably ] Numb ’ , but that ‘ To Know him is to Love him ’ was beyond me .
Some weeks passed with David cajoling me from time to time , telling me how easy it would be , but I clung resolutely to my fear of failure until one day he made one final entreaty .
I quote “ If you do ‘ To Know Him Is To Love Him ’ for The Hoping Foundation Gig , I ’ll come and do ‘ C[ omfortably ] Numb ’ on one of your Wall shows ” .
Well !
You could have knocked me down with a feather .
How f**king cool !
I was blown away .
How could I refuse such an offer .
I could n’t , there was no way .
Generosity trumped fear .
And so explaining that I would probably be s**te , but if he did n’t mind I did n’t , I agreed and the rest is history .
We did it , and it was f** king great .
End of story .
Or possibly beginning .
- Roger
PS .
Just heard from David , he will decide in due course which gig he wants to do , it will be a surprise !

Oh , Rush .
While everyone is focused on the environmental and economic impact of the oil rig explosion and subsequent spill , Limbaugh has his own theory : the rig was blown up by " hardcore environmentalist wackos . "
President Obama just made some remarks on the topic .
He said , according to AFP , that the spill was " a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , " and added that " BP is responsible for this leak .
BP will be paying the bill . "
But Rush has arrived at a very different culprit .
Here , via WWLTV in Louisiana , is the big guy 's theory as aired on his Thursday show .
We 'd advise you put on a tinfoil hat before reading it , just to get into the spirit of things .
I want to get back to the timing of the blowing up , the explosion out there in the Gulf of Mexico of this oil rig .
Since they 're sending SWAT teams down there now this changes the whole perspective of this .
Now , lest we forget , ladies and gentlemen , the carbon tax bill , cap and trade that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day .
I remember that .
And then it was postponed for a couple of days later after Earth Day , and then of course immigration has now moved in front of it .
But this bill , the cap - and - trade bill , was strongly criticized by hardcore environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment .
So , since they 're sending SWAT teams down there , folks , since they 're sending SWAT teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants , than by blowing up a rig ?
I 'm just noting the timing here .
But handily we can thwart this mysterious cabal of environmentalists by doing ... nothing .
Because oil is supposed to be in the water :
You do survive these things .
I 'm not advocating do n't care about it hitting the shore or coast and whatever you can do to keep it out of there is fine and dandy , but the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there , " Limbaugh said .
" It 's natural .
It 's as natural as the ocean water is .

Computer scientists from the University of California , San Diego broke " the terabyte barrier " -- and a world record -- when they sorted more than one terabyte of data ( 1,000 gigabytes or 1 million megabytes ) in just 60 seconds .
During this 2010 " Sort Benchmark " competition -- the " World Cup of data sorting " -- the computer scientists from the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering also tied a world record for fastest data sorting rate .
They sorted one trillion data records in 172 minutes -- and did so using just a quarter of the computing resources of the other record holder .
Companies looking for trends , efficiencies and other competitive advantages have turned to the kind of heavy duty data sorting that requires the hardware muscle typical of data centers .
The Internet has also created many scenarios where data sorting is critical .
Advertisements on Facebook pages , custom recommendations on Amazon , and up - to - the - second search results on Google all result from sorting data sets as large as multiple petabytes .
A petabyte is 1,000 terabytes .
" If a major corporation wants to run a query across all of their page views or products sold , that can require a sort across a multi- petabyte dataset and one that is growing by many gigabytes every day , " said UC San Diego computer science professor Amin Vahdat , who led the project .
" Companies are pushing the limit on how much data they can sort , and how fast .
This is data analytics in real time , " explained Vahdat .
Better sort technologies are needed , however .
In data centers , sorting is often the most pressing bottleneck in many higher - level activities , noted Vahdat who directs the Center for Networked Systems ( CNS ) at UC San Diego .
The two new world records from UC San Diego are among the 2010 results released recently on http://sortbenchmark.org -- a site run by the volunteer computer scientists from industry and academia who manage the competitions .
The competitions provide benchmarks for data sorting and an interactive forum for researchers working to improve data sorting techniques .
World Records
The Indy Minute Sort and the Indy Gray Sort are the two data sorting world records the UC San Diego computer scientists won in 2010 , the first year they entered the Sort Benchmark competition .

In the Indy Minute Sort , the researchers sorted 1.014 terabytes in one minute -- thus breaking the minute barrier for this terabyte sort for the first time .
" We 've set our research agenda around how to make this better … and also on how to make it more general , " said UC San Diego computer science PhD student Alex Rasmussen , the lead graduate student on the team .
The team also tied the world record for the Indy Gray Sort which measures sort rate per minute per 100 terabytes of data .
" We used one forth the number of computers as the previous record holder to achieve that same sort rate performance -- and thus one fourth the energy , and one fourth the cooling and data center real estate , " said George Porter , a Research Scientist at the Center for Networked Systems at UC San Diego .
The Center for Networked Systems is an affiliated Center of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology ( Calit2 ) .
Both world records are in the Indy category -- meaning that the systems were designed around the specific parameters of the Sort Benchmark competition .
The team is looking to generalize their results for the Daytona competition and for use in the real world .

" Sorting is also an interesting proxy for a whole bunch of other data processing problems .
Generally , sorting is a great way to measure how fast you can read a lot of data off a set of disks , do some basic processing on it , shuffle it around a network and write it to another set of disks , " explained Rasmussen .
" Sorting puts a lot of stress on the entire input / output subsystem , from the hard drives and the networking hardware to the operating system and application software . "
Balanced Systems
The data sorting challenges the computer scientists took on are quite different from the modest sorting that anyone with off the shelf database software can do by comparing two tables .
One of the big differences is that data in terabyte and petabyte sorts is well beyond the memory capacity of the computers doing the sorting .
In creating their heavy duty sorting system , the computer scientists designed for speed and balance .
A balanced system is one in which computing resources like memory , storage and network bandwidth are fully utilized and as few resources as possible are wasted .
" Our system shows what 's possible if you pay attention to efficiency -- and there is still plenty of room for improvement , " said Vahdat , holder of the SAIC Chair in Engineering in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego .
" We asked ourselves , ' What does it mean to build a balanced system where we are not wasting any system resources in carrying out high end computation ? ' " said Vahdat .
" If you are idling your processors or not using all your RAM , you 're burning energy and losing efficiency . "
For example , memory often uses as much or more energy than processors , but the energy consumed by memory gets less attention .
To break the terabyte barrier for the Indy Minute Sort , the computer science researchers built a system made up of 52 computer nodes .
Each node is a commodity server with two quad - core processors , 24 gigabytes ( GB ) memory and sixteen 500 GB disks -- all inter-connected by a Cisco Nexus 5020 switch .
Cisco donated the switches as a part of their research engagement with the UC San Diego Center for Networked Systems .
The compute cluster is hosted at Calit2 .
To win the Indy Gray Sort , the computer science researchers sorted one trillion records in 10,318 seconds ( about 172 minutes ) , yielding their world - record tying data sorting rate of 0.582 terabytes per minute per 100 terabytes of data .
The winning sort system is made up of 47 computer nodes similar to those used in the minute sort .
According to wolframalpha.com , 100 terabytes of data is roughly equivalent to 4,000 single - layer Blu - Ray discs , 21,000 single - layer DVDs , 12,000 dual - layer DVDs or 142,248 CDs ( assuming CDs are 703 MB ) .
Deadly home - brewed liquor kills 17 in Kenya Published duration 26 July 2010
image caption Many Kenyans drink home - distilled liquor because they cannot afford commercial brands
Poisonous moonshine has killed at least 17 people and blinded a dozen more in Kenya 's largest slum .
Police said the home - distilled drink may have contained traces of methanol .
Many of those who died were found in their homes in the Nairobi slum of Kibera .
Some were taken to hospital but died after arriving there .
Alcohol - related deaths are common in Kenya , with hundreds of people dying every year from poisoned liquor often sold in the brewer 's home .
Home choice
A woman accused of distilling the moonshine , known locally as changaa , was arrested and is now being questioned , police said .
Samples of the liquid have been sent for tests , they added .
Authorities want to know if the poisonous chemicals in the drink were created by accident in the distilling process or were added deliberately - possibly to make the batch go further .
In a country where most people are too poor to afford legally made alcoholic drinks , changaa is the beverage of choice for thousands of Kenyans , says the BBC's Peter Greste in Nairobi .
The drink , brewed in illicit stills in slums and backyards everywhere , is often spiked with toxic additives to make it stronger , our correspondent says .
Professor Victor Shih from Northwestern University in the US has warned that local entities have borrowed $ 1.7 trillion , using inflated land values as collateral .
China 's authorities have played down these concerns , denying that credit has been allowed to balloon out of control as it did in Japan during the 1980s .
But it is an open question whether the Communist leadership can calibrate fine - tuning any better than the rest of the world .
The headline on Drudge Report was sinister , touching off racially paranoid fantasies in each of the 11 or so states where his site is still popular :
Increase intensity ?
Oh no !
Michelle Obama is telling African Americans to band together to fight white people !
Michele Bachmann and Glenn Beck were right !
She 's coming to get us !
They are coming to get us !
And I 'm scared !
I was so freaked out that I actually followed Drudge 's link .
And it sent me here , to an ABC News story mentioning nothing about the First Lady telling blacks to " increase intensity . "
Huh ?
What was going on here ?
I thought Michelle Obama was trying to rile up blacks .
Was ABC now participating in a conspiracy to cover up her remarks , just like the MSM stamped out the " get whitey " video tape ?
I needed to know the answers to these questions .
So I hit the Google and Binged the search and found that rightwingers were all talking about Michelle Obama 's sinister comment .
But I still could n't find what it was that she had said .
Nonetheless , I knew that what she said must have been wrong .
Everybody was outraged , and they should have been .
It 's one thing when wingers give a speech to fundamentalist American Taliban whackjobs or run political ads calling President Obama a slavemaster , but it 's quite another thing when the First Lady speaks to the NAACP in an election year and tells blacks that now is the time to " increase intensity . "
That is fanning the flames of racism , pure and simple .
Right ?
But there was still part of me that wanted to see her full , unsnipped remarks .
I just had to see each and every one of her awful , wretched words .
So I kept on digging until I found the transcript .
Actually , it turns out that the transcript was at my fingertips the whole time .
It was sitting right there in my inbox from the White House Press Office .
How nice of them to send me her hate speech .
So with the transcript now open on the monitor in front of me , I rubbed my hands together , ready -- and , yes , I 'll admit , a little bit afraid -- to read her militant speech .
It did n't take long to find the relevant passage :
When African American communities are still hit harder than just about anywhere by this economic downturn , and so many families are just barely scraping by , I think the founders would tell us that now is not the time to rest on our laurels .
When stubborn inequalities still persist -- in education and health , in income and wealth -- I think those founders would urge us to increase our intensity , and to increase our discipline and our focus and keep fighting for a better future for our children and our grandchildren .
( Applause . )
And that ’s why I really wanted to come here today -- because I wanted to talk with you about an issue that I believe cries out for our attention -- one that is of particular concern to me , not just as First Lady , but as a mother who believes that we owe it to our kids to prepare them for the challenges that we know lie ahead .
And that issue is the epidemic of childhood obesity in America today .
Now , right now in America , one in three children is overweight or obese , putting them at greater risk of obesity - related conditions like diabetes and cancer , heart disease , asthma .
And we ’re already spending billions of dollars in this country a year to treat these conditions , and that number is only going to go up when these unhealthy children reach adulthood .
But it ’s important to be clear that this issue is n’t about how our kids look .
It ’s not about that .
It ’s about how our kids feel .
It ’s about their health and the health of our nation and the health of our economy .
And there ’s no doubt that this is a serious problem .
It ’s one that is affecting every community across this country .
But just like with so many other challenges that we face as a nation , the African American community is being hit even harder by this issue .
( Applause . )
We are living today in a time where we ’re decades beyond slavery , we are decades beyond Jim Crow ; when one of the greatest risks to our children ’s future is their own health .
African American children are significantly more likely to be obese than are white children .
Nearly half of African American children will develop diabetes at some point in their lives .
People , that ’s half of our children .
And if we do n’t do something to reverse this trend right now , our kids wo n’t be in any shape to continue the work begun by the founders of this great organization .
The first thing I noticed was that not only did Michelle tell African Americans to " increase intensity " but she also urged more " discipline . "
Those were truly frightening words to hear , given that the race war was finally upon us .
I kept on reading , hoping to gain insight into her battle plan .
And that 's when it happened .
After completing the next paragraph , I realized this was n't a speech about race war .
In fact , Michelle Obama was talking about the scourge of childhood obesity .
In a matter of seconds -- maybe even faster than that -- it dawned on me that I actually agreed with her .
In fact , what she was saying was incontrovertibly true .
It was obvious .
We do need to increase our intensity to combat this important health problem .
We do need more discipline in addressing fundamental health problems that hold some of our nation 's children back .
Suddenly , I felt relieved .
It was soothing to know that when it comes to Michelle Obama , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
In fact , if you let yourself , you might just get inspired , because her speech was really a speech about love -- love of country , love of community , and love for our nation 's children .
Yet somehow the right - wing noise machine tried to turn her speech into one about hate .
And in the end , it says more about them and their fears and their motivations than it does about Michelle Obama or any of the rest of us .
Their paranoia really is the past .
And slowly but surely we will close the door on it and find our way to a better future .
HAPPY days are here again for the Republicans , or so you might think .
Barack Obama 's popularity rating is sagging well below 50 % .
Passing health - care reform has done nothing to help him ; most Americans believe he has wasted their money — and their view of how he is dealing with the economy is no less jaded .
Although growth has returned , the latest jobs figures are dismal and house repossessions continue to rise .
And now his perceived failure to get a grip on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is hurting him ; some critics call it his Hurricane Katrina ; others recall Jimmy Carter 's long , enervating hostage crisis in Iran .
Sixty per cent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track .
All 435 seats in the House are up for grabs in November .
The polls portend heavy losses for the Democrats , who currently enjoy a 39 - seat majority there .
Quite possibly , they will lose control of it .
The Republicans stand less chance of winning the Senate , where a third of the seats are contested this year , but they should win enough to make it almost impossible for the Democrats to break a filibuster there by picking off a Republican or two .
The second two years of Mr Obama 's presidency look like being a lot tougher than the first .
Malice in Wonderland
Mr Obama deserves to be pegged back .
This newspaper supported him in 2008 and backed his disappointing - but - necessary health - care plan .
But he has done little to fix the deficit , shown a zeal for big government and all too often given the impression that capitalism is something unpleasant he found on the sole of his sneaker .
America desperately needs a strong opposition .
So it is sad to report that the American right is in a mess : fratricidal , increasingly extreme on many issues and woefully short of ideas , let alone solutions .
This matters far beyond America 's shores .
For most of the past half - century , conservative America has been a wellspring of new ideas — especially about slimming government .
At a time when redesigning the state is a priority around the world , the right 's dysfunctionality is especially unfortunate .
The Republicans at the moment are less a party than an ongoing civil war ( with , from a centrist point of view , the wrong side usually winning ) .
There is a dwindling band of moderate Republicans who understand that they have to work with the Democrats in the interests of America .
There is the old intolerant , gun-toting , immigrant - bashing , mainly southern right which sees any form of co-operation as treachery , even blasphemy .
And muddying the whole picture is the tea-party movement , a tax revolt whose activists ( some clever , some dotty , all angry ) seem to loathe Bush - era free - spending Republicans as much as they hate Democrats .
Egged on by a hysterical blogosphere and the ravings of Fox News blowhards , the Republican Party has turned upon itself ( see article ) .
Optimists say this is no more than the vigorous debate that defines the American primary system .
They rightly point out that American conservatism has always been a broad church and the battle is not all one way .
This week California 's Republicans chose two relatively moderate former chief executives , Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina , to run for governor and the Senate .
But both had to dive to the right to win , which will not help them in November .
And in neighbouring Nevada the Republicans chose a tea - partier so extreme that she may yet allow Harry Reid , the unloved Democratic Senate leader , to hang on to his seat .
Many of the battles are indeed nastier than normal : witness the squabble in Florida , where the popular governor , Charlie Crist , has left the party ; Senator Lindsey Graham walking away from climate - change legislation for fear of vile personal attacks ; and even John McCain , who has battled with the southern - fried crazies in his party for decades , joining the chorus against Mexican “ illegals ” to keep his seat .
As for ideas , the Republicans seem to be reducing themselves into exactly what the Democrats say they are : the nasty party of No .
They may well lambast Mr Obama for expanding the federal deficit ; but it is less impressive when they are unable to suggest alternatives .
Paul Ryan , a bright young congressman from Wisconsin , has a plan to restore the budget to balance ; it has sunk without a trace .
During the row over health care , the right demanded smaller deficits but refused to countenance any cuts in medical spending on the elderly .
Cutting back military spending is denounced as surrender to the enemy .
Tax rises of any kind ( even allowing the unaffordable Bush tax cuts to expire as scheduled ) are evil .
This lack of coherence extends beyond the deficit .
Do Republicans favour state bail - outs for banks or not ?
If they are against them , as they protest , why are they doing everything they can to sabotage a financial - reform bill that will make them less likely ?
Is the party of “ drill , baby , drill ” in favour of tighter regulation of oil companies or not ?
If not , why is it berating Mr Obama for events a mile beneath the ocean ?
Many of America 's most prominent business leaders are privately as disappointed by the right as they are by the statist Mr Obama .
Down the rabbit hole and beyond the Palin
Out of power , a party can get away with such negative ambiguity ; the business of an opposition is to oppose .
The real problem for the political right may well come if it wins in November .
Just as the party found after it seized Congress in 1994 , voters expect solutions , not just rage .
The electorate jumped back into Bill Clinton 's arms in 1996 .
Business conservatives are scouting desperately for an efficient centrist governor ( or perhaps general ) to run against Mr Obama in 2012 .
But tea -party - driven success in the mid-terms could foster the illusion that the Republicans lost the White House because Mr McCain was insufficiently close to their base .
That logic is more likely to lead to Palin - Huckabee in 2012 than , say , Petraeus - Daniels .
Britain's Conservatives , cast out of power after 18 years in 1997 , made that mistake , trying a succession of right - wingers .
Only with the accession of the centrist David Cameron in 2005 did the party begin to recover as he set about changing its rhetoric .
There may be a lesson in that for the Republicans — and it is not too late to take it .

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has landed at Farnborough for its first appearance at an international air show .
Boeing 's flagship aircraft is different from conventional aircraft , having been built largely out of light - weight composite material .
" This is the first time we 've had a new airplane at an air show since the early 1990s , " Jim Albaugh , boss of Boeing Commercial Airplanes , told the BBC .
The plane has been delayed by more than two years after a series of hitches .
When it was first conceived , the Dreamliner was a revolutionary concept , but rivals have since done much to catch up .
Airbus is building a similar series of planes dubbed A350 , while newcomers in Russia and China are gearing up to enter the fast - growing market for single - aisle aircraft .
" The market is changing , " said Mr Albaugh in a BBC News interview .
" There are a lot of companies that have a lot of technology and ambition , but competition is good .
Competition makes us better .
Competition makes us more innovative . "
Long life
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Richard Scott takes a look inside Boeing 's new 787 Dreamliner
The Dreamliner is scheduled for delivery to its launch customer All Nippon Airways later this year , though this deadline could slip into early 2011 , Boeing told BBC News last week .
The plane is currently conducting daily flight tests in the US after its first flight in December 2009 .
By then , the plane was already more than two years late , so Boeing is eager to avoid further delays .
However , the delays are not important in the bigger scheme of things , Mr Albaugh insisted .
" This is an airplane that 's going to be in the market for 50 years , " he said .
New orders
Optimism about the Dreamliner 's performance in the market is mirrored by high hopes of a revival in the fortunes of the civilian aviation industry .
During the past two years , airlines in difficulty have held back from ordering new planes , though production schedules have been largely unaffected as aircraft manufacturers have order books stretching several years into the future .
This year , predicted Mr Albaugh , the customers will be back .
" We 're going to hear a lot of orders being announced this week , both from Airbus and from Boeing , " he said .
John Leahy , head of sales at Airbus , said on Saturday that he had bet parent company EADS chief Louis Gallois that the planemaker would match the number of orders it had taken in the year so far during the Farnborough show .
Industry watchers are also waiting for announcements from the world 's leading airplane makers about whether and when they will update their best - selling but ageing Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 series of planes .
" We 've got three options , " Mr Albaugh said .
" Do nothing , re-engine or build a new airplane . "
A decision should be taken later this year , he said .
Airbus will also announce its decision after the middle of September , Mr Leahy said , hinting that it would probably fit its A320 jets with engines that should help it deliver fuel savings and thus emission cuts of about 15 % from 2015 .
" We think that is the way to go and that Boeing will be behind us before the end of the year , " he said .

An Israeli parliamentary committee recommended stripping an Arab MP of her privileges yesterday in a move to prepare the ground for putting her on trial for participating last week in the Gaza - bound aid flotilla attacked by Israeli commandos .
Haneen Zoubi , who has become a national hate figure since challenging Israel ’s account of the confrontation , said yesterday she was facing “ a witch - hunt . ”
The interior minister , Eli Yishai , has submitted a request for her citizenship to be revoked , and a bill — labelled the “ Zoubi Law ” — is being considered that would allow a serving MP to be expelled for “ inciting ” against the state .
Zoubi has been provided with a bodyguard after receiving a spate of death threats .
A popular Facebook page in Hebrew is calling for her execution and an online petition for her expulsion from the parliament has attracted tens of thousands of supporters .
Last week , in unprecedented scenes as she tried to address parliament , Zoubi was heckled into silence by Jewish legislators shouting out “ terrorist ” and “ traitor . ”
Guards only narrowly prevented a far - right parliamentarian from attacking her .
Yesterday ’s hearing of the parliament ’s house committee was originally intended to consider revoking the immunity of six Arab MPs , including Zoubi , who travelled to Libya in April .
All the Arab MPs boycotted the meeting .
However , the committee chairman , Yariv Levin , of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud Party , switched the focus to Zoubi ’s involvement in the flotilla .
Legal advisers said the MP was still being investigated for attempting to enter a closed military area and violence against the commandos .
After she disembarked from the Mavi Marmara in Ashdod last week , Zoubi said she had been questioned by police about possessing a weapon .
The committee approved by a majority of 7 - 1 stripping her of parliamentary privileges that take away her diplomatic passport , reportedly to prevent her fleeing the country , and withdraw help with litigation fees .
Parliament must approve the decision .
Levin accused Zoubi of betraying the country and said she must be put on trial .
“ What Zoubi did crossed the line and even in a democracy there must be red lines .
Whoever sails to Hamas is a supporter of terror , ” he said .
Zoubi responded : “ They conducted a kangaroo court against me .
They have called on the public to harm me . ”
An editorial in the liberal Haaretz newspaper warned yesterday that an atmosphere of “ dangerous incitement ” was developing against Israel ’s Palestinian minority , a fifth of the population .
Two other Arab MPs , Ahmed Tibi and Taleb al - Sana , revealed that they too had received death threats .
In addition to the removal of Zoubi ’s privileges , she is also facing the revocation of her citizenship .
The measure has been used only twice before in Israel ’s history — both times against Palestinian citizens accused of terrorism .
Last week , Yishai wrote to the attorney general asking for the go - ahead , saying Zoubi had “ headed a group of terrorists ” and was “ undoubtedly aware of the activists ’ preparations for the attack against IDF [ Israeli army ] troops .
This is a premeditated act of treason . ”
Orna Kohn , a lawyer with Adalah , a legal center for the country ’s Palestinian minority , said Yishai ’s move was “ uncharted legal territory ” that could leave Zoubi stateless , in violation of international law .
“ There is simply no precedent for revoking the citizenship of an MP , ” she said .
After Zoubi ’s release last week , she said she had seen three passengers shot in the head by soldiers , and two more left to bleed to death .
According to autopsies conducted in Turkey , five of the nine dead passengers were shot in the head , and many of the lethal shots were fired from close range .
During her address to the parliament last week , Zoubi called for an international investigation and demanded to know why Israel had not published photographs and video footage it confiscated from passengers that related to the nine dead and dozens of wounded .
After the session , she said : “ It was so hostile in the chamber that , had MPs been allowed to carry guns , I am sure someone would have shot me . ”
Israel has been swept by right - wing demonstrations in support of the raid on the flotilla over the past few days .
A Hebrew Facebook page “ Execute MP Haneen Zoubi ” features a cartoon image of the MP with crosshairs on her forehead as the figure waves a Palestinian flag with a bloody Star of David at its center .
Zoubi said she had been surprised to learn that the armed bodyguard — normally reserved for government ministers and the head of state — was supposed to remain with her even inside the parliament chamber .
“ What does that say about the threat posed by my fellow MPs ? ”
Four other leaders of Israel ’s Palestinian community who were on the ships are being investigated by police .
After the mass release of detainees last week , they were freed to house arrest but are banned from leaving the country .
At his remand hearing , Sheik Raed Salah , a leader of Israel ’s Islamic Movement , said of the flotilla episode : “ The soldiers tried to kill me .
They fired in the direction of someone else they thought was me . ”
Rumours circulating widely that Sheikh Salah had been killed in the commando raid eight days ago were not denied by Israeli officials and only ended when his family identified that a body brought to an Israeli hospital was not his .

In a report published this week , a group of independent investigators from Israel 's intelligence community found that activists aboard the ' Mavi Marmara ' were part of an organized group that was prepared for a violent conflict .
Last week Israeli commandos killed nine pro-Palestinian activists when they boarded the Turkish - owned boat , part of a six - ship convoy trying to break Israel 's maritime blockade on the Gaza Strip
The report , published by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center ( known in Israel by its Hebrew acronym Malam ) , said activists who attacked commandos with clubs and knives were supported by the Turkish government .
Malam is a privately run but is widely seen as an unofficial branch of Israel 's intelligence community and has in the past been a medium for passing Israel 's intelligence findings to the public .
The report said while most of the Mavi Marmara 's 500 passengers were humanitarian volunteers who underwent security checks before boarding the ship at Antalya in Turkey , a group of 40 IHH activists had boarded the ship in an Istanbul port beforehand , keeping apart from the rest of the passengers throughout the journey .
This hard core of activists boarded the ship without checks and was equipped with communications equipment , flack jackets embroidered with Turkish flags , and gas masks , Malam said .
According to the report , the group turned the upper deck into its headquarters , blocking it off to other passengers .
It had a clear internal hierarchy , with specific activists nominated as commanders .
Bülent Yldrm , the leader of the IHH , an Islamic organization that planned the voyage , was on the Mavi Marmara and briefed group members about two hours before the Israeli Navy intercepted the ship .
Their main objective was to hold back soldiers by any means , and to push them back into the sea .
As they had been banned from bringing wepaons aboard , IHH members improvised weapons including metal rods and knives cut from the ship 's metal rails , which they used to attack the soldiers .
According to a witness aboard the ship , a confrontation broke out when the ship 's crew heard IHH members sawing the railing into metal rods , but they were unable to confiscate them from them .
IHH activists also gathered all the knives from six cafeterias on the ship , as well as axes from fire extinguishers on the deck , all of which served as weapons against Israeli commandos .
Before the takeover , IHH ordered all other passengers into the hold of the ship and told them to remain there .
Only journalists and security personnel were allowed access to the deck .
Video footage matched testimonies from passengers who claimed they witnessed any violence , as they were denied access to the deck , where the clash occurred .
The testimonies are also similar to the version given by the Navy commandos who said that they fought with a group of approximately 50 people who used every weapon available to attack them .
Eight of the nine dead were identified as IHH members .
Files found on laptops owned by the IHH members pointed at strong ties between the movement and Turkey 's prime minister .
Some of the activists even said that Erdogan was personally involved in the flotilla 's preparations .
They also said that they knew in advance that their chances of making it into Gaza were slim , but their initial goal was to " to expose Israel 's true face to the world . "
An IHH journalist said during his investigation with Israeli security forces that " the Turks set a trap for you and you fell straight into it . "
He also said that the recent flotilla was the first in many .

Starting today ( July 1 ) , every Finnish citizen now has a guaranteed legal right to a least a 1 M bps broadband connection , putting it on the same footing as other legal rights in the country such as healthcare and education .
As we reported last year , Finland was the first nation in the world to pass this type of legislation , followed by Spain in November .
The Finish government has promised guaranteed speeds of 100 M bps by 2015 for all of its citizens , and currently about 97 % of Finns already have access to broadband connections .
As our @Zee mentioned last year : “ the fast growth of technology has led the European Commission to bring forward a review of the basic telecoms services Europeans can expect . ”
And as this blog points out :
“ This is no mean feat in a geographically challenging region , with a quarter of the country lying above the Arctic Circle .
The country has followed the Scandinavian trend of fixed - to - mobile migration , with increasing numbers of citizens choosing to bypass the limitations of fixed - line telecoms and Internet for mobile - only connectivity . ”
Finland ’s communication minister Suvi Linden told the BBC that , “ We considered the role of the internet in Finns everyday life .
Internet services are no longer just for entertainment . ”
So there you have it , broadband access to the Internet is now officially a legal right in one country at least .
Here ’s hoping the word spreads .

In the name of saving children from candy - flavored methamphetamine , the U.S. appears on the verge of mandating more than a year in jail for anyone who cooks up a batch of pot brownies .
A bill by California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein that has recently reached the Senate floor has cannabis advocacy groups concerned that potent , medical - grade edible products would become a higher crime carrying weighter sentences , ostensibly to protect children from ingesting strawberry - flavored meth .
ADVERTISEMENT
The bill is the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act , which , according to Feinstein , “ sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ if you target our children by peddling candy - flavored drugs , there will be a heavy price to pay . ”
Sen . Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) co-sponsors the bill .
The full text is available online [ PDF link ] .
“ Flavored meth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with child - friendly names like Strawberry Quick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is designed to get people to try it a few times , ” Feinstein declared in a media advisory .
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all about hooking young people , and we have to stop this practice before it grows any further .
So , this legislation will increase the criminal penalties for anyone who markets candy - flavored drugs to our youth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by imposing on them the same enhanced penalties applied to dealers who distribute drugs to minors . ”
“ New techniques and gimmicks to lure our kids into addiction are around every corner .
Candy flavored meth is the latest craze used by drug dealers , ” Senator Grassley added .
“ Research has shown time and again that if you can keep a child drug - free until they turn 20 , chances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted .
This makes it all the more important that we put an end to the practice of purposely altering illegal drugs to make them more appealing to young people . ”
Cannabis advocacy blog “ Toke of the Town ” retorted : “ Since there is no national trend toward lacing candy and other edibles with meth or any other drug besides cannabis , this bill clearly targets legitimate medical marijuana dispensaries , caregivers and patients in states that have legalized it as medicine . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
And what sort of “ enhanced penalty are we talking about ?
“ [ A ] term of imprisonment [ … ] shall be not less than one year , ” the legislation states .
In the same breath , however , the bill adds : “ This subparagraph shall not apply to any offense involving [ five ] grams or less of marihuana . ”
Should Feinstein ’s bill become law , the stipulation of five grams or less would absolutely lead prosecutions to level claims as to how much plant matter was used in the preparation of various drug - laced concoctions , which could be a highly subjective science .
ADVERTISEMENT
Interestingly , the legislation gives no preferred mode of calculating the correlation of the plant matter ’s weight and the actual , tangible drug effect and content of the finished product , seemingly leaving a drastic space for ambiguity and Ã‚Â interpretation .
However , she also opposes Proposition 19 , California ’s marijuana legalization initiative , alleging that it would tie the hands of law enforcement , preventing officers from making stops and arrests of drivers stoned on marijuana .
Feinstein even signed a ballot argument with Mothers Against Drunk Driving , citing specifically stoned school bus drivers as the principle threat to post - legalized society .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Let ’s assess her argument point by point , ” began L.A. Times writer Paul Armentano .
“ First , Proposition 19 explicitly states that it will not amend or undermine existing state law criminalizing motorists who operate a vehicle while impaired by pot .
Driving under the influence of marijuana is already illegal in California , and violators are vigorously prosecuted .
This fact will not change under the initiative .
“ Second , Proposition 19 in no way undermines federal drug - free workplace rules , just as the state ’s 14 - year experience with legalized medical marijuana has not done so .
Further , it does not limit the ability of employers to sanction or fire employees who show up to work under the influence of pot .
Just as a private or public employer today may dismiss workers for being impaired by legal alcohol , employers in the future will continue to be able to fire employees who arrive to work under the influence of marijuana . ”
“ Some medical marijuana users are so sick that they are unable to smoke their medicine and must eat it in baked goods or lozenges , ” pleaded activist group Students for Sensible Drug Policy .
“ They are already breaking federal law and risking prosecution but if S. 258 passes , the penalties they face would double .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Please write your two United States Senators today and urge them to defeat this heartless bill . ”
The act was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in mid-June and is awaiting a vote by the Senate at - large .
While the idea of transplanting an entire face from a corpse -- including the eyelids , tear ducts , and mouth -- might seem , well , gross , you probably do n't suffer from a face deforming genetic disorder .
For the 35 - year - old patient " Jerome , " it 's a technical miracle .
The successful operation , carried out by Laurent Lantieri , is a claimed world 's first and was completed just a few weeks ago at the Creteil Henri-Mondor hospital outside of Paris .
According to local newspaper reports , the patient , who had been waiting two years for the surgery , gave an enthusiastic " thumbs up " when he first saw his new face in the mirror .
Naturally , the operation also reconnects nerves and blood vessels using a microscope -- in fact , the patient 's beard has even started to grow in .
God complex , deserved , Dr. Lantieri .
P.S.

Please read our agenda — a lot has changed since I wrote up this introductory article
So many people lately seem to be coming forward with these amazing stories of how marijuana helped their autistic child .
I ’m truly happy for these people , but they ’re only telling one side of the story .
They succeeded .
For whatever reasons , their endeavor paid off and made their lives better .
We do n’t have this kind of success story to tell , and I think that ’s exactly why our story needs to be heard .
Alexander
My son was born almost nine years ago .
He was diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis , a relatively uncommon disorder that varies wildly from person to person , at just six weeks old .
In Alex ’s case , the most noticeable symptoms it caused were seizures and autism .
The seizures have been treated with various medications over the years , but the real problem we faced ( since he was four or so ) was the well - known situation of autism rage .
Specifically , he would hurt himself .
At first , Alex was happy most of the time .
As time passed , his happiness became less common , and the self - injurious behaviors became the norm .
To paraphrase from multiple specialists who have helped us over the years , “ autistic children sometimes do this , and we do n’t know why . ”
We talked to behaviorists and a psychiatrist .
We tried at least one medication from every family of drugs the psychiatrist felt could help this kind of condition , including Zoloft , Risperdal , Naltrexone , Ativan , Valium , and finally Haldol .
Nothing but the Haldol ever really helped , and that ’s only because it was a huge dose meant for short - term control — it did the job , but also turned Alex into a zombie .
One last hope ?
Late in 2009 , we realized we could no longer take care of our son .
He was too strong and beginning to get so dangerous to himself and us that the only way we could restrain him was by putting him or ourselves at risk .
He bloodied his face regularly , gave himself a black eye a few times , and busted open his lip at least once .
( See our videos for some really gruesome footage of the intensity of Alex ’s rage )
The thought of letting somebody else take care of Alex was too much to bear , so my wife started doing research on what we could do to help him .
We found that there was a possible connection between his Vagus Nerve Stimulator ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve_stimulation) and psychotic rage , so we pushed hard and eventually convinced the doctors to turn down the intensity of the electric current sent to his brain .
After that , his seizures came back , and we had to crank it back up because the one episode was so intense it required an ER visit .
Worse still , in the days afterward , his behavior seemed to get worse .
I told my wife we needed to call the state and tell them to find a place for him .
I just could n’t deal with it anymore .
Toward Christmas , she found some articles about medical marijuana and children with autism and rage .
We were at first surprised that anybody would think of such a thing , but kept digging and the pieces seemed to fit .
After some research on marijuana itself , we believed that we had little to lose in trying it .
After all , it ’s just a plant , and certainly could n’t hurt any more than pumping the poor child full of valium , right ?
Scientific evidence seemed to confirm that the worst - case scenario would be an overdose resulting in Alex falling asleep .
We simply did n’t consider this too great a risk .
We got his medical marijuana card for the seizures .
The law does n’t include autism or rage in Oregon , but his seizures were a qualifying condition , and if it worked , we could turn his VNS down again and remove some meds that have pretty awful side - effects .
Early successes and false hope
At first , we did n’t know how to give him the medication .
Neither of us ever experimented with pot in our teenage years , and did n’t really care to now .
We were donated some hash oil , and just made guesses about how much was a dose .
Imagine being told by a doctor you had to guess at how much Tylenol to give your child … .
Fortunately , unlike Tylenol , marijuana does n’t have any fatal overdose risks .
Eventually we had some truly amazing results .
We almost had it down to a science – 75 microliters of hash oil seemed to calm him a bit .
150 usually made him very relaxed , but a bit too sleepy .
There were multiple occasions early on where the dose was so perfect that he became relaxed but very attentive .
He explored his world with his hands , something he was very rarely able to do .
His hands were the enemy up to this point .
If they were n’t tucked inside his shirt , he was beating himself up .
On many occasions he brought us clothing to put over a shirt to make it harder to for him to get his hands out .
He had become afraid of his own body .
But on those few truly magical days when we got the dosing just right , he played .
He used his hands to explore .
He looked at us and smiled .
I can honestly say those were the happiest moments I had known in years .
We were very hopeful at this point , but unfortunately it did n’t last .
We ran out
It ’s that simple .
Our donated supply had run out .
We could n’t get in contact with a grower , and Oregon law does n’t allow dispensaries ( and if it did we could n’t likely afford it anyway , based on costs I ’ve seen in CA ) .
We got a later donation of hash , but it was a very small amount and did n’t last long enough to matter .
We even tried Marinol , but it was available only in capsules .
I ’d love to see somebody convince a nonverbal child to swallow a capsule .
Alex stopped eating , drinking , and sleeping .
Multiple ER visits later , we went through the heart - wrenching process of relocating our son 200 miles from home .
There was no place closer that could take him .
I used up all my sick and vacation time staying at home to help try to keep him safe , using Oregon ’s Family Medical Leave
Act to avoid being fired ( though my employer was very understanding , I was still concerned about being let go eventually ) .
We visit Alex a little bit , but it ’s about a four - hour drive one way , so it ’s averaged about once every two or three weeks .
It ’s nowhere near enough for a child who has no idea why mom and dad are suddenly out of his life .
We ’re working right now to move closer to him , but even then we will only see him a couple times a week or so .
For the past five years , Alex has been my entire life outside of work .
After work I ’d care for him to give my wife a break .
I took care of him , played with him , and slept in his room almost every single night .
On weekends , it was a joint effort , but rarely did I ever get too far from him for very long .
He was my world .
Being away from him is the worst thing that ’s ever happened to me .
We ’re less stressed , we have more free time , and finally my other son gets to see me and play with me .
But for over two months now I ’ve had a hole that nothing can hope to fill .
A website called WikiLeaks just published secret documents related to the war between the U.S. and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
The documents detail deals , armed conflicts , strategies , politics , intelligence operations and some casualties from 2004 and 2010 , painting the most complete , publicly available picture of the Afghan War yet .
The event is in some ways comparable to the leak of the Pentagon Papers , a set of documents that provided a behind - the - scenes look at the American war in Vietnam .
Those papers reached the public via major media outlets in 1971 .
At more than 90,000 reports , WikiLeaks 's Afghan War Diary is even more substantial .
By some measures it is the biggest intelligence leak to date .
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told UK newspaper
The Guardian that the size of the leak is only one dimension of its significance :
This situation is different in that it's not just more material and being pushed to a bigger audience and much sooner ... but rather that people can give back .
So people around the world who are reading this are able to comment on it and put it in context and understand the full situation .
That is not something that has previously occurred .
And that is something that can only be brought about as a result of the Internet .
Two months ago , we put WikiLeaks first in a list of innovative websites that could reshape the news .
The site accepts submissions of confidential political or corporate documents , reviews them to make sure they 're accurate , then publishes them on the web for anyone to see .
WikiLeaks has previously leaked e-mails from vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and a video of U.S. soldiers killing civilians .
Assange was careful to point out that the Afghan War Diary is comprised of old reports , not future military plans , so its usefulness to NATO 's enemies in the battlefield should be limited .
The people able to make the most informed decisions about whether or not the release of information can endanger American interests or lives are those working inside the Pentagon , but those are the very people WikiLeaks is trying to keep accountable .
The controversy of values is clear .
WikiLeaks is able to solicit submissions from all over the world while avoiding jurisdiction by operating in several countries at once — or none at all , depending on your interpretation of the situation .
This was n't possible before the web .
Now it is , and the implications for society are significant .
How the Leak Happened
The Afghan War Diary was simultaneously given to reporters from The New York Times , The Guardian and Der Spiegel several weeks in advance so those reporters could study the documents and provide context with their public release .
It was also given to those three publications so that no one national government could censor it .
WikiLeaks removed data that could implicate its sources , but the U.S. military already has an alleged WikiLeaks source in custody : 22 - year - old intelligence analyst Bradley Manning , who The Guardian says is suspected as the source of the video that depicted U.S. soldiers killing civilians .
So far we 've seen no evidence for or against any connection between the Afghan War Diary and Manning .
Politico reports that the White House released a critical statement in response to the leak , saying the U.S. " strongly condemns " the disclosure .
The statement criticized WikiLeaks for not approaching the White House for comment or verification , and claimed that the bleak logs record events that took place before the Obama administration 's change in strategy .
What the Leak Includes
The three publications given early access to the reports have made a few similar observations about what they say .
Foremost is that the situation in Afghanistan is bleaker than any of the governments involved would have you believe , particularly when it comes to collaboration between the U.S. and Pakistan .
Several reports either directly or indirectly implicate the ISI , a Pakistani intelligence agency , in aiding Taliban fighters .
There are some suggestions in the reports that current or former members of the ISI have actually met with Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders to collaboratively organize attacks on American troops .
However , The New York Times notes that some of the reports on that subject come from Afghanistan intelligence , which has a negative relationship with Pakistan and a potential interest in damaging its reputation .
Other reports detail NATO - ordered civilian killings , specifics as to why NATO progress has been slow at best , and other bleak pictures of the activities in the war .
Apart from the WikiLeaks website , you can find report specifics in an interactive map The Guardian produced to highlight 300 critical reports found in the leak .

Can green homes really be affordable ?
To stand out in a still sluggish housing market , more builders are beginning to offer average - priced , ultra - efficient homes .
In Beaverton , Ore. , Green One Construction Services is building a zero - net - energy development of 18 homes designed to produce at least as much power as they use .
Follow Green House on Twitter
The three - bedroom Sage Green homes , the first five of which are complete , come with superior insulation , triple - glazed windows and solar panels .
Prices start at $ 257,900 .
( You can see more pictures on Preston Koerner 's Jetson Green blog . )
This month in Gilbert , Ariz. , a southeast Phoenix suburb , Meritage Homes unveiled a new development -- Lyon 's Gate -- that aims to be 80 % more efficient than regular , code - compliant homes .
Included in the $ 174,900 base price are nine - inch thick exterior walls , a thermostat that can be remotely programmed using an iPhone and an ECHO solar electric / thermal system that can produce up to 10 kilowatts of power annually -- about half the amount consumed by a regular house .
" If customers respond to this , this will become the way we build houses , " C.R. Herro , Meritage 's vice president for environmental affairs , told the Arizona Republic .
" If we built these with $ 50,000 worth of ( green ) features and charged $ 50,000 more , we would n't sell one ... I 'm building these for people who could n't care less about energy efficiency . "
Energy bills are estimated to run about $ 734 annually for the 1,640 - square - foot model and $ 1,218 per year for the largest , 3,062 - square - foot one .
Suing tens of thousands of accused peer - to - peer movie file - swappers — it can be a lucrative business model , but it works well only when Internet service providers can turn huge lists of IP addresses into real names and addresses in a timely fashion .
But what if a major ISP like Time Warner Cable only had to do 28 of these lookups a month ?
And might take three years to burn through its entire list ?
Time Warner Cable has pleaded with the federal judge overseeing several of the P2P cases brought this year by the US Copyright Group .
The company averages 567 IP lookup requests per month , nearly all of them coming from law enforcement .
These lookup requests involve everything from suicide threats to child abduction to terrorist activity , and the company says that such cases take " immediate priority . "
It says that , without a major staffing increase , it simply cannot turn around more than 1,000 requests in a timely fashion without compromising the much more important requests from law enforcement .
TWC requested that the judge limit subpoena lookups for the US Copyright Group to 28 per month .
In response , lawyer Tom Dunlap blasted TWC as a " good ISP for copyright infringers . "
He went on to threaten the company , saying , " To the extent TWC ’s tactics are just that — letting the public know that TWC is a good ISP for copyright infringers because TWC will fight any subpoenas related to infringers ’ activities — TWC exposes itself to a claim for contributory copyright infringement . "
Judge Rosemary Collyer , who is overseeing the Far Cry and The Steam Experiment cases , does n't agree .
In a recent ruling , she has modified TWC 's subpoenas so that the company " shall provide identifying information for a minimum of 28 IP addresses per month . "
And that 's not 28 per month , per case ; it 's 28 per month total for both cases combined .
How long will it take to get through all these subpoenas ?
Several months ago , TWC faced 809 lookup requests related to the Far Cry case alone .
Since that time , the plaintiffs have added several thousand more IP addresses to the case , and more requests have come from the Steam Experiment case .
Assuming a lowball estimate of 1,000 IP addresses that belong to TWC , the company may take nearly three years to do all of its lookups .
Collyer 's ruling does n't affect the other P2P cases brought by US Copyright Group that are being heard by other judges , and it does n't affect other ISPs ( TWC was the only one to object so strongly ) .
But it does suggest that federal judges are sympathetic to the argument that law firms can't simply dump thousands upon thousands of IP addresses on ISPs and demand quick responses .
In addition , Judge Collyer refused to " sever " the thousands of defendants in each case , as requested by the EFF and ACLU .
" But they may be severed in the future , " she wrote .

If we ’ve been a little quiet today , it ’s because a copy of Anthony Bourdain ’s new tome , Medium Raw : A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook , has hit our desk ahead of its June 8 publication date .
Like Kitchen Confidential before it , it ’s a compulsively readable collection of short essays , but rather than narrowly focusing on the restaurant industry , it touches on topics as diverse as the evil of McDonald ’s , the oxymoron of being a “ cool dad , ” and even the fallout from his first marriage ( without getting too much into it , Tone confesses to visiting brothels , drunk driving , and contemplating suicide in the Caribbean ) .
But the real question is :
Who made Bourdain ’s shit list this time around ?
Bourdain is , as you ’d expect , noticeably softer on Emeril and his ilk , but he devotes an entire chapter to one Alan Richman .
In fact , the name of the chapter is “ Alan Richman Is a Douchebag . ”
Back when Richman slammed Les Halles , Bourdain told Grub Street , “ It was like being mauled by Gumby .
Afterwards , you ’re not sure it even happened . ”
But he ’s much more vociferous here , reprimanding Richman for failing to mention “ the most cogent point ” that , weeks before the review , Bourdain had nominated him for “ Douchebag of the Year ” at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival ( before that , Richman had put down the New Orleans restaurant scene in GQ ) .
After blowing three pages slamming Richman for the New Orleans put - down , Bourdain then goes on to criticize one of Richman ’s “ restaurant commandments ” against absentee chefs : “ Richman ’s Commandment # 19 is a fucking insult to the very people who ’ve been cooking and creating dishes for him for years .
What ’s worse is that , once again , this uniquely gas - engorged douche knows better .
But rest assured that while he has no problem giving the stiff middle finger to the people who actually prepare his food , he will be sure to remain in good odor with the ‘ celebrity ’ chefs he claims — on our behalf , no doubt — to be outraged by . ”
He admits that Richman has a “ discerning palate , ” but returning to the subject of his Les Halles slam , decides , “ So , maybe I got it wrong .
Alan Richman is not a douchebag .
He ’s a cunt . ”
That settles that !
There ’s also plenty of fence - mending ( Bourdain calls onetime foe Jamie Oliver a “ hero ” for his work with school lunches ) , and tomorrow we ’ll take a closer look at what might be the book ’s most compelling chapter ( in which he tries to get into the mind of David Chang ) , but in the meantime , let ’s see who else get short shrift in Medium Raw .
Food Network
With every critical outrage — the humiliating , painful - to - watch Food Network Awards , the clumsily rigged - looking Next Food Network Star , the cheesily cheap - jack production values of Next Iron Chef America — every obviously , half - assed knock - off they slapped on the air would go on to ring up sky - high ratings and an ever - larger audience of cherished males twenty - two to thirty - six ( or whatever that prime car - buying demographic is ) .
Celebrity Restaurants
Rich international douchebags and those who love them will happily pay those kinds of prices simply to be jammed into tiny , dollhouse - size banquettes , cheek by Botoxed jowl at Nello — or to poke at faux Chinese food in graveyards of the uber - rich , like Mr. Chow and Philippe .
Add to the mix some curiously available Eastern European women who find low - riding ball - sacks distinctly fascinating ?
You ’ve got yourself a recipe for success .
Culinary School
I am frequently asked by aspiring chefs , dreamers young and old , attracted by the lure of slowly melting shallots and caramelizing pork belly , or delusions of Food Network stardom , if they should go to culinary school .
I usually give a long , thoughtful and qualified answer .
But the short answer is ‘ no . ’ ”
Factory Hamburgers
This Cargill outfit is the largest private company in America .
A hundred and sixteen billion dollars in revenue a year .
And they feel the need to save a few cents on their low - end burgers by buying shit processed in ammonia ?
Scraps have to be whipped or extracted or winnowed out or rendered before they can put them into a patty mix ?
Mystery meat assembled from all over the world and put through one grinder — like one big , group grope in moist , body - temperature sheets — with strangers ?
Alice Waters
In the same way , having Alice Waters on your side of the argument is like having Alec Baldwin or Barbara Streisand endorse your candidate ( a feeling I know all too well ) .
You may agree with everything they say , but you wish they ’d just shut the fuck up …
Then she chose to cook Leslie [ Stahl , on 60 Minutes ] a single egg over a roaring wood fire in her Berkeley home .
I do n’t know about you , but burning up a couple of cords of firewood for a single fucking egg does n’t exactly send a message of sustainability …
I , for one , after reading all the accounts , official and unofficial , of Alice ’s career and the history of Chez Pannise , ca n’t find a single supporting source to verify she was ever a chef .
And yet , year after year , she is described adoringly as such by people who know her .
Gael Greene
Gael joins the ranks of the damned because she moderated a panel discussion at the 92nd Street Y in New York City a while back — and she was lucky enough to have Fergus Henderson on her panel and she barely acknowledged him .
She kept getting his name wrong .
She blathered on and on about her favorite subject ( herself ) while ignoring the most influential chef of the last ten years sitting a few feet away .
Alain Ducasse
Alain Ducasse , on the other hand , is a villain .
Because he almost single - handedly brought down fine dining in America with his absurdly pretentious restaurant Alain Ducasse New York ( ADNY , as it was known ) …
To use an egregiously overused expression , ADNY was where fine dining jumped the shark .
The James Beard House
Speaking of old fuckers :
The James Beard House goes on the villains list — because it harbors and gives safe haven to villains .
It gives them somewhere to go .
It provides comfort and succor and the illusion of importance to a bunch of supremely irrelevant old fucks who have nothing to do and nothing to say of any significance to the restaurant business they claim to support and love .

Take John Mariani , the professional junketeer over at Esquire , whose “ likes and dislikes ” ( shower cap in his comped hotel , attractive waitresses , car service ) are communicated , as if telepathically , to chefs before his arrival .
( Motherfucker hands out pre-printed recipe cards on arrival , with instructions on how to prepare his cocktail of choice — a daiquiri . )
This guy has been a one - man schnorrer for decades .
He ’s been caught red - handed on numerous occasions — but his employers continue to dissemble on his behalf .
Alinea
My meal there was one of the longest , least pleasurable meals of my life .
Twenty minutes in , and I was looking at the little menu card , counting the ( many ) dishes to come , ticking off the hours , minutes , and seconds I ’d have to remain before earning my freedom .
I thought it lethally self - serious , usually pointless , silly , annoying , and generally joyless .
It was , for me , a misery from beginning to end .

Vegetarians
I do n’t care what you do in your home , but the idea of a vegetarian traveler in comfortable shoes waving away the hospitality — the distillation of a lifetime of training and experience — of , say , a Vietnamese pho vendor ( or Italian mother - in - law , for that matter ) fills me with sputtering indignation .
Guy Fieri
I do n’t dislike Guy Fieri , I realized , after many viewings of his cooking shows , much soul - searching at my personal ashram and many doses of prescription hypnotics .
I just dislike — really dislike — the idea that somebody would put Texas - style barbecue inside a fucking nori roll .

The eye - searing “ Kwanzaa Cake ” clip on YouTube , of Sandra Lee doing things with store - bought angel food cake , canned frosting , and corn nuts , instead of being simply the unintentionally hilarious viral video it should be , makes me mad for all humanity .

Venezuela head threatens US oil cut over Colombia row Published duration 25 July 2010
image caption Mr Chavez has long accused the US of plotting to oust him
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has threatened to halt oil exports to the US if his country is attacked by Colombia - a close US ally .
The threat comes amid an escalating dispute over allegations that Venezuela is harbouring Colombian rebels .
Mr Chavez broke diplomatic ties with Colombia last week and put his army on high alert .
Venezuela is America 's fifth biggest source of imported oil , supplying about a million barrels a day .
Mr Chavez said he had received intelligence that " the possibility of armed aggression against Venezuela from Colombia was higher than it had ever been " .
" If there was any attack on Venezuela from Colombian territory or from anywhere else , promoted by the Yankee empire , we would suspend oil shipments to the US , even if we have to eat stones , " he said .
" We would not send one more drop to US refineries . "
The left - wing Venezuelan leader also said he had cancelled a trip to Cuba to celebrate a revolutionary anniversary with his close ally , President Raul Castro , because of the danger of attack .
Detailed allegations
A dispute over whether Venezuela allows Colombian Farc and ELN rebels to operate from its territory has dogged ties between the two South American nations for the past eight years .
But relations hit a new low last week when Colombia presented detailed allegations , including maps , photographs and testimony from guerrilla deserters .
Venezuela vehemently denies the accusation , and Mr Chavez has accused Colombia of trying to create a pretext for US military intervention against him .
He has also accused Colombia 's outgoing President Alvaro Uribe - who leaves office next month - of trying to prevent an improvement in relations with Venezuela under his successor , Juan Manuel Santos .
Mr Uribe - a close ally of the US - has made the fight against left - wing rebels the main priority of his presidency .
In a newspaper interview published on Sunday , he said he could not understand why guerrilla leaders sheltering in Venezuela were not arrested .
" I leave office with the sadness that these terrorists still have the capacity to inflict damage from outside the country , " he said .
In 2008 Mr Uribe sent Colombian troops into neighbouring Ecuador to attack a rebel base , killing the Farc leader , Raul Reyes .
His decision to give US forces access to military bases inside Colombia has been another cause of concern for Venezuela .
In part two , we ’re going to take a look at a piece I created called ‘ Sever ’ .
It ’s based on the generative template described previously .
Here , you can download the full source .
The idea behind this piece was to have some sort of organic strand or thread that unravels and splits apart , much like the vein of some abstract creature .
This is accomplished by a series of strands that draw in a sinusoidal pattern while shrinking and occasionally splattering symbols and dots along its path .
There is some moderately heavy math involved which we ’ll get into later , but for now let ’s focus on the structure .
There are two classes , the document class ( Sever.as ) and the Strand class .
All of the display and setup functionality is being handled in the document class , while the drawing functionality is handled in Strand.as .
First , let ’s take a look at the document class , Server.as .
I am setting a static variable ‘ S ’ that will be used for objects of our Strand class to communicate back by using the syntax : Server.S. ( public property or function ) .
Remember to import Server.as in Strand.as .
Back in our document class , note that we are only adding one display object to the stage , bmp .
This is a Bitmap object that all of our strands will draw into , we are bypassing the vector renderer entirely , in this piece we will be generating way too much vector information for any computer to handle effectively .
After adding bmp , we call setupStripes which basically creates a pinstripe pattern across the entire screen and draws that into stripes BmpData .
We will set one of our Strand objects to act as a mask for this graphic as you can see on line 55 of Server.as .
That brings us to the setupStrands function .
This function uses a for loop to create 20 strands and places them all in the middle of the stage horizontally ( they initialize with a y position of the height of the stage , or the bottom ) .
I add references to these objects in the strandArr array for easy access later .
As stated above , we are setting one of the Strands to be the mask of our stripes Bmp , so that when it draws it reveals that image .
We are also adding a subtle drop shadow filter [ ds ] to each Strand .
After our main display objects are set up , we add an Event .
ENTER_FRAME listener to the stage .
In the listener function , you will see that we are doing three things on each frame : First , we are calling runStrands ( ) which makes each strand draw the next part in it ’s sequence , next we draw everything to our main display object , bmp , then we clear all the vectors out of each Strand object .
This process is optimized for performance , and as stated before , we are bypassing the vector renderer completely and are keeping all of our Sprite objects clear .
In this case , the Strands are our Sprite objects as they extend the Sprite class .
Now onto the fun stuff : the Strand class .
Inside Strand.as , you will find in the constructor function that we are setting an array of colors for the fills , and one for the symbols ( splatterings ) .
Then we call our init function , which sets the initial conditions for the strand .
These include the random color from the fill array , the y position ( which is always the height of the stage on init ) , the x position which is somewhere within 80 pixels in each direction from the center of the stage horizontally , sX which is what we increment by inc to get our sine wav pattern , spread which is how far left and right the strand fluctuates , inc which is the number we use to increment sX , xOffset which continually shifts the Strand left or right , and sizeOffset which is the rate at which the Strand shrinks .
Our drawStrand function is being called from the document class .
This is to avoid having numerous Event .
ENTER_FRAME listeners active .
When this function is called , it checks if the strand has either shrunken beyond sight or gone offscreen .
If any of those conditions are met , init is called and it starts over with all new properties .
Then it draws a circle at the current xPos and yPos coordinates , randomly calls the splatter function , then called moveOn which calculates the next coordinates to draw a circle to .
It does this by incrementing sX by inc and taking into account the spread and xOffset variables .
The y position is always just moved up 2 pixels each frame .
It also shrinks the size of the next circle by using the sizeOffset variable .
These equations came out after a lot experimentation , change them around to see what results you can get , or even add more factors to the equation to make the system even more complex .
The final thing to go over is the splatter function .
This is randomly called 1 out of 100 frames and creates ( usually ) a splattering of circles at random positions and sizes close to the main xPos and yPos coordinates .
It also draws symbols that have been drawn in the symbols_mc located in Sever.fla .
If you look in Server. fla , right click on symbols_mc , and click Properties , you will notice I ’ve given this movie clip a class name of Symbol , so that we can create an object of that class in our code .
These symbols are placed into an array for later removal by the clearGraphics function in the document class , if these symbols were allowed to build up over time , our program would crash to a screeching halt .
We color each symbol based on a random color from the symColorArr array .
Feel free to reuse these files in your own experimentation , but please kindly link back if you post any of your derivative works .

There is also a PRINT of this design too !
There 's an amazing story in today 's New York Times .
Titled " From Untouchable to Business Woman , " it 's a chronicle of one woman 's journey .
But it 's a much larger story , really .
Advertisement
The piece focuses on Kakuben Lalabhai Parmar , a 50 - year - old woman from a rural village in the western Indian state of Gujarat .
When the author meets her , she is selling her wares in Times Square .
At a practical level , Ms. Parmar 's trip required a series of unusual conveyances , among them a bullock cart , a trishaw , the flatbed of a Jeep and the open - topped shuttle bus she rode to reach an airport before boarding a form of transport she had seldom seen up close before , let alone ridden ... At a deeper cultural level , her journey is yet stranger and more wonderful , embodying as it does a half - century of global feminism and the evolutionary arc of modern India .
In the cattle - herding community Ms. Parmar belongs to , one among a cluster of groups categorized by the Indian constitution as " scheduled castes , " women were traditionally bound not just to their region or village but to the home .
Advertisement
The " scheduled castes " or tribes - also known as Adivas - are loosely defined today as those formerly described as " Untouchables . "
( Although in some cases the term may refer to those in remote rural areas who did not participate in the caste system . )
Previously known by the British as " the depressed classes , " scheduled castes are explicitly recognized by the constitution .
The words are generally a byword for poverty .
Ms. Parmar 's earlier life was typical of that of a woman from her village .
Married at 14 , she had virtually no contact with the world outside her home .
Things changed when the not - for - profit Sewa Project came to her village in an effort to preserve traditional handicrafts .
Ms. Parmar started selling the hand - embroidered patchwork fabric she made , and is now what the article calls " an informal ambassador for Sewa and the Crafts Council of India . "
She is her family 's breadwinner and has been able to buy cattle and install plumbing and electricity .
As she tells the Times , " When I was a girl , all the assets belonged to the father or the husband or the brother ... in those days , the husband was in charge of everything ... What could you do , with no skills and no education ? "
Now , she says , " that I have my own business and make my own money , my husband shows me respect . "
It 's an amazing story by any standard , but it's hard to conceive of the difference from Parmar 's earlier life .
Writing in a report for the Princeton Gender and Policy Network , one researcher reported that , " through many conversations we realized that the SC women we talked to had trouble even imagining their lives being led with the same dignity as a man of the same caste or as an upper caste woman .
Their only reference for a better life was " backward " caste women who also worked as agricultural laborers , but without the stigma of untouchability . "
In recent years , the treatment of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has become an issue with some human rights organizations .
Recent reports of the sexual and physical abuse of Hindu Scheduled Cast women have galvanized organizations like the International Solidarity Network .
But on a personal level , that Ms. Parmar is nor merely leading by example but agitating actively for women 's rights is probably as effective an advocate for change as exists .
An ambassador indeed .

PREDATORS SYNOPSIS :
Royce ( Adrien Brody ) regains consciousness in freefall , plummeting towards the ground .
His parachute barely saves him - likewise half a dozen strangers who land around him , each ignorant of why and where they are .
But they soon get the gist : someone or something is hunting them .
Royce himself is a hunter - a cold - blooded mercenary whose only allegiance is to those who pay him .
He assumes command over this group of elite warriors who come to realize they 've been brought together on an alien planet ... as prey .
With the exception of unarmed medical doctor Edwin ( Topher Grace ) , they are all cold - blooded killers - mercenaries , Yakuza , convicts , death squad members - human predators who are now being systemically hunted and eliminated by a new breed of alien Predators .
Review by Louise Keller :
Delivering on its promise , Predators is a moody , unrelenting and attention - grabbing sci- fi thriller , filled with action , splendid visual effects and packed with undulating tension .
True to its 80s film origins , and using its broad concept as a springboard , the ante of the premise of an invisibly cloaked extra terrestrial warrior is raised and a twist added .
The dense jungle may be like the Amazon , but the location is planets away , and the writers that producer Robert Rodriguez has commissioned , have cleverly made the problem of relocating its human characters one of the intriguing plot points .
Beyond its spectacular effects and mega - budget , it 's good old fashioned entertainment of the B - movie kind , with a strong premise , nicely drawn characters and ace performances from a team of actors spearheaded by Adrien Brody , that make us give more than a damn .
In the attention - grabbing opening frames , we watch as Brody 's Royce freefalls through the sky , and lands unceremoniously in the middle of an impenetrable jungle filled with gigantic trees with protruding branches , thick undergrowth , barren rock faces and massive waterfalls .
Soon , he and his six unknown companions ( who all arrive in similar fashion ) , all armed with heavy artillery , are up against a devastating adversary with a cloaking device , infra red capabilities , brute force , and minds as contorted as the gnarled tree trunks around them .
Thrown together by necessity rather than choice , they 're an unruly bunch of alpha stereotypes , made more credible by the fact their behaviour reflects who they really are .
Predictably ( and at times with humour ) , there is conflict between them , as they realise it is not coincidental that they , as professional killers and criminals have been chosen and brought here .
Brody is utterly credible as the focused , adaptable mercenary Royce , who thinks on his feet , strategizes and whose survival skills are second to none .
He quotes Hemingway , too , much to the surprise of Alice Braga 's Isabelle , the athletic Israeli sniper whose Achilles heel is her heart .
Topher Grace shows another side as the disgraced doctor with a secret .
Each member of the group adds colour - the samurai warrior who does n't speak much ( Louis Ozawa Changchien ) , the tattooed serial killer ( Walton Goggins ) , the African soldier - warlord ( Mahershalalhashbaz Ali ; ' I 'z as bad as you are ; those things are worse ' ) , the tough Russian soldier ( Oleg Tartakov ) , the recluse with an imaginary friend ( Laurence Fishburne ) and cowboy assassin ( Danny Trejo ) , whose unforgettable face speaks volumes from each wrinkle , scar and crevice .
The visuals are stunning , as are the awesome , terrifying predators , which become more formidable as we climb the pecking order .
It 's a race against time , a battle of wits as Royce and gang keep one step ahead of the brutal force and formidable destruction of their adversaries .
It 's edge of the seat stuff with John Debney 's pounding music score enhancing the massive stunts , superb cinematography , lighting and strong production elements .
Fantasy sci-fi action in impressive form .
Review by Andrew L. Urban :
As every master - chef knows , if you start with good ingredients , a bit of imagination and have a top team in the kitchen , you can make even a hamburger qualify as cuisine .
In 1994 Robert Rodriguez was hired to write a new , fresh version of Predator , the franchise that started in 1987 , starring Arnold Schwarzenegger .
A big fan of the film , Rodriguez set about writing a new script , without the constraints of having to think about budgets and such .
He threw caution to the wind .
Years passed and he got very busy , so when asked by Fox to direct it , he suggested producing it instead , at his Troublemaker Studios .
And he got himself a top team in the kitchen , starting with Hungarian born director Nimród Antal ( winner of the Youth Award at Cannes in 2004 for Kontroll ) and one of Antal 's favourite cinematographers , fellow Hungarian Gyula Pados ( who shot Kontroll ) .
Retaining the jungle setting of the 1987 original , this fresh new Predators combines commando style action with sci- fi elements in an utterly compelling way .
The spectacular opening scene of a man freefalling from the sky begins the adrenaline flow , which hardly stops until the climactic showdown between the predators and the prey .
Predators meets every expectation the young male target audience could have .
A small group of professional mercenaries and killers - strangers to each other - has been dropped into this jungle on another planet by aliens ; and this time , they are the prey .
There is one sharpshooting female among the hard - nosed group , Isabelle , superbly played by Alice Braga , who reveals her demons just as the others reveal the terrible things they have done to survive in combat as predators .
These are deeply flawed characters , hardly the kind of heroes or role models who normally populate action films .
But the thing is , the terrifying alien predators with extraordinary powers of shielding themselves and capable of firing deadly rays are so much worse .
Adrien Brody makes a totally credible action anti-hero , and is supported by a motley crew of bad - ass characters like Nikolai ( Oleg Tartakov ) the likeable Russian spirited out of Chechnya and Cuchillo ( Danny Trejo ) , a Mexican drug bandit .
There is also a small but bang - up cameo by Laurence Fishburne who delivers in spades as the mysterious hermit - like survivor , Noland .
John Debney 's score underpins the sense of constant danger while the green - blooded creatures and the gory fight scenes are out of this world ( literally ) .
Full of surprises and twists , the action and the relationships between the contrasting characters keeps us glued .

NY Times 's excuse for not calling waterboarding " torture " does n't hold water
By now you 've heard about that surprising new Harvard study finding that news orgs that routinely called waterboarding " torture " for many years suddenly shifted away from the term after it became public that the Bush administration had sanctioned it .
The New York Times has now explained the reasoning behind its decision , and it 's pretty surprising .
The paper disputed the study 's accuracy , but it gave Michael Calderone a statement acknowledging the shift and conceding that Bush administration entreaties were partly responsible :
" As the debate over interrogation of terror suspects grew post - 9/11 , defenders of the practice ( including senior officials of the Bush administration ) insisted that it did not constitute torture , " a Times spokesman said in a statement .
" When using a word amounts to taking sides in a political dispute , our general practice is to supply the readers with the information to decide for themselves .
Thus we describe the practice vividly , and we point out that it is denounced by international covenants and in American tradition as a form of torture . "
The Times ' explanation is that once Bush officials started arguing that waterboarding was n't torture , the only way to avoid taking sides was to stop using the word .
But here 's the problem :
Not using the word also consitutes taking a side :
That of the Bush administration .
That 's because this debate was n't merely a semantic one .
It was occuring in a legal context .
The administration 's critics pointed out that the decision to approve waterboarding was illegal under international law designating it torture .
The Bush administration argued that waterboarding is n't torture in order to argue that it is n't illegal .
The decision to refrain from calling waterboarding " torture " is tantamount to siding with the Bush administration 's claim that the act it acknowledged doing is not illegal under any statute .
No one is saying the Times should have adopted the role of judge and jury and proclaimed the Bush administration officially guilty .
Rather , the point is that by dropping use of the word " torture , " it took the Bush position -- against those who argued that the act Bush officials sanctioned is already agreed upon as illegal under the law .
Think of it this way :
We all agree that pickpocketing constitutes " theft . "
A pickpocket does n't get to come along and argue : " No , what I did is n't theft , it 's merely pickpocketing , and therefore it is n't illegal . "
Any newspaper that played along with a pickpocket 's demand to stop using the word " theft " would be taking the pickpocket 's side , not occupying any middle ground .
There is no middle ground here .
Current research suggests that taking morphine can block new blood vessel and tumor growth .
The related report by Koodie et al , " Morphine suppresses tumor angiogenesis through a HIF1α / p38MAPK pathway , " appears in the August 2010 issue of the American Journal of Pathology .
Morphine is currently the gold standard of analgesics used to relieve severe pain and suffering .
Angiogenesis , or new blood vessel growth , is critical for tumor progression from dormant to malignant .
Morphine is commonly used to treat cancer pain , but the effects of morphine use on new blood vessel and tumor growth remain controversial .
Using a clinically relevant morphine dose in a mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma , researchers led by Dr. Sabita Roy of the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis , MN examined the effect of morphine use on new blood vessel growth in tumors .
They found that chronic morphine use decreased levels of tumor angiogenesis in a manner dependent on the opioid receptor .
This effect was mediated by suppression of signaling induced by low oxygen concentrations , leading to a reduction in the levels of pro-angiogenic factors .
Therefore , morphine may not only serve as an analgesic for cancer patients , but may also inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth .
Koodie et al conclude that " morphine is a potential inhibitor of tumor growth , through the suppression of tumor cell - induced angiogenesis and hypoxia - induced p38 MAPK activation of HIF - 1 .
In addition to its analgesic potential , morphine can be exploited for its anti-angiogenic potential in cancer pain management ; these findings support the use of morphine for cancer pain management . "

South African motorsport 's governing body would only support a bid to host a grand prix on the provision that part of the proceeds would be channeled in to the development of the country 's racing infrastructure and help promote young and underprivileged home - grown talent .
Following on from the country 's successful hosting of the World Cup this summer , the South African Motorsport association indicated that it was incumbant on F1's stakeholders to follow FIFA 's example and help build up the grass roots infrastructure of the sport .
Bernie Ecclestone recently pointed to South Africa as one of several countries under consideration to host future rounds of the Formula One World Championship , suggesting that Cape Town would make a good potential venue .
But George Nyabadza , the chairman of the country 's motorsport body Motorsport South Africa , said that while he supported the idea in principal , he needed to see tangible benefits .
" F1 enjoys very little support in countries where there is no representation , " he said .
" Only when we can wave our rainbow flag will there be public interest and national unity . "
Nyabadza said he wanted to see very clear provisions of how much money would be generated for motorsport development , particularly in the female segment and the black youth segments of South Africa : " It would be irresponsible , " he said , " to host an F1 race and not have the stakeholders invest a portion of the proceeds in these segments .
" There would be no legacy for the sport . "
Nyabadza added that the government would need to conduct an economic impact study to weigh up the benefits against the ' substantial costs ' involved .
The MSA 's managing director Francois Pretorius said its governing body would only support hosting a grand prix if it provided concrete benefits to the grassroots development of motorsport , which would happen under the auspices of MSA .
According to a statement released by the MSA , Pretporius added that " the immediate socio- economic priorities in the country outweighed the possible long - term benefits of hosting the event unless a cogent and sustainable plan of sport development was provided for " .
The MSA made it clear that it would seriously consider support for any bidders prepared to factor these provisions into their proposal .
South Africa last hosted a grand prix at Kyalami in 1993 , which was won by Alain Prost in a Williams - Renault .
So , um , maybe you heard : there ’s a new iPhone out .
For my money ( and I shelled out plenty for it ) , the phone ’s best feature is the new “ Retina display , ” the eye - popping high - resolution screen .
Everything they say about it is true : at 320 ppi , the pixels are just plain invisible .
The crisp bright screen really looks as good as print , absolutely gorgeous .
But what soothes the eye also adds headaches for designers .
For three years , the iPhone came in just one flavor of screen resolution : the 3.5 - inch screen was always 320x480 pixels .
The new phone doubles the resolution to 640x960 pixels .
Suddenly , we ’re all designing for two different screens .
Fold in the iPad , and you ’ve got three iOS screens to juggle .
( Hey , it ’s better than designing for Android phones , which will have around 60 different devices and form factors by year end , but still … device fragmentation has arrived in its own small way in iOS land . )
Apple ’s done some nice work under the hood in iOS 4 to make this transition as easy as possible , but designers still have to take on some extra legwork .
Here ’s the gist .
I ’ll Give You Two Pixels for That Point
Starting in iOS 4 , dimensions are measured in “ points ” instead of pixels .
Conveniently enough , the iPhone screen is 320x480 points on both iPhone 4 and older models .
Since that matches the pixel dimensions on older phones , existing apps look and work the same on those phones in iOS 4 as they did in earlier operating systems .
There , one pixel is one point , a one - to - one match .
In other words , dimensions for all the various elements of iOS 4 remain the same , but their units have changed : you just substitute points where you used to say pixels .
( Ah , the travails of the hard - working tech writer ; the new phone was unveiled just two weeks after my new book Tapworthy went to press .
Though the 640x960 screen was already a foregone conclusion , it was n’t yet clear how iOS would handle the new resolution , so I had to treat the matter with benign neglect .
Alas , Tapworthy refers to all of its dimensions in pixels .
If you have the book , just squint a little and pretend it says “ points ” instead . )
On iPhone 4 , a point is two pixels ; draw a one - point line , and it shows up two pixels wide .
So : just specify your measurements in points for all devices , and iOS automatically draws everything to the right proportion on the screen .
Text and images remain the same physical size on both old and new phones .
That goes for bitmap images in legacy apps , too ; iOS 4 blows ‘em up , automatically pixel - doubling them to adapt to the new phone ’s resolution .
Of course , pixel - doubled images do n’t take advantage of the gloriously crisp display on the new phone .
That ’s where your extra legwork comes in : to add high - resolution images to your app , you have to include a second set of all your graphic files .
For every image in your app , add a second version that ’s twice the size , adding @ 2 x to the name .
For a low - resolution image named image.png , for example , you would add a second file named image@2x.png .
The new image will be picked up automatically by iPhone 4 .
Everywhere your code requests image.png ( or even just plain old image ) , image@2x.png will be used instead .
Really ?
Yep , Really
I know what you ’re thinking : “ Do I really have to make two versions of my images ?
If I make a single high - resolution set , wo n’t iOS 4 scale them down on older devices ? ”
Sorry , no , not automatically .
While iOS 4 goes seamlessly in the other direction ( scaling up low - res images for iPhone 4 ) , it does n’t work the other way .
By default , it scales all images so that one pixel equals one point .
That ’s a great solution for making sure that old apps work correctly on the new phone , but it does n’t help you go the other way ‘ round .
While you could add additional code to downsize each and every high - res image for older devices , that would a ) be a hassle , b ) reduce performance , and c ) create resized images that do n’t look as good as the original .
It might be extra work to create two sets of images for both old and new devices , but that ’s the right way to go .
In practice , that means Photoshop fans should learn to get comfortable with Illustrator or [ insert preferred vector application ] .
By building your app graphics in vector format , you can export them in whatever size you like with limited muss or fuss .
This almost certainly wo n’t be the last time we see a new iPhone screen resolution emerge , and you can be ready for the next time by prepping all your graphics in vector formats .
( Some folks , including Sebastiaan de With and Rusty Mitchell saw this coming a long time ago . )
There ’s one exception to that : the app icon .
Because of the wide variety of sizes and contexts in which your app icon appears , a pixel - perfect bitmap approach makes good sense .
That ’s particularly true for the tiniest versions , where the fabulous vector detail of your large icon will just scale down to mush .
More on icon Photoshoppery in a sec .
First , let ’s get acquainted with the growing family of app icons that iOS requires for the various devices .
Boy Howdy ,
That ’s a Lot of Icons
It used to be simple .
You used to need just three icon sizes : a big 512 px icon for the App Store , a 57 px icon for the home screen , and a 29 px icon for search results .
Now , if you ’re building a universal app for iPhone , iPhone 4 , and iPad , you ’ve gotta create 11 — eleven ! — separate icons .
And can you believe it : the mix even includes both 57x57 and 58x58 versions .
Oh , the humanity .
Here ’s the rundown :
App Store Icon
512x512 ( scaled down to 175x175 for display in the store )
Application Icon
114x114 ( iPhone 4 )
57x57 ( older iPhones )
72x72 ( iPad )
Spotlight Search Results and Settings Icon
58x58 ( iPhone 4 )
50x50 ( Spotlight results for iPad )
29x29 ( settings for iPad and older iPhones )
Document Icon
This is a new icon type in iOS 4 .
It ’s used if your app creates a custom document type .
The iPad uses the document icon in two different sizes .
320x320 ( iPad )
64x64 ( iPad )
44x58 ( iPhone 4 )
22x29 ( older iPhones )

And finally , the promised icon Photoshoppery .
The inimitable Neven Mrgan put together a handy Photoshop template to help make quick work of this app - icon assembly line .
Highly recommended .
Meanwhile , Back on the Web
If you ’re designing mobile websites or web apps , you likewise need to do a tiny bit more work to show off your high - resolution prowess on iPhone 4 .

10 Things You Did n’t Know About The Male Mind
If you ’ve ever wanted to know what goes on inside the male mind , this is what happens :
1 . The male mind is n’t afraid of commitment –
It ’s their associations with it
A lot of women I meet think that guys are inherently terrified of being with one person .
It ’s not true .
The only reason is because they associate it with losing their freedom , having sexual excitement , being able to pursue whatever they want .
The great news is , that these feelings are entirely within a woman ’s control .
If you appear needy and desperate to be serious with him , he ’ll be terrified of taking the leap .
This is just one reason guys run from relationships ( if you want to delve more into the male psyche on this issue , read my piece on the 3 Secrets That Reveal Why He Wo n’t Commit… ) .
If you make him WANT to be with you long - term and show him that life will only get more fun when he does , committing to you will only excite him more .
2. Looks are n’t enough to keep the male mind attracted
Men are n’t as shallow as women think .
Though a man might sleep with a woman for her looks , this by itself will never make him look at that girl as relationship - worthy .
3 . Men are just as emotionally needy as women
Men like women want a certain amount of affection from a relationship .
If they do n’t feel like they ’re getting it , they ’ll be just as hurt as any woman would .
The difference is that men often express their affection in a more physical way than women .
4 . Men are just as nervous about starting conversations as women
Believe us , men find it just as difficult to go and start conversations with people they are attracted to as women do .
You can use this information to your advantage as a woman .
If starting up conversation yourself is n’t something you feel comfortable doing at first , your job is to make it as easy as possible for him to approach you .
5 . Men ’s self - esteem is highly wrapped up in their sexual ability
When men feel sexually rejected , they feel like less of a man .
Even with men in relationships who feel totally loved , if they do n’t feel that their woman desires them sexually as much as they desire her , it hurts their pride in a way women can’t imagine .
6 . The male mind is n’t good at game - playing
Men are pretty simple .
Women sometimes give them mixed signals and think they are “ playing the game ” when actually the man often takes it as a sign that she ’s not at all interested and simply gives up .
7 . The male mind craves VARIETY
Both in your relationships , dating and the bedroom , the male mind is turned on by doing different things .
8 . Men are as insecure about rejection as women
The male ego is highly wrapped up in to how he perceives his performance with the opposite sex .
This is why it can take some men a while to pluck up the courage to ask you for a date , even if you think you ’ve made it obvious that you want him to ask you out .
9 . The male mind appreciates things more when they are earned
This is why men are completely turned off by desperate women .
They feel like anyone else could have been in their place .
What they want to feel like is that they earned their place in your life .
That they have proved themselves worthy to having the keys to becoming a part of your already amazing life .
10 .
The male mind can be programmed with the right language
Men love turning women on .
If you want a guy to change his behaviour in a relationship , instead of saying “ Honey , I would really appreciate it if you did xxx . ” try this instead : “ It really turns me on when guys do xxx ” .
This might sound trivial , but it ’s amazing how much hoovering you can get guys to do once they think it turns you on !
When you get inside the male mind in this way , you ’ll never be confused about why men act the way they do again .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Pakistan ’s intelligence agency controlled and coordinated the 2008 Mumbai attacks , a top Indian security official said , in what is the most direct accusation yet of Pakistan by India in the strikes that killed 166 people .

Home Secretary G.K. Pillai ’s comments to an Indian newspaper published on Wednesday come a day before the foreign ministers of the nuclear - armed rivals meet in Islamabad to repair relations worsened by the attacks .
The two sides are trying to revive a peace dialogue crucial not only for improving their ties but also the security outlook in Afghanistan where the two countries vie for influence .
India last year linked Pakistan ’s Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) with the attacks , saying the perpetrators were “ clients and creations ” of the agency .
But Pillai ’s remarks are more direct and could find resonance in the foreign ministers ’ meeting .
“ It was not just a peripheral role , ” the Indian Express newspaper quoted Pillai as saying .
“ They ( ISI ) were literally controlling and coordinating it from the beginning till the end . ”
Pillai was not immediately available for comment .
India has blamed Pakistan - based Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) militants for the Mumbai attacks .
It broke off a 4 - year - old peace process with Pakistan , saying reviving the dialogue would depend on action against LeT and its chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed .
Pillai said the evidence against the ISI emerged from the interrogation by Indian officials of a Chicago man , David Headley , who pleaded guilty to working with LeT to plan the attacks .
“ The sense that has come out from Headley ’s interrogation is that the ISI has had a much more significant role to play ( in the attacks ) , ” said Pillai , the top - ranking official in charge of domestic security .
“ The same goes for Hafiz Saeed .
He was not a peripheral player .
He knew everything . ”
India has handed over to Pakistan several dossiers of evidence , including against Saeed , but Islamabad says there are no grounds to try the LeT chief .
Pillai said he was hopeful that Pakistan would share information on steps it has taken against the Mumbai planners .
“ We have given them a whole series of data and information that we have .
We have given them the names , we have given them the descriptions , we have given them what their height is or their complexion is , ” he said .
“ Now it is up to them . ”
Former Vice President Dick Cheney , battling a lifetime of cardiac disease , has not decided whether to seek a heart transplant but could use a device surgically inserted into his chest last week as permanent therapy for his condition , according to a source close to the Cheney family and to heart surgeons familiar with the treatment .
“ He has not made any decision yet about a transplant , ” the source said Thursday .
“ He is totally focused right now on recuperation and rehab ” with his current device .
The source asked not to be named while commenting on private matters .
The device implanted into the former vice president ’s chest is known as an LVAD , or left ventricular assist device .
It is often described as a temporary therapy representing a “ bridge ” to a transplant , fueling speculation that Cheney , 69 , may be on the path toward seeking a new heart .
But experts said the newest models of the device , which is essentially a pump , are considered “ destination therapies ” that can last for years .
“ There are patients who have been having a wonderful quality of life for more than five years already , ” said Dr. Richard J. Shemin , chief of cardiothoracic surgery at UCLA ’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center .
“ Because it ’s a more modern device , smaller and more efficient , there is a lot of enthusiasm for it . ”
Shemin has no direct knowledge of Cheney ’s care .
Cheney , who suffered his first of five heart attacks at 37 , announced Wednesday that he had undergone surgery to insert the device last week at Inova Fairfax Heart & Vascular Institute in Virginia .
In a statement released by his office , he said the procedure addressed a new phase of “ increasing congestive heart failure ” but said he believed he would soon resume an active life .
Cheney may not be a good candidate for a heart transplant , primarily because of his age .
The scarcity of available hearts means that surgeons typically prefer to reserve them for younger patients with longer expected life spans .
Other factors that could rule out a transplant include an uncontrollable cancer and a chronic infection that would be exacerbated by the immunosuppression required with the device , said Dr. Paul Mazur , a cardiothoracic surgeon at MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute in Fountain Valley , Calif .
“ This device has been a saving grace for a lot of patients with advanced heart failure , ” Mazur said .
“ It will get them out and walking about again . ”
LVADs , which are much different from artificial hearts , were originally bulky devices designed to take some of the pumping load off of a weakened heart until a transplant could be arranged .
Newer devices are smaller and often have no more than one moving part , minimizing the possibility of clotting .
Everything is implanted in the chest except for the batteries , which are worn on a vest much like a hunting vest .
One potential oddity is that most patients who have the device have neither a pulse nor a conventional blood pressure , and must carry medical documentation saying that the lack of a pulse does not mean they are dead .
“ The patient is going to look like a walking zombie , ” Mazur said .

The motion is the first step toward reversing the county 's 4 - year - old policy on the dispensaries , which are allowed with strict prohibitions on their location :
They can not be within 1,000 feet of churches , daycare centers , libraries , playgrounds , schools and other sensitive uses .
The supervisors ' action directs county staff to prepare an ordinance to implement the ban .
It first needs to be considered by the Regional Planning Commission and then by the Board of Supervisors , a process that could take at least three or four months .
Some supervisors are worried that more dispensaries are on the way , which they said could attract crime .
Another factor was the city of Los Angeles ' recent aggressive push to shut down dispensaries that are illegal under a city ordinance that took effect four weeks ago , raising concern that dispensary owners would be searching for a new home .
" It leaves the unincorporated portion vulnerable , " said Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich , author of the motion .
The board , he said , needs to protect residents ' " safety and property values . "
Supervisor Gloria Molina expressed dismay at illegal pot dispensaries that have sprouted in Valinda .
" It takes anywhere from six months to a year to close one down that is started illegally , " Molina said , asking staff to come back with suggestions on speeding up enforcement .
While approving the motion , Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky expressed strong objections to rewriting a law he said worked .
" It 's the illegal ones that are driving everybody crazy , " Yaroslavsky said .
Barry Kramer , a medical cannabis patient who lives in L.A. , urged supervisors to focus on targeting illegal clubs , rather than ones that want to operate legally .
" It 's not the ordinance that 's bad , " Kramer said .
" They definitely do n't need to ban access to legitimate patients . "
Daryl Dittebrand , who lives in an unincorporated neighborhood near Arcadia , expressed opposition to a proposed medical marijuana dispensary 60 feet away from his home .
" I am fearful of what it 's going to do to my neighborhood .
I 'm afraid of the crime , and I 'm afraid of the potential for armed robbery , " Dittebrand said .
An initiative passed in 1996 and a state law adopted in 2003 allow patients and caregivers to form collectives to cultivate marijuana , but cities and counties have considerable power to regulate where dispensaries can operate .
Some dispensaries have filed court challenges to those regulations .

2010 Fantasy Football Preview : Quarterback By Committee ( QBBC )
All 2010 Fantasy Football Articles | 2010 Position Rankings
Every year , I kickoff TSR ’s hardcore fantasy football coverage with my Quarterback By Committee ( QBBC ) post .
I do this for a couple of reasons : 1 ) out of curiosity , as I usually draft a QBBC myself , and 2 ) there ’s a lot of number crunching so it gets the fantasy football juices flowing .
For the neophytes , QBBC is a strategy often utilized by savvy fantasy footballers who want to take advantage of the relative depth at quarterback by forming a committee of overlooked mid-rounders .
The premise is this :
Two or three mediocre quarterbacks whose schedules mesh nicely — i.e. they have several favorable matchups when their schedules are combined — will give you the positional production of a top 5 QB .
This allows fantasy owners to load up on running backs , wide receivers and even a stud tight end in the early rounds , building depth at the positions where talent is at a premium .
Sure , it ’s great to have Aaron Rodgers or Drew Brees anchoring your team , but that means you do n’t get that second round RB or WR that you had your eye on .
If you can get Top 5 QB production from a couple of guys that you grab in the 8th , 9th or 10th rounds , and your early - round RBs and WRs perform up to expectations , your team will definitely be playoff bound .
This works because of the depth at QB .
We know that the signal callers going in round 8 — guys like Eli Manning , Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco — are going to start and throw a lot of passes for their respective teams ( barring injury , of course ) .
Running backs or wide receivers that are going in the 8th round are another animal .
RBs still available in the middle rounds are either sharing time or fighting for the starting job .
WRs available that late are typically the second , third or even fourth options on their teams .
So that ’s the theory — now for the research .
To come up with a reasonable expectation for each two - man QBBC combination , I took the season projections from Footballguys ( a great fantasy football site ) and using their strength of schedule for each team , I was able to produce a week - by - week projection for each quarterback .
From there , it was relatively easy to come up with a list of the duos that project to have the best combined seasons .
I only focused on those QBs going in the 8th round or later , so this exercise excludes the Top 11 signal callers ( in terms of Average Draft Position ) : Aaron Rodgers ( 1.08 ) , Drew Brees ( 1.10 ) , Peyton Manning ( 2.04 ) , Tom Brady ( 2.11 ) , Tony Romo ( 3.09 ) , Matt Schaub ( 3.11 ) , Phillip Rivers ( 4.01 ) , Jay Cutler ( 6.04 ) , Kevin Kolb ( 6.04 ) , Donovan McNabb ( 6.09 ) and Brett Favre ( 6.11 ) .
( Note : this article assumes a 12 - team draft , so all mention of specific rounds and ADP have that in mind . )
This allows fantasy owners to spend at least the first seven picks on RBs , WRs and TEs , putting together a balanced squad before turning to the QB position .
So what was the top QBBC combination ?
The answer might surprise you :
Matt Ryan / Ben Roethlisberger ( 320.2 fantasy points )
Eli Manning / Ben Roethlisberger ( 320.2 fantasy points )
Maybe it ’s not so surprising .
Roethlisberger finished QB9 last season and averaged 22.0 fantasy points per game .
He missed Week 12 , and had he played and scored his average , he would have finished QB4 .
He ’s going to miss the first six weeks of the season due to his recent behavior in a college bar , and as a result he ’s going in the 11th round .
A savvy owner ( who is not worried about the bad karma associated with drafting a guy with a history of sexual assault ) looks at this situation and sees that he can get a Top 5 QB for half a season for the price of a 10th or 11th rounder .
If he can just get through the first seven weeks of the season ( PIT has a bye in Week 5 ) , he ’d be sitting pretty with Big Ben and QB X for the stretch run .
In fact , Roethlisberger is part of the top seven QBBCs and eight of the top nine combos .
Along with Ryan ( 8.02 ) , E. Manning ( 8.07 ) , Big Ben is a good match with Joe Flacco ( 8.12 ) and Carson Palmer ( 9.12 ) .
All four of those combinations would require two picks in rounds 8 - 10 .
Roethlisberger also meshes well with Alex Smith ( 12.09 ) , Vince Young ( 12.08 ) , Jason Campbell ( 13.02 ) and Matt Stafford ( 12.05 ) , in that order .
Those QBBCs are all projected to score in the 288-300 fp range ( or QB 6 - 8 production ) , for the price of a 10th rounder ( Roethlisberger ) and a 12th rounder .
Not bad .
To execute this strategy …
One way would be to wait until the 8th round to draft your first QB and take Ryan / Manning / Flacco .
Personally , I ’d go with Manning first , then Ryan and then Flacco .
Here ’s why : Manning was QB10 last season and averaged 20.3 points over the last eight games .
This was the 8th highest average during that span .
His strength of schedule is actually a bit better than last year and he should benefit from improvement by Hakeem Nicks and Kevin Boss .
While I like both Ryan and Flacco , and they are entrenched as the starters for their respective teams , their schedules are a little tougher this season .
Still , either guy would be a nice match with Big Ben .
If you do n’t want to burn an 8th rounder on your first QB , or if you miss out on Manning / Ryan / Flacco , you could wait until the 10th round to grab Roethlisberger , and then look to add Smith , Young , Campbell or Stafford in the 12th or 13th round .
These players are not in uber - stable situations , but they should start , at least for the first seven games .
Do n’t want Roethlisberger ?
The top non-Ben QBBC is Eli Manning and Carson Palmer , which would probably require you to use your 8th and 9th round picks to get both players .
A cheaper ( and almost as effective ) duo would be Flacco and Smith .
Other cheaper duos : Manning / Henne , Ryan / Garrard , Ryan / Henne , Manning / Young , Ryan / Smith , Flacco / Young , Manning / Smith .
Top three - man combination without drafting a QB in rounds 1 - 9 ?
How about Big Ben , Smith and David Garrard ?
Garrard ’s nice schedule in W5 - W7 offsets Smith ’s somewhat difficult schedule during that stretch .
The trio is projected to score 308.4 fantasy points .
( That ’s QB4 - type production . )
Take Roethlisberger in the 10th , Smith in the 11th and Garrard in the 12th .
If you miss out on Garrard , Young is also a good fit with Roethlisberger and Smith .

Fernando Alonso is heading into this weekend 's British Grand Prix optimistic that Ferrari can remain a force in the world championship battle , even though the upgrades it took to Valencia did not deliver the step forward it had hoped for .
The Spaniard had been expected to challenge for victory in Valencia with the new exhaust - blown diffuser on his Ferrari , but instead he was outpaced by Red Bull Racing and McLaren in qualifying - and then lost out badly in the early safety car phase of the race .
Despite that disappointment , Alonso thinks the true pace of the F10 will be better highlighted at the high - speed Silverstone circuit - and he is staying bullish about his team 's overall chances in what he thinks is a key part of the title battle .
" It is a crucial moment in the season , with three races coming up in the space of four weeks , " Alonso wrote on the official Ferrari website .
" We are ready , both on the technical front and physically .
" In Valencia , we introduced significant updates on the F10 and there will be more in Silverstone and the races after that .
" The development programme is intensive and I think we will see it produce results .
We have also prepared very carefully from the physical point of view , given that the next events are all very close and one needs to be at a hundred percent all the time . "
Alonso concedes that the quick nature of Silverstone will not play to the strengths of his F10 , but he sees no reason to be downbeat about his form - especially with rain an ever - present threat in Britain .
" The track seems reasonably similar to the way it was , with a lot of very fast corners , which will not suit us that much , " he said .
" However , it 's a fact that the configuration of the F10 seen in Valencia should give us a boost in these quick corners , so it is best to wait and see where we will be : I remain optimistic .
" Then , there is always a chance of rain playing its part at Silverstone .
I would be very surprised to have a completely dry weekend and we will be ready to tackle any situation that comes our way . "
The Venezuelan authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the owner of a private television channel fiercely critical of President Hugo Chavez .
Prosecutors accuse Guillermo Zuloaga , who owns the Globovision channel , of business irregularities .
Mr Zuloaga 's supporters say the warrant is an effort to silence him .
The government says all due legal procedures have been followed .
Opposition groups accuse Mr Chavez of trying to control the media .
' Completely irregular '
The BBC's Will Grant in Caracas says members of the national intelligence police are searching for Mr Zuloaga , a millionaire businessman who is one of the highest profile opposition figures in Venezuela .
Image caption President Chavez has been waging what he calls a " media war "
A warrant has also been issued for his son .
So far neither of the two men have been found or arrested but their home in Caracas has been cordoned off by the police .
A lawyer for Mr Zuloaga denounced the arrest order as " completely irregular " .
Mr Zuloaga 's supporters say the warrant is politically motivated , after President Chavez recently referred to comments made by Mr Zuloaga at an international press forum earlier this year .
At the conference , Mr Zuloaga suggested that Mr Chavez was responsible for most of the deaths which occurred in April 2002 during a short - lived coup .
" How is it possible that he can accuse me of such things and still walk free ? " the Venezuelan leader asked during a recent televised address .
But the state prosecutor , Luisa Ortega , said on state television that the men were being sought over alleged irregularities in two car dealerships of which they are the main shareholders .
The government has repeatedly denied any persecution of Mr Zuloaga for his political views .
Our correspondent says it insists that crimes have been committed within the car dealerships and both Guillermo Zuloaga and his son must answer the charges against them .

After starting to develop a game in HTML5 , I realized that I 'll be learning so many new things that I may as well keep track of them and help you learn -

I love instant messaging .
I use it both for work — we use instant messaging extensively at the Orbiting HQ — and for play , talking to my girlfriend , my family , and random people around the world .
For most IM protocols , I use Digsby , but for Windows Live Messenger I 've always tended to stick with the official client .
I depend on many of Windows Live Messenger 's built - in features — photo sharing , multiple - location sign - in , and webcam support — that I just do n't get with third - party clients .
I also use social networks , including Facebook , Flickr , and Twitter .
So , I was looking forward to the new version of Windows Live Messenger .
An update to the client I use all the time , designed to integrate better both with Windows 7 and the social networks I use all day sounds great .
What could possible go wrong ?
New clean look
First , it all looks new .
Though the basic design is unaltered , the new Messenger looks cleaner and crisper .
Spurious gradients have been banished , whitespace has been added .
Some changes are quite subtle ; scroll bars , for example , fade out when the mouse is n't near them .
It looks familiar , but considerably smarter .
New traffic light buttons .
Windows 7 integration has been improved .
The previous Messenger included a Jump list and a taskbar icon overlay to show your online status ; this has now been extended with a multicolored status - switching toolbar .
Less welcome is Microsoft 's new solution to a sticky issue .
Neither this version nor the previous version of Messenger minimizes to the notification area ; instead , they use icon overlays and the taskbar icon .
This is a good thing : the notification area is n't actually meant for long - running applications , it 's meant for notifications .
However , to ensure that the taskbar button is actually visible ( and hence able to display the overlay and the Jump list ) , an application needs to have a window .
If the application has no open windows at all , Windows removes its taskbar button entirely — which would leave users no way of manipulating Messenger .
Inelegant , but effective
The current version of Messenger addresses this by creating a dummy window .
If no other Messenger windows are open , an invisible dummy window is created .
It does n't appear in alt - tab , and it does n't have a " proper " thumbnail ( instead it uses your display picture ) , so it never really gets in the way .
Clicking the icon opens up the contact list , so the behavior is reasonably sensible — it 's just a slightly inelegant hack to accommodate the taskbar 's behavior .
In the new Messenger , the dummy window is gone .
But this is not a good thing .
Instead of having a dummy window to ensure that Messenger always has an open window , and hence always has a taskbar button , the contact window is now persistent .
Even if you click the X to dismiss it , it just minimizes .
There 's no way of getting rid of it .
The reason I find this objectionable is that it means that the window now appears in the alt - tab list .
Windows Live Messenger is n't the only application to do this : recent versions of Skype also make their contact window persistent , so it 's always polluting my alt - tab list .
But it 's nonetheless a step backwards .
The real fix is for Microsoft to decouple the taskbar buttons from application windows — allow running applications to create a button even if they have no visible windows .
Maybe in Windows 8 .
The most profound visual changes are found in the Messenger main window .
It 's here that the social networking features really come to the fore .
By default , the Messenger main window is large .
It 's no longer just a container for contacts : Microsoft is positioning it as a one - stop shop for all your social networking needs .
So it 's been split in two : the left - hand side contains social - networking updates , with the right - hand side used for the contact list .
Welcome to the social .
Er ...
The social networking support is pleasant .
It shows a regularly - updated view of status updates and picture uploads , supports Facebook commenting , and integrates other Windows Live Essentials where it makes sense to do so .
Clicking a Facebook photo gallery opens up the gallery in Windows Live Photo Gallery , which provides an attractive and effective picture browser that 's a great deal better than the one built in to Facebook .
Old faithful
For those preferring to keep it old - school , the traditional contact view can be used .
This has been smartened up somewhat , as it now does something useful when the window is enlarged : as the window grows and shrinks , the contacts re-arrange themselves to create multiple columns .
No more wasted space
Overall , I like these changes .
Making the contacts view work better for larger window sizes is an obvious and welcome change , and social networks are important enough to me that including their data in Messenger makes sense .
I do , however , have quite a few user - interface niggles .
For example , in social view , the drop - down box that lists my name and sign - on status never gets big enough to show all the text it needs , instead always hiding some text behind ellipsis marks .
I do n't want " ... "
Definite room for improvement ...
The social view also does n't handle huge windows very effectively .
Microsoft says that an alarming proportion of Windows Live Messenger users run with the window maximized .
Maximizing the new version of Messenger is certainly more useful than it was in the past , but it still fails to capitalize on all the space available to it .
No matter how wide I made the window , it never grew to more than two columns of social information or two columns of contacts .
The big — and some may say , overdue — change to IM windows is that they 're now tabbed .
Multiple conversations are now grouped together into a single window .
Though this has long been possible with Messenger Plus , it 's now built - in .
At long last .
Unfortunately , Microsoft has n't done a very good job of it .
The tab support is extremely rudimentary .
Common conventions like middle - click to close tabs are n't implemented .
Tabs can be detached from the main window through a context menu , but once detached , they can't be re-attached , and unlike applications like Digsby or Chrome , I can't detach them simply by dragging them away .
Nor can a bunch of separate windows be grouped together — I can't , for example , have one window with my work conversations , and another for my friends and family .
To my mind , this is all quite basic tab functionality , and I 'm quite surprised that Microsoft has implemented it this lazily .
Windows Live Messenger
Wave 4 implements the bare minimum of tab functionality , and frankly , I do n't think it 's good enough .
This is a shame ; tabbing is a good addition to the client .
I just wish it was done well .
To top it all off , the tab functionality seems quite buggy .
Undocking a tab did n't remove it from the list of tabs , it just made it unselectable .
It 's a graphical glitch that I 'm sure will be fixed eventually , and yes , I do understand that it 's a beta ( though to my mind , " obviously buggy behavior " should n't be in a beta ) , but given how rudimentary the tab support is , it 's disappointing that it does n't even work properly .
Ooops .
Nor was this the only graphical glitch I 've seen ; text seems to spew outside the confines of the toolbar in chat windows , and on one occasion the contact list was placed completely off - screen .
Ooops .
The mechanics of chatting are much the same as always , but with some nice refinements .
Paste a link to a YouTube video ( or , no doubt , various other video services ) , and the window switches to a mode that embeds the video right inside the chat window .
It 's similar to the previous version 's Photo sharing — but made more general .
Microsoft has clearly been paying attention to how people use the product — people pass around links to videos all day long — and is streamlining the experience .
This capability is also extended to still images ; pasting a link switches to an inline image viewer .
" kitten " and " lolcat " get automatic links
Content - sharing extends to more than images and videos .
Certain keywords acquire dashed underlining .
These words are automatically linked to integrated Bing searches .
Opening the search pops up a window that gives
Bing search results ; it defaults to image search , but other kinds are also available .
A search result can then be selected and shared , switching to the inline image viewer if necessary .
Whether this is useful or just plain annoying is harder to determine .
Embedded YouTube makes me happy .
What makes me less happy is that webcam functionality appears to have been crippled .
The current version of Messenger has two kinds of webcam operation .
There 's " View webcam , " which lets one or both parties stream their webcam , and there 's " video call , " which enables both parties ' webcams , and their microphones .
" Video Call " is obviously more limited .
If one party has no webcam , there 's no Video Call option .
If one party does n't want to broadcast their webcam , or their microphone , video call is n't an option .
And yet the new Messenger discards the basic webcam features .
It 's video call or nothing .
I have nothing against Video Calls , and use the feature from time to time .
But I use the basic webcam capabilities more .
It 's not a bug .
It 's not an accidental omission .
It 's a deliberate decision by Microsoft : the new Messenger will have only one webcam mode , and it 's Video Call .
The company claims that by concentrating on one webcam mode they can make it better .
Apparently the picture quality is improved .
In addition , the company has n't fixed some long - standing annoyances .
The current version of Messenger has an annoying habit of resizing and repositioning the window in a more or less random way whenever a webcam connection is offered , and again when it 's accepted .
Not only is this behavior retained with Video Calls , it 's now extended : it happens when images and videos are linked too !
Brilliant .
The interface is still confused , too .
The menu bars are hidden by default throughout the application , just as in previous versions .
And , just as in previous versions , there are options that reside exclusively on the menus .
Hiding the menus is a fine design choice if the interface provides a genuine alternative ( as is the case , for example , with the Ribbon UI ) .
But hiding it just for the sake of making it hard to find seems pointless , at best .
I like what Microsoft has done with the product .
The visual refresh is welcome , and for the most part , well - done .
There are lots of small touches , like use of animation when resizing , that makes the software pleasant to use .
I think I like the social networking integration , too , and am certainly going to keep it enabled , at least for the time being ( it might end up annoying me in the long run ) .
But the webcam feature regression kills my interest almost stone dead .
It 's totally insensitive to the way that I , and a lot of others , use Messenger , and the decision is frankly unfathomable .
If this change does n't bother you , then Messenger is shaping up to be a nice upgrade .
AUSTIN — The Texas Capitol has reopened after a bomb threat this morning closed the building for the second Friday in three weeks ..
" The Capitol has been reopened and is now open for visitors and employees , " said DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange .
Well this becomes more entertaining by the moment .
Those who staked so much on the " Amazongate " story , only to see it turn round and bite them , are now digging a hole so deep that they will soon be able to witness a possible climate change scenario at first hand , as they emerge , shovels in hand , in the middle of the Great Victoria Desert .
Here 's the story so far .
In January the rightwing blogger Richard North claimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had " grossly exaggerated the effects of global warming on the Amazon rain forest " .
In 2007 the Panel had claimed that " up to 40 % of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation " .
Reduced rainfall could rapidly destroy the forests , which would be replaced with ecosystems " such as tropical savannahs . "
North asserted that this " seems to be a complete fabrication " , though see this update too .
His story was picked up by hundreds of other climate change deniers , some of whom went so far as to claim that it destroyed global warming theory .
It was also run by the Sunday Times , which headlined its report " UN climate panel shamed by bogus rainforest claim " .
Two weeks ago the Sunday Times published a complete retraction .
That , you might think , would be the end of the matter .
How wrong you would be .
Far from accepting that they had made a mistake , the promoters of this story now seem determined to compound it .
On Sunday our old friend Christopher Booker asserted that " an exhaustive trawl through all the scientific literature on this subject by my colleague Dr Richard North ( who was responsible for uncovering " Amazongate " in the first place ) , has been unable to find a single study which confirms the specific claim made by the IPCC 's 2007 report … all observed evidence indicates that the forest is much more resilient to climate fluctuations than the alarmists would have us believe . "
There is no doubt that the IPCC made a mistake .
Sourcing its information on the Amazon to a report by the green group WWF rather than the substantial peer - reviewed literature on the subject , was a bizarre and silly thing to do .
It is also an issue of such mind - numbing triviality , in view of the fact that the IPCC 's 2007 reports extend to several thousand pages and contain tens of thousands of references , that I feel I should apologise for taking up more of your time in pursuing it .
But the climate change deniers have made such a big deal of it that it can not be ignored .
It is also true that nowhere in the peer - reviewed literature is there a specific statement that " up to 40 % of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation " .
This figure was taken from the WWF report and it should n't have been .
But far from " grossly exaggerating " the state of the science in 2007 , as North claimed , the IPCC – because it referenced the WWF report , not the peer - reviewed literature – grossly understated it .
The two foremost peer - reviewed papers on the subject at the time of the 2007 report were both published in Theoretical and Applied Climatology .
The references are below .
They are cited throughout the literature on Amazon dieback .
What do they tell us ?
That the projection in the IPCC 's report falls far , far short of the predicted impacts on the Amazon .
The first paper , by Cox et al , predicts a drop in broadleaf tree cover from approximately 80 % of the Amazon region in 2000 to around 28 % in 2100 ( Figure 6 ) .
That is bad enough , involving far more than 40 % of the rainforest .
But the forest , it says , will not be largely replaced by savannah : " When the forest fraction begins to drop ( from about 2040 onwards ) C4 grasses initially expand to occupy some of the vacant lands .
However , the relentless warming and drying make conditions unfavourable even for this plant functional type , and the Amazon box ends as predominantly baresoil ( area fraction > 0.5 ) by 2100 . "
In other words , the lushest region on earth is projected by this paper to be mostly replaced by desert as a result of global warming ( and the consequent reduction in rainfall ) this century .
I hope I do n't have to explain the consequences for biodiversity , the people of the Amazon or climate feedbacks , as the carbon the trees and soil contain is oxidised and released to the atmosphere .
So what does the second paper say ?
Betts et al go even further .
In their model runs : " By the end of the 21st Century , the mean broadleaf tree coverage of Amazonia has reduced from over 80 % to less than 10 % . "
They are slightly more sanguine about the savannah / desert balance .
" In approximately half of this area , the trees have been replaced by C4 grass leading to a savanna - like landscape .
Elsewhere , even grasses cannot be supported and the conditions become essentially desert - like . "
Is n't that reassuring ?
It is worth noting that both these papers are referenced elsewhere in the IPCC 's 2007 report .
They are not alone .
One of the runs in a 1999 paper by White , Cannell and Friend , also published in a peer - reviewed journal ( see below ) shows almost the entire Amazon basin as desert by the 2080s ( Figure 2 b ( ii ) ) .
Compare these projections to Booker 's claim that " all observed evidence indicates that the forest is much more resilient to climate fluctuations than the alarmists would have us believe . "
So now the promoters of the Amazongate story have three options .
They can persist in claiming that the IPCC was wrong , but this time on the grounds that it underestimated the likely response of the Amazon to climate change .
But that would create more problems for them than it solved .
They could fall back on their age - old defence and claim that it's all irrelevant , because the scientists ' projections for how the Amazon might respond to climate change are based on models .
But that would oblige them to suggest a better means of predicting future events .
Tealeaves ?
Entrails ?
Crystal balls ?
Or they could quietly slink away before this doomed crusade causes them any more embarrassment , and find something more useful to do .
Booker ends his piece by maintaining that on " the only occasion " on which I had attempted to expose the misinformation he peddles , I got it wrong and had to apologise to my readers .
Yes , I did get one of my claims wrong and I said so as soon as I discovered it .
This is where Christopher and I differ : I admit my mistakes , he does not .
But I 'm fascinated by his assertion that this was " the only occasion " on which I pulled him up .
Either he has a very short memory or a very selective one .
To prompt some glimmer of recognition , here are some of the other occasions on which I have pointed out his mistakes :
In 2007 I showed that Booker and North had used cherry - picking to support their claim that speed cameras had impeded the decline of deaths on the roads .
They had ignored the latest evidence ( which flatly contradicted their claims ) , misquoted a House of Commons report and changed the date of an article of mine , which had the effect of making their narrative more convincing .
In 2008 , I showed how Booker had misquoted scientific papers , engaged in cherry - picking and relied on the word of a man convicted under the Trade Descriptions
Act for making false claims about his qualifications to support his contention that white asbestos cement " poses no measurable risk to health " .
I also drew attention to my favourite Bookerism : his observation , in February 2008 , that " Arctic ice is n't vanishing after all . "
The " warmists " , he pointed out , had made much of the fact that in September 2007 northern hemisphere sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded .
But now it had bounced back , proving how wrong they were .
To reinforce this point , he helpfully published a graph , showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January .
I pointed out that the Sunday Telegraph continued to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter .
In 2009 , I detailed six howling mistakes about climate change in just one of his columns .
Last month I lambasted him for falsely claiming that under EU rules you 'll be able to bury dead pets only after " pressure cooking them at 130 degrees centigrade for half an hour " .
I do n't mean to spend my life correcting Booker 's mistakes , but the volume of misinformation he has published is mindblowing , and someone has to call him to account .
Other journalists , perhaps wisely , do n't bother .
All this is good knockabout stuff .
But we 're in danger of forgetting that it concerns a deadly serious matter : a change in the climatic conditions which have made human civilisation and the current human population possible , and , specifically , the degradation of the most wonderful and beautiful of the world 's ecosystems into desert and scrubby grassland .
It is hard to overstate the irresponsibility of those who misrepresent the science in order to persuade people that no action needs to be taken .

Traxis Partners hedge fund manager Barton Biggs used to be a pretty vocal stock market bull , even as recently as early May .
Back then he said , “ I ’m betting the next move in the U.S. market is going to be up 15 to 20 percent , ” and " I would just point out that the world is having a strong economic recovery , and so is Europe . ”
His view has changed dramatically since .
Explaining that he can change his mind ' very quickly ' , he 's significantly paired back his exposure to stocks .
Bloomberg :
“ The economic numbers are very disappointing , ” Biggs said .
“ Maybe the politicians respond .
I ’m worried that we could have not just a soft patch but a double dip which lasts two or three quarters and where nominal GDP is only up 2 or 3 percent , and that ’ll have a big effect on profits .
I ’m afraid the market goes down another 10 or 15 percent if that happens . ”
...
“ I sold stocks pretty aggressively in the U.S. , and we had a lot in tech , ” Biggs said , referring to this week .
“ I ’ve taken basically all of it out in the U.S. , and we had a broader exposure to consumer stocks and just , in general , I ’ve reduced my net long position by about 30 or 40 percentage points .
He added : “ I ’m not putting my money into anything .
I ’m raising cash . ”

A mass extinction of fish 360 million years ago hit the reset button on Earth 's life , setting the stage for modern vertebrate biodiversity , a new study reports .
The mass extinction scrambled the species pool near the time at which the first vertebrates crawled from water towards land , University of Chicago scientists report .
Those few species that survived the bottleneck were the evolutionary starting point for all vertebrates -- including humans -- that exist today , according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Everything was hit , the extinction was global , " said Lauren Sallan , University of Chicago graduate student and lead author of the paper .
" It reset vertebrate diversity in every single environment , both freshwater and marine , and created a completely different world . "
The Devonian Period , which spanned from 416 to 359 million years ago , is also known as the Age of Fishes for the broad array of species present in Earth 's aquatic environments .
Armored placoderms such as the gigantic Dunkleosteus and lobe - finned fishes -- similar to the modern lungfish -- dominated the waters , while ray - finned fishes , sharks , and tetrapods were in the minority .
But between the latest Devonian Period and the subsequent Carboniferous period , placoderms disappeared and ray - finned fishes rapidly replaced lobe - finned fishes as the dominant group , a demographic shift that persists to today .
" The Devonian period is known as the Age of Fishes , but it 's the wrong kind of fish , " Sallan said .
" Just about everything dominant in Devonian died at the end of the period and was replaced . "
" There 's some sort of pinch at the end of the Devonian , " said second author Michael Coates , PhD , professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago .
" It 's as if the roles persist , but the players change : the cast is transformed dramatically .
Something happened that almost wiped the slate clean , and , of the few stragglers that made it through , a handful then re-radiate spectacularly . "
advertisement
Scientists have long theorized that the Late Devonian Kellwasser event -- considered to be one of the " Big Five " extinctions in Earth 's history -- was responsible for a marine invertebrate species shake - up .
But an analysis of the vertebrate fossil record by Sallan and Coates , pinpointed a critical shift in their diversity to the Hangenberg extinction event 15 million years later .
Prior to the extinction , lobe - finned forms such as Tiktaalik and the earliest limbed tetrapods such as Ichthyostega had made the first tentative " steps " toward a land - dwelling existence .
But after the extinction , a long stretch of the fossil record known as " Romer 's Gap , " is almost barren of tetrapods , a puzzle that had confused paleontologists for many years .
Sallan and Coates ' data suggest that the 15 - million - year gap was the hangover after the traumatic Hangenberg event .
" The gap is real .
Something that is classically seen after an extinction event is a gap in the records of survivors , " Sallan said .
" You have a very low diversity fauna , because most things have been killed off . "
When tetrapods finally recovered , those survivors were likely the great - great - grandfathers to the vast majority of land vertebrates present today .
Modern vertebrate traits -- such as the motif of five - digit limbs that is shared by all mammals , birds , and reptiles in utero -- may have been set by this early common ancestor , the authors propose .
" Extinction events remove a huge amount of biodiversity , " Coates said .
" That shapes in a very significant way the patchiness of biodiversity that persists to the present day . "
The analysis benefitted from recent advances in filling in the vertebrate fossil record , Coates said .
Previously , estimates of the earlier extinction had been made using fossils of invertebrates such as mollusks and clams , which are far more abundant .
With a larger dataset of vertebrates and analytical techniques borrowed from modern ecology , Sallan and Coates were able to see the abrupt changes in species composition before and after the Hangenberg event .
advertisement
" It 's a big extinction during what was already considered a critical time in vertebrate evolution , so it 's surprising that it went unnoticed for so long , " Sallan said .
" But it took the right methods to reveal its magnitude . "
What remains mysterious is exactly what happened 360 million years ago to trigger this mass extinction , the authors said .
Other researchers have found evidence of substantial glacier formation at the end of the Devonian period , which would dramatically lower sea levels and affect the life within .
The first appearance of forest - like environments in some regions might also have produced atmospheric changes catastrophic to animal life .
The research also raises questions about the pattern of evolution after the extinction event .
It remains unclear why groups that were abundant before the event did not recover , while other groups spread and diversified in radical new ways .
Regardless of these questions , the consequences are still being felt hundreds of millions of years later , the authors said .
" It is a pivotal episode that shaped modern vertebrate biodiversity , " Coates said .
" We are only now beginning to place that important event in the history of life and the history of the planet , which we were n't able to do before . "

Question and Answers
1. What is The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ?
The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( Div. of ABC or ABC ) is the unit of State Government that is charged with regulating the commerce of alcoholic beverages within the State of New Jersey .
The 21st amendment to the United States Constitution gave each state the right to determine whether to allow alcoholic beverages , and , if so , how to regulate them .
As soon as the amendment was adopted in 1933 , New Jersey enacted its Alcoholic Beverage Control Law , which is commonly known as Title 33 ( since the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law is contained in the Revised Statutes as the 33rd title listed alphabetically by major subject matter , and under the title of  Intoxicating Liquors ) .
In that law , a Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was established under a Commissioner .
In the late 1940s , after New Jerseys 1947 Constitution was adopted , some departments were consolidated and the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control was absorbed into and became a division of the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General .
The Division of ABC is headed by a Director , who is appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate .
The Director is required to supervise the manufacture , distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in such a manner as to fulfill the public policy and legislative purpose of the Alcoholic Beverage Control law .
Investigations of violations of the ABC law are conducted by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Investigations Bureau ) .

2 . How old must someone be to purchase or drink alcoholic beverages on a licensed premises ?
A person must be 21 years of age or older to legally purchase or consume any alcoholic beverage on a licensed premises .
There is absolutely no exception to this .
( N.J.S.A. 9:17B-1 ) However , persons under the age of 21 can legally drink in connection with a religious ceremony or at home under parental supervision .
top
3 . How old must someone be to own a license or be employed by a licensee ?
The lawful age to own a license and to purchase alcoholic beverage products for resale under a license privilege is 18 years of age , ( N.J.S.A . 9:17B -1 ) Bartender , waiter or sales clerk : 18 years * Entertainer : 18 years * Restaurant & hotel worker not selling alcohol : 16 years ** Stock clerk in distribution licensee : 15 years *** Caddy or pin setter : 15 years *** Waiter ( not selling alcohol ) for consumption licensee which is not restaurant or hotel : 16 years *** *
Although a person must be 18 years of age to be employed as an entertainer ( includes members of a band , etc. ) , N.J.S.A. 34:2-2 I.17 , et seq. , provides for the employment of younger persons in certain " theatrical productions . "
This is under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Department of Labor . **
To qualify as a restaurant , the establishment must regularly and principally be used for the purpose of providing meals to the public , having an adequate kitchen and dining room equipped for the preparing , cooking and serving of food for its customers and in which no other business , except such as is incidental to such establishment , is conducted .
As a rough rule of thumb , to qualify as a restaurant , the establishments should have table ( i.e. " sit - down " ) service with a full service menu , proper and adequate equipment to be considered a bona fide restaurant ( e.g. , food freezers , dish washer , oven , etc. ) and the majority of its business revenues should be from the sale of prepared food for consumption on the premises , with revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages merely being ancillary thereto .
***
Permits for the employment of minors under 18 years of age must first be obtained from the Division of ABC before ( or within ten days ) such persons are employed on a licensed premises .
These rules , including the requirements for permits , apply to children of licensees as well , if they are employed on the licensed premises in any capacity .
top
4 . Are non-licensed restaurants permitted to allow customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages ( byob ) for consumption with their meals ?
Unless there is a local ordinance prohibiting it , customers of an unlicensed restaurant may be permitted by the ownership of the restaurant to bring and consume only wine and beer .
The restaurant can supply glasses , ice , etc. , but may not impose a cover , corkage or service charge .
Also , under no circumstances may spirituous liquor be permitted .
There may be no advertising whatsoever of the fact that wine or beer may be permitted .
Additionally , the owner may not permit wine or beer to be consumed during hours in which the sale of these products is prohibited by licensees in that municipality , nor allow consumption of beer or wine by persons under the age of 21 years or by persons who are actually or apparently drunk or intoxicated .
( N.J.S.A. 2C:33 - 27 ) .
top
5 . How is the quantity of alcohol indicated in the different types of alcoholic beverages ?
In distilled spirits , the alcohol content is indicated in  Proof ,  which is equal to twice the actual percentage of alcohol .
For example , a distilled spirit which is shown to be 60 proof contains 30 % alcohol .
The alcoholic content of wine is indicated in percentage by volume .
This gives the actual percentage of the beverage that is alcohol .
For beer and other malt alcoholic beverages , although the percentage of alcohol is not shown on the label , the alcohol content is usually given in percentage of alcohol by weight .
This percentage number will usually appear to be slightly less than if the alcohol content were shown by volume .
top
6 . May a patron take from a restaurant an unfinished portion of wine in an alcoholic beverage version of a " doggy bag ? "
Yes .
It is the policy of the State to encourage moderation in the consumption of alcoholic beverages .
To permit a diner to take home an unfinished portion of the bottle of wine , rather than consume it all to prevent waste of his purchase , furthers that policy .
Thus all unfinished bottles of wine may be re-corked and the patron can take them with him / her .
Removal of other open containers of alcoholic beverages from the licensed premises , such as a glass of wine , a mixed drink , an opened bottle or can of beer , is still prohibited .
Licensees should caution patrons using wine doggy bags that the wine should be placed in the trunk of the patrons car while in transit because Motor Vehicle Law prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverage in a car and the presence of a container with its original seal broken in a motor vehicle ( buses , taxi cabs and limousines are excluded ) can give rise to a presumption that the unfinished bottle was consumed in the car .
top
7 . Can people make their own wine or beer at home ?
A New Jersey resident over the age of 21 may engage in the personal manufacture ( or home brewing ) of up to 200 gallons of wine or malt alcoholic beverage ( beer ) for personal or household use or consumption .
A permit is no longer necessary for this activity .
In certain circumstances , home brewing is also permissible outside the home if the site of brewing is an authorized “ noncommercial ” premises and is a licensed instructional facility .
A permit is required for this activity .
In either scenario , any wine or beer manufactured is subject to the same limitations ; namely , that there is a 200 gallon per year limit and the beer or wine produced may not be sold under any circumstances , nor may it be used for any purpose other than for personal or household use or consumption by the brewer .
top
8 . Are New Jersey consumers permitted to order alcohol from a catalog or via the internet and have it delivered to their homes ?
Update pending .
top
9 . Can parents be held responsible for their minor children who consume alcohol ?
Yes .
A parent or guardian having legal custody of a person under 18 years of age is required to exercise reasonable supervision or control over that person in connection with the consumption of alcohol .

10 . Does New Jersey allow the sale of alcohol at drive up windows ?
For public policy reasons the Division of ABC prohibits the sale of alcohol from drive up windows .
The relationship between alcoholic beverages and the operation of a motor vehicle is such that the Division of ABC has determined that this type of service could result in the irresponsible consumption of alcohol .
In addition , it does not provide the licensee with the best opportunity to visually observe the patron to ascertain whether that patron is of legal age or is impaired or intoxicated .

11 . Can a person have an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle ?
New Jersey law prohibits any person from having an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle , even if the driver or other passenger is not intoxicated .
The policy of the State of New Jersey is that alcohol and motor vehicles , when combined , create a dangerous situation and therefore , the consumption of any alcohol by any person in a motor vehicle is prohibited .
The penalties for such a violation range from a minimum fine of $ 200 up to 10 days of community service .

12 . Can bars , restaurants or other licensed establishments run betting pools for sporting events such as the Super Bowl ?
As a general rule , neither gambling nor gambling paraphernalia is permitted on a licensed premises .
Those games or activities , however , which are licensed under the New Jersey law dealing with bingo , raffles or lotteries may be conducted on a licensed premises .
Any other unlicensed game or activity , where chance and not skill is the primary element and a person pays money or anything else of value in the hope or expectation of winning money , a prize or some other valuable thing , is prohibited .
This prohibition does not apply to the holding of a tournament , such as darts or bowling , where skill , and not chance , is the determining factor .
The Division has found that  football pools ,  sport pools  and " super bowl pools  constitute gambling and are , therefore , prohibited on the licensed premises .

13 .
How many liquor stores and restaurants are allowed in each municipality ?
The number of licenses to sell alcohol for consumption on a licensed premises ( restaurants and bars ) and to sell alcohol for off premise consumption ( packaged goods ) within a municipality is determined based upon the population .
A municipality may issue one consumption license for every 3,000 of its population .
As to distribution licenses , which allow the sale of alcohol for off premise consumption , a municipality may issue one license for every 7,500 of its population .
A municipality is allowed to ban all sales of alcohol within its borders if it so desires .
top
14 .
What time must liquor sales stop ?
Generally , a municipality , by ordinance , establishes the lawful hour during which alcoholic beverages may be sold .
In some municipalities , referenda have been held to establish or limit the hours or days of sale .
By ABC regulation , no retail licensee may sell distilled spirits in original containers ( packaged goods ) before 9:00 am and after 10:00 pm on any day of the week .
Municipalities can further limit these hours by ordinance or referendum , and frequently do so with respect to Sunday mornings .
However , by State statute retail licensees can sell wine and beer in original containers ( package goods ) at any time the municipality has permitted the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption .
In cities of the first class ( Jersey City , Newark ) , however , the hours of sale are regulated by municipal ordinance and State limitations are not applicable .
To be certain as to restrictions on hours of sale , check with that particular municipality .

15 . What Does the Counsel to the Director Do ?
The primary responsibility of the Counsel to the Director is to provide legal advice to the Director and to assist the Director in formulating Division policy .
Objectives include implementing the statutory objectives set forth in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act , balancing the interests of each segment of the industry and protecting New Jersey citizens against fraudulent or misleading business activities or practices that foster the immoderate , illegal or irresponsible sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages .
As the primary legal representative of the Division , the Counsel to the Director represents the Division in federal , state and administrative law proceedings and advises the Director concerning appeals filed from actions taken by municipal issuing authorities concerning the issuance , renewal , transfer and disciplining of retail licenses .
The Counsel to the Director also reviews ordinances that may be adopted by municipalities to govern the local sales of alcoholic beverages , and advises the Director about the adoption , repeal and amendment of all state regulations as well as the implementation of the ABC law through directives and other forms of administrative decisions .

El secretario de Gobernación , Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong , aseguró en su momento tomará la decisión de competir por la candidatura del PRI a la Presidencia de la República .
Sin embargo , mencionó que no es momento de hacer pronunciamientos de ese tipo , ya que podría perjudicar a otros aspirantes dentro del propio partido .
Sería ventajoso de mi parte y no es mi camino .
Hay que tomar decisiones en el momento , hoy no la he tomado , hoy todavía no he decidido al respecto ; cuando lo tenga que hacer , lo voy a hacer con toda claridad (...)
Te estoy hablando de responsabilidad ; tengo que poner el ejemplo y por eso me debo de esperar al momento oportuno para hacerlo .
En entrevista radiofónica manifestó que los tiempos electorales están marcados y él los respetará .
Lo único que sucede cuando se anuncia con tanta anticipación , en tiempos de responsabilidad personal , es que se distrae uno y no hace lo que tiene que hacer ; entonces , nada más se está cuidando hacia un proceso electoral , afirmó Osorio Chong .
En tanto , cuestionado sobre la participación del expresidente Felipe Calderón en las campañas del proceso electoral , sobre todo después de sus dichos de que la mafia está dentro del PRI , Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong dijo que el ex-Ejecutivo federal se ha expuesto demasiado .
Por otra parte , sobre Andrés Manuel López Obrador criticó la alianza que hizo con la Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación ( CNTE ) .
ESCAPE - obsessed monkeys used springy tree branches to catapult themselves over a five - metre electric fence to freedom .
( This story originally ran on our site in 2010 .
It has reappeared in our most popular list because it is being linked to from another site . )
The Japan Times said the trees were a little over 1.8 - metres high and about 1.8 - 3 metres from the high - voltage wire fence at Kyoto University 's primate research centre .
Nevertheless , a dozen monkeys used them to leap over the barrier .
" Their jumping power was greater than we thought , " said Hirohisa Hirai , deputy head of the institute in Inuyama .
However , the monkeys seemed not to know what to do with their new - found liberty following Sunday 's great escape .
Most of them were found hanging around the outside of the fence and at least five were lured back inside with peanuts .
The trees were cut short to prevent further flights .

Scandal , legalized betting and first - ever marathon photos Friday , April 19 , 12:00 p.m. 1901 was a year of firsts for the Boston Marathon .
For the first time , the 38 eligible " perfectly fit " starters appeared in photographs , rather than line drawings , in the local newspapers .
Original coverage
Click here for The Boston Globe 's coverage of the 1901 race .
This was a year when organized betting , usually reserved for boxing and horse racing , was used to turn the runners ' performances into quick returns or losses .
All bets at Ashland 's Columbia House were on Caffery .
The next closest wager was on MacDonald ; but even so , Caffery was favored 2 to 1 .
The race was marked with unusual moments such as when a horse joined the race somewhere between Natick and Wellesley .
Also , contoversy entered the Marathon for the first time as a result of Ronald McDonald collapsing after being handed a sponge by an onlooker and carrying it until he dropped .
There are two different versions of what happened to McDonald .
The first , provided by McDonald 's attending physician claimed the sponge was infused with chloroform .
Dr. Thompson ruled out an accident because of the huge sum of money staked on the race .
The second , levelled by McDonald 's trainer John Bowles , accused Thompson of giving McDonald some pills , that were supposed to stimulate him , when he became exhausted .
Bowles claimed the doctor fabricated his conspiracy story after realizing the pills had the opposite effect .
With this commotion as a backdrop , Caffery ran a flawless race to the finish .
Image caption Michael Oren said Israel would not apologise for the incident
Israel will reject a proposed international commission to investigate its deadly raid on a Gaza aid flotilla , its ambassador to the US has said .
Michael Oren told US broadcaster Fox News that Israel has the ability and the right to investigate its own military .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had earlier telephoned Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu with the proposal .
Nine people died when Israeli commandos stormed the Turkish ship last week .
" We are rejecting an international commission .
We are discussing with the Obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place , " Mr Oren told Fox News Sunday .
He said Israel would not apologise for the incident .
Eight of those killed were Turkish , and the ninth had joint US - Turkish nationality .
Europe action
Mr Netanyahu was due to discuss Mr Ban 's proposal with senior cabinet ministers on Sunday .
But Mr Oren said : " Israel is a democratic nation .
Israel has the ability and the right to investigate itself , not to be investigated by any international board . "
The proposed commission would have included representatives from the US , Turkey and Israel and could have been headed by former New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer .
The UK and France have urged Israel to accept an inquiry involving international oversight .
Speaking at a news conference with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner , the UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said any investigation must be " credible and transparent " .
" We believe there should be an international presence at minimum in that inquiry or investigation , " he said .
Mr Kouchner , in response to criticism that Europe had not taken enough action , said the EU was willing to check cargo on ships going into Gaza , and play more of a role in controlling the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza .
Activists deported
Meanwhile , Israel has been deporting activists who tried to sail another aid ship - the Rachel Corrie - to Gaza in defiance of Israel 's blockade .
Image caption Activists from the Rachel Corrie are being reunited with friends and family
Six Malaysians and a Cuban national from the boat were deported to Jordan on Sunday .
Five Irish nationals - including Nobel Peace laureate Mairead Maguire - and six Filipinos as well as the ship 's Scottish captain , were due to fly out later .
Mr Netanyahu has described those on board the Irish - owned Rachel Corrie as " peace activists " , but labelled the other vessel - the Mavi Marmara - a " ship of hate organised by violent Turkish terror extremists " .
Post - mortem examinations in Turkey revealed that 30 bullets had been found in the victims ' bodies - one activist had four in the head .
The BBC's Jonathan Head , in Istanbul , says some of the details seem to contradict Israel 's assertion that their commandos used minimum lethal force .
In another development on Sunday , a senior Iranian military figure said the country 's elite Revolutionary Guards were ready to escort aid flotillas to Gaza if ordered to by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
" The Revolutionary Guards ' naval forces are fully prepared to escort freedom and peace flotillas carrying humanitarian aid from all over the world to the oppressed people of Gaza , " Ali Shirazi , Ayatollah Khamenei 's naval representative , told Mehr news agency .
Israel stepped up its blockade of Gaza in 2007 , when the Islamist Hamas movement took control of the territory , and says its policies will not change while Hamas remains in power .
Iceland ’s openly gay Prime Minister , Johanna Sigurdardottir , has officially married her long - term partner , Jonina Leosdottir .
Legislation that allows gay couples to marry came into force yesterday , 27 June , following a unanimous decision adopted by Icelandic parliament on 12 June .
Civil unions for same - sex couples were first approved in Iceland back in 2002 , which gave gay couples the same rights and benifits as married heterosexual couples .
It was under this new law that Ms Sigurdardottir and Ms Leosdottir first formalised their relationship , now transformed into a marriage under the new law .
Ms Sigurdardottir , 68 , who came to power in February 2009 , has lived with writer Ms Leosdottir , who is in her fifties , for many years .
Iceland , a very secular and liberal country , legalised homosexuality in 1940 .
In 1992 , the age of sexual consent – for mutually consenting individuals , gay and heterosexual – was set at age 14 .
The same year , discrimination in goods and services on account of sexual orientation became illegal , as did threats , attacks , mockery or defamation on the same grounds .
Civil partnerships became legal in 1996 .
The country ’s capital , Reykjavik , has its own gay scene , despite the relatively small population and a pride parade takes place in the city every August .
Ms Sigurdardottir is the world ’s first – and to date , only – openly gay head of government .
George Washington , Father of our Country , Public Enemy Number One
If George Washington were alive today , he might face a hefty fine for the late return of library books .
Officials at New York Society Library said one of its ledgers shows that the president racked up 220 years of late fees on two books he borrowed , but never returned .
One of the books was the Law Of Nations , which deals with international relations .
The other was a volume of debates from Britain ’s House of Commons .
They were both due back on November 2 , 1789 .
In today ’s dollars , adjusted for inflation , the fine – accumulated at the rate of a few pennies a day – is estimated at about $ 300,000 .
Other prominent borrowers who used the collection did not appear to have the same problems with returning titles .
The first treasury secretary , Alexander Hamilton , the first chief justice , John Jay , and Thomas Jefferson ’s vice - president , Aaron Burr , are all listed in the ledger under both borrowing and return dates .
The library told the Guardian that they have no interest in collecting the fine – they ’d simply like the books back , if possible .

Today , Canadian law student Ghyslain Raza is President of a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the heritage , culture and history of a riverside French - Canadian town called Trois - Rivières .
But before that , the world knew him by a different title : The " Star Wars Kid . "
Raza is now a law student at Montreal 's McGill University .
In February of this year , he took control of the Patrimoine Trois - Rivières ( formerly called the Society for Conservation and Promotion of Cultural Heritage ) , which was founded more than 30 years ago .
Raza is trying to revitalize the organization by reaching out to academics , releasing new publications and working with the city to make sure that developments in the area keep heritage concerns in mind .
Is that where you expected the Star Wars kid to be today ?
The short attention spans of viral video viewers prevent the subjects of the videos from fully and accurately presenting themselves .
Few people would want to be entirely defined by one minute and 48 seconds of fame , but that 's the hand Raza was dealt in his youth .
Hardly anyone would recognize him these days , though .
That 's the other effect of the web 's short attention span .
The Hidden Story Behind the Video
Back in 2002 , a teenage Raza recorded a video that would become one of the most popular viral hits of all time , and one of the first cautionary tales in the debate about privacy on the Internet .
In it , he swung a golf ball retriever around as if it were Darth Maul 's double - bladed lightsaber in Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace and accompanied his movements with muffled sound effects .
Four classmates discovered the video and distributed it online .
It spread rapidly via e-mail and Internet forums , reaching millions of viewers — a great feat in the pre-YouTube era .
News outlets reported that Raza was so ridiculed for his activities in the video that he slipped into depression and had to take time off from school to seek psychiatric care .
His family sued the families of the classmates who leaked the video for $ 250,000 , then settled out of court .
The video has been referenced or spoofed on Arrested Development , Family Guy , The Colbert Report and other TV series .
Viral marketing company
The Viral Factory estimated that the original clip received more than 900 million views back in 2006 ; if that estimate was close to the mark , then the final number probably lands well over a billion today .
Take that , Lady Gaga .

Five - year - old boy wins defamation case against Lidl Published duration 28 July 2010
image caption Lidl settled the case for 7,500 euros
A five - year - old Irish boy who was wrongly accused of stealing a bag of crisps has won 7,500 euros damages for defamation of character .
The case , reported in the Irish Times on Wednesday , concerned Tadhg Mooney from Balbriggan in County Dublin .
The court heard he was in a local branch of Lidl with his mother in June 2009 when a shop assistant grabbed his arm and made the accusation .
His barrister told the court her client had suffered injury to his reputation .
She added that , Tadhg , now aged six , had also been caused to suffer distress and inconvenience .
The Circuit Civil Court also heard that the action of the shop assistant in grabbing the boy's arm amounted to false imprisonment and assault .
The barrister told the judge , Mr Justice Matthew Deery , that she was recommending acceptance by the court of a settlement offer of 7,500 euros and costs by Lidl Ireland Ltd .
Mr Justice Deery approved the offer .
On Wednesday , the family 's lawyer Dermot McNamara told the AFP wire service that Tadhg 's mother had shown a receipt for the bag of crisps to the store .
However , he said the shop manager failed to take her concerns seriously , causing her to take legal proceedings against the firm for slander , for false imprisonment , assault and negligence .
Edna Sednitzer , who blogs at Red Light Politics , sent us in two screencaps of what she came across during a recent search on Thesaurus.com .
She searched the word “ power ” and this is one of the entries that came up , for “ related adjectives ” ( some words I found notable highlighted in red ) :
Out of curiosity she then searched “ weakness , ” and here are the suggested adjectives :
At least according to this thesaurus , masculinity is powerful , capable , competent ; femininity is weak and incompetent .
There ’s a sexual component as well — notice that power is associated with being virile , while weakness = lustless .
Of course , we also associate men and masculinity with the active pursuit of sex , while women are supposed to be the objects of pursuit , not actively sexual .
Anyway , it ’s a great example of how language is gendered in a way that privileges masculinity and men over femininity and women .

Things may be looking up , ever so slightly , for the Gulf of Mexico 's endangered sea turtles .
A few days ago , environmental groups announced that they were suing BP and the Coast Guard over the " controlled burns " that were intended to burn off oil slicks in the water ; the environmentalists said that sea turtles were getting caught in the infernos and burned alive .
This morning a judge was prepared to hear arguments on a proposed injunction , but at the last minute the parties declared that they 've reached a settlement .
The agreement comes in advance of an emergency court hearing set today in New Orleans federal court , where environmentalists sought to force BP to either stop controlled burns or place rescuers on the boats to scoop federally protected sea turtles out of floating sludge patches before the corralled oil is ignited [ Bloomberg ] .
According to Sea Turtles Restoration Project
, one of the plaintiffs in the case , BP and the Coast Guard have agreed to station a qualified biologist on every vessel involved in the burns , and to remove turtles from the burn area before setting the blaze .
This is good news for the leatherbacks , loggerheads , and Kemps Ridley turtles that make their home in the Gulf .
Of course , it would be better news if their home was n't saturated with oil and periodically set on fire , but we 'll take what we can get .
Elsewhere in turtle news , conservationists are preparing to collect 70,000 turtle eggs from Alabama and Florida beaches .
The ambitious scheme , coordinated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , is seen as the best chance of preventing a massive die - off of the threatened creatures .
" This is an extraordinary effort under extraordinary conditions , but if we can save some of the hatchlings , it will be worth it as opposed to losing all of them , " said Chuck Underwood of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
" We have a much higher degree of certainty that if we do nothing and we allow these turtles to emerge and go into the Gulf and into the oil ... that we could in fact lose most of them , if not all of them , " he added .
" There 's a chance of losing a whole generation . " [ AP ]
In the next couple of weeks , turtle experts will start the painstaking process of excavating up to 800 nests ; each egg must be carefully lifted from its nest without rolling or repositioning it , to avoid disrupting the growing embryo inside .
Then the eggs will be transported to a climate - controlled hanger at Kennedy Space Center on Florida 's east coast where they 'll stay until hatching .
Finally , if all goes well , the next generation of loggerheads and other sea turtles will be set loose in the oil - free Atlantic .

Steven D. Hayworth , chief executive of Gibraltar Private Bank and Trust , is thrilled that his daughter will be working this summer at a women ’s clothing store before heading to college in the fall .
It is not the particular job that pleases Mr. Hayworth .
Rather , he is hoping his daughter will make the connection between how much she earns each day and what that will buy .
“ As a parent who has worked his whole life and has had a little bit of success in my career , one of the huge life lessons I learned early on is the value of a dollar , ” said Mr. Hayworth , whose bank is based in Coral Gables , Fla .
“ Particularly for children of upper - middle - class and affluent families , there ’s no perspective on value .
When the new Range Rover pulls into the driveway , there ’s no concept of how many hours of hard work went into owning that vehicle . ”
Unlike many collegebound children today , Mr. Hayworth ’s daughter would have had no worries if she had not been able to find a job .
She could have spent the summer by the pool knowing her parents had the money to put her through college .
But the fact that she does not have to work is exactly what worries Mr. Hayworth and many other affluent parents .
The recession and tight job market have made it imperative to teach their children the value of work .
They worry about that , it seems , more than about any short - term swings in their portfolios .

From this shocking beginning , the author of the phenomenal Dune series has created a masterpiece .
The White Plague is a marvelous and terrifyingly plausible blend of fiction and visionary theme .

For John Roe O'Neill is a molecular biologist who has the knowledge , and now the motivation , to devise and disseminate a genetically carried plague - a plague to which , like those that scourged mankind centuries ago , there is no antidote , but one that zeros in , unerringly and fatally , on women .
As the world slowly recognizes the reality of peril , as its politicians and scientists strive desperately to save themselves and their society from the prospect of human extinction , so does Frank Herbert grapple with one of the great themes of contemporary life : the enormous dangers that lurk at the dark edges of science .

Can a snake prey on a dinosaur ?
The answer is yes .
Remains of a snake and dinosaur fossil , and dinosaur eggs provide unequivocal evidence that a particular species of snake that lived in Dholi Dungri village , about 130 km from Ahmedabad , Gujarat about 67 million years ago devoured sauropod dinosaurs .
The snake did not eat fully - grown sauropod dinosaurs ; it preyed on dinosaurs just as they were hatching from the eggs .
The snake used its long body to coil around its prey to kill it and then swallow it .
“ We infer that the crushed egg encircled by the snake was exited by the sauropod hatchling found adjacent to it , ” notes the paper published online today ( March 02 ) in PLoS Biology journal .
Modern day pythons use the same technique — coil around their prey quickly and tighten the grip so that the prey suffocates and dies .
They then swallow the prey .
Pythons are not poisonous .
The new snake fossil discovered in Gujarat — named Sanajeh indicus ( Sanaj means ancient , jeh means gape ) — from the Late Cretaceous rocks is 3.5 - metre long and is found in a coiled position around a broken egg .
There are other broken pieces of eggs and two other unbroken eggs lying nearby , and fossil remains of a 0.5 - metre-long hatchling dinosaur lying next to the snake .
Importance of the study
The study is important as the nearly complete remains of the snake preserved in the nest of a sauropod dinosaur , and feeding on the hatchling dinosaur provide unequivocal evidence of its eating habits .
The authors have interpreted the snake coiled around a broken egg , two unbroken eggs and a dinosaur lying nearby as “ ethofossil ” preservation of the snake ’s feeding behaviour .
It also provides evidence of the evolutionary transition from basal snakes to modern - day derived macrostomatans like pythons .
Why wide gape matters
One of the most important features that enable macrostomatans ( like pythons ) to prey on animals bigger than deer is their wide gape ( the extent to which the mouth can be opened ) .
Fully grown pythons , for instance , can have a gape as wide as 60 cm .
“ The gape of Sanajeh indicus is approximately 16 cm , ” said Dr. Dhananjay M. Mohabey , Director of Palaeontology Division , Geological Survey of India ( GSI ) , Nagpur .
Dr. Mohabey is one of the authors of the paper ; he had discovered the fossil way back in 1984 .
The evolution of large - gape snakes ( macrostomatans ) capable of feeding on large prey and their ancestral habitat has remained controversial .
Modern - day pythons have excellent jaw adaptations and elongated skull ; fully grown pythons have a gape as wide as nearly 60 cm .
Among other changes , macrostomatans have really long lower jaws and increased mobility of jaws compared with S. indicus .
“ The lower jaw of S. indicus is 12 cm long … it ’s a fairly long jaw , ” said Dr. Mohabey .
“ There are other morphological features that make the jaws highly mobile and flexible … and give a wide gape of 16 cm . ”
Mobility of jaws
For instance , unlike the jaws of basal snakes that open like a hinge , the upper and lower jaws of S. indicus can be moved laterally as well .
This lateral movement gives the jaw the mobility .
The combination of jaw mobility along with its 12 cm-long jaw size provides the snake with a wide gape and the ability to swallow its prey .
“ It had a large body - size … it was able to manipulate the jaws to swallow large dinosaurs , ” said Dr. Mohabey .
However , dinosaurs older than one year were free of risk from S. indicus as even today ’s macrostromatans of lengths comparable to the fossil snake prey on animals weighing less than 10 kg .
Not a transitional fossil
Discussing about the evolutionary transition , Dr. Mohabey said : “ It ’s a primitive snake with some advanced features . ”
However , it is surely not the transitional fossil between the basal and derived macrostomatans . “… [ S. indicus ] lacks specializations of modern egg eaters and of macrostromatans , [ and the other features ] place it in intermediate position in snake phylogeny , ” notes the paper .
“ There will be other more primitive [ ones ] between this [ snake ] and the basal snake , and more advanced ones between this [ S. indicus ] and the derived macrostomatans , ” he said .
According to him , the nest was along a riverside and the dinosaurs were burying their eggs in the sand .
“ Some sort of smell or sound during hatching used to alert the snakes , which then preyed on the hatchlings , ” he said .
No transportation of the eggs , snake
The presence of two unbroken eggs and broken pieces of eggs , the coiled position of the snake , along with the snake - dinosaur association clearly shows that they were buried and killed instantaneously with little transportation from another locality .
In other words , the snake - dinosaur and egg association is not an accidental co-deposition phenomenon .
Along with the unbroken eggs , “ the excellent preservation of delicate cranial elements … is indicative of relatively rapid and deep burial , ” notes the paper .
According to Dr. Mohabey , there must have been some storm induced flooding event that resulted in debris flow , and there should have been hardly any time for the snake to escape .
This is not the first instance of snake fossils found in association with sauropod dinosaur eggs .
Pakistan Porn Search Leader
Pakistan is the world - wide leader in internet porn searches .
And they have some strange tastes over there .
James Joyner · · 1 comment
What happens when you combine Muslim culture with a large , educated populace ?
Lots of porn searches , apparently .
They may call it the “ Land of the Pure , ” but Pakistan turns out to be anything but .
The Muslim country , which has banned content on at least 17 websites to block offensive and blasphemous material , is the world ’s leader in online searches for pornographic material , FoxNews.com has learned .
“ You wo n’t find strip clubs in Islamic countries .
Most Islamic countries have certain dress codes , ” said Gabriel Said Reynolds , professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Notre Dame .
“ It would be an irony if they have n’t shown the same vigilance to pornography . ”
So here ’s the irony : Google ranks Pakistan No. 1 in the world in searches for pornographic terms , outranking every other country in the world in searches per person for certain sex-related content .
Pakistan is top dog in searches per-person for “ horse sex ” since 2004 , “ donkey sex ” since 2007 , “ rape pictures ” between 2004 and 2009 , “ rape sex ” since 2004 , “ child sex ” between 2004 and 2007 and since 2009 , “ animal sex ” since 2004 and “ dog sex ” since 2005 , according to Google Trends and Google Insights , features of Google that generate data based on popular search terms .
The country also is tops — or has been No. 1 — in searches for “ sex , ” “ camel sex , ” “ rape video , ” “ child sex video ” and some other searches that ca n’t be printed here .
Before recently falling into some strange Google black hole , OTB has long gotten a not insignificant amount of traffic from people looking for nude pictures of various celebrities .
Those landing here as a result are no doubt disappointed .
At any rate , it ’s no surprise to me that the Web ’s most ubiquitous use is surfing for porn .
And , while I ’d not have guessed “ Pakistan ” if asked to name the number one per capita consumer of porn , it makes some sense .
I am , however , a bit puzzled at their leadership in various bestiality searches .
I ’m not sure if that ’s some sort of South Asian fetish about which I do n’t care to know more or simply a function of somebody having to lead in those categories .
I take a few days off to relocate myself in meatspace and the biggest story that surfaces is …motorized doping ?
Did n’t we already do this ?
A YouTube video is all it takes to sway you zombies ?
Did n’t we already decide that whipping the cranks above 90 rpm ( I count 19 pedal strokes in the first 10 seconds of Cancellara ’s race - winning Roubaix attack — that ’s 114 rpm ) removed any assist value ?
Was n’t it clear that that seat tube is too narrow , and the wrong material , and shows no signs of the screws required to secure the motor ?
Or that the cranks and bottom bracket are n’t compatible with the alleged doping mechanism ?
And does it bother anyone else that the video resolution is too poor to clearly see the KM to go display , let alone what finger Cance uses to shift ?
But hey — if you ’re convinced , you ’re convinced .
Do n’t let logic get in the way of a perfectly invalid opinion .
Like the UCI , actually , whose official response was to say that motorized doping could n’t be happening because “ the risk is simply too big ” .
Less than a decade removed from young riders dropping like BP ’s stock price from pumping their veins too full of blood cells , and the risk of putting an engine in your bike is too big ?
How did these people get to be in charge of this sport ?
Logic also failed at the Tour of Luxemburg yesterday , where , after three minutes and fifty - one seconds of losing to Jimmy Engoulvent , Lance Armstrong declared his season back on track .
Yes , crashes , lack of race days , doping investigations , and another 365 days of wear and tear aside , everything ’s A - OK at Camp Armstrong .
Why ?
Because Armstrong says so .
Call me unconvinced .
Even if Armstrong finishes well at the five - day event , I do n’t think the parcours is sufficient for him to make a decent assessment of his fitness for a race as rigorous as the TdF .
Take some lackluster fitness and additional pressure for a good result and Armstrong may be forced to cut some corners in what , in past years , has been impeccable Tour prep .
And with some potentially stepped - up enforcement , cutting corners could be pretty costly this time around .
Just ask Alejandro Valverde — these things can have a way of catching up with you .
Premier Dalton McGuinty stared down critics in his own Liberal caucus over his government ’s actions during the recent G20 summit in Toronto by invoking the spectre of both Pierre Trudeau and Richard Nixon .
In a closed - door meeting with MPPs on Wednesday , McGuinty deflected questions from members unhappy at the heavy - handedness of police in dealing with protesters — and the government ’s complicity in failing to correct the mistaken impression officers had been given more powers .
“ He told us , ‘ Just remember , the same guy who gave us the Charter also gave us the War Measures Act , ’ ” said one startled MPP , noting the premier also refuted calls from several members to strike a public inquiry into the G20 debacle .
McGuinty ’s contrasting of Trudeau ’s 1982 entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution to the former prime minister ’s use of the War Measures Act during the 1970 October Crisis in Quebec was “ bizarre , ” said another member .
“ Then things got even weirder — he said : ‘ Do n’t forget about the silent majority . ’ ”
That was an apparent reference to former U.S. president Nixon ’s 1969 appeal to the “ great silent majority ” of middle - class voters who did not take to the streets to protest American involvement in Vietnam .
“ I could n’t believe what I was hearing , ” said one MPP , noting Trudeau is as beloved in Liberal circles as Nixon is reviled .
“ It was really disconcerting , ” the MPP added .
“ I was surprised he would go down that road , ” agreed a veteran Liberal .
Speaking to reporters before the meeting , McGuinty shrugged off calls for a provincial inquiry .
“ First of all , it ’s a federal responsibility , ” he said at Queen ’s Park .
“ Our police — given the circumstances and the challenges that were before them — conducted themselves remarkably well , ” the premier said before separate meetings of his caucus and his cabinet .
“ Unfortunately there were a few ( protesters ) — small in number — who were there to create mischief , to cause chaos and to damage , ” he said , adding he does n’t want to “ second - guess ” the police for arresting hundreds of people with apparently little cause .
“ There were some troublemakers , some thugs and some criminals , who deliberately exploited a peaceful protest for their own unlawful means . ”
McGuinty did concede his government may have erred after secretly agreeing on June 2 to a regulatory change that gave police clearer authority within the fortified security zone where the summit was held .
After the Star broke news on June 25 of the temporary change , which designated some areas within the security zone as a “ public work ” under the 1939 Public Works Protection
Act , the government did not immediately correct the impression that police had been given the power to arrest people who refused to provide identification or submit to a search within five metres of the zone ’s outer perimeter .
Toronto police chief Bill Blair and various government officials allowed the public to believe officers had that authority until days after the summit of world leaders was over .
“ There was some confusion obviously surrounding five metres .
There was no five - metre rule .
It was constantly published in print and republished on TV and radio and there was no foundation in fact for that , ” said McGuinty .
“ And we should have acted on that sooner to make it clear , ” he said .
“ What we did say is , ‘ If you want to come on the other side of this fence , if you want to come nearer to the G20 leaders … then we ’re going to have a new rule in place that we think is very important and in keeping with the standards and values of Ontarians . ’ ”
Still , the premier insisted he would not “ second - guess ” the police .
“ Our police — given the circumstances and the challenges that were before them — conducted themselves remarkably well , ” he said .
Progressive Conservative MPP Peter Shurman ( Thornhill ) said while no public inquiry is needed , McGuinty still needs to come clean on why regulatory changes were made without any consultation .

NDP MPP Cheri DiNovo ( Parkdale - High Park ) blasted the premier for “ the whole obfuscation process ” that she felt enabled police to arrest protesters who might otherwise have been left alone .
“ The subject of a public inquiry , of course , should be Mr. McGuinty and his outrageous actions .
He circumvented all regular procedures and rules of democracy , ” said DiNovo .
“ He convened a secret cabinet meeting , extending police powers .
I think everyone in Ontario who ’s concerned about civil liberties should be concerned that no one in opposition knew about it , not even Liberal backbenchers knew about it . ”

Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute , where research data , lab notes and other research processes are freely available , under terms that enable reuse , redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods .
- FOSTER Open Science Definition
For years , Creative Commons has been involved in with projects and policy to enable and support the open sharing of scientific information .
The CC licenses and public domain tools are widely used to share scientific research and data .
We ’ve also created software and developed policy recommendations that make it easier for scholars and policymakers to advocate for open solutions to collaboration and information exchange .
Projects
Science Commons was launched in 2005 with the goal of bringing the openness and sharing that have made Creative Commons licenses a success in the arts and cultural fields to the world of science .
Science Commons helped explore the intersection of the web , legal tools , and scholarly publishing for the benefit of scientific discovery , innovation , and collaboration .
It has since been re-integrated with Creative Commons and is no longer a discrete project .
Creative Commons launched its Scholar ’s Copyright Project in June 2006 , with one of the main components being the Scholar ’s Copyright Addendum Engine .
This tool provides a simple mechanism for scholars to retain copyright over their published material that otherwise would be transferred to the publisher .
It has now re-launched and updated in beta on CC Labs .
The Termination of Transfer tool has also been released in beta .
Once finalized , it will help authors learn if and when they have the right to terminate agreements under U.S. law , and regain their right their right to use CC tools to publish under open access terms .
Policy
The practice of open science is inextricably linked to the dissemination of that research to other scientists , and the public .
Much of scientific research is funded by the public , thus there has been an increasing attention to ensuring that there is broad public access to the outputs ( articles and data ) of publicly funded science .
Thus , advocates call for open licensing requirements to be attached to publicly funded research grants .
This means that articles developed as a result of public funding must be shared under a liberal open license ( such as CC BY ) so that everyone else is granted permission to read and re-use that publicly funded research .
Such policies are already in place in the UK , and are coming online at the European level , in the United States , and elsewhere .
Universities and philanthropic foundations are also adopting open licensing policies for the research articles and data sets that their faculty and grantees produce .

It is self - evident to any ardent follower of professional Brood War that SK Telecom T1 will be the Proleague Champions again this year .
However , some of you may not have realized this truth yet , perhaps being less observant fans of this beautiful e-Sport , so here are some indisputable facts to help you understand why SK Telecom T1 's victory is inevitable again this year .
Last year , quite a few observers tried to argue why team would win the Proleague championship .
But all of them would be shown to be misguided , except one .
Only fanatacist 's enlightened foretelling of SK Telecom T1 's victory would prove to be accurate , and it is well worth re-reading to reflect on as a starting point to look forward , as history is about to repeat itself .

However , some of you may not have realized this truth yet , perhaps being less observant fans of this beautiful e-Sport , so here are some indisputable facts to help you understand why SK Telecom T1 's victory is inevitable again this year .
The Order of the Universe
In the natural order of things , the proleague championship belongs to SKT T1 .
It is an anomaly when other teams somehow rise to the top .
Did you know that no team has ever won the proleague championship more than twice ?
No team other than SKT T1 , that is , who have claimed victory no less than four times ( or more , depending on exactly how you categorize past events ) .
Other teams may somehow climb to the top once or twice , but their reign is always fleeting , and the championship inevitably returns to SKT T1 .
Any pretenders trying to even get a glimpse of the championship trophy are fighting an uphill battle against the laws of ESPORTS , and SKT T1 is ready to take down all challengers to the throne .

The Main Line
Fantasy , Bisu , Best .
SKT T1's aces who can handily rip apart any other team 's lineup .
No other team has a 1 - 2 - 3 punch as strong as SKT T1 's main line .
Some might have a superlative ace , or maybe a pair of relatively strong players , but nothing that approaches the majesty of SKT T1 's strength .
Even Flash and Jaedong have shown signs of weakness in recent times .
But this month , someone else has stepped up to snatch the sigil of reliability , and that player is the cornerstone of SKT T1 's main line .
Fantasy
You may not have realized it , but this past round , Jung Myung Hoon was the best terran and best player overall in proleague , with an 8 - 1 record , and in addition , he 's qualified to the Ro16 of both individual leagues as well .
While it 's always debatable which player is currently strongest in skill , there 's no debate as to who is currently most reliable , with the undisputed highest win percentage in proleague R5 ( not counting those one game winners , of course ) .
And he shows now sign of stopping .
Many players have stepped up their game and changed their strategies to face the former most reliable Terran , and have started to snatch an increasing number of wins from the player once thought of as unbeatable , but that 's not the case with Fantasy .
Despite everyone 's realization that Fantasy 's signature vultures and dropship play often spell doom to his opponents , others have yet to assemble a reliable counter to neutralize them .
And Fantasy further ups his game during the playoffs ( see : last year ) , with the legendary Terran Oov at his side as his coach and mentor .
If there 's any one player that 's going to dominate these playoffs , it is Fantasy , not whoever else you might have had in mind .
Bisu
The freshly revitalized Revolutionist is once again ready to stomp on the carcasses of his foes , returning to proleague as well as the Ro16 of both individual leagues .
Having undergone special training to recover from a minor setback , Kim Taek
Yong is back to assume his position as the first among the protoss dragons , the head of the tribe .
Some may argue that his recent televised matches did not involve opponents who could serve as definitive tests to judge whether or not he has regained his form , but those observers are looking at things the wrong way .
The fact of the matter is that the peak of Bisu 's current strength has yet to be revealed .
Those that paid attention to his matches will see that his harassment , his multitasking ability , his micro and macromanagement are once again impeccable , having returned to or even surpassed their previous levels .
Still , despite evidence in the form of the skillful play that Bisu has shown off recently , many may dare to claim or think to themselves that Bisu is no longer a top player in Brood War .
Be prepared to eat crow during these playoffs as Bisu once again brings down the hurt while SKT T1 marches to the top of the podium .
Best
The Monster Macro Machine still terrorizes his enemies with an unending stream of protoss might .
As long as Doh Jae Wook has his probes and his gateways , his opponents will cower before an unending flow of units ready to march in and tear apart any sort of defense they might mount .
Terrans tremble before his might .
Protosses would do well to fear him .
And zergs - well , they can no longer rest easy the way they once did when they meet him on the battlefield .
While it cannot be denied that this dragon does exhibit a weakness against the Swarm , his vulnerability is less than it once was - no longer does he simply roll over and die to the weakest of zerg cerebrates .
And God help any Terran victim who faces Best on the battlefield .

The freshly revitalized Revolutionist is once again ready to stomp on the carcasses of his foes , returning to proleague as well as the Ro16 of both individual leagues .
Having undergone special training to recover from a minor setback , Kim Taek
Yong is back to assume his position as the first among the protoss dragons , the head of the tribe .
Some may argue that his recent televised matches did not involve opponents who could serve as definitive tests to judge whether or not he has regained his form , but those observers are looking at things the wrong way .
The fact of the matter is that the peak of Bisu 's current strength has yet to be revealed .
Those that paid attention to his matches will see that his harassment , his multitasking ability , his micro and macromanagement are once again impeccable , having returned to or even surpassed their previous levels .
Still , despite evidence in the form of the skillful play that Bisu has shown off recently , many may dare to claim or think to themselves that Bisu is no longer a top player in Brood War .
Be prepared to eat crow during these playoffs as Bisu once again brings down the hurt while SKT T1 marches to the top of the podium .
The Monster Macro Machine still terrorizes his enemies with an unending stream of protoss might .
As long as Doh Jae Wook has his probes and his gateways , his opponents will cower before an unending flow of units ready to march in and tear apart any sort of defense they might mount .
Terrans tremble before his might .
Protosses would do well to fear him .
And zergs - well , they can no longer rest easy the way they once did when they meet him on the battlefield .
While it cannot be denied that this dragon does exhibit a weakness against the Swarm , his vulnerability is less than it once was - no longer does he simply roll over and die to the weakest of zerg cerebrates .
And God help any Terran victim who faces Best on the battlefield .
The SKT Zergs
Once the laughingstock of the league , the SKT zergs are now a dangerous force to be reckoned with .
Did you know that a SKT Zerg has the best win percentage among all zergs in proleague R5 , with 6 clear victories and only 1 loss ( 815 with one game does n't count ) ?
Or that the 3 SKT Zergs together have the same or more wins than the entire zerg lineup of any other playoff - bound team ?
Last year , while " SKT Zerg " was still an insult , SKT T1 easily took the championship in a total of 8 sets to 3 .
What kind of massacre will now ensue now that SKT T1 has augmented its strength with strong zergs ?
Be ready to watch as this zerg trio overwhelm any opposition they face with their newfound abilities .

The Overseer
Somehow , for every coach there are voices claiming that the particular coach is some sort of genius or master planner , but the reality is that Park Young Woon outsmarts them all .
Still , any evidence that might be put forth in support of this fact will likely be greeted with accusations of luck or coincidence , so it may be more instructive to focus on other qualities that set the SKT T1 coach apart .
Guts and courage .
Remember that bet offered during last year 's proleague grand finals ?
The head - shaving bet that Oz 's coach Cho was too chicken to accept ?
That 's just one example of how confident SKT 's coach is in his players , as well as a sign of the coach 's willingness to put things on the line .
As another example , some are saying that SKT T1 stepped over the line by making a move that would result in OGN rescheduling its group selection .
These people are mistaken and are interpreting events in an incorrect manner .
Instead , the truth is that the managers and coaches of the other teams were too timid and lacked the courage to take action in response to OGN 's entirely unreasonable scheduling .
Only the SKT coach considered and challenged OGN 's fiat and forced the broadcaster to switch to a more reasonable day .
Empathy and a connection with his players .
Those that pay attention to the players and teams between games would notice that the SKT coach is always ready with a pat on the back or a hug for all his players .
While some might look down upon such actions and dismissively label this approach as " touchy - feely " , one cannot argue with the results and team cohesion that the coach has created .
Others may somehow be deluded into thinking that a cold , unapproachable front that many coaches adopt is somehow better , which is untrue .
It 's more likely that this kind of attitude is adopted by those coaches who are n't able to bring themselves to reach out to the players the way Coach Park has .

The Emperor
While it 's clear Lim Yo Hwan is no longer the dominant player he was years ago , he still serves as a guide and a mentor to the team , as well as its figurehead .
What other team can claim to have one of the forefathers and the most significant pioneer of professional Brood War among its ranks ?
The player who was the moving force behind the creation of player teams in the first place ?
Boxer can provide an unrivaled amount of experience that his teammates can drawn upon for strength , and he continues to devise more strategies and mold his successors to reach their potential .
Boxer is the X - Factor behind SKT T1 that no other team possesses or could even hope to replicate .

The Resurgence
While SKT T1 displayed some weakness mid-season , they have come back stronger than ever on the road to the playoffs .
Other teams are entering the playoffs on the back of strong performances early in the year , and are currently underperforming below whatever ephemeral potential they showed earlier this season , while SKT T1 's strength continues to increase , with no signs of plateauing .
With the exception of MBC , every team headed to the playoffs not named SK Telecom T1 has had a worse R5 when compared to R4 , and MBC has merely improved from a godawful 4 - 6 to a mediocre 6 - 5 .

The Bunkie
That 's right .
No other team has been able to make a mascot work like SK Telecom T1 .
That 's because Bunkie is baller .
There you go , folks .
Unassailable evidence that SK Telecom T1 will once again emerge as the champions of proleague in a few short weeks .
Those of you still not convinced , I only pity your blindness .
In any case , when Coach Park once again hoists the trophy over the beaches of Gwangahnri , I will not be called a seer accurately predicting an unlikely outcome , merely a realist stating the obvious .

The owner of a national auto glass company in Oakland has been sentenced to more than three years in federal prison for overcharging insurance firms by installing cheaper windshields than his employees claimed on repair invoices , authorities said Wednesday .
Mehrdad " Tony " Hakimian , 48 , of Mill Valley , the owner of Glass Emporium of Marin Inc. , must spend 42 months behind bars and pay a $ 150,000 fine , U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen said Friday at a hearing in Oakland .

The parent wanted to land a private helicopter in the school grounds
A parent has been banned from sending an 11 - year - old child to their end - of - year primary school prom in a helicopter .
East Renfrewshire Council confirmed it had received an inquiry about landing a helicopter in the grounds of Mearns Primary in Newton Mearns .
But it rejected the request on health and safety grounds .
The local authority said the idea was dismissed because it had no educational benefits .
It is understood the parent wanted their child to make a big entrance at the end - of - term party .
It comes as part of a growing trend for more outlandish gestures at school - leavers ' dances .
Children often arrive at their proms in stretched - limos and other flashy cars .
The helicopter request was maybe just a wee bit over the top George Barbour , East Renfrewshire Council
George Barbour , a spokesman for East Renfrewshire Council , said : " A parent approached us looking to land a helicopter in the school grounds .
" But we refused that request because the school would have had to spend time cordoning off areas to keep the children safe .
" Their time is better spent teaching the children . "
He added : " We have had parents wanting to drop their children off in limos and even a Ferrari , all sorts of vehicles .
" Generally we would try to accommodate as much as we can , recognising that this is a big important event in the children 's and the parents ' lives .
" The helicopter request was maybe just a wee bit over the top . "
A spokeswoman for the charity One Parent Families Scotland said the cost of end - of - term parties could put pressure on parents .
She added : " Schools need to be sensitive to the financial circumstances of all parents .
" It 's about having inclusive policies and the mechanisms for helping those who are in limited incomes so their children do n't miss out .
" Children , being children , want to be part of the group . "
Now you 've had a week to shake off your Glastonbury hangover , you might want to try tagging yourself on this giant , panoramic photo of the Pyramid stage field at half time during the England vs Slovenia game .
Orange has been trying to create a world record for the most tagged people in an online photo , and 5,576 people have tagged themselves or their friends so far .
But there were more like 70,000 in the field at that time , so there are plenty more to do .
The pic itself is a 1.3 gigapixel , 75,000 pixel - wide image compiled from 36 photos that took one minute to capture .
They used two Hasselblad H4D - 50 cameras with 50 megapixel digital backs and , camera geeks , a 150 mm lens on top and 100 mm lens tilt shift adapter .
Both cameras were mounted vertically on a tripod and rotated at 10 degree increments to take the pictures .
The image is integrated with Facebook , so if you were there , or know someone who was , you can connect yourself , or your friend , to Facebook .
Meanwhile , can we please crowdsource the identity of the Slipknot fan giving the camera the finger ?
Analysis
Five members of the Supreme Court on Monday assured state , county and city officials not to worry : the new decision protecting a “ right to keep and bear arms ” against government action at any level — local , state or national — “ does not imperil every law regulating firearms . ”
But the Court majority did not have any assurances for judges at every level , that they will be spared the duty of ruling on many forms of gun regulation that a legislature , county board , or city council has chosen to enact .
And the Court gave those judges very little guidance , in its ruling in McDonald , et al. , v. Chicago , on how they are to analyze those laws .
The Court did not even rule on the constitutionality of the one law that was at issue — a handgun ban in Chicago — nor did it tell the Seventh Circuit Court what constitutional standard to apply in judging that law when the case returns there .
That particular law ’s fate , like that of so many others around the nation , now must await a new round in court .
What the Court ’s assurance aimed to do was to forecast that opponents of gun control will not win every time .
But it had no authority to prevent many such battles from arising in the lower courts .
It is fair to speculate that , after decades of frustration that the Second Amendment had not limited state and local power to pass gun laws , there is a pent - up demand to use it now that it is newly available as a high - powered legal weapon against such legislation .
Judges , in short , are about to learn what legislators have long known : given the passionate support that exists for gun rights , virtually any attempt to curb them produces a pitched battle .
The dueling of lobbyists will now be replicated by dueling attorneys .
Justice Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , in the Court ’s main opinion , did make one thing unmistakably clear to lower court judges : the right to have a gun for self - defense in the home is a “ fundamental ” constitutional right .
That one - word label carries enormous import .
Ordinarily , if a right is deemed to be fundamental , any law that seeks to limit it will be judged by the stiffest constitutional test there is : it must satisfy “ strict scrutiny , ” meaning that it will be struck down if the government ’s need for it is not “ compelling ” and if the approach it takes is not the narrowest possible way to get at the problem .
Some laws can survive “ strict scrutiny , ” but not a great many do .
Two years ago , when the Court struck down a flat ban on handguns that had been enacted in Washington , D.C. , that was the first time it had found that the Second Amendment guaranteed a personal right to have a gun for self - defense in the home , enforceable against federal laws or those in the federal capital city ( District of Columbia v. Heller ) .
It nullified that law without saying that it was using a “ strict scrutiny ” test ; indeed , it said that ban would fail using any constitutional test .
So , the similar handgun ban adopted in Chicago ( and in other cities , such as Toledo and Oak Park , Ill. ) , may well be doomed .
But that may be the easiest kind of law for judges to nullify under the Amendment .
Justice Alito remarked that there was “ a paucity of precedent ” in state courts , when viewing gun rights under state constitutions , for upholding such flat bans .
But where the new decision will be most significantly tested will be regulation , not prohibition , of gun possession or use .
Without embracing everything that Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in one of Monday ’s dissenting opinions ( including his sweeping claim that the Court was sending lower courts off on a “ mission - almost - impossible ” ) , his opinion does come close to a fair description of some of the complications that will be featured in future lawsuits .
As Breyer noted , “ countless gun regulations of many shapes and sizes are in place in every state and in many local communities . ”
He then catalogued some of the questions that will now arise as many of those laws are tested : “ Does the right to possess weapons for self - defense extend outside the home ?
To the car ?
To work ?
What sort of guns are necessary for self - defense ?
Handguns ?
Rifles ?
Semi-automatic weapons ?
When is a gun semi-automatic ?
Where are different kinds of weapons likely needed ?
Does time - of - day matter ?
Does the presence of a child in the house matter ?
Does the presence of a convicted felon in the house matter ?
Do police need special rules permitting patdowns designed to find guns ?
When do registration requirements become severe to the point that they amount to an unconstiutional ban ?
Who can possess guns and of what kind ?
Aliens ?
Prior drug offenders ?
Prior alcohol abusers ?
How would the right interact with a state or local government ’s ability to take special measures during , say , national security emergencies ?
… These are only a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind . ”
Justice Alito ’s opinion did repeat some of the limitations on gun rights that the Court had said , in its Heller decision , that it was not disturbing .
The Court had said there , Alito noted , that the right it was newly protecting was not “ a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose . ”
And Alito repeated , from the Heller opinion , the assurance that “ our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as ‘ prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , ’ ‘ laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . ”
One of the first cases to test what McDonald means , when applied beyond a flat ban on handguns , is the case of Nordyke v. King , now on hold before the en banc Ninth Circuit Court ( docket 07-15763 ) , awaiting the Supreme Court ’s new decision .
In that case , officials in Alameda County , Calif. , imposed a flat ban on bringing any guns onto any county property , which had the practical effect of banning gun shows at a county fairgrounds .
A panel of the Ninth Circuit , while finding that the Second Amendment applied to state and local government , upheld the ban .
That ruling was set aside when the en banc Court took on the case .
Presumably , that battle will now resume , perhaps with new briefs .
It could clarify what , for example , is a “ sensitive place ” from which guns may be excluded .
The new lawsuits likely to develop will come against the background of a new desire , among devotees of gun rights , to carry their firearms in public places .
Gun owners held a large “ piece rally ” in Washington recently , and many guns were holstered for the occasion , to put new emphasis on the building resistance to gun-carry restrictions .
A number of gun owners showed up last summer at “ Tea Party ” rallies , wearing their guns .
Communities that interpret the McDonald decision as being limited to having guns in the home may conclude that they can ban guns anywhere outside the home .
Any ordinances to that effect , though , are surely going to be tested .
( And , as Justice John Paul Stevens noted in his dissent on Monday , there is a passing hint in the Heller decision of 2008 that maybe the personal right to a gun is not limited to having it at home .
In that comment , the Heller opinion said the individual right it was declaring was “ a right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation . ”
Lawsuits may be needed to clarify just what that right entails . )
Other laws almost certain to be tested are registration provisions .
In fact , Dick Anthony Heller , the Washington , D.C. , private security guard who won the Second Amendment case two years ago , is back in the D.C. Circuit Court , testing the gun registration law that the local City Council adopted after its flat ban had been nullified by the Supreme Court .
A federal judge upheld the new ordinance , and Heller and other gun owners ’ appeal is pending ( Circuit Court docket 10 - 7036 ) .
While the Heller decision was profoundly important , for finding in the Second Amendment an individual right to a gun , it is a fact that the vast number of laws that seek to regulate gun possession and use are those enacted at the state and local levels , not by Congress .
Thus , a gun right that at its origin seemed fairly narrow has now been nationalized , though it remains surrounded in basic doubt about just what it actually means .
Raw milk .
In the past month , no two words have caused more controversy on Simple , Good and Tasty than these .
In the wake of an E.coli outbreak that 's been linked to raw milk from a small , Minnesota dairy farm , we have seen our readers line up in two distinct camps : those who ca n’t understand why anyone would risk drinking raw milk , and those who ca n’t understand why anyone would drink anything else .
I wanted to broaden the debate , to take it beyond the local story about the Hartmann Dairy farm , its customers , and the Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture .
I wanted to know more about raw milk from the people who are considered the experts : so I e-mailed Bill Marler and David Gumpert .
Bill Marler was profiled here on SGT back in December .
He ’s the country ’s most renowned attorney representing victims of food poisoning .
We got to know Bill while covering the the story of Stephanie Smith , the young , Minnesota woman who became paralyzed after eating a Cargill hamburger laced with E.coli ; Marler was her attorney .
Marler is a bit of a paradox ; he ’s an avid supporter of local / organic / sustainably produced food , but warns locavores that the halo - effect of small farms does not protect them from food - borne illnesses .
David Gumpert is a journalist and writer who has become the standard bearer in the raw - milk movement .
His book The Raw Milk Revolution : Behind America ’s Emerging Battle Over Food Rights , and his blog , The Complete Patient , represent the most well - informed thinking among a growing group of raw - milk advocates .
Gumpert has written articles about raw milk for Huffington Post , Grist , Business Week , Food Safety News , The Nation , and Boston Globe .
I asked both men if they would participate in an e-mail debate about raw milk .
They agreed .
So I started by e-mailing them the same five questions ( see below ) .
When I received their answers , I let them read what the other had written and then write a response .
At that point , we exchanged e-mails again , and they got one more turn to counter each other .
What follows is mostly their exact words ; almost all of them .
A minor amount of editing was done for clarity and space , but about 95 percent of their digital conversation is intact .
Most of the hyperlinks were inserted by them ; a few , again for clarification purposes , are mine .
SGT : Question 1
Why are so many people – do either of you have an estimated number ?
– willing to ignore the well - publicized risks associated with drinking raw milk ?
David Gumpert :
I ’ve seen estimates of between 0.2 and 4 percent of Americans consuming raw milk .
No one knows because America ’s public health and agriculture establishment – the FDA , CDC , USDA – do n’t want us to know , since they strongly disapprove of people consuming raw milk .
But the number seems to be increasing .
The fact that so many people are willing to ignore the well - publicized risks you mention is testimony to the loss of credibility of our public health institutions and agriculture establishment .
I know when I first read warnings from the FDA about raw milk back in 2005 , I did n’t even know people still drank unpasteurized milk .
But I ’d seen enough examples of FDA screw - ups in approving drugs that later caused illnesses and serious side effects , and in going after small food producers that were n’t creating problems , that my reaction to the raw milk warnings was cynical , as in :
If the FDA says it ’s bad , well , raw milk must be good .
Growing numbers of other people apparently have the same reaction .
I ’ve had several producers of raw milk in New York state , who have been temporarily shut down by claims of listeria in their milk – even though there have n’t been any listeria outbreaks – tell me that the shutdowns generate many inquiries from potential raw milk drinkers .
That ’s a strange way to market your product : state agriculture or public health officials issue warnings about it , and business bumps up .
But that ’s the sad state of government credibility related to food and health .
This growing interest is really testimony to the perceived health benefits of raw milk .
A major study of nearly 15,000 children in Europe a few years ago indicated that children who drank raw milk had lower rates of allergies and asthma than children who did n’t .
And I ’ve met dozens of raw milk consumers who ca n’t stop talking about how raw milk has eliminated their problems with lactose intolerance , or reduced their children ’s throat and ear infections .
In addition , nearly everyone who drinks raw milk says it tastes much better than the pasteurized variety .
Bill Marler :
First , I ’m not sure the risks associated with drinking raw milk are well publicized .
Many people who have been sickened by bacteria in raw milk had no idea how dangerous it could be .
And many people who become ill do not come forward for fear of harming their source or because of embarrassment for allowing their child to consume the product .
Bugs that exist today are nasty .
When John Boy milked the Walton ’s cow , I bet that E. coli O157:H7 was never a concern .
Personally , I ca n’t imagine ignoring that kind of risk and giving it to my family , so I have to believe that there is such a strong pull away from our highly processed , widely distributed , and heavily marketed food chain that even when someone has heard about potential dangers of raw milk , the information is seen as untrustworthy .
As stories emerge about dangerous chemicals in our foods ( BPA , for example ) , it might seem the smart move to go as close as possible to the source of the food , so that you get it right from the udder , and do n’t give big business a chance to mess with it , or mess it up .
They ’re hearing from the farmer / seller that outbreaks happen when someone is n’t careful , and that this farmer / seller is so careful that it will never happen to their product .
But my experience is that it does , even to very , very conscientious producers .
Second , a lot of the information that people find online has to do with raw milk helping conditions that medicine has no cure for – asthma , eczema , and rheumatoid arthritis .
People who are suffering from these diseases – or whose children are suffering from them – are desperate for help .
When they read that raw milk might make a difference , it might seem worth a try – unless the dangers are clearly spelled out .
That ’s why I contributed to the public - private partnership that created the website Real Milk Facts so that people could evaluate the risks and possible benefits , and make an informed choice .
David Gumpert :
Here ’s what I think about Bill ’s claims that “ the bugs that exist today are nasty . ”
Yes , they are ( though nowhere near as nasty as those like typhoid and tuberculosis that got into milk and other foods in the late 1800s and early 1900s ) .
But the important point to keep in mind is that these bugs can infect people via all kinds of foods .
We ’ve seen many outbreaks affecting ground beef , leafy green veggies , and fast food , not to mention peanut butter and pistachios .
So people are coming to understand that there are risks of pathogens associated with nearly all foods .
When it comes to raw milk , increasing numbers of people are deciding that it ’s worth taking the risk to gain the health benefits perceived to be in raw milk .
In our free and open society , we allow people to make all kinds of decisions about engaging in activities that are risky , from rock climbing to riding motorcycles to eating heavily salted and sugary foods to taking prescription drugs with often - serious side effects .
Why should we treat raw milk so differently ?
SGT : Question # 2
What is the biggest misconception about raw milk ?
What is the biggest misconception about pasteurized milk ?
David Gumpert :
For raw milk , the biggest misconception is that it is inherently unsafe , that there ’s no way it can be produced safely .
This stems from the large - scale illnesses that developed from raw milk in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when milk was often watered down , produced from sick animals , and without knowledge of the importance of sanitation and refrigeration .
For pasteurized milk , the biggest misconception is that you ca n’t get sick from it .
You can , and we ’ve had outbreaks affecting tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands of people within the last 25 years ; I describe a number of these outbreaks in my book The Raw Milk Revolution : Behind America ’s Emerging Battle Over Food Rights .
Such outbreaks do n’t happen very often – they are invariably the result of after - processing contamination – but when they do , they are big problems , since pasteurized milk is distributed so widely .
Bill Marler :
For raw milk , the biggest misconception is just how risky consumption is , particularly for the populations especially at risk : infants , children , pregnant women , and the immune - compromised .
When raw milk advocates tout the relatively small number of illnesses or deaths associated with raw dairy products , they ignore one of the most basic tenets of statistics : the denominator , e.g. how few people are exposed .
In spite of the fact that less then one / half of one percent of all fluid milk consumed in the country is consumed unpasteurized , raw dairy products account for more than twice the number of outbreaks .
I would hope that people would weigh what could happen if they or their child got seriously ill with E. coli , Campylobacter or Salmonella , which are just some of the bugs that can be present in unpasteurized milk .
For pasteurized milk , few people understand the just how regulated the product is .
Take a look at the bible of milk safety regulation , the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance .
David Gumpert :
Raw milk opponents often raise the scary image of children becoming ill from raw milk .
Children become ill , as well , from other foods that contain the pathogens Bill mentions .
I ’ve met many parents , including medical professionals , who regularly feed their children raw milk and are convinced their children ’s health benefits .
Now , granted , the stories about improved health are seen as “ anecdotal ” by the scientific community , but I ’ve met enough of these people ( and devote a chapter to their experiences in my book that I have come to respect and take seriously such experiences .
SGT : Question # 3
The sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal in 22 states ; 19 states – including Minnesota – only allow raw milk to be sold at the farm directly to the consumer .
What do State agricultural and health departments fear most about raw milk ?
David Gumpert :
There are two fundamental schools of thought about raw milk at the state agriculture and health department levels .
The one that tends to prevail in the states where raw milk is illegal is that raw milk is by its nature unsafe – end of argument .
The second school of thought , prevalent in the states that allow raw milk , is that raw milk can be produced safely , with attention to proper sanitation and animal health .
However , sometimes in states that allow raw milk , there is a difference of opinion between the agriculture and health departments .
As one example , in Massachusetts , which allows on - farm sales of raw milk , the Department of Public Health has been pushing the Department of Agricultural Resources to clamp down on delivery services that bring raw milk from farms to consumers in cities .
In May , the public health commissioner , in a letter , told the agriculture commissioner “ in an ideal world we would prefer that all milk sold in Massachusetts be pasteurized ... ”
Bill Marler :
State agricultural and health departments are charged with preventing food - borne disease and the people in those departments take their responsibility seriously and very personally .
For many their work is a calling , a job they are proud of .
These professionals really do want to prevent the next child with kidney failure or the young woman with paralysis , like Stephanie Smith .
On a larger scale these agencies also worry that unregulated or under - regulated raw milk consumption will increase exponentially ( exploding with the fervor in which Americans always embrace the next fad ) .
This could lead to outbreaks , illnesses and deaths from raw milk , the likes of which we have n’t seen since the first half of the last century , when it is estimated that 25 percent of all food borne illness was associated with the consumption of raw dairy products .
From the regulators ’ point of view this is not a freedom of choice issue , anyone can milk a cow or goat and drink the milk ; it is about people making money ( $ 10 to $ 16 per gallon in California ) by selling a dangerous product .
Regulators ’ mindsets typically follow that dangerous or potentially dangerous products ( like alcohol or cigarettes ) should be regulated , and the dangers well publicized .
David Gumpert :
Bill is repeating what should be labeled as regulator hysteria that growing raw milk consumption “ could lead to outbreaks , illnesses and deaths from raw milk , the likes of which we have n’t seen since the first half of the last century . ”
We are today talking about some dozens of people becoming mostly mildly ill versus many thousands who became seriously ill or died in the early 1900s ; there has n’t been a death from raw milk in at least 25 years .
( The two deaths attributed to raw milk by the CDC actually resulted from so - called “ bathtub cheese , ” which most raw milk advocates avoid , since it ’s often made from milk intended for pasteurization . )
The established dairy industry , with an estimated $ 140 billion in annual revenues , also likes to paint such a picture , since the dairy industry is increasingly coming to fear raw milk as a competitive threat .
( Remember , each one percent of market share grabbed by raw milk is equal to $ 1.4 billion . )
In addition , to suggest that dairies producing raw milk are “ about people making money … by selling a dangerous product ” is unfortunate .
The farmers I ’ve met who sell raw milk are extremely dedicated and personally committed to producing a high - quality product they know improves the health of many of their customers .
Yes , raw milk usually costs more than conventional milk , but that is because dairy farmers take special care in the feeding of their cows and the milking methods they use .
And higher prices for their product enable raw - milk - producing dairies to become economically sustainable – something that is nearly impossible for small dairies that produce milk for conventional processors .
We ’ve lost 88 percent of our dairies over the last 40 years ; let ’s not be so quick to condemn the small ones trying to survive to the junk heap .
SGT : Question # 4
If people are so intent on drinking raw milk , are there ways it can be made safer ?
David Gumpert :
When you think about it , hundreds of thousands of people drink raw milk every day , without problems .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control , in a report made available in 2008 to the Farm - to - Consumer Legal Defense Fund ( in response to a Freedom - of - Information Act request ) , showed an average of 54 reported illnesses from raw milk during the 33 - year period between 1973 and 2005 .
That ’s not a major public health problem by any stretch of the imagination .
There has been a spike in illnesses attributed to raw milk in the last year , but it ’s still nowhere near a serious problem .
But the spike points up the need for constant vigilance by producers of raw milk and other raw dairy products .
There needs to be a focus on modern sanitation : availability of running water , careful cleanup of equipment , sanitary barn conditions .
Keeping a closed herd – that is , not picking up cows at farm auctions that may have been exposed via feedlots to pathogens like E.coli 0157:H7 and campylobacter – seems important .
Also , feeding the cows on pasture and hay , and avoiding a lot of grains , may well help reduce the incidence of pathogens .
Bill Marler :
There have been at least nine outbreaks since January 2010 .
Although I do believe that there are farmers that try and produce a safe product , there are other producers who seem to both shun all government regulation and have very little interest in the science of bacterial and viral pathogens that inhabit cattle feces – even those of grass - fed cows .
If raw milk if going to be produced and people do not simply want to buy their own animal , and in lieu of banning raw milk products , some states have adopted regulations that attempt to protect public health and allow for consumer choice .
Here is what I would suggest :
Raw milk should be sold only on farms that are certified by the state and inspected and tested regularly .
Make ambiguous black market milk / cheese sales and " pet food sales " meant for human consumption clearly illegal .
Raw milk should not be sold in grocery stores or across state lines – the risks of mass production and transportation are too great .
The risk of a casual purchase by someone who misunderstands the risks is too great , as well .
Farms should be required to have insurance coverage sufficient to cover reasonable damages to their customers .
Practices such as outsourcing ( buying raw milk from farms not licensed for raw milk production ) should be illegal .
Colostrum should be regulated as a dairy product , not a nutritional supplement .
Warning signs on the bottles and at point - of - purchase should be mandatory .
An example : " WARNING :
This product has not been pasteurized and may contain harmful bacteria ( not limited to E. coli O157:H7 , Campylobacter , Listeria and Salmonella ) .
Pregnant women , infants , children , the elderly , and persons with lowered resistance to disease ( immune compromised ) have the highest risk of harm , which includes diarrhea , vomiting , fever , dehydration , Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome , Guillain - Barre Syndrome , Reactive Arthritis , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , miscarriage , or death , from use of this product . "
David Gumpert
Bill ’s suggestions for regulating raw milk – particularly about outsourcing and warning signs – are a good start at coming up with a consistent approach .
I disagree with his first two points about requiring sales from farms and not allowing retail sales , since it ’s impractical to require consumers to travel sometimes an hour or more each way to a farm to buy milk .
Raw milk is being safely transported all over California , a huge state , and sold in retail stores to thousands of customers every day .
Same thing in Maine , Pennsylvania and Connecticut .
Let ’s be realistic and treat raw milk like any other food , and let the marketplace determine whether it might be sold across state lines or in retail stores .
Most consumers of raw milk today are highly informed and educated , and my guess is they will mostly prefer to buy their milk from smaller local producers in any event .
SGT : Question # 5
Would broader legalization of raw milk be good for the local food movement ?
David Gumpert :
It would .
First and foremost , it would be good for local economies by keeping more revenues in local communities .
Consider this : Farmers selling milk for pasteurization receive between $ 1 and $ 1.50 a gallon , and lose money at that rate .
They have to cut back on all spending .
Farmers who sell milk unpasteurized get $ 5 to $ 10 a gallon , and then spend those revenues in their communities , on tractors , vet services , new clothes or painting their houses .
Everyone wins .
A 2009 study by the Massachusetts chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Association ( NOFA / Mass . ) found that not only has the number of Massachusetts raw - milk dairies increased sharply ( from 10 in 2006 to 27 today ) , but that the revenues generated by the dairies tends to remain in local communities , since the milk is sold directly to consumers , without the economic spillage to out - of - state corporations like Dean Foods inherent in conventional distribution and retailing models .
Keep in mind as well that milk sales keep people coming back for other foods , since milk supplies have to be replenished every week or two .
When consumers return to a farm or farmers ’ market for their milk , they buy other things as well – meat , eggs , veggies , cheese .
Once again , everyone wins because people are buying more locally produced food , and encouraging expansion of the local food movement .
Wider availability of raw milk would also be much more equitable than our current system , which penalizes people according to where they live .
There ’s something wrong with a system in which people who live in California or Connecticut can go out to a local grocery store and purchase all the raw milk they want , and those who live in Florida or Georgia or Maryland can’t .
Bill Marler :
If legalization of raw milk proceeds the way it is now , in a state - by - state process that produces wildly different rules in different areas and a largely unregulated product , I think we ’ll see a lot more outbreaks , sicknesses , even deaths .
Then people who have put their trust in raw , unprocessed foods will take a hard look not only at raw milk , but at other local products as well .
More outbreaks could drive the raw milk movement underground , which would only mean more illnesses .
If a national regulation is put into place , and information about the dangers associated with raw milk is widely disseminated , perhaps we can avoid all those sick kids .
I certainly hope so .
David Gumpert
I think the scary scenario Bill portrays could be avoided by having more involvement by agriculture and public health regulators in working with small dairies to ensure safe production .
For example , there could be extension courses and seminars for farmers on “ best practices ” for producing safe and high - quality raw milk .
Let ’s try cooperation and education instead of the hostility and arrogance that have characterized regulator behavior toward raw milk .
Bill Marler :
David ’s responses seem reasonable to me – sideswipes at Public Health aside .
I think we just both come at the issue from differing perspectives .
David sees the low risk , in part , thankfully , because he has not seen the devastation of these illnesses first hand .
I see the illnesses all too well and all too often – not all from raw milk .
So , where to find common ground ?
There have been nearly 10 recalls and less outbreaks related to raw milk since January .
As demand increases and more folks have access to it , those numbers may well rise , if there is not some type of movement ( governmentally or privately ) to clamp down on producers who take short cuts .
This is true for raw milk as it is in the broader context of food safety .
As people see profits to be made , many times their focus becomes making a buck – not keeping their product safe .
I think David is right , there are probably raw milk producers that are doing a great job that we never hear about – because they do not sicken anyone .
The raw milk movement needs to move away from the anti-government , anti-science rhetoric ( the “ teat ” party ) and embrace that the risks are real and should not be denied or ignored .
David Gumpert :
I appreciate Bill 's concerns about possible increases in illnesses , and think the emerging raw milk industry needs to take this bull by the horns .
I 'd like to see a raw dairy association established that would set and enforce safety and health standards , much like what now exists in the leafy greens and other food areas .
Members who abide by the standards would get to say so on their milk labels .
I hope such an association would be part of a movement toward greater cooperation among producers and government regulators , to move past the suspicion and even hostility that has been a hallmark of recent years .
And that was the end of Round 1 .
Round 2 began nine days later .
On Sunday , June 27 , the Star Tribune ran an inflammatory editorial calling for a ban on raw milk in the state of Minnesota .
It derided raw - milk buyers , saying they have a “ dangerous sense of superiority ” because “ They do n't go to supermarkets like regular people .
Instead , after watching documentaries and doing Internet ‘ research , ’ they have ‘ a philosophy about how you consume … ’ ”
Here ’s what I consider the most eyebrow - raising excerpt : “ Those who continue to buy raw milk , particularly those who serve it to children , need to be called out for placing their families in harm 's way .
Grandparents , family and friends should n't tolerate this irresponsibility . ”
I wanted to know what Marler and Gumpert thought about this , so I e-mailed them the link late Sunday night – 11:58 p.m to be exact .
Turns out Gumpert was way ahead of me and had already written about it on his blog .
Marler responded first :
Bill Marler , 2:06 a.m. , Monday morning
IMHO and despite David ’s last post on [ The Complete Patient ] , I think that the editorial is a normal response to a bad situation at [ Hartmann ’s ] dairy .
When you combine anti-government , anti-science , and the profit motive , I think these outbreaks will continue and the majority will react as this editorial shows .
If the raw milk movement has a chance , it will be by the social protesting that David appears to advocate – or it will be by embracing the fact that outbreaks happen , that science has its role , and protecting the consumer is the goal .
David Gumpert , 8:01 a.m .
As Bill indicates , I alluded to this editorial in my latest blog post about the current crackdown in Minnesota , including execution of a search warrant on a consumer 's home ( a first in the raw milk wars , as far as I know ) , as not dissimilar to old - time racial prejudice I am old enough to still remember ...
I can remember when elites in the South worried about blacks ' sense of superiority .
Only they used the word ' uppity ' to get their point across . "
I am convinced that the food safety and ag people detest raw milkies and sustainable farmers in much the same way as sheriffs in the South detested blacks – as less than human – and that is a major force behind these Washington - directed crackdowns .
I worry about Bill 's regularly expressed concern about " the profit motive " as being a big concern in the growth of raw milk .
Is n't " the profit motive " a driver of all food producers ?
Is n't the lack of profit a big reason many dairies have folded over the last 40 years ?
To risk what many raw dairies are risking ( search warrants , shutdowns , police raids ) usually requires more than a focus on “ the profit motive . ”
It requires a genuine interest in getting healthy foods to eager consumers .
Bill Marler , 8:20 a.m .
David , I find comparing human rights to the right to drink raw milk , well , perhaps as over - dramatic as the video of Chris Martin on a vent .
Re : profits .
I am not opposed to them .
My point is that like any business , people get into them and start them for many reasons .
Some find a market , like raw milk , and they do a great job because they are selling directly to family and friends .
Then they realize that they can sell it to others and continue to do a good job .
But then others enter the market and care less about making a quality product and more about making a buck or a political point or two .
Unless the raw milk movement stops playing the race card ( and denying outbreaks ) and deal with these issues straight up , what you see is going to get worse , not better .
David , most of the dairies – not all , but most – were shit holes like Hartmann's .
They will be the nail in the coffin of the movement that you have pushed yourself to lead .
David Gumpert , 2:26 p.m .
Fortunately , Bill , you 're not one of the farmers and consumers whose rights have been threatened , in some cases trampled on , as those in these cases :
2006 – Kentucky dairy farmer Gary Oaks confronted by agents from FDA and Ohio Dept of Agriculture , escorted by Cincinnati police , in Cincinnati parking lot passing out raw milk to his herdshare members .
He 's questioned so intensively he collapses .
He ’s hospitalized three times over next few months with symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Eventually he settles with ODA to avoid further stress , and pays $ 500 fine .
Never any allegation of illnesses .
2006 – Ohio raw dairy farmer Carol Schmitmeyer loses her Grade A dairy license when two Dayton raw milk drinkers become ill .
Each subsequently submits affidavits contending they most likely became ill from other causes , and she wins her license back in a state court case in late 2006 .
2006 – Michigan farmer Richard Hebron , pulled over by Michigan state police and searched , has $ 8,000 worth of raw dairy confiscated ; simultaneously , his home searched for five hours by Michigan Dept of Agriculture agents , and his computer and food confiscated .
County DA spends six months deciding not to prosecute him , but he 's not compensated for his loss .
Illnesses that prompted the raid most likely the result of pasteurized milk contamination .
2007 -2008 – Pennsylvania raw dairy farmer Mark Nolt 's farm raided three times by dozens of agents from FDA and PA Dept of Ag , during which thousands of dollars of dairy equipment confiscated , along with book by Joel Salatin , Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal .
Never any allegation of illnesses from his milk .
2006 - 2009 – Half a dozen New York raw dairy farmers shut down for varying amounts of time by NY Dept of Ag and Markets because of findings of listeria in their raw milk , yet not a single listeria illness attributed to raw milk during this time .
One of the farmers has been shut down nine times , and is currently being prosecuted by the state agriculture agency for failure to pay huge fines .
2009 - 2010 – Half a dozen Wisconsin raw dairy farmers either being prosecuted and / or lose their Grade A dairy licenses for selling raw milk , even though no illnesses from their farms .
Plus , raw milk buying club owner Max Kane being prosecuted for failure to give up his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination because he wo n't name his customers and raw dairy farmer suppliers .
2009 – Georgia ag agents and FDA agent force more than 50 consumers to publicly dispose of raw milk legally purchased in South Carolina and being delivered by a buying club , as it had been doing for five years previously .
2010 – Four Massachusetts buying clubs that deliver raw milk from dairies to consumers are served with cease - and - desist orders , despite years of having operated with full knowledge of ag officials , and despite not a single illness attributed to raw milk in the state in well over a decade .
2010 – Minnesota ag agents accompanied by detectives execute a search warrant on a Minneapolis area family that consumes raw milk , supposedly because the family allowed dairy farmer Michael Hartmann to park in their driveway to drop off milk to area consumers .
2010 – A private Minneapolis buying club , Traditional Foods Warehouse , shut down because of suspected connections to raw dairies , denying its several hundred members access to their food .
This is just a partial list , and it's no coincidence it 's as long as it is .
It is testimony to an official nationally directed campaign to deprive owners of small dairies of their right to distribute food either according to state regulations or via private contract , and the right of consumers to access the foods of their choice .
We see an ongoing difference between words and action .
You suggest that raw milk proponents must admit to illnesses from certain dairies to gain respect and credibility .
While some farmers and other raw milk proponents have been prepared to admit to a number of outbreaks from raw milk , it seems to make no difference whether there is admission of illnesses or no evidence of illnesses – the crackdown proceeds more aggressively than ever .
The only words I take seriously are those from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control as part of the national " Healthy People 2020 " national health goals over the next ten years , currently in draft form : to " increase the number of states that have prohibited sale or distribution of unpasteurized dairy products . "
Bill Marler , 2:28 p.m .
Well , more Hartmann dairies and the state will have a cake walk .
Stop playing victim and clean this up .
SGT , 12:28 a.m. Tuesday morning
Um , Bill … David …
Can I assume that these e-mails are “ on record ? ”
In other words , can I use them on SGT ?
Bill Marler , 2:36 p.m .
I ’ve been typing my responses on my iPhone .
But do with them as you wish .
David Gumpert , 2:39 p.m .
Yeah , I ’m fine with you using my material as you ’d like as well .
And that brings us up to date .
At least so I thought until I read the latest breaking news about raw milk , e-mailed to me last night by Bill Marler as he boarded a plane to London :
Longmont Colorado Billy Goat Raw Milk Dairy Sickens 16 with Campylobacter and E. coli O157:H7

Today the Supreme Court ruled that Chicago 's handgun ban violates the right to keep and bear arms .
The 5 - to - 4 decision confirms that the Second Amendment binds state and local governments as well as federal domains such as the District of Columbia , which had a similar gun law that the Court overturned in the landmark 2008 case D.C. v. Heller .
The Court ruled that the Second Amendment , like most other protections in the Bill of Rights , applies to the states by way of the 14th Amendment 's Due Process Clause .
It rejected an invitation to revive the amendment 's Privileges or Immunities Clause , a more plausible basis for incorporation .
The decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago is here ( PDF ) .
SCOTUS
Wiki has the oral argument transcript and other documents related to the case here .
Previous Reason coverage here .
More later .
Addendum : Regarding the appropriate route for incorporation , Justice Antonin Scalia , an outspoken critic of substantive due process , has this to say in his concurring opinion :
Despite my misgivings about Substantive Due Process as an original matter , I have acquiesced in the Court 's incorporation of certain guarantees in the Bill of Rights " because it is both long established and narrowly limited . "
This case does not require me to reconsider that view , since straightforward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it .
In his concurring opinion , by contrast , Justice Clarence Thomas makes the case for enforcing the Privileges or Immunities Clause :
There are some awesome shots back from times of the USSR .
Having been shot during 1950 - 1980 ’s they represent life of the Russian people in such cities like Moscow , Novosibirsk and in some other cities along the Transsiberian railway track .
Most of them were shot just by bypassers and onlookers , but a few were made by foreign photographers like Leonard Giannada and Franco Rattazzi .

( Note : Segment 3 of this interview has been removed from the podcast feed — out of respect for the family members involved , and due to legal and other concerns ) .
In this 4 - part series , we interview Richard Packham — co-founder of the Ex-Mormon foundation .
Throughout the interview and via Richard ’s own personal story , we explore 3 ways in which the LDS Church creates unnecessary enemies :
Episode 1 : By not being honest about its own history ( e.g. teaching accurate history ) Episode 2 : By breaking up families ( when one no longer believes ) Episode 3 : By harming the loved ones of those who have left the church Episode 4 : To conclude , Richard discusses the benefits of religious belief and the LDS church , the mission of the ExMormon foundation , and bears a final testimony regarding the joy / happiness he has experienced since leaving the church .
NOTE : The purpose of this interview is NOT to encourage people to stay or leave the LDS church .
It is simply to :
Seek to understand and to validate the path of those who have felt compelled to leave the church , and Explore ways in which the church can seek to no longer create unnecessary enemies .
(… a bit of silence .
You have to let the tape roll for a few seconds , or else the intro gets cut off … there . )
There was a time that it was possible to say everything you needed to say with a small rectangular bit of plastic containing a thin strip of magnetic tape .
It was 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minutes of glory .
It was the music of the spheres — mostly social ones .
It was the mix tape , an artifact of a bygone age , perhaps .
But also a lost art form , a dark art of play / record , pause , and fade .
In this world of playlists and iPod shuffles , the ancient art form of the mix - tape is a fading memory of a world soaked in sepia toned nostalgia .
Or maybe not sepia tone , so much as pastel colours , and brass trimmings .
Yet , a few of us remember the clack of a C - 90 tape , the BASF , the Maxell , the Memorex , in our hands .
Making mix tapes was the act of stringing together poetry , compiling the lists , the employment of quick thinking about sequencing , about fades , about themes , about sheer and unadulterated expression .
Because that ’s what the making of the mix tape was — expression .
It might have been the expression of what we absolutely knew to be superior musical taste , with the crowd pleasers mixed in with the more obscure tracks , the ones that not only exalted the listener , but also of the mix - tape creator , the alchemist , the magician , who so nonchalantly placed it in the running .
And still hoping you ’d be impressed , we hoped , we willed , that the sheer cool of the song would become attached to the way others viewed us .
Or maybe it was an act of young , and unpolluted ( and sometimes unrequited ) love , with each song being a sentiment straight from one heart and into the center of another .
Start the tape .
Let the transparent lead - in roll , and wait for the black .
Then , clamp those play / record buttons down , savagely .
And it is begun .
There you ’d sit surrounded by album covers , watching that black hole sun spin , while queuing up the next one , holding the black vinyl disc by the edges in anticipation .
Mix tapes were acts of creation .
You were an artist , with the piles of albums feverishly plucked from the racks in turn , and then strewn on the floor when their time in the sun was over .
They are paint to a canvas .
This was not the time for order in the outside world , only order of the inside world .
Only with the architecture of sounds , tied by theme or by sonic unity .
And there were no rules — other than the one about no two tracks being by one artist on one side of the tape .
The pens and pencils ran furiously over the laminated inserts as the music played , cramming the titles of songs together , running into the names of bands like cars lined up crookedly in a musical traffic jam .
The breaths were inhaled , and then held , as we begged our stereos not to cut off that last song on side - A , because that song was such a perfect ending to a side , such a perfect set up to side - B .
You eyed the rolling tape , watching the thin black band get thinner , and thinner .
“ Oh please ! ” you muttered to yourself , “ Just fit . ”
Sometimes it did .
Sometimes it did n’t .
There were only so many songs that could fit on one side of your mix tape .
Even if it did n’t , there was always side - B to make up for it .
You could redeem yourself with side B — if you chose carefully , if you were wise .
And that ’s the thing .
The limitations of the exercise is what made it fun .
When that perfect song did fit , when it did dovetail so perfectly with the next track , it was transcendent , almost as good as the love we hoped our tape would inspire when we gave it to that special someone .
And that ’s bottom line .
Mix tapes , like love itself , were always best when you gave them away .
When you ’re done , you ’ve got an artifact .
You have a collection of little slices of time as captured by means of plastic , magnetic tape , and traces of ritual , lingering like some ineffably sweet scent .
You ’ve created something out of nothing , fashioning from the ether of the Top Forty , or from imported treasures that none of your friends knew existed .
You ’ve done more than create a playlist .
You ’ve given birth to something , an object no less , that did n’t exist in that same way before .
Mix tapes were always unique .
Later , they ’d be listened to , for a while .
Maybe they helped to break down the walls of reticence in a lover .
Or maybe they , and you , were spurned .
Perhaps they ended up a a shoe box , forever separated from their handmade track listings , the labels faded or smudged by over - eager and sweaty hands .
Maybe they ended up in a pile , given back to you by someone who could n’t see the value in them , or perhaps in anything .
But whether held with admiration , love , or scorn , they are artifacts of our lives .
They are the wonderful , and sharply in - focus present and all of the emotions felt in the present , suspended in amber , and held on the hiss and crackle of replicated analogue waves , pulling sounds down from the ages , and telling the listener all they ever needed to know about us in that specific moment .
Mix tapes were no less than our bids for immortality .

It ’s no secret that the Obama administration has struggled from the beginning to find a coherent narrative to support the Afghan war it inherited .
Or to craft an even remotely coherent strategy .
( Other than how to shift the blame when the whole thing implodes . )
But now that General David Petraeus is assuming command , hearts seem suddenly light .
There is a sense – or at least a claim – that new leadership in the field will somehow transform an otherwise bleak and worsening situation .
This sense is shared across party lines , and it appears likely that Petraeus will be unanimously confirmed in his new role by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
It seems appropriate , therefore , to reread Gen. Petraeus ’ seminal work , Field Manual 3 - 24 , to get a sense of how he might undertake this transformation .
( FM 3 - 24 is the counterinsurgency guide for the US military .
Along with FM 3-24.2 , Tactics
In Counterinsurgency , it details what every US soldier , from private to four - star is supposed to know about COIN . )
If Afghanistan is , in fact , a COIN engagement – and we must assume POTUS believes it is , since he has nominated a man perceived to be America ’s foremost COIN expert to lead it – then he should be using the best available COIN guidelines to assess it .
Presumably that would be FM 3 - 24 , so I ’ve taken the liberty of extracting key points to use as metrics .
The number and italicized sections below are lifted directly from FM 3 - 24 .
The snarky ( excuse me , I mean insightful ) commentary is mine .
1 - 4 . Long - term success in COIN depends on the people taking charge of their own affairs and consenting to the government ’s rule .
Er . . . then actually having a functioning ‘ Host Nation ’ government is a necessary precondition for success ?
1 -10 .
For the reasons just mentioned , maintaining security in an unstable environment requires vast resources , whether host nation , U.S. , or multinational .
You mean vast , as in hundreds of thousands of troops , similar numbers of development personnel and the cash to fund it all ?
1-30 .
Protracted conflicts favor insurgents , and no approach makes better use of that asymmetry than the protracted popular war .
Nine years and counting .
Might be a good time to ask which team has the deeper bench .
1-113 .
The primary objective of any COIN operation is to foster development of effective governance by a legitimate government .
Oh .
Whoops .
1-116 .
Six possible indicators of legitimacy that can be used to analyze threats to stability include the following :
The ability to provide security for the populace ( including protection from internal and external threats ) .
Selection of leaders at a frequency and in a manner considered just and fair by a substantial majority of the populace .
A high level of popular participation in or support for political processes .
A culturally acceptable level of corruption .
A culturally acceptable level and rate of political , economic , and social development .
A high level of regime acceptance by major social institutions .
How many points do you get for ‘ none of the above ’ ?
1-121 . Unity of effort must be present at every echelon of a COIN operation .
Ah , man , even the VP , those weenies over at State and the National Security Advisor ?
1-131 .
The cornerstone of any COIN effort is establishing security for the civilian populace .
Right .
Remind me how many of those provinces were rated as ‘ fully secure ’ in the April 2010 review ?
As I recall , the exact number was , umm . . . is zero a number ?
1-134 .
Insurgencies are protracted by nature .
Thus , COIN operations always demand considerable expenditures of time and resources .
Roger that .
Just so long as the pull date is before the next election .
Well , shucks .
Color me cynical .
In the wildland fire biz we used a quick and dirty little algorithm called TREAT to decide whether to fight or flee .
I think it might apply here , too .

The rule was , if you had any three or more , it was a good decision to stand and fight .
Any fewer , and it was time to remove your crews from danger .
Using that for AfPak , I ’d give the US about 1.2 .
Pretty good on attitude , fair on training ( for that specific environment ) , way short of time , resources and experience .
The US cannot commit to the 10 to 20 year time frame ( starting today ! ) that is likely necessary to actually succeed .
Nor can it come close to putting the necessary number of troops in the field .
( Estimated at over 1.4 million with the classic troop density of 20 counterinsurgents per 1,000 population .
Yeah , you can count the locals , but at this point , the ANA and ANP are so bad they would have to be subtracted from the total , not added . )
And – key point – in terms of experience , the US has yet to win a classical counterinsurgency fight .
( Sorry , Iraq does n’t count .
It was n’t true COIN , and the US did not win .
For an explanation , see Fourth Generation Warfare in a Fifth Generation Conflict . )
Bottom line ?

NASA eyeballs glacial melt in Greenland
By Andrew Freedman
* Several rain chances this week : Full Forecast *
Satellite images from DigitalGlobe , via NASA , showing the recent breakup of part of the Jakobsahvn Isbrae glacier .
The Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier , one of the largest glaciers in Greenland , swiftly lost a 2.7 - square mile chunk of ice between July 6 and 7 , NASA announced late last week .
The ice loss pushed the point where the glacier meets the ocean , known as the " calving front , " nearly one mile farther inland in a single day .
According to the space agency , the new calving front location is the farthest inland on record .
Events such as this one are not unusual , but rarely do scientists see them unfold in near real - time .
Researchers working with the space agency spotted the rapid ice loss using high - resolution satellite imagery .
Two such images tell the story .
In the first image ( above ) , a rift , which looks like a narrow horizontal line indicated by the red arrow , can be seen developing in the glacier .
In the next image , taken a day later , the ice below the rift has collapsed into the sea and the location of the calving front has retreated .
Why does this glacier matter to me , you ask ?
The short answer : sea level , although this particular event wo n't raise the level of the Potomac or any other U.S. river anytime soon .
Unlike the loss of sea ice , glacial melting causes sea level to increase , and the fate of glaciers like this one will play a key role in determining by how much sea level increases .
The Jakobshavn Isbrae is what is known as an outlet glacier , which the National Snow and Ice Data Center defines as " a valley glacier which drains an inland ice sheet or ice cap and flows through a gap in peripheral mountains . "
In other words , it serves as a drainage pipe from the land ice into the ocean .
According to NASA , the Jakobshavn Isbrae , which is located in western Greenland at about 69 degrees north latitude , is the largest outlet glacier in Greenland , draining 6.5 percent of Greenland 's ice sheet area .
Scientists at NASA , NOAA and other agencies are keeping close tabs on Greenland 's ice due to its significant ramifications for global sea level rise .
If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt ( a process that would likely take several centuries to play out , even with more global warming than we 've already seen ) , sea level would rise by as much as an estimated 23 feet globally .
NASA reports that " as much as 10 percent of all ice lost from Greenland is coming through Jakobshavn , which is also believed to be the single largest contributor to sea level rise in the northern hemisphere . "
Interestingly , this particular glacier has been retreating especially rapidly in recent years .
As the below image shows , the ice front receded more 27 miles in 160 years , but in recent years the ice loss rate has increased , with six miles of retreat observed in just the past decade .

Recent studies have found that warming ocean temperatures may be responsible for much of the increased melting of Greenland 's outlet glaciers , and this may be accelerating the melting of the larger Greenland ice sheet .
For example , one study published in Nature Geoscience in February concluded that glaciers in west Greenland are melting 100 times faster at their undersea end points than on the surface .
This event would support the ocean - driven melt theory , according to a NASA ice specialist .
" While there have been ice breakouts of this magnitude from Jakonbshavn and other glaciers in the past , this event is unusual because it occurs on the heels of a warm winter that saw no sea ice form in the surrounding bay , " said Thomas Wagner , cryospheric program scientist at NASA Headquarters , in a press release .
" While the exact relationship between these events is being determined , it lends credence to the theory that warming of the oceans is responsible for the ice loss observed throughout Greenland and Antarctica . "

Ein hübsches Sümmchen als Pension
Klammert er sich darum an sein Amt ?
Kann er trotz der 21 zertrampelten jungen Menschen
bis Oktober 2010 seinen Rücktritt verhindern ?
Herr Adolf Sauerland ist früher Berufsschullehrer gewesen .
Was haben sie gemacht , bevor sie Oberbürgermeister wurden ?
Bevor ich zum Oberbürgermeister der Stadt Duisburg gewählt wurde , war ich Berufsschullehrer in Krefeld .
Dann macht er kraft Parteibuchtickets – CDU – einen saftigen Gehaltssprung .
Brachte es zur Besoldungsklasse B sonstwas .
Gibt selber zu mehr als 10.000 € monatlich abzustecken :
Duisburg - virtuell :
Wie viel verdient man als Oberbürgermeister ?
Die Gehälter der Bürgermeister und Oberbürgermeister sind per Gesetz geregelt und richten sich nach der Größe einer Stadt .
Jeder Oberbürgermeister einer deutschen Stadt mit mehr als 500.000 Einwohnern bekommt laut Gesetz ein Gehalt von gut zehn Tausend Euro brutto .
Im Interview zeigt er sich , fett wie er ist , mit Weingläsern .
Gefüllten Weingläsern .
Mit Alkohol ?
Kommt vom Alkohol seine fette Wampe sein Emboinpoint sein Hungerödem ?
Bund der Steuerzahler steckt uns ein Licht auf über die Pension von seinesgleichen .
Diese Leute brauchen nur sechs
Jahre zu arbeiten um Pension abstecken zu können und sie müssen keinen Cent aus der eigenen Tasche einzahlen um die saftige Pension zu kassieren .
Das folgende Zitat vom Bund der Steuerzahler wurde gepostet am 4.5.2008 bei Politikforen :
Oberbürgermeister , Bürgermeister und Landräte sind im Alter gut versorgt : Schon
nach einer Wahlperiode – also nach nur fünf Jahren bzw .
demnächst sechs Jahren
im Amt – und unter Erfüllung sehr einfacher Voraussetzungen haben sie einen
Anspruch auf eine staatliche Altersversorgung .
Diese beträgt mindestens 35 Prozent
ihrer letzten Bezüge als Stadt - oder Kreisoberhaupt .
Ein Beispiel : Ein verheirateter
Bürgermeister einer Gemeinde mit weniger als 10.000 Einwohnern erhält im
Monat aktuell rund 4.200 Euro ( A16 ) .
Nach fünf Jahren im Amt hat er einen Pensionsanspruch
von monatlich 1.470 Euro .
Sein verheirateter Amtskollege in Köln
wird , da die Stadt mehr als 500.000 Einwohner hat , nach B 11 bezahlt , was einem
monatlichen Gehalt von gut 10.600 Euro entspricht .
Daraus ergibt sich nach fünfjähriger
Dienstzeit ein Pensionsanspruch von monatlich 3.710 Euro , für den er
keinen Beitrag gezahlt hat .
Den leistet der Steuerzahler .
Er hat den Hauptgewinn in Griffweite …
Update :
Kommentatoren hier behaupten anderes , sie sagen er habe schon seine Pension sicher !
Ende Update
Das Zitat von eben stammt von 2008 .
Jetzt also muss ein Herr Adolf Sauerland 6
Jahre abgesessen haben als OB um in den Genuß seiner saftigen Pension zu kommen , für die er nichts eingezahlt hat .
Diese sechs Jahre des Herrn Adolf Sauerland , CDU , sind aber noch nicht abgesessen .
Erst im Oktober 2010 ist es soweit .
Falls Herr Adolf Sauerland , CDU , jetzt zurückträte von seinem fetten Pöstchen als Oberbürgermeister , mit seinem fetten Bauch , dann verlöre er seine fette Pension .
Folglich wird er , da er zu der heutigen „ Elite “ ( = Negativauslese ) der heutigen deutschen Systemparteien gehört , freiwillig nicht zurücktreten , jedenfalls nicht vor Oktober .
Also wird er die CDU hübsch weiter beschädigen und als das vorführen , was sie ist und er wird so die CDU zur Kenntlichkeit entstellen .
Das freut uns .
Im Zuge dieser Demaskierung wird die CDU panikgetrieben den Druck auf ihn steigern um ihn der Wählerstimmen wegen loszuwerden .
Das wird spannend .
Das freut uns wieder .
Die CDU kann ihm den fälligen Rücktritt mit irgendeinem hochdotierten Druckposten – EU bietet sich an – versüßen , bei dem er sogar noch mehr Kohle macht als mit seiner Pension .
Das freut uns nicht .
Das werden wir genau verfolgen und berichten .
Herr Adolf Sauerland hat es sich verdient , dass wir uns um sein Schicksal kümmern .
Er wurde laut eigener Bekundung am 4 . Juni 1955 geboren .
Warum benannten ihn die Eltern mit dem Namen Adolf ?
Im Jahre 1955 , also zehn Jahre nach dem vom Verbrecher Adolf H. entfesselten Weltkrieg , nennen Eltern ihr Kind Adolf ?
Und dieses Kind legt diesen Namen nicht ab als Erwachsener ?
Was sollen wir davon halten ?
Mir persönlich reicht der aus dem vergangenen Jahrhundert für die nächsten 100.000 Jahre .
Wetten werden angenommen !
Hält er durch bis zum Stichtag ?
Rettet er seine Pension ?
Schafft Herr Sauerland , Noch - Oberbürgermeister , CDU , es sich die 6 Jahre vollzumachen ?
Bis zum saftigen Pensionsanspruch ?
Schafft er es ?
Bei ihm geht es nur um seine fette Pension , für die er nichts einzuzahlen brauchte .
Für 21 bei lebendigem Leibe totgetrampelte junge Menschen geht es um überhaupt nichts mehr : Sie sind totgetreten .
Herr Adolf Sauerland ist Oberbürgermeister will nicht von seinem fetten Pöstchen abtreten und bleibt der Bestattung der jungen Menschen fern und verkündet er hätte nichts gewusst von Warnungen .
( Warum ist er OB wenn er nichts weiss ?
Lügt er vielleicht ein wenig ? )
Das Reden von wegen „ staatsanwaltschaftliche Ermittlungen “ sollte immer auch dazu die Tatsache nennen , daß Staatsanwälte in Deutschland weisungsgebunden sind .
Sie unterstehen Landesminister ( Justizminister , der selbstverständlich seinerseits den Weisungen des Ministerpräsidenten – oder wie auch immer man im jeweiligen Bundesland den jeweiligen offiziellen Regierungschef nennt – untersteht . )
Wie wir gleich sehen werden ist die Kette derer lang , die einem stinknormalem Staatsanwalt hineinreden können , die dem normalen Staatsanwalt gegenüber weisungsbefugt sind , der natürlich , wie alle , auch an seinem Weiterkommen in seinem Berufe interessiert ist …
Ist das nicht schön ?
Kurbelt das nicht die Fantasie an ?
Man könnte tolle Gedankenspiele veranstalten … Was wäre wenn … Lassen wir es hier an dieser Stelle .
Vorerst .
( Eigentlich sollten sich die Systemmedien dieses unseres freien , demokratischen und sozialen Rechtsstaates dieser Aufgabe widmen hier mal ein wenig zu recherchieren :
Wer ermittelt ?
Welchen Rang hat er ?
Wer ist ihm gegenüber alles weisungsbefugt ?
Wer ist Justizminister in NRW ?
Welche theoretischen Möglichkeiten gäbe es ein Verfahren entweder zu torpedieren , abzuschießen oder es in die Länge zu ziehen ?
[ Mir fallen gleich ein halbes Dutzend ein , natürlich ist das rein theoretisch gedacht , ohne jeden Praxisbezug , und jedwede Ähnlichkeit mit früher oder irgenwann einmal vielleicht existierenden Ereignissen oder Personen wäre reiner purer blanker bloßer Zufall .
{ Welche Möglichkeiten hätte irgendein Vorgesetzter innerhalb irgendeiner Hierarchie um die Arbeit eines Untergebenen zu torpedieren und / oder in die Länge zu ziehen ? } ]
Wie sind die Parteizugehörigkeiten ?
Klüngel ?
Die Systemmedien sollten auch suchen ob andere Zugehörigkeiten vorliegen , dies als kleine Anregung . )
Wikipedia :
Anders als Richter sind Staatsanwälte weisungsgebunden ( Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ) und unterliegen uneingeschränkt der Dienstaufsicht durch Vorgesetzte ( GVG ) .
Einem Staatsanwalt bei der Staatsanwaltschaft eines Landes sind übergeordnet : der Staatsanwalt als Gruppenleiter ( früher : Erster Staatsanwalt ; je nach Land ggf. als Unterabteilungsleiter oder Vertreter des Abteilungsleiters ) ,
der Oberstaatsanwalt ( als Abteilungsleiter ) ,
der Leitende Oberstaatsanwalt ( als Behördenleiter ) ,
der Generalstaatsanwalt ( Leiter der übergeordneten Behörde ) ,
der Justizminister oder Justizsenator ( Berlin , Bremen und Hamburg ) des jeweiligen Landes .
Diesen Vorgesetzten muss der sachbearbeitende Staatsanwalt in bestimmten Fällen über das Verfahren und seine durchgeführten oder geplanten Maßnahmen berichten , beispielsweise in Verfahren , die sich gegen Politiker richten oder aus anderen Gründen weitere Kreise beschäftigen können .

Image caption Tony Blair now works as a Middle East peace envoy
Police protection for former prime ministers should not cost anything more " than is absolutely necessary " , Foreign Secretary William Hague has said .
It follows newspaper reports that Tony Blair 's bodyguards are costing taxpayers £ 250,000 a year in expenses .
The Mail on Sunday claims officers are staying in " five - star luxury " on Mr Blair 's holiday and business trips .
Mr Blair 's office rejected calls for him to pay policing costs , arguing he spent most of his time on unpaid work .
This included projects in Africa , his role as a Middle East peace envoy for the Quartet powers - the EU , the UN , the US and Russia - and his faith and sports foundations .
' Good job '
A spokesman said : " Mr Blair has a very high regard for the professionalism of his protection team .
" They do a fantastic job , often in very difficult circumstances particularly in the Middle East . "
The Mail on Sunday reports protection squad claims of more than £ 1,200 - a- night for accommodation in hotels , limousine hire and other expenses .
Like all public services the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) has got to prove that it delivers value for money Metropolitan Police
The paper lists a series of holidays , including a two - week break Mr Blair took in Borneo , where officers ran up a bill of more than £ 20,000 on their Metropolitan Police Barclaycard .
Another week - long visit , by the Blairs to the Como Shambhala health retreat in Bali , is said to have resulted in a bill of £ 6,873 for the three - man police team 's accommodation .
In addition to the holidays , officers accompanied Mr Blair on more than 21 international trips in the first four months of 2010 , the newspaper reports , to destinations including Abu Dhabi , Jordan , Liberia , China , Israel , Singapore , Malaysia and the US .
The newspaper says it has seen documents which show the annual cost of Mr Blair 's protection squad was nearly double the £ 135,000 submitted by the officers protecting Gordon Brown in his last year as prime minister .
Asked about the story on Sky News , Mr Hague said : " I do n't know anything about that particular level of cost .
That 's not provided by the Foreign Office so I can't really comment on that .
" Clearly , former prime ministers , whoever they are , whichever party they are from , do need to be protected but we have to make sure that is as cost - effective as possible .
That it does n't cost any more to the taxpayer than is absolutely necessary .
" I am sure the departments who deal with that will make sure it is subject to the right level of scrutiny but I can't say any more about that , really , today . "
Mr Hague paid tribute to Mr Blair 's work in his new role as UN Middle East peace envoy , saying : " I think he does a good job " .
The foreign secretary , who held talks with Mr Blair at the Foreign Office on Friday , said that despite their former differences as leaders of rival parties , he would continue to work with the former PM to try to " ease the situation in Gaza and improve the prospects of peace in the Middle East " .
' Luxury '
The cost of protecting Mr Blair was criticised by the former director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald , who is to be made a Liberal Democrat peer .
He told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show that " something had gone awry " if Mr Blair 's protection officers were staying in five - star hotels .
He said : " There is obviously a good reason why former prime ministers are protected , and Tony Blair is probably under threat as much as any .
" But I think it does slightly stick in the craw that so much money is being spent on so much luxury .
I am sure that many , many taxpayers are going to resent this . "
All former prime ministers are entitled to round - the - clock police bodyguards and protection officers ' overtime rates are reported to be among the highest in the Metropolitan Police .
The Mail on Sunday reports that officers protecting former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major claimed an extra £ 119,000 in expenses last year .
' Cheapest price '
In a statement , the Metropolitan Police said : " Like all public services the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) has got to prove that it delivers value for money .
" We are committed to achieving this and with anticipated budget cuts we are even more focused on how we can best do this .
" Overtime is called upon when it is essential to maintain operational effectiveness . "
It added : " The few officers receiving significant payments in respect of overtime are mainly in undercover roles or in royalty and diplomatic protection units .
" In such areas , working time is determined by the operational circumstances and , in the case of protection officers , requirements of the principal . "
The statement said that the Met regularly monitors and scrutinises levels of overtime and expenses and reports regularly to individual groups and the Metropolitan Police Authority .
It said the Met sought to " book the cheapest price travel available bearing in mind operational demands " and all overseas travel was subject to authorisation by a senior police officer or a senior member of police staff " .
Catalonia bans bullfighting in landmark Spain vote Published duration 28 July 2010
image caption Bullfighting has declined in popularity in Catalonia but fights are still held in Barcelona
The parliament of Catalonia has voted to ban bullfighting - the first region of mainland Spain to do so .
The vote took place as the result of a petition brought to parliament , signed by 180,000 people who say the practice is barbaric and outdated .
Bullfight supporters insist that the corrida , as it is known , is an important tradition to preserve .
They also fear the vote could be the first of many in the country .
The ban takes effect in January 2012 .
In Wednesday 's vote , 68 backed a ban , 55 voted against and nine abstained .
Barcelona 's main bullring is one of the oldest in Spain , but support for the bullfight has waned .
The Barcelona bullring is the only functioning one in Catalonia .
The vote was brought to the agenda by activists who argue it is cruel and unacceptable and say most spectators in Catalonia these days are tourists .
The campaign was led by the animal rights lobby group Prou ! ( Enough ! ) .
Supporters says the corrida is an art form that it is vital to preserve .
media caption The BBC's Sarah Rainsford : " The emotions were very high in the debate "
Catalan nationalism
The vote was close as the two main parties in parliament took the unusual step of allowing members to cast their ballots according to their conscience .
But while the official debate is over animal rights , many believe this process is an attempt by nationalist - minded Catalans to mark their difference from the rest of Spain by rejecting one of its best known traditions .
Pro-bullfighting groups fear that a ban could spark a wave of similar campaigns across the country .
They argue that threatens the livelihood of thousands of people .
The first Spanish region to ban bullfighting was the Canary Islands , in 1991 .
Deep - rooted tradition
A bullfight typically lasts about 20 minutes , and the bull is stabbed numerous times before the fatal blow delivered with a sword thrust between its shoulder blades .
The fighting bulls are specially bred and traditionally a corrida involves six bulls and three matadors , each of whom tackles two bulls .
In Portugal and the south of France the bull is not killed in the ring .
Bullfighting is also widespread in Latin America .
The Plaza Mexico arena in Mexico City is the biggest in the world , seating up to 55,000 spectators .
One of the oldest is the 18th - Century Plaza de Acho in Lima , Peru .
One of the most famous fans of bullfighting was the US writer Ernest Hemingway , who celebrated the tradition in his book Death in the Afternoon .
Facebook founder may have given up ownership stake
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A seven - year - old contract signed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg granting a New York businessman an ownership stake in Zuckerberg 's then - fledgling Web project may be real , a Facebook lawyer acknowledged Tuesday in federal court hearing .
" Mr. Zuckerberg did have a contract with Mr. Ceglia , " Facebook lawyer Lisa Simpson told U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo , N.Y. , according to a Bloomberg report .
But Facebook is n't convinced that the document plaintiff Paul Ceglia submitted to the court is an authentic copy of that contract .
" Whether [ Zuckerberg ] signed this piece of paper , we 're unsure at this moment , " she said .
Wellsville , N.Y. , resident Ceglia sued Facebook and Zuckerberg in a local court late last month , claiming he hired Zuckerberg in 2003 to work on two separate business ventures .
The first was to develop and maintain Web software for " the StreetFax Database , " according to a copy of a contract Ceglia filed with the court .
The second venture was " continued development " of an already - in - progress project " designed to offer the students of Harvard university access to a wesite [ sic ] similar to a live functioning yearbook with the working title of ' The Face Book . ' "
A local judge granted Ceglia 's request for an unusual and sweeping restraining order temporarily preventing Facebook from transferring or selling any of its assets .
Facebook responded by having the case transferred to federal court , where Judge Arcara on Friday suspended the restraining order .
Both sides agreed Tuesday to let the injunction lapse for the time being .
Ceglia 's attorney , Terrence Connors , said that his client hired Zuckerberg -- then an 18 - year - old Harvard freshman -- to work as a coder on a street - mapping database Ceglia hoped to create .
The contract they drew up covered both that work and an investment in a side project Zuckerberg said he had in the works , according to Connors .
That side project grew into Facebook , the world 's largest social networking site .
Ceglia agreed to pay Zuckerberg $ 2,000 for the job .
In a series of legal filings , Facebook has challenged both the facts of Ceglia 's case and the timing of it .
Ceglia 's alleged contract is dated April 23 , 2003 -- several months before Zuckerberg is believed to have started work on Facebook 's predecessor projects .
The domain name " thefacebook.com " was first registered in January 2004 .
But Ceglia 's attorneys maintain that their client 's case is a strong one .
" The contract is real -- as is plaintiff 's entitlement to at least a 50 % ownership interest in Facebook , " they wrote in court filing submitted Friday .
Facebook maintains that Ceglia 's suit is " completely frivolous , " a spokesman said Tuesday following the court hearing in Buffalo .
" The plaintiff has not produced the original of the alleged agreement for anyone , including the court , " he said .
" We have serious questions about the authenticity of the document and , assuming an original exists , we look forward to expressing our opinion about it once we see it . "
MIAMI -- Once Mike Miller 's deal with Miami finally got completed Friday , the Heat moved quickly to add other pieces to their dramatically changed roster .
The Heat landed a pair of centers , re-signing restricted free agent Joel Anthony to a five - year deal worth around $ 18 million and also inking second - round draft pick Dexter Pittman from Texas to a three - year contract .
Anthony has spent three seasons with the Heat , mostly as a defensive - minded reserve .
Pittman was the 32nd pick in last month 's draft and has been with Miami 's summer - league club .
Next up : Miami is getting set to add more big men .
Zydrunas Ilgauskas agreed to join the Heat on Tuesday and may be signed by Saturday , and Miami is also closing in on adding veteran forward Juwan Howard -- an ironic twist , considering Pat Riley tried to land Howard in a $ 99 million deal 14 years ago that was voided by the NBA .
But before going forward with anyone else , Miami needed to get the deal with Miller done .
" From the first moment that we met Mike on July 1 , it seemed like it would be a match made in heaven , " Riley , the Heat president , said in a statement .
" We consider him to be the finest perimeter shooter in the NBA . "
Miller made 48 percent of his 3 - pointers last season for Washington , second - best in the NBA behind Kyle Korver .
The 6 - foot - 8 shooter agreed in principle about a week earlier to a five - year deal worth about $ 25 million and actually signed his contract Thursday , but it took about another 24 hours for it to become finalized because of other paperwork issues .
He was considered a vital part of Miami 's offseason plan , which of course started with the re-signing of Dwyane Wade and the additions of LeBron James -- Miller 's close friend -- and Chris Bosh .
James said he wanted Miller to play with him , even talking the former Florida Gator into passing up higher - paying deals for a chance to sign with Miami .
" He is a multifaceted player who can rebound , handle the ball and make plays , " Riley said .
" We expect big things from him . "
After Friday 's signings , Miami now has eight players under contract , with Miller , Pittman and Anthony joining Wade , Bosh , James , Mario Chalmers and Udonis Haslem .
" This contract with Joel Anthony is a testament to the man who is second to none ; who has worked hard and deserved this , " Riley said .
" We felt that what he has done over the last couple of years in developing his game , his body and his knowledge warrants this reward .
If other NBA non -drafted free agents want a prototype to follow , Joel Anthony is that man . "
The 6 - foot - 10 , 290 - pound Pittman has been with Miami 's summer league team after the Heat took him with the 32nd selection in last month 's draft .
The Heat expected during the draft that Jermaine O'Neal would not be back in Miami for the coming season , so Miami used its first of what was four second - round choices to grab Pittman .
O'Neal 's departure also made re-signing Anthony a priority .
" Dexter has the size and agility to be a very productive player for us in the long run , and there is no better place for him to improve than in the Miami Heat system , " Riley said .
Miami has had conversations with swingman Matt Barnes , who played with Orlando last season and delayed his anticipated Friday decision on 2010 - 11 because other teams were contacting him .
The Heat also are considering their other second - round draft picks , Da'Sean Butler and Jarvis Varnado , plus have interest in free agent point guards Keyon Dooling and Chris Quinn .

THERE ’S A CERTAIN AGE at which you cease to regard your own death as a distant hypothetical and start to view it as a coming event .
For me , it was 67 — the age at which my father died .
For many Americans , I suspect it ’s 70 — the age that puts you within striking distance of our average national life expectancy of 78.1 years .
Even if you still feel pretty spry , you suddenly find that your roster of doctor ’s appointments has expanded , along with your collection of daily medications .
You grow accustomed to hearing that yet another person you once knew has dropped off the twig .
And you feel more and more like a walking ghost yourself , invisible to the younger people who push past you on the subway escalator .
Like it or not , death becomes something you think about , often on a daily basis .
Actually , you do n’t think about death , per se , as much as you do about dying — about when and where and especially how you ’re going to die .
Will you have to deal with a long illness ?
With pain , immobility , or dementia ?
Will you be able to get the care you need , and will you have enough money to pay for it ?
Most of all , will you lose control over what life you have left , as well as over the circumstances of your death ?
These are precisely the preoccupations that the right so cynically exploited in the debate over health care reform , with that ominous talk of Washington bean counters deciding who lives and dies .
It was all nonsense , of course — the worst kind of political scare tactic .
But at the same time , supporters of health care reform seemed to me too quick to dismiss old people ’s fears as just so much paranoid foolishness .
There are reasons why the death - panel myth found fertile ground — and those reasons go beyond the gullibility of half - senile old farts .
While politicians of all stripes shun the idea of health care rationing as the political third rail that it is , most of them accept a premise that leads , one way or another , to that end .
Here ’s what I mean : Nearly every other industrialized country recognizes health care as a human right , whose costs and benefits are shared among all citizens .
But in the United States , the leaders of both political parties along with most of the “ experts ” persist in treating health care as a commodity that is purchased , in one way or another , by those who can afford it .
Conservatives embrace this notion as the perfect expression of the all - powerful market ; though they make a great show of recoiling from the term , in practice they are endorsing rationing on the basis of wealth .
Liberals , including supporters of President Obama ’s health care reform , advocate subsidies , regulation , and other modest measures to give the less fortunate a little more buying power .
But as long as health care is viewed as a product to be bought and sold , even the most well - intentioned reformers will someday soon have to come to grips with health care rationing , if not by wealth then by some other criteria .
You could say I believe in one form of health care rationing : the kind you choose for yourself .
In a country that already spends more than 16 percent of each GDP dollar on health care ( PDF ) , it ’s easy to see why so many people believe there ’s simply not enough of it to go around .
But keep in mind that the rest of the industrialized world manages to spend between 20 and 90 percent less per capita and still rank higher than the US in overall health care performance .
In 2004 , a team of researchers including Princeton ’s Uwe Reinhardt , one of the nation ’s best known experts on health economics , found that while the US spends 134 percent more than the median of the world ’s most developed nations , we get less for our money — fewer physician visits and hospital days per capita , for example — than our counterparts in countries like Germany , Canada , and Australia .
( We do , however , have more MRI machines and more cesarean sections . )
Where does the money go instead ?
By some estimates , administration and insurance profits alone eat up at least 30 percent of our total health care bill ( and most of that is in the private sector — Medicare ’s overhead is around 2 percent ) .
In other words , we do n’t have too little to go around — we overpay for what we get , and we do n’t allocate our spending where it does us the most good .
“ In most [ medical ] resources we have a surplus , ” says Dr. David Himmelstein , cofounder of Physicians for a National Health Program .
“ People get large amounts of care that do n’t do them any good and might cause them harm [ while ] others do n’t get the necessary amount . ”
Looking at the numbers , it ’s pretty safe to say that with an efficient health care system , we could spend a little less than we do now and provide all Americans with the most spectacular care the world has ever known .
But in the absence of any serious challenge to the health - care - as - commodity system , we are doomed to a battlefield scenario where Americans must fight to secure their share of a “ scarce ” resource in a life - and - death struggle that pits the rich against the poor , the insured against the uninsured — and increasingly , the old against the young .
For years , any push to improve the nation ’s finances — balance the budget , pay for the bailout , or help stimulate the economy — has been accompanied by rumblings about the greedy geezers who resist entitlement “ reforms ” ( read : cuts ) with their unconscionable demands for basic health care and a hedge against destitution .
So , too , today : Already , President Obama ’s newly convened deficit commission looks to be blaming the nation ’s fiscal woes not on tax cuts , wars , or bank bailouts , but on the burden of Social Security and Medicare .
( The commission ’s co-chair , former Republican senator Alan Simpson , has declared , “ This country is gonna go to the bow - wows unless we deal with entitlements . ” )
Old people ’s anxiety in the face of such hostile attitudes has provided fertile ground for Republican disinformation and fearmongering .
But so has the vacuum left by Democratic reformers .
Too often , in their zeal to prove themselves tough on “ waste , ” they ’ve allowed connections to be drawn between two things that , to my mind , should never be spoken of in the same breath : death and cost .
Dying Wishes
The death - panel myth started with a harmless minor provision in the health reform bill that required Medicare to pay in case enrollees wanted to have conversations with their own doctors about “ advance directives ” like health care proxies and living wills .
The controversy that ensued , thanks to a host of right - wing commentators and Sarah Palin ’s Facebook page , ensured that the advance - planning measure was expunged from the bill .
But the underlying debate did n’t end with the passage of health care reform , any more than it began there .
For if rationing is inevitable once you ’ve ruled out reining in private profits , the question is who should be denied care , and at what point .
And given that no one will publicly argue for withholding cancer treatment from a seven - year - old , the answer almost inevitably seems to come down to what we spend on people — old people — in their final years .
As far back as 1983 , in a speech to the Health Insurance Association of America , a then - 57 - year - old Alan Greenspan suggested that we consider “ whether it is worth it ” to spend so much of Medicare ’s outlays on people who would die within the year .
( Appropriately , Ayn Rand called her acolyte “ the undertaker ” — though she chose the nickname because of his dark suits and austere demeanor . )
Not everyone puts the issue in such nakedly pecuniary terms , but in an April 2009 interview with the New York Times Magazine , Obama made a similar point in speaking of end - of - life care as a “ huge driver of cost . ”
He said , “ The chronically ill and those toward the end of their lives are accounting for potentially 80 percent of the total health care bill out here . ”
When geezers are empowered to make choices about our dying days , most of us will choose less aggressive — and less costly — treatments .
The president was being a bit imprecise :
Those figures are actually for Medicare expenditures , not the total health care tab , and more important , lumping the dying together with the “ chronically ill ” — who often will live for years or decades — makes little sense .
But there is no denying that end - of - life care is expensive .
Hard numbers are not easy to come by , but studies from the 1990s suggest that between a quarter and a third of annual Medicare expenditures go to patients in their last year of life , and 30 to 40 percent of those costs accrue in the final month .
What this means is that around one in ten Medicare dollars — some $ 50 billion a year — are spent on patients with fewer than 30 days to live .
Pronouncements on these data usually come coated with a veneer of compassion and concern :
How terrible it is that all those poor dying old folks have to endure aggressive treatments that only delay the inevitable ; all we want to do is bring peace and dignity to their final days !
But I wonder :
If that ’s really what they ’re worried about , how come they keep talking about money ?
At this point , I ought to make something clear : I am a big fan of what ’s sometimes called the “ right to die ” or “ death with dignity ” movement .
I support everything from advance directives to assisted suicide .
You could say I believe in one form of health care rationing : the kind you choose for yourself .
I ca n’t stand the idea of anyone — whether it ’s the government or some hospital administrator or doctor or Nurse Jackie — telling me that I must have some treatment I do n’t want , any more than I want them telling me that I can’t have a treatment I do want .
My final wish is to be my own one - member death panel .
A physician friend recently told me about a relative of hers , a frail 90 - year - old woman suffering from cancer .
Her doctors urged her to have surgery , followed by treatment with a recently approved cancer medicine that cost $ 5,000 a month .
As is often the case , my friend said , the doctors told their patient about the benefits of the treatment , but not about all the risks — that she might die during the surgery or not long afterward .
They also prescribed a month ’s supply of the new medication , even though , my friend says , they must have known the woman was unlikely to live that long .
She died within a week .
“ Now , ” my friend said , “ I ’m carrying around a $ 4,000 bottle of pills . ”
Perhaps reflecting what economists call “ supplier - induced demand , ” costs generally tend to go up when the dying have too little control over their care , rather than too much .
When geezers are empowered to make decisions , most of us will choose less aggressive — and less costly — treatments .
If we do n’t do so more often , it ’s usually because of an overbearing and money - hungry health care system , as well as a culture that disrespects the will of its elders and resists confronting death .
Once , when I was in the hospital for outpatient surgery , I woke up in the recovery area next to a man named George , who was talking loudly to his wife , telling her he wanted to leave .
She soothingly reminded him that they had to wait for the doctors to learn the results of the surgery , apparently some sort of exploratory thing .
Just then , two doctors appeared .
In a stiff , flat voice , one of them told George that he had six months to live .
When his wife ’s shrieking had subsided , I heard George say , “ I ’m getting the fuck out of this place . ”
The doctors sternly advised him that they had more tests to run and “ treatment options ” to discuss .
“ Fuck that , ” said George , yanking the IV out of his arm and getting to his feet .
“ If I ’ve got six months to live , do you think I want to spend another minute of it here ?
I ’m going to the Alps to go skiing . ”
I do n’t know whether George was true to his word .
But not long ago I had a friend , a scientist , who was true to his .
Suffering from cancer , he anticipated a time when more chemotherapy or procedures could only prolong a deepening misery , to the point where he could no longer recognize himself .
He prepared for that time , hoarding his pain meds , taking care to protect his doctor and pharmacist from any possibility of legal retribution .
He saw some friends he wanted to see , and spoke to others .
Then he died at a time and place of his choosing , with his family around him .
Some would call this euthanasia , others a sacrilege .
To me , it seemed like a noble end to a fine life .
If freedom of choice is what makes us human , then my friend managed to make his death a final expression of his humanity .
My friend chose to forgo medical treatments that would have added many thousands of dollars to his health care costs — and , since he was on Medicare , to the public expense .
If George really did spend his final months in the Alps , instead of undergoing expensive surgeries or sitting around hooked up to machines , he surely saved the health care system a bundle as well .
They did it because it was what they wanted , not because it would save money .
But there is a growing body of evidence that the former can lead to the latter — without any rationing or coercion .
One model that gets cited a lot these days is La Crosse , Wisconsin , where Gundersen Lutheran hospital launched an initiative to ensure that the town ’s older residents had advance directives and to make hospice and palliative care widely available .
A 2008 study found that 90 percent of those who died in La Crosse under a physician ’s care did so with advance directives in place .
At Gundersen Lutheran , less is spent on patients in their last two years of life than nearly any other place in the US , with per capita Medicare costs 30 percent below the national average .
In a similar vein , Oregon in 1995 instituted a two - page form called Physician Orders for Life - Sustaining Treatment ; it functions as doctor ’s orders and is less likely to be misinterpreted or disregarded than a living will .
According to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care , a 20 - year study of the nation ’s medical costs and resources , people in Oregon are less likely to die in a hospital than people in most other states , and in their last six months , they spend less time in the hospital .
They also run up about 50 percent less in medical expenditures .
It ’s possible that attitudes have begun to change .
Three states now allow what advocates like to call “ aid - in - dying ” ( rather than assisted suicide ) for the terminally ill .
More Americans than ever have living wills and other advance directives , and that can only be a good thing :
One recent study showed that more than 70 percent of patients who needed to make end - of - life decisions at some point lost the capacity to make these choices , yet among those who had prepared living wills , nearly all had their instructions carried out .
Here is the ultimate irony of the death - panel meme :
In attacking measures designed to promote advance directives , conservatives were attacking what they claim is their core value — the individual right to free choice .
The QALY of Mercy
A wonkier version of the reform - equals - rationing argument is based less on panic mongering about Obama ’s secret euthanasia schemes and more on the implications of something called “ comparative effectiveness research . ”
The practice got a jump start in last year ’s stimulus bill , which included $ 1.1 billion for the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research .
This is money to study what treatments work best for which patients .
The most obvious use of such data would be to apply the findings to Medicare , and the effort has already been attacked as the first step toward the government deciding when it ’s time to kick granny to the curb .
Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) has said that Obama ’s support for comparative effectiveness research means he is seeking “ a national rationing board . ”
Evidence - based medicine , in itself , has absolutely nothing to do with age .
In theory , it also has nothing to do with money — though it might , as a byproduct , reduce costs ( for example , by giving doctors the information they need to resist pressure from drug companies ) .
Yet the desire for cost savings often seems to drive comparative effectiveness research , rather than the other way around .
In his Times Magazine interview last year , Obama said , “ It is an attempt to say to patients , you know what , we ’ve looked at some objective studies concluding that the blue pill , which costs half as much as the red pill , is just as effective , and you might want to go ahead and get the blue one . ”
One prominent advocate of rationing has suggested that society does n’t have a duty to help those in their 70s and 80s “ become still older indefinitely . ”
Personally , I do n’t mind the idea of the government promoting the blue pill over the red pill , as long as it really is “ just as effective . ”
I certainly trust the government to make these distinctions more than I trust the insurance companies or pharma reps .
But I want to know that the only target is genuine waste , and the only possible casualty is profits .
There ’s nothing to give me pause in the health care law ’s comparative effectiveness provision , which includes $ 500 million a year for comparative effectiveness research .
The work is to be overseen by the nonprofit Patient - Centered Outcomes Research Institute , whose 21 - member board of governors will include doctors , patient advocates , and only three representatives of drug and medical - device companies .
Still , there ’s a difference between comparative effectiveness and comparative cost effectiveness — and from the latter , it ’s a short skip to outright cost - benefit analysis .
In other words , the argument sometimes slides almost imperceptibly from comparing how well the blue pill and the red pill work to examining whether some people should be denied the red pill , even if it demonstrably works better .
The calculations driving such cost - benefit analyses are often based on something called QALYs — quality - adjusted life years .
If a certain cancer drug would extend life by two years , say , but with such onerous side effects that those years were judged to be only half as worth living as those of a healthy person , the QALY is 1 .
In Britain , the National Health Service has come close to setting a maximum price beyond which extra QALYs are not deemed worthwhile .
In assessing drugs and treatments , the NHS ’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence usually approves those that cost less than 20,000 pounds per QALY ( about $ 28,500 ) , and most frequently rejects those costing more than 30,000 pounds ( about $ 43,000 ) .
It ’s not hard to find examples of comparative effectiveness research — complete with QALYs — that hit quite close to home for almost anyone .
Last year I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation , a disturbance in the heart rhythm that sometimes leads to blood clots , which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke .
My doctor put me on warfarin ( brand name Coumadin ) , a blood - thinning drug that reduces the chances of forming blood clots but can also cause internal bleeding .
It ’s risky enough that when I go to the dentist or cut myself shaving , I have to watch to make sure it does n’t turn into a torrent of blood .
The levels of warfarin in my bloodstream have to be frequently checked , so I have to be ever mindful of the whereabouts of a hospital with a blood lab .
It is a pain in the neck , and it makes me feel vulnerable .
I sometimes wonder if it ’s worth it .
It turns out that several comparative effectiveness studies have looked at the efficacy of warfarin for patients with my heart condition .
One of them simply weighed the drug ’s potential benefits against its dangerous side effects , without consideration of cost .
It concluded that for a patient with my risk factors , warfarin reduced the chance of stroke a lot more than it increased the chance that I ’d be seriously harmed by bleeding .
Another study concluded that for a patient like me , the cost per QALY of taking warfarin is $ 8,000 — cheap , by most standards .
Prescription drug prices have more than doubled since the study was done in 1995 .
But warfarin is a relatively cheap generic drug , and even if my cost per QALY was $ 15,000 or $ 20,000 , I ’d still pass muster with the NHS .
But if I were younger and had fewer risk factors , I ’d be less prone to stroke to begin with , so the reduction in risk would not be as large , and the cost per QALY would be correspondingly higher — about $ 370,000 .
Would I still want to take the drug if I were , say , under 60 and free of risk factors ?
Considering the side effects , probably not .
But would I want someone else to make that decision for me ?
Critics of the British system say , among other things , that the NHS ’s cost - per - QALY limit is far too low .
But raising it would n’t resolve the deeper ethical question :
Should anyone but the patient get to decide when life is not worth living ?
The Los Angeles Times ‘ Michael Hiltzik , one of the few reporters to critically examine this issue , has noted that “ healthy people tend to overestimate the effect of some medical conditions on their sufferers ’ quality of life .
The hale and hearty , for example , will generally rate life in a wheelchair lower than will the wheelchair - bound , who often find fulfillment in ways ‘ healthier ’ persons could n’t imagine . ”
Simone de Beauvoir wrote that fear of aging and death drives young people to view their elders as a separate species , rather than as their future selves : “ Until the moment it is upon us old age is something that only affects other people . ”
And the more I think about the subject , the more I am sure of one thing :
It ’s not a good idea to have a 30 - year - old place a value on my life .
Whose Death Is It Anyway ?
Probably the most prominent advocate of age - based rationing is Daniel Callahan , cofounder of a bioethics think tank called the Hastings Center .
Callahan ’s 1987 book , Setting Limits : Medical Goals in an Aging Society , depicted old people as “ a new social threat , ” a demographic , economic , and medical “ avalanche ” waiting to happen .
In a 2008 article , Callahan said that in evaluating Medicare ’s expenditures , we should consider that “ there is a duty to help young people to become old people , but not to help the old become still older indefinitely …
One may well ask what counts as ‘ old ’ and what is a decently long lifespan ?
As I have listened to people speak of a ‘ full life , ’ often heard at funerals , I would say that by 75 - 80 most people have lived a full life , and most of us do not feel it a tragedy that someone in that age group has died ( as we do with the death of a child ) . ”
He has proposed using “ age as a specific criterion for the allocation and limitation of care , ” and argues that after a certain point , people could justifiably be denied Medicare coverage for life - extending treatments .
You can see why talk like this might make some old folks start boarding up their doors .
( It apparently , however , does not concern Callahan , who last year at age 79 told the New York Times that he had just had a life - saving seven - hour heart procedure . )
It certainly made me wonder how I would measure up .
I ’d be willing to give up some expensive , life - prolonging medical treatment for my Gen X son .
But not for some WellPoint executive ’s vacation .
So far , I have n’t cost the system all that much .
I take several different meds every day , which are mostly generics .
I go to the doctor pretty often , but I have n’t been in the hospital overnight for at least 20 years , and my one walk - in operation took place before I was on Medicare .
And I am still working , so I ’m paying in as well as taking out .
But things could change , perhaps precipitously .
Since I have problems with both eyesight and balance , I could easily fall and break a bone , maybe a hip .
This could mean a hip replacement , months of therapy , or even long - term immobility .
My glaucoma could take a turn for the worse , and I would face a future of near blindness , with all the associated costs .
Or I could have that stroke , in spite of my drug regimen .
I decided to take the issue up with the Australian philosopher Peter Singer , who made some waves on this issue with a New York Times Magazine piece published last year , titled “ Why We Must Ration Health Care . ”
Singer believes that health care is a scarce resource that will inevitably be limited .
Better to do it through a public system like the British NHS , he told me , than covertly and inequitably on the private US model .
“ What you are trying to do is to get the most value for the money from the resources you have , ” he told me .
In the world he imagines , I asked Singer over coffee in a Manhattan café , what should happen if I broke a hip ?
He paused to think , and I hoped he would n’t worry about hurting my feelings .
“ If there is a good chance of restoring mobility , ” he said after a moment , “ and you have at least five years of mobility , that ’s significant benefit . ”
He added , “ Hip operations are not expensive . ”
A new hip or knee runs between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 , most of it covered by Medicare .
So for five years of mobility , that comes out to about $ 7,000 a year — less than the cost of a home - care aide , and exponentially less than a nursing home .
But then Singer turned to a more sobering thought :
If the hip operation did not lead to recovery of mobility , then it might not be such a bargain .
In a much - cited piece of personal revelation , Obama in 2009 talked about his grandmother ’s decision to have a hip replacement after she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer .
She died just a few weeks later .
“ I do n’t know how much that hip replacement cost , ” Obama told the Times Magazine .
“ I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she ’s my grandmother . ”
But the president said that in considering whether “ to give my grandmother , or everybody else ’s aging grandparents or parents , a hip replacement when they ’re terminally ill … you just get into some very difficult moral issues . ”
Singer and I talked about what choices we ourselves might make at the end of our lives .
Singer , who is 63 , said that he and his wife “ know neither of us wants to go on living under certain conditions .
Particularly if we get demented .
I would draw the line if I could not recognize my wife or my children .
My wife has a higher standard — when she could n’t read a novel .
Yes , I would n’t want to live beyond a certain point .
It ’s not me anymore . ”
I ’m 10 years older than Singer , and my own advance directives reflect similar choices .
So it seems like neither one of us is likely to strain the public purse with our demands for expensive and futile life - prolonging care .
You can say this is all a Debbie Downer , but people my age know perfectly well that these questions are not at all theoretical .
We worry about the time when we will no longer be able to contribute anything useful to society and will be completely dependent on others .
And we worry about the day when life will no longer seem worth living , and whether we will have the courage — and the ability — to choose a dignified death .
We worry about these things all by ourselves — we do n’t need anyone else to do it for us .
And we certainly do n’t need anyone tallying up QALYs while our overpriced , underperforming private health care system adds a few more points to its profit margin .
Let It Bleed
What happened during the recent health care wars is what military strategists might call a “ bait - and - bleed ” operation :
Two rival parties are drawn into a protracted conflict that depletes both their forces , while a third stands on the sidelines , its strength undiminished .
In this case , Republicans and Democrats alike have shed plenty of blood , while the clever combatant on the sidelines is , of course , the health care industry .
In the process , health care reform set some unsettling precedents that could fuel the phony intergenerational conflict over health care resources .
The final reform bill will help provide coverage to some of the estimated 46 million Americans under 65 who live without it .
It finances these efforts in part by cutting Medicare costs — some $ 500 billion over 10 years .
Contrary to Republican hysteria , the cuts so far come from all the right places — primarily from ending the rip - offs by insurers who sell government - financed “ Medicare Advantage ” plans .
The reform law even manages to make some meaningful improvements to the flawed Medicare prescription drug program and preventive care .
The legislation also explicitly bans age - based health care rationing .
My advice to rationing advocates : Start treating health care as a human right , and see how much money you save .
Still , there are plenty of signs that the issue is far from being put to rest .
Congress and the White House wrote into the law something called the Independent Payment Advisory Board , a presidentially appointed panel that is tasked with keeping Medicare ’s growth rate below a certain ceiling .
Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag , the economics wunderkind who has made Medicare ’s finances something of a personal project , has called it potentially the most important aspect of the legislation : Medicare and Medicaid , he has said , “ are at the heart of our long - term fiscal imbalance , which is the motivation for moving to a different structure in those programs . ”
And then , of course , there ’s Obama ’s deficit commission :
While the president says he is keeping an open mind when it comes to solving the deficit “ crisis , ” no one is trying very hard to pretend that the commission has any purpose other than cutting Social Security , Medicare , and probably Medicaid as well .
Already , the commission is working closely with the Peter G. Peterson Foundation , headed by the billionaire businessman and former Nixon administration official who has emerged as one of the nation ’s leading “ granny bashers ” — deficit hawks who accuse old people of bankrupting the country .
In the end , of course , many conservatives are motivated less by deficits and more by free - market ideology :
Many of them want to replace Medicare as it now exists today with a system of vouchers , and place the emphasis on individual savings and tax breaks .
Barring that , Republicans have proposed a long string of cuts to Medicaid and Medicare , sometimes defying logic — by , for example , advocating reductions in in - home care , which can keep people out of far more expensive nursing homes .
The common means of justifying these cuts is to attack Medicare “ waste . ”
But remember that not only are Medicare ’s administrative costs less than one - sixth of those of private insurers , Medicare pays doctors and hospitals less ( 20 and 30 percent , respectively ) than private payment rates ; overall , Medicare pays out less in annual per capita benefits than the average large employer health plan , even though it serves an older , sicker population .
That basic fact is fully understood by the health care industry .
Back in January 2009 , as the nation suited up for the health care wars , the Lewin Group — a subsidiary of the health insurance giant United Health — produced an analysis of various reform proposals being floated and found that the only one to immediately reduce overall health care costs ( by $ 58 billion ) was one that would have dramatically expanded Medicare .
Facts like these , however , have not slowed down the granny bashers .
In a February op - ed called “ The Geezers ’ Crusade , ” commentator David Brooks urged old people to willingly submit to entitlement cuts in service to future generations .
Via Social Security and Medicare , he argued , old folks are stealing from their own grandkids .
I ’m as public spirited as the next person , and I have a Gen X son .
I ’d be willing to give up some expensive , life - prolonging medical treatment for him , and maybe even for the good of humanity .
But I ’m certainly not going to do it so some WellPoint executive can take another vacation , so Pfizer can book $ 3 billion in annual profits instead of $ 2 billion , or so private hospitals can make another campaign contribution to some gutless politician .
Here , then , is my advice to anyone who suggests that we geezers should do the right thing and pull the plug on ourselves :
Start treating health care as a human right instead of a profit - making opportunity , and see how much money you save .
Then , by all means , get back to me .

There was a day a few weeks ago when I found my 2 ½ - year - old son sitting on our building doorstep , waiting for me to come home .
He spotted me as I was rounding the corner , and the scene that followed was one of inexpressible loveliness , right out of the movie I ’d played to myself before actually having a child , with him popping out of his babysitter ’s arms and barreling down the street to greet me .
This happy moment , though , was about to be cut short , and in retrospect felt more like a tranquil lull in a slasher film .
When I opened our apartment door , I discovered that my son had broken part of the wooden parking garage I ’d spent about an hour assembling that morning .
This would n’t have been a problem per se , except that as I attempted to fix it , he grew impatient and began throwing its various parts at the walls , with one plank very narrowly missing my eye .
I recited the rules of the house ( no throwing , no hitting ) .
He picked up another large wooden plank .
I ducked .
He reached for the screwdriver .
The scene ended with a time - out in his crib .
As I shuffled back to the living room , I thought of something a friend once said about the Children ’s Museum of Manhattan — “ a nice place , but what it really needs is a bar ” — and rued how , at that moment , the same thing could be said of my apartment .
Two hundred and 40 seconds earlier , I ’d been in a state of pair - bonded bliss ; now I was guided by nerves , trawling the cabinets for alcohol .
My emotional life looks a lot like this these days .
I suspect it does for many parents — a high - amplitude , high - frequency sine curve along which we get the privilege of doing hourly surfs .
Yet it ’s something most of us choose .
Indeed , it ’s something most of us would say we ’d be miserable without .
From the perspective of the species , it ’s perfectly unmysterious why people have children .
From the perspective of the individual , however , it ’s more of a mystery than one might think .
Most people assume that having children will make them happier .
Yet a wide variety of academic research shows that parents are not happier than their childless peers , and in many cases are less so .
This finding is surprisingly consistent , showing up across a range of disciplines .
Perhaps the most oft - cited datum comes from a 2004 study by Daniel Kahneman , a Nobel Prize–winning behavioral economist , who surveyed 909 working Texas women and found that child care ranked sixteenth in pleasurability out of nineteen activities .
( Among the endeavors they preferred : preparing food , watching TV , exercising , talking on the phone , napping , shopping , housework . )
This result also shows up regularly in relationship research , with children invariably reducing marital satisfaction .
The economist Andrew Oswald , who ’s compared tens of thousands of Britons with children to those without , is at least inclined to view his data in a more positive light :
“ The broad message is not that children make you less happy ; it ’s just that children do n’t make you more happy . ”
That is , he tells me , unless you have more than one .
“ Then the studies show a more negative impact . ”
As a rule , most studies show that mothers are less happy than fathers , that single parents are less happy still , that babies and toddlers are the hardest , and that each successive child produces diminishing returns .
But some of the studies are grimmer than others .
Robin Simon , a sociologist at Wake Forest University , says parents are more depressed than nonparents no matter what their circumstances — whether they ’re single or married , whether they have one child or four .
The idea that parents are less happy than nonparents has become so commonplace in academia that it was big news last year when the Journal of Happiness Studies published a Scottish paper declaring the opposite was true .
“ Contrary to much of the literature , ” said the introduction , “ our results are consistent with an effect of children on life satisfaction that is positive , large and increasing in the number of children . ”
Alas , the euphoria was short - lived .
A few months later , the poor author discovered a coding error in his data , and the publication ran an erratum .
“ After correcting the problem , ” it read , “ the main results of the paper no longer hold .
The effect of children on the life satisfaction of married individuals is small , often negative , and never statistically significant . ”
Yet one can see why people were rooting for that paper .
The results of almost all the others violate a parent ’s deepest intuition .
Daniel Gilbert , the Harvard psychologist and host of This Emotional Life on PBS , wrote fewer than three pages about compromised parental well - being in Stumbling on Happiness .
But whenever he goes on the lecture circuit , skeptical questions about those pages come up more frequently than anything else .
“ I ’ve never met anyone who did n’t argue with me about this , ” he says .
“ Even people who believe the data say they feel sorry for those for whom it ’s true . ”

So what , precisely , is going on here ?
Why is this finding duplicated over and over again despite the fact that most parents believe it to be wrong ?
One answer could simply be that parents are deluded , in the grip of some false consciousness that ’s good for mankind but not for men and women in particular .
Gilbert , a proud father and grandfather , would argue as much .
He ’s made a name for himself showing that we humans are pretty sorry predictors of what will make us happy , and to his mind , the yearning for children , the literal mother of all aspirations for so many , is a very good case in point — what children really do , he suspects , is offer moments of transcendence , not an overall improvement in well - being .
Perhaps .
But there are less fatalistic explanations , too .
And high among them is the possibility that parents do n’t much enjoy parenting because the experience of raising children has fundamentally changed .
“ I ’m going to count to three . ”
It ’s a weekday evening , and the mother in this videotape , a trim brunette with her hair in a bun and glasses propped up on her head , has already worked a full day and made dinner .
Now she is approaching her 8 - year - old son , the oldest of two , who ’s seated at the computer in the den , absorbed in a movie .
At issue is his homework , which he still has n’t done .
“ One. Two … ”
This clip is from a study conducted by UCLA ’s Center on Everyday Lives of Families , which earned a front - page story in the Sunday Times this May and generated plenty of discussion among parents .
In it , researchers collected 1,540 hours of footage of 32 middle - class , dual - earner families with at least two children , all of them going about their regular business in their Los Angeles homes .
The intention of this study was in no way to make the case that parents were unhappy .
But one of the postdoctoral fellows who worked on it , himself a father of two , nevertheless described the video data to the Times as “ the very purest form of birth control ever devised .
Ever . ”
“ I have to get it to the part and then pause it , ” says the boy .
“ No , ” says his mother .
“ You do that after you do your homework . ”
Tamar Kremer - Sadlik , the director of research in this study , has watched this scene many times .
The reason she believes it ’s so powerful is because it shows how painfully parents experience the pressure of making their children do their schoolwork .
They seem to feel this pressure even more acutely than their children feel it themselves .
The boy starts to shout .
“ It ’s not going to take that long ! ”
His mother stops the movie .
“ I ’m telling you no , ” she says .
“ You ’re not hearing me .
I will not let you watch this now . ”
He starts up the movie again .
“ No , ” she repeats , her voice rising .
She places her hand firmly under her son ’s arm and starts to yank .
“ I will not have this — ”
Before urbanization , children were viewed as economic assets to their parents .
If you had a farm , they toiled alongside you to maintain its upkeep ; if you had a family business , the kids helped mind the store .
But all of this dramatically changed with the moral and technological revolutions of modernity .
As we gained in prosperity , childhood came increasingly to be viewed as a protected , privileged time , and once college degrees became essential to getting ahead , children became not only a great expense but subjects to be sculpted , stimulated , instructed , groomed .
( The Princeton sociologist Viviana Zelizer describes this transformation of a child ’s value in five ruthless words : “ Economically worthless but emotionally priceless . ” )
Kids , in short , went from being our staffs to being our bosses .
“ Did you see Babies ? ” asks Lois Nachamie , a couples counselor who for years has run parenting workshops and support groups on the Upper West Side .
She ’s referring to the recent documentary that compares the lives of four newborns — one in Japan , one in Namibia , one in Mongolia , and one in the United States ( San Francisco ) .
“ I do n’t mean to idealize the lives of the Namibian women , ” she says .
“ But it was hard not to notice how calm they were .
They were beading their children ’s ankles and decorating them with sienna , clearly enjoying just sitting and playing with them , and we ’re here often thinking of all of this stuff as labor . ”
This is especially true in middle - and upper - income families , which are far more apt than their working - class counterparts to see their children as projects to be perfected .
( Children of women with bachelor degrees spend almost five hours on “ organized activities ” per week , as opposed to children of high - school dropouts , who spend two . )
Annette Lareau , the sociologist who coined the term “ concerted cultivation ” to describe the aggressive nurturing of economically advantaged children , puts it this way : “ Middle - class parents spend much more time talking to children , answering questions with questions , and treating each child ’s thought as a special contribution .
And this is very tiring work . ”
Yet it ’s work few parents feel that they can in good conscience neglect , says Lareau , “ lest they put their children at risk by not giving them every advantage . ”

But the intensification of family time is not confined to the privileged classes alone .
According to Changing Rhythms of American Family Life — a compendium of data porn about time use and family statistics , compiled by a trio of sociologists named Suzanne M. Bianchi , John P. Robinson , and Melissa A. Milkie — all parents spend more time today with their children than they did in 1975 , including mothers , in spite of the great rush of women into the American workforce .
Today ’s married mothers also have less leisure time ( 5.4 fewer hours per week ) ; 71 percent say they crave more time for themselves ( as do 57 percent of married fathers ) .
Yet 85 percent of all parents still — still !— think they do n’t spend enough time with their children .
These self - contradictory statistics reminded me of a conversation I had with a woman who had been in one of Nachamie ’s parenting groups , a professional who had her children later in life .
“ I have two really great kids ” — ages 9 and 11 — “ and I enjoy doing a lot of things with them , ” she told me .
“ It ’s the drudgery that ’s so hard : Crap , you do n’t have any pants that fit ?
There are just So. Many .
Chores . ”
This woman , it should be said , is divorced .
But even if her responsibilities were shared with a partner , the churn of school and gymnastics and piano and sports and homework would still require an awful lot of administration .
“ The crazy thing , ” she continues , “ is that by New York standards , I ’m not even overscheduling them . ”
Mothers are less happy than fathers , single parents are less happy still .
I ask what she does on the weekends her ex-husband has custody .
“ I work , ” she replies .
“ And get my nails done . ”
A few generations ago , people were n’t stopping to contemplate whether having a child would make them happy .
Having children was simply what you did .
And we are lucky , today , to have choices about these matters .
But the abundance of choices — whether to have kids , when , how many — may be one of the reasons parents are less happy .
That was at least partly the conclusion of psychologists W. Keith Campbell and Jean Twenge , who , in 2003 , did a meta - analysis of 97 children - and - marital - satisfaction studies stretching back to the seventies .
Not only did they find that couples ’ overall marital satisfaction went down if they had kids ; they found that every successive generation was more put out by having them than the last — our current one most of all .
Even more surprisingly , they found that parents ’ dissatisfaction only grew the more money they had , even though they had the purchasing power to buy more child care .
“ And my hypothesis about why this is , in both cases , is the same , ” says Twenge .
“ They become parents later in life .
There ’s a loss of freedom , a loss of autonomy .
It ’s totally different from going from your parents ’ house to immediately having a baby .
Now you know what you ’re giving up . ”
( Or , as a fellow psychologist told Gilbert when he finally got around to having a child : “ They ’re a huge source of joy , but they turn every other source of joy to shit . ” )
It would n’t be a particularly bold inference to say that the longer we put off having kids , the greater our expectations .
“ There ’s all this buildup — as soon as I get this done , I ’m going to have a baby , and it ’s going to be a great reward ! ” says Ada Calhoun , the author of Instinctive Parenting and founding editor - in - chief of Babble , the online parenting site .
“ And then you ’re like , ‘ Wait , this is my reward ?
This nineteen - year grind ? ’ ”
When people wait to have children , they ’re also bringing different sensibilities to the enterprise .
They ’ve spent their adult lives as professionals , believing there ’s a right way and a wrong way of doing things ; now they ’re applying the same logic to the family - expansion business , and they ’re surrounded by a marketplace that only affirms and reinforces this idea .
“ And what ’s confusing about that , ” says Alex Barzvi , a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU medical school , “ is that there are a lot of things that parents can do to nurture social and cognitive development .
There are right and wrong ways to discipline a child .
But you ca n’t fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others and constantly concluding you ’re doing the wrong thing . ”
Yet that ’s precisely what modern parents do .
“ It was especially bad in the beginning , ” said a woman who recently attended a parents ’ group led by Barzvi at the 92nd Street Y .
“ When I ’d hear other moms saying , ‘ Oh , so - and - so sleeps for twelve hours and naps for three , ’ I ’d think , Oh , shit , I screwed up the sleep training . ”
Her parents — immigrants from huge families — could n’t exactly relate to her distress .
“ They had no academic reference books for sleeping , ” she says .
( She ’s read three . )
“ To my parents , it is what it is . ”
So how do they explain your anguish ?
I ask .
“ They just think that Americans are a little too complicated about everything . ”
One hates to invoke Scandinavia in stories about child - rearing , but it ca n’t be an accident that the one superbly designed study that said , unambiguously , that having kids makes you happier was done with Danish subjects .
The researcher , Hans - Peter Kohler , a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania , says he originally studied this question because he was intrigued by the declining fertility rates in Europe .
One of the things he noticed is that countries with stronger welfare systems produce more children — and happier parents .
Of course , this should not be a surprise .
If you are no longer fretting about spending too little time with your children after they ’re born ( because you have a year of paid maternity leave ) , if you ’re no longer anxious about finding affordable child care once you go back to work ( because the state subsidizes it ) , if you ’re no longer wondering how to pay for your children ’s education and health care ( because they ’re free ) — well , it stands to reason that your own mental health would improve .
When Kahneman and his colleagues did another version of his survey of working women , this time comparing those in Columbus , Ohio , to those in Rennes , France , the French sample enjoyed child care a good deal more than its American counterpart .
“ We ’ve put all this energy into being perfect parents , ” says Judith Warner , author of Perfect Madness : Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety , “ instead of political change that would make family life better . ”
MOMS : Ever feel alone in how you perceive this role ?
I swear I feel like I ’m surrounded by women who were once smart & interesting but have become zombies who only talk about soccer and coupons .
This was an opening gambit on UrbanBaby this past April .
It could have devolved into a sanctimommy pile - on .
It did n’t .
I totally feel this way .
I am a f/t wohm — Work Outside the Home Mom — have a career , and I do n’t feel smart or interesting anymore !
I do n’t talk about soccer or coupons , but just feel too tired to talk about anything that interesting .
I freely admit that I have gained “ more ” than I have lost by becoming a parent , but I still miss aspects of my old life .
More generous government policies , a sounder economy , a less pressured culture that values good rather than perfect kids — all of these would certainly make parents happier .
But even under the most favorable circumstances , parenting is an extraordinary activity , in both senses of the word extra : beyond ordinary and especially ordinary .
While children deepen your emotional life , they shrink your outer world to the size of a teacup , at least for a while .
( “ All joy and no fun , ” as an old friend with two young kids likes to say . )
Lori Leibovich , the executive editor of Babble and the anthology Maybe Baby , a collection of 28 essays by writers debating whether to have children , says she was particularly struck by the female contributors who ’d made the deliberate choice to remain childless .
It enabled them to travel or live abroad for their work ; to take physical risks ; to , in the case of a novelist , inhabit her fictional characters without being pulled away by the demands of a real one .
“ There was a richness and texture to their work lives that was so , so enviable , ” she says .
( Leibovich has two children . )
Fathers , it turns out , feel like they ’ve made some serious compromises too , though of a different sort .
They feel like they do n’t see their kids enough .
“ In our studies , it ’s the men , by a long shot , who have more work - life conflict than women , ” says Ellen Galinsky , president of the Families and Work Institute .
“ They do n’t want to be stick figures in their children ’s lives . ”
And couples probably pay the dearest price of all .
Healthy relationships definitely make people happier .
But children adversely affect relationships .
As Thomas Bradbury , a father of two and professor of psychology at UCLA , likes to say : “ Being in a good relationship is a risk factor for becoming a parent . ”
He directs me to one of the more inspired studies in the field , by psychologists Lauren Papp and E. Mark Cummings .
They asked 100 long - married couples to spend two weeks meticulously documenting their disagreements .
Nearly 40 percent of them were about their kids .
“ And that 40 percent is merely the number that was explicitly about kids , I ’m guessing , right ? ”
This is a former patient of Nachamie ’s , an entrepreneur and father of two .
“ How many other arguments were those couples having because everyone was on a short fuse , or tired , or stressed out ? ”
This man is very frank about the strain his children put on his marriage , especially his firstborn .
“ I already felt neglected , ” he says .
“ In my mind , anyway .
And once we had the kid , it became so pronounced ; it went from zero to negative 50 .
And I was like , I can deal with zero .
But not negative 50 . ”
This is the brutal reality about children — they ’re such powerful stressors that small perforations in relationships can turn into deep fault lines .
“ And my wife became more demanding , ” he continues .
“ ‘ You do n’t do this , you do n’t do that . ’
There was this idea we had about how things were supposed to be :
The family should be dot dot dot , the man should be dot dot dot the woman should be dot dot dot . ”
This is another brutal reality about children :
They expose the gulf between our fantasies about family and its spikier realities .
They also mean parting with an old way of life , one with more freewheeling rhythms and richer opportunities for romance .
“ There ’s nothing sexy or intimate between us , based on the old model , ” he says .
“ The new model , which I ’ve certainly come to adopt , is that our energy has shifted toward the kids .
One of the reasons I love being with my wife is because I love the family we have . ”
Studies have found that parents ’ dissatisfaction only grew the more money they had , even though they could buy more child care .
Most studies show that marriages improve once children enter latency , or the ages between 6 and 12 , though they take another sharp dive during the war zone of adolescence .
( As a friend with grown children once told me : “ Teenagers can be casually brutal . ” )
But one of the most sobering declines documented in Changing Rhythms of American Family Life is the amount of time married parents spend alone together each week :
Nine hours today versus twelve in 1975 .
Bradbury , who was involved in the UCLA study of those 32 families , says the husbands and wives spent less than 10 percent of their home time alone together .
“ And do you think they were saying , ‘ Gee honey , you look lovely .
I just wanted to pick up on that fascinating conversation we were having earlier about the Obama administration ’ ? ” he asks .
“ Nope .
They were exhausted and staring at the television . ”
“ I ’m not watching it , ” insists the boy .
We ’re back to the videotape now , and that den in Los Angeles .
Mother and son are still arguing — tensely , angrily — and she ’s still pulling on his arm .
The boy reaches for the keyboard .
“ I ’m putting it on pause ! ”
“ I want you to do your homework , ” his mother repeats .
“ You are not — ”
“ I know , ” the son whines .
“ I ’m going to pause it ! ”
His mother ’s not buying it .
What she sees is him stalling .
She pulls him off the chair .
“ No , you ’re not , ” says his mother .
“ You ’re still not listening ! ”
“ Yes I am ! ”
“ No , you ’re not ! ”
Children may provide unrivaled moments of joy .
But they also provide unrivaled moments of frustration , tedium , anxiety , heartbreak .
This scene , which is n’t even all that awful or uncommon , makes it perfectly clear why parenting may be regarded as less fun than having dinner with friends or baking a cake .
Loving one ’s children and loving the act of parenting are not the same thing .
Yet that ’s where things get tricky .
Obviously , this clip shows how difficult and unpleasant parenting can be .
What it does n’t show is the love this mother feels for her son , which we can pretty much bet has no equal .
Nor does it convey that this unpleasant task she ’s undertaking is part of a larger project , one that pays off in subtler dividends than simply having fun .
Kremer - Sadlik says that she and her fellow researchers were highly conscious of these missing pieces when they gathered each week to discuss their data collection .
“ We ’d all remember the negative things , ” she says .
“ Whereas everything else was between the lines .
So it became our moral dilemma :
How can we talk about the good moments ? ”
She pauses , and then asks the question that , to a parent ( she herself has two children ) , is probably most relevant of all : “ And why were the good moments so elusive ? ”
The answer to that may hinge on how we define “ good . ”
Or more to the point , “ happy . ”
Is happiness something you experience ?
Or is it something you think ?
When Kahneman surveyed those Texas women , he was measuring moment - to - moment happiness .
It was a feeling , a mood , a state .
The technique he pioneered for measuring it — the Daily Reconstruction Method — was designed to make people reexperience their feelings over the course of a day .
Oswald , when looking at British households , was looking at a condensed version of the General Health Questionnaire , which is best described as a basic gauge of mood :
Have you recently felt you could not overcome your difficulties ?
Felt constantly under strain ?
Lost much sleep over worry ?
( What parent has n’t answered , yes , yes , and God yes to these questions ? )
As a matter of mood , there does seem to be little question that kids make our lives more stressful .
But when studies take into consideration how rewarding parenting is , the outcomes tend to be different .
Last year , Mathew P. White and Paul Dolan , professors at the University of Plymouth and Imperial College , London , respectively , designed a study that tried to untangle these two different ideas .
They asked participants to rate their daily activities both in terms of pleasure and in terms of reward , then plotted the results on a four - quadrant graph .
What emerged was a much more commonsense map of our feelings .
In the quadrant of things people found both pleasurable and rewarding , people chose volunteering first , prayer second , and time with children third ( though time with children barely made it into the “ pleasurable ” category ) .
Work was the most rewarding not - so - pleasurable activity .
Everyone thought commuting was both unrewarding and unfun .
And watching television was considered one of the most pleasurable unrewarding activities , as was eating , though the least rewarding of all was plain old “ relaxing . ”
( Which probably says something about the abiding power of the Protestant work ethic . )
Seven years ago , the sociologists Kei Nomaguchi and Melissa A. Milkie did a study in which they followed couples for five to seven years , some of whom had children and some of whom did not .
And what they found was that , yes , those couples who became parents did more housework and felt less in control and quarreled more ( actually , only the women thought they quarreled more , but anyway ) .
On the other hand , the married women were less depressed after they ’d had kids than their childless peers .
And perhaps this is because the study sought to understand not just the moment - to - moment moods of its participants , but more existential matters , like how connected they felt , and how motivated , and how much despair they were in ( as opposed to how much stress they were under ) :
Do you not feel like eating ?
Do you feel like you ca n’t shake the blues ?
Do you feel lonely ?
Like you ca n’t get going ?
Parents , who live in a clamorous , perpetual - forward - motion machine almost all of the time , seemed to have different answers than their childless cohorts .
The authors also found that the most depressed people were single fathers , and Milkie speculates that perhaps it ’s because they wanted to be involved in their children ’s lives but were n’t .
Robin Simon finds something similar :
The least depressed parents are those whose underage children are in the house , and the most are those whose are n’t .
This finding seems significant .
Technically , if parenting makes you unhappy , you should feel better if you ’re spared the task of doing it .
But if happiness is measured by our own sense of agency and meaning , then noncustodial parents lose .
They ’re robbed of something that gives purpose and reward .
When I mention this to Daniel Gilbert , he hardly disputes that meaning is important .
But he does wonder how prominently it should figure into people ’s decisions to have kids .
“ When you pause to think what children mean to you , of course they make you feel good , ” he says .
“ The problem is , 95 percent of the time , you ’re not thinking about what they mean to you .
You ’re thinking that you have to take them to piano lessons .
So you have to think about which kind of happiness you ’ll be consuming most often .
Do you want to maximize the one you experience almost all the time ” — moment - to - moment happiness — “ or the one you experience rarely ? ”
Which is fair enough .
But for many of us , purpose is happiness — particularly those of us who find moment - to - moment happiness a bit elusive to begin with .
Martin Seligman , the positive - psychology pioneer who is , famously , not a natural optimist , has always taken the view that happiness is best defined in the ancient Greek sense : leading a productive , purposeful life .
And the way we take stock of that life , in the end , is n’t by how much fun we had , but what we did with it .
( Seligman has seven children . )
About twenty years ago , Tom Gilovich , a psychologist at Cornell , made a striking contribution to the field of psychology , showing that people are far more apt to regret things they have n’t done than things they have .
In one instance , he followed up on the men and women from the Terman study , the famous collection of high - IQ students from California who were singled out in 1921 for a life of greatness .
Not one told him of regretting having children , but ten told him they regretted not having a family .
“ I think this boils down to a philosophical question , rather than a psychological one , ” says Gilovich .
“ Should you value moment - to - moment happiness more than retrospective evaluations of your life ? ”
He says he has no answer for this , but the example he offers suggests a bias .
He recalls watching TV with his children at three in the morning when they were sick .
“ I would n’t have said it was too fun at the time , ” he says .
“ But now I look back on it and say , ‘ Ah , remember the time we used to wake up and watch cartoons ? ’ ” The very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification , nostalgia , delight .
It ’s a lovely magic trick of the memory , this gilding of hard times .
Perhaps it ’s just the necessary alchemy we need to keep the species going .
But for parents , this sleight of the mind and spell on the heart is the very definition of enchantment .

The suspects are still on the loosePosted : 07/15/2010 Last Updated : 9 hours and 3 minutes ago * By : Bill Kallus
In this illustration , the hot , blue star HE 0437 - 5439 has been tossed out of the center of our Milky Way galaxy with enough speed to escape the galaxy 's gravitational clutches .
The stellar outcast is rocketing through the Milky Way 's distant outskirts at 1.6 million miles an hour , high above the galaxy 's disk , about 200,000 light - years from the center .
The star is destined to roam intergalactic space .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has detected a hypervelocity star - a rare entity moving three times faster than our sun .
The star may have been created in a cosmic misstep .
A hundred million years ago , a triple - star system was traveling through the bustling center of our Milky Way galaxy when it wandered too close to the galaxy 's giant black hole .
The black hole captured one of the stars and hurled the other two out of the Milky Way .
The two outbound stars merged to form a super - hot blue star traveling at incredible speeds .
This story may seem like science fiction , but Hubble astronomers say it is the most likely scenario for creation of a so - called hypervelocity star , known as HE 0437 -5439 .
It is one of the fastest ever detected with a speed of 1.6 million mph .
Hubble observations confirm that the stellar speedster hails from the Milky Way 's core , settling some confusion about the star 's original home .
Most of the roughly 16 known hypervelocity stars , all discovered since 2005 , are thought to be exiles from the heart of our galaxy .
But this Hubble result is the first direct observation linking such a star to a galactic center origin .
" Using Hubble , we can for the first time trace back to where the star came from by measuring the star 's direction of motion on the sky .
Our measurements point directly to the Milky Way center , " says astronomer Warren Brown of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
Brown , a member of the Hubble team that observed the star , is the lead author on a paper about the finding published online July 20 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Brown said , " These exiled stars are rare in the Milky Way 's population of 100 billion stars .
For every 100 million stars in the galaxy , there lurks one hypervelocity star . "
" Studying these stars could provide more clues about the nature of some of the universe 's unseen mass , and it could help astronomers better understand how galaxies form , " says team leader Oleg Gnedin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
The stellar outcast already is cruising in the Milky Way 's distant outskirts about 200,000 light - years from the galaxy 's center .
Using Hubble to measure the runaway star 's direction and determine the Milky Way 's core as its starting point , Brown and Gnedin 's team calculated how fast the star had to have been ejected to reach its current location .
" The star is traveling at an absurd velocity , twice as much as it needs to escape the galaxy 's gravitational field , " Brown said .
Brown is a hypervelocity star hunter who found the first unbound star in 2005 .
" There is no star that travels that quickly under normal circumstances -- something exotic has to happen . "
The star 's age is another mystery .
Based on the speed and position of HE 0437 - 5439 , the star would have to be 100 million years old to have journeyed from the Milky Way 's core .
Yet its mass -- nine times that of our sun -- and blue color mean that it should have burned out after only 20 million years -- far shorter than the transit time it took to get to its current location .
This illustration shows one possible mechanism for how the star HE 0437 - 5439 acquired enough energy to be ejected from our Milky Way galaxy .
In this scenario , a triple - star system , consisting of a close binary system and another outer member bound to the group , is orbiting near the galaxy 's monster black hole .
One star is captured by the black hole and the tightly bound pair gets ejected from the galaxy .
As the duo speeds through the galaxy , one member evolves more quickly and consumes the other .
The resulting rejuvenated star , massive and very blue , is called a blue straggler .

Astronomers have proposed two possibilities to solve the age problem .
The star either dipped into the Fountain of Youth by becoming a blue straggler , or it was flung out of the Large Magellanic Cloud , a neighboring galaxy .
In 2008 a team of astronomers thought they had solved the mystery .
They found a match between the exiled star 's chemical makeup and the characteristics of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud .
The rogue star 's position also is close to the neighboring galaxy , only 65,000 light - years away .
The new Hubble result , however , settles the debate over the star 's birthplace and places it in the Milky Way .
The most likely explanation for the star 's blue color and extreme speed is that it was part of a triple - star system that was involved in a gravitational billiards game with the galaxy 's monster black hole .
This concept for imparting an escape velocity on stars was first proposed in 1988 .
The theory predicted that the Milky Way 's black hole should eject a star about once every 100,000 years .
The triple - star system contained a pair of closely orbiting stars and a third outer member also gravitationally tied to the group .
The black hole pulled the outer star away from the tight binary system .
The doomed star 's momentum was transferred to the stellar twosome , boosting the duo to escape velocity from the galaxy .
As the pair rocketed away , they went on with normal stellar evolution .
The more massive companion evolved more quickly , puffing up to become a red giant .
It enveloped its partner , and the two stars spiraled together , merging into one superstar - the blue straggler that Hubble observed .
A blue straggler is a relatively young , massive star produced by the merger of two lighter - weight stars .
Astronomers used the sharp vision of Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys to make two separate observations of the wayward star 3.5 years apart .
Team member Jay Anderson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore developed a technique to measure the star 's position relative to each of 11 distant background galaxies .
These background galaxies form a reference frame in which Anderson compared the star 's position in 2006 and 2009 to calculate how far it had moved .
" Hubble excels with this type of measurement , " Anderson said .
" This observation would be challenging to do from the ground . "
The team is trying to determine the homes of four other unbound stars , all located on the fringes of the Milky Way .
" We are targeting massive " B " stars , like HE 0437 - 5439 , " said Brown , who has discovered 14 of the 16 known hypervelocity stars .
" These stars should n't live long enough to live in the distant outskirts of the Milky Way , so we should n't expect to find them there .
But the quantity of stars in the outer region is much less than in the core , so we have a better chance of finding these unusual objects . "

Image caption China 's government already exercises strict controls over the internet
Reports from China say a controversial government - backed software project to filter internet content could be on the brink of collapse .
State media said the developer behind the Green Dam Youth Escort software had closed its Beijing project team because of a lack of government funding .
Its partner in Henan said without funding , its team would soon close too .
China had insisted all computers be equipped with the software , but scaled back plans after censorship complaints .
No funding
The Chinese authorities announced last year that all computers sold in China would have to have the software pre-installed from 1 July 2009 .
Officials said it would filter out pornographic or violent material , but critics complained that it could also be used to stop Chinese internet users searching for politically sensitive information .
Opponents also raised questions about the apparent monopoly enjoyed by the software providers .
The roll - out was delayed amid strong domestic and international opposition , and officials later said that using the software was optional .
In the end , the Green Dam software was only installed in 20 million computers in internet cafes and schools , state media said .
Now , according to the Beijing Times , the project team from developer Beijing Dazheng Human Language Technology Academy has shut down .
The installation and aftercare team from Zhengzhou Jinhui Computer System Engineering , in Henan province , also faced closure , the daily reported .
This was because government funding only covered a one - year period from 2008 to 2009 and there had been no subsequent funding , the daily said , citing Chen Xiaomeng , general manager for the developer .
According to Mr Chen , requests to the government for more funding had generated no response .
There has been no official comment on the issue from the Chinese authorities , who correspondents say may feel they lost face in the row .
Apart from funding , the Green Dam project has faced a number of problems .
In January a US company filed a $ 2.2 bn ( £ 1.4 bn ) lawsuit in the US accusing Beijing of stealing lines of code from its internet filtering software for Green Dam .
It is suing the Chinese government , two Chinese firms and seven PC makers .
Analysts also said that Green Dam had weaknesses in its URL , text and image filtering system and vulnerabilities in the software that made machines susceptible to being hijacked .
The world 's first kiloelectronvolt X - ray laser produces such a high flux of photons that atoms can be ' cored ' .
In other words , the light source can knock out both the electrons of an atom 's innermost shell .
What would you do if someone gave you an X - ray source with a spectral brightness that was 10 billion times greater than anything that had previously existed ?
Most of us might work out that we could shine it on something and see what happens , but it requires considerable skill and insight to design and interpret an experiment that provides fundamental knowledge about how these ultra-intense X - rays interact with matter .
Just such an experiment is reported by Young et al.1 on page 56 of this issue .
The authors show how they can tailor the characteristics of the world 's first X - ray laser of kiloelectronvolt ( keV ) photon energy in a way that enables them to ' peel ' or ' core ' atoms .
The X - ray source in question is the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park , California .
This remarkable machine , which demonstrated lasing for the first time in April last year2 and started operating as a full user facility about six months later , promises a revolution in X - ray science .
As is the case for all X - ray sources , it allows matter to be probed at the interatomic length scale , which is a few ångströms .
What is transformative , however , is that it produces high - repetition - rate , ultra - bright pulses as short as a few tens of femtoseconds ( 1 femtosecond ( fs ) being 10 − 15 seconds ) .
Such pulses are shorter than the typical vibrational period of atoms in a solid and thus allow , in principle , atomic motion to be charted in real time .
When the output of the X - ray source is focused to micrometre - scale spots , intensities in excess of 1018 watts per square centimetre are produced — a regime that until now was the province of optical lasers .
At such high intensities , a single X - ray laser pulse can result in many X - ray photons being absorbed by an atom , a situation that is highly unlikely even when using the brightest sources previously available ( those emitting synchrotron radiation ) .
Understanding how light and matter interact in this new intensity regime is the goal of the team led by Young and colleagues1 .
The authors focused the X - rays into a jet of neon gas by reflecting them at grazing angles of incidence from curved mirrors .
They then detected the electrons and ions that were produced by accelerating them in a fixed electric field : electrons and ions of different charges travelled at different velocities and so could be differentiated by their time of arrival at the detector .
Next , they varied the photon energy of the X - ray laser between 800 eV and 2,000 eV , as well as the length of the laser pulses ( or , more precisely , the length of the electron bunches used to produce them ) from 230 fs to 80 fs .
By scanning these parameters and then analysing the charge states of the ions , they found that the X - rays could ' peel ' or ' core ' the atoms .
Neon atoms have ten electrons : two in the inner K shell ; and eight in the outer L shell .
It takes an 870 - eV photon to knock out a K - shell electron .
Thus , with photon energies lower than this value , the team1 observed peeling of the atoms ; that is , the X - rays stripped off many of the eight weakly bound electrons from the L shell ( Fig. 1a ) .
With photon energies higher than 870 eV , they observed ( as is seen with conventional X - ray sources ) the ejection of one of the two core electrons , briefly leaving the ions in a state with a core hole and only one electron in the K shell .
This occurs only briefly because the core hole is rapidly filled by an electron from the L shell , although at slightly higher photon energies another photon could then eject this electron as well , leading to a complex refilling and ionization process .
However , before that refilling might occur , the remaining K - shell electron , which is no longer receiving the shielding that would be provided by its companion , becomes even more tightly bound to the neon nucleus .
Indeed , a photon of energy 993 eV would be needed to eject this electron also and create two core holes .
Figure 1 : Peeling and coring of atoms .
Young and colleagues1 have used an ultra- intense X - ray laser source to knock out electrons from neon atoms .
a , Below an energy value of 870 eV — the energy it takes to knock out a K - shell electron — X - rays strip some of the eight weakly bound electrons from the outer L shell of the neon atom — a process that can be thought of as peeling the atom .
b , Above 993 eV , both electrons from the inner K shell can be knocked out , ionizing the atom from the inside out — in other words , coring the atom .
( Adapted from Encyclopædia Britannica . )

As Young et al. demonstrate , significant new physics occurs if the photon energy is higher than 993 eV .
Beyond this critical energy , the photon density within the focal spot of the X - ray laser is so great that both of the inner electrons can be ejected during the laser pulse before refilling , thereby ionizing the atoms from the inside out — which can be termed coring of the atoms ( Fig. 1 b ) .
When an atom has had both core electrons ejected , the main mechanism by which it absorbs X - rays is shut off until one of those core vacancies is filled by electrons from the L shell .
This process usually takes a few femtoseconds , but the team1 found that this refilling time was itself extended at still higher photon energies of about 2,000 eV — an effect that they could observe with the shortest - duration laser pulses .
The extension of the lifetime of the ' hollow ' atom at high photon energies is attributed to an increase in the refilling time if some of the L - shell electrons are also ejected during the complex interaction ( for example , if they fill the core hole but then themselves are ejected ) .
Questions remain , however .
To obtain agreement between the data and theoretical modelling of the interaction between ultra-intense X - rays and atoms , the team needed to assume that the shortest X - ray pulses were considerably shorter than the length of the electron bunch that produced them — so perhaps the laser itself is not fully understood .
During the period in which an atom is cored , it is essentially transparent because the K - shell electrons are the ones that absorb X - rays most efficiently .
At this stage in the ' evolution ' of the ion , it becomes a better scatterer than absorber — what the team calls ' radiation hardening ' of the atom .
This phenomenon may have implications beyond fundamental atomic physics : one of the proposed flagship projects for X - ray lasers is single - biomolecule diffractive imaging , to determine the structures of proteins that cannot be crystallized3 .
This technique would work best with X - ray pulses that are shorter than the hollow - atom lifetime , enabling the diffraction patterns of proteins to be obtained before significant electron and nuclear motion takes place — an approach that has been dubbed ' diffract and destroy ' .
For this to be feasible , many electrons need to remain bound to their parent atoms long enough to scatter during the pulse .
Although the jury is still deliberating on whether single - molecule imaging will become a reality , the work of Young and colleagues provides some degree of confidence in this approach .

Twins Who Share A Brain Tatiana and Krista Hogan are craniopagus twins ( Tatiana is on the left ) .
They are connected at the head and share a brain .
They were born Oct. 25 , 2006 , to parents Felicia and Brendan Hogan of British Columbia , Canada .
" These twins , I think to our current knowledge , are the only ones that do have a common neurological connection , " said Dr. Doug Cochrane , the twins ' pediatric neurologist .

" [ The doctor ] just sat there and he 's like , ' Um , there 's no way to say it , but your girls are conjoined , and they 're conjoined at the head , ' " recalled Felicia Hogan .
" And he 's like , ' I have no idea if these girls are going to survive .
...
You still have time to abort them . '
And right then I looked at him and said , ' There 's no way that 's ever going to happen . ' "
The twins were born healthy and strong , weighing 12.5 pounds .

" [ Krista will ] just get so frustrated with her sister that she 'll -- the only way that she knows how to get it out is to scratch her sister , " mom Felicia Hogan said .
" We try and get her to stop , but usually we 're 10 seconds too late . "

The twins ' happiness is apparent to all around them -- they laughed and played the entire day the " Nightline " crew was with them .
" They ... have this connection between their , what 's called the thalamus , between the thalami , one in each to the other , " said Dr. Doug Cochrane , the twins ' pediatric neurologist .
" So there 's actually a bridge of neural tissues in these twins , which makes them quite unique . "
It also makes them impossible to separate .
Mom Felicia Hogan and others believe the connection has given the twins unique powers .
" They share a lot of things normal conjoined twins do n't , " she said .
" They have special abilities to see each other , see what each other 's seeing through each other 's eyes . "

The twins ' condition has given them very real problems .
Tatiana , the smaller of the two , has an enlarged heart and actually pumps much of Krista 's blood to her brain .
The complications have led to surgeries and more worries .
" We just kind of live today , " said mom Felicia Hogan .
" We live within today .
Forget about tomorrow , we 'll deal with tomorrow when tomorrow gets here . "
For now , the girls are healthy and strong .

There will be those who see such snooping as a weapon of the morally supercilious and the politically censorious .
They will , even though Locke does n’t discuss this , cite instances where repressive states – Maoist China or post - war East Germany – have enjoined their citizens to spy on their neighbours with the goal of cracking down on dissenters .
At the same time , civil society often encourages eavesdropping .
“ Careless talk costs lives ” was the wartime slogan that one might rephrase as “ Careful listening saves lives ” .
For good or for bad , local authorities across Britain increasingly outsource and technologise eavesdropping by allowing ratepayers to tell them where to place CCTV cameras .
The class of 2009 left university knowing they were facing the toughest battle for jobs in a generation .
The outlook for the 300,000 young men and women who were leaving university appeared decidedly bleak , with warnings that the number of new graduates out of work would be double that of the previous year , that students who had graduated from English universities would be the most indebted in history , and that up to 40,000 graduates would be still looking for work six months after leaving university .
That was , at least , the dire prediction , but what was the reality ?
I have spent the last year documenting the post - graduation lives of six students who are among the class of 2009 .
The six studied at the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University , and agreed to keep audio diaries throughout their year in which they recorded their hopes for the coming year as well as their reaction to the reality .
By the end of the year , the six students were scattered around the world and were far more cynical about the value of a university education than they had been on graduating .
Back in the summer of 2009 they had all been reasonably clear about the type of work they were seeking .
Jonathan Page , who had graduated in biochemistry , had his mind set on the sales industry .
Fiona Knight , who studied neuroscience at the University of Leeds , was contemplating a shift in focus – she had decided to try to get a job in the media .
Mohsin Ali , a computer studies graduate from Leeds Metropolitan , wanted to work in online research and development .
Caroline Gerrard had ambitions to work in sound design .
Samantha Del Core hoped to work in interior design , and Lauren Hughes wanted to be a journalist .
Hughes told me that she had been realistic about what the employment market would be like .
" My expectations after leaving university were quite low , " she says .
" Graduating amongst the hype of the economic crisis meant that I was fully prepared to not be able to get a job easily , especially when my aspirations were to go into journalism , which is such a competitive field . "
Others were less hard - headed .
In an audio diary recorded soon after graduating , Gerrard predicted that within six months she would be " in a high - powered job in sound design and really loving it " .
Knight said that she " wanted to do something that is exciting , I am not happy just doing nine to five , I want a way of life not just a job " , while Page claimed that he would not expect to start on anything less than £ 30,000 a year .
Inevitably , reality has taken a wrecking ball to some of these rather optimistic notions .
" Initially when I graduated I thought I would be unemployed for a month or two , " said Gerrard .
" After a month or so I 'd tried over 70 companies and I only had positive responses from two .
The earliest opportunity was about five months later for a week of unpaid work . "
Page and Ali both left the country to seek work in Cyprus and Saudi Arabia , while Del Core found the soul - crushing business of being rejected hard to take .
" I 've looked for jobs in newspapers , at the job centre , on the internet , and by word of mouth , " she says .
" I 've had several interviews , some of which I got to the second stage , but I never got past that .
It has been quite disheartening – some positions I applied for were more the dream job than a means to an end , and I was very upset when I did n't get those .
I was in tears . "
Having spent time with the graduates , I was struck by how much they seemed to have believed , at least at the start , that they were entitled to a well - paid and fulfilling job simply because they had been to university .
" When you look at the people who are going to university , " explains Professor Kate Purcell , of Warwick University 's Institute for Employment Research , " they have been encouraged to think that education has given them employability skills , so as well as learning about history or English or business studies they are also learning problem solving , developing communication skills , so they are pretty confident about themselves . "
This confidence is not necessarily well founded .
I attended a graduate careers fair at the University of Leeds earlier this summer , where I spoke to some employers who gave me a rather different perspective on the calibre of this year 's graduates .
Susie Young is the recruitment manager at Waitrose and she told me that out of the 2,500 applications they had received they still could not fill the 20 graduate positions that were available .
" A lot of the graduates are scared , " she said .
" They think there are no opportunities out there so they apply for anything and everything and they do n't really invest in the time to really look into each organisation . "
Will Corder , recruitment adviser at Kimberly - Clark , told a similar story .
" I find that there are quite a few people who apply to us who can't even spell Kimberly - Clark – even though it is written on the application form , " he says .
" A lot of people go to university for the sake of it because they think it is the right thing to do .
So that makes lots of graduates .
Universities are still selling the idea to people that if they go to university they are guaranteed a great job at the end of it , and that is just not the case any more . "
It was at the Labour party conference in 1999 that Tony Blair announced that by 2010 50 % of school leavers would be enrolled in higher education .
Although the Labour government quietly abandoned that target last year , the latest numbers from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills show that they actually came pretty close to meeting it : by 2009 , university participation rates among 17 - to 30 - year - olds had risen to 45 % .
But while the numbers may be up , the consequent rise in social mobility that this policy was intended to help with has n't been achieved .
According to a report last year called Fair Access to the Professions , a graduate 's chances of getting into one of the top professions – such as law , medicine , politics or the media – are still heavily influenced by background , as today 's young professionals in these areas come from families with an income that is up to 27 % higher than average .
The increasing number of graduates entering the job market has meant that employers are often insisting that prospective employees pass psychometric tests as a way of selecting candidates , and it has also led to claims that too many young people are being herded into university .
" When I think about a university course , I think of something that teaches people a skill so that they are qualified to do a certain job , " says Gerrard .
" But , in reality , after my degree I do n't feel qualified for anything – degrees do n't indicate someone 's common sense or people skills , and I do n't think you can get through many interviews without a little of both . "
All our students left university with large debts and they had strong views about how university education should be funded in the future .
The prospect of a graduate tax , recently floated by the business secretary , Vince Cable , was met with some scepticism .
" I can see the rationale behind a graduate tax , " said Hughes , who currently has debts of around £ 11,000 .
" But I can not see the benefit in the current economic climate .
It seems unfair to charge a higher tax rate on graduates without providing enough jobs to enable them to be able to pay .
And it may make people less serious about going to university as the tax is imposed after graduation . "
One year after graduating none of the students is quite where they hoped to be .
Hughes is spending two months travelling around South Asia before she returns to Britain to save money for a post - graduate course in journalism she wants to start next year .
Page is soon to start work at a headhunting agency in London .
Del Core is still sending out her CV to interior design companies and trying to set up her own website .
Knight is still working as a receptionist .
Gerrard is working in a local theatre in Newcastle , and Ali is in Saudi Arabia contemplating a return to Britain .
Like the 14.9 % of graduates who are unemployed , our graduates have n't had the best of years , at least in terms of getting a job .
Some of them told me they felt that university had not properly equipped them for the hard world of work .
" We were meant to be taught about CV writing and how to do job interviews but it was all self - learning , " says Del Core .
" When I would ask questions I would n't get an answer so I do n't feel I was taught anything new .
I felt more patronised than anything else . "
" The only career guidance we got was to write a CV each year for their records , " says Page .
" I was taught nothing about how to succeed in interviews . "
Despite these complaints , perhaps the most surprising , and heartening , thing I discovered in following the graduates over the last year was that , for all the talk of debt and recession , they would not have given up the chance to go to university .
" Living away from home and having to fend for myself taught me to use my own initiative , " explained Hughes .
" It made me a lot more independent . "
The class of 2009 may have entered the job market at a bleak time but , one year on , they were grateful for their chance to spend three years studying and socialising .
Gerrard spoke for the entire group when she reflected : " I probably did n't get what I thought I would out of my course , but I can't say I wish I had n't done it , as that would mean I would n't have met some of my best friends . "

Justin Bailey Samus in Norfair after using the JUSTIN BAILEY password .
Featured in Metroid
Metroid : Zero Mission
Metroid : Samus Returns Properties Boots , Varia Suit , Usage of Arm Cannon Morph Ball and Screw Attack functions outside of the Power Suit
Justin Bailey refers to a well - known password in Metroid and is also used by fans to refer to the magenta leotard Samus Aran wears upon using this password .
It may have first been referenced in Nintendo Power .[ citation needed ]
The Justin Bailey password is notable for starting Samus out without her Power Suit .
Instead , she wears her outfit from the second - best ending ( leotard and boots ) .
She retains the Arm Cannon .
Although the colors of Samus ' hair , leotard , and skin are all dependent on which suits she has acquired ( the default hair color is brown ) , the term Justin Bailey typically refers to the green - haired palette associated with the Varia Suit .
The suit is normally acquired by restarting the game after one of the two best endings , but most players of non-Japanese versions use the mentioned password instead .
The name " Justin Bailey " comes from the password ( JUSTIN BAILEY ------ ------ ) which allows players to immediately play Samus without her suit on , but still grants her the same abilities and damage reduction as if she were wearing her suit .
Along with the graphical change , the password starts Samus in Norfair with five Energy Tanks , 255 Missiles , the Varia Suit , the Hi-Jump Boots , Screw Attack , and the Wave Beam .
Kraid and Ridley are defeated and the path to Tourian is opened .
However , she must still find the Ice Beam , as the password does not give it and the beam is required to defeat the Metroid larvae in Tourian .
There are many false theories regarding the password .
For example , Justin Bailey was originally thought to be one of the creators of the game , but no such name appears in the game credits .
It was also often said that the Justin Bailey code was a reference to an English or Australian term for a bathing suit .
Bathing suits were , according to this rumor , referred to as " bailies , " so " Justin Bailey " would more accurately be rendered as " Just In [ a ] Bailey " , which is what Samus appears to wear when the code is used .
However , Samus ' outfit with this code is a leotard , not a bathing suit , and " bailey " is not actually slang for " bathing suit " anywhere in the world .
It was also rumored that the password violated Metroid 's normal checksum verification , which would suggest that JUSTIN BAILEY was deliberately coded into the game .
The Metroid Database has attempted to debunk this myth using password generators : [ citation needed ]
“ ... the JUSTIN BAILEY password is a total fluke .
If you play around with Metroid 's password system ( something you can do with the Metroid Password Generator program , found in Fan Apps ) , you can come up with other names and words that work as passwords .
The " Justin Bailey " code is one which was found early on and happened to work pretty well , so it became widely reported . „
Using the Justin Bailey code is not the only way to play as suitless Samus .
The suit is normally unlocked by replaying the game after any of the endings obtained by beating it in under 3 hours and the game 's password system contains a flag that determines whether the player will be using a suited Samus or not .
For example , the code " 000000 000020 000000 000020 " allows the player to start at the beginning of Metroid as suitless Samus without any progress .
Because the original Family Computer Disk System release of Metroid used save files instead of passwords , the Justin Bailey code can only be used in the Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game ( as well as any subsequent re-releases based on the NES version ) .
Due to the removal of passwords in later games , suitless Samus is no longer a bonus feature , though she did continue to appear suitless in the best endings of subsequent games , and in the Game Overs for most non-Prime series games following Super Metroid in which her suit cracked and exploded , revealing Samus wearing a revealing outfit .
The Justin Bailey also appears in WarioWare : Twisted ! , WarioWare : Touched ! , and WarioWare Gold , in the respective microgames based on the original Metroid .
On rare occasions , Samus will appear in her Justin Bailey suit .
The best ending of Metroid : Samus Returns , when completed on Hard Mode in under 4 hours , features Samus in the Justin Bailey suit , with her green hair and light pink skin ( although her hair is in a ponytail ) .
As Samus lands after jumping off - screen , she waves at the camera in the same way she did at the end of Metroid .
Although not present in the middle ending of Hard Mode , Samus 's unhelmeted self in this ending has her hair colored green in direct reference to the Justin Bailey suit .

What is steampunk ?
According to a brief description I found at Beading Daily : " The steampunk culture takes its cues from the Victorian era , and speculates on how our world would be different if steam power had become the driving force behind our culture .
Gears and watch hands are used to decorate larger pieces .
Old - fashioned keys are also very popular , as are bits of antique cast - offs , such as pill cases , thread cutters and tiny knives . "
The movement not only encompasses jewelry , but also clothing , goggles , and other fashion accessories such as boots and hats .
This , I found out by conducting a search for " steampunk " on Google .
The earliest images of the steampunk culture can be traced back as early as 1962 , according to a chronology that used to be listed at Steampunkopedia , a Polish website .
One item on the list surprised me , but the more I thought about it , the more it made perfect sense to be included : Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 .
It certainly was a depiction of blending of Victorian - era and modern technology for the time , was n’t it ?
Although its roots are much older , the actual term " steampunk " was n't created until the late 1980s .
As cited on Wikipedia , according to Jesse Sheidlower 's Science Fiction Citations ,
“ Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s , the term steampunk originated in the late 1980s as a tongue in cheek variant of cyberpunk .
It seems to have been coined by the science fiction author K. W. Jeter , who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers ( author of The Anubis Gates , 1983 ) , James Blaylock ( Homunculus , 1986 ) and himself ( Morlock Night , 1979 and Infernal Devices , 1987 ) which took place in a 19th - century ( usually Victorian ) setting and imitated conventions of actual Victorian speculative fiction such as H. G. Wells 's The Time Machine .
In a letter to the science fiction magazine Locus , printed in the April 1987 issue , Jeter wrote :
Dear Locus ,
Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night ; I 'd appreciate your being so good as to route it [ to ]
Faren Miller , as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in ‘ the Powers / Blaylock / Jeter fantasy triumvirate ’ was writing in the ‘ gonzo - historical manner ’ first .
Though of course , I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering .
Personally , I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing , as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers , Blaylock and myself .
Something based on the appropriate technology of the era ; like " steampunks " , perhaps ...
— K.W. Jeter
Steampunk jewelry is coming back into fashion , as demonstrated by mentions in recent issues of the email newsletters for magazines such as Beading Daily ( 3/3/10 ) , which featured a how - to article for a steampunk faux rivet charm bracelet ; Bead & Button Show News ( 2/19/10 ) , which featured a number of steampunk piece classes offered at the Bead & Button Show in Milwaukee , Wisconsin June 6 - 13 , 2010 ; and Art Jewelry ( 2/11/10 ) , which featured a steampunk - themed ad for Whole Lotta Whimsey , a website that sells materials for craftspeople .
The ad promoted a how - to blog entry for making a steampunk clasp .
I first learned about steampunk through an Advanced Wire Jewelry class I took at The Adult School of Madison , Chatham and Florham Park in New Jersey last fall .
One of the kits the teacher offered was a necklace featuring the inside mechanism of a vintage watch in a claw setting as the focal piece .
She referred to the look as “ steampunk ” in passing .
There was also another necklace kit that incorporated a small cog in it and we wired a pearl into the center of the cog as part of the bail for the pendant .
That was also an example of steampunk jewelry .
Both concepts were created by sb designs .
In mid-February , I was shopping at A.C. Moore and I saw a lyre pendant with gears as part of the design .
It ’s not a true steampunk piece because the gears are not real ones affixed to the larger piece , but it is inspired by the steampunk movement .
However , the item was indicated on the receipt to be a steampunk piece , listed as AN PNDT METAL STMPUNK LYRE OXB .
Assuming I am correctly interpreting the abbreviations , it is called Angel Pendant Metal Steampunk Lyre Oxidized Brass ; it was manufactured by Creativity Inc. ’s Blue Moon Beads division .
I also bought some gears and cogs on eBay this past spring for use in my Metalwork & Jewelry class projects at Montclair State University , Montclair , New Jersey .
When I conducted a search for “ steampunk supplies , ” 488 listings came up .
The trinket box pictured was my final project for the semester .
What I like best about this concept is that family heirlooms that may have lost their usefulness in their original form can now find new life being revisited or reincarnated into new pieces .
As the saying goes , " what is old is new again . "
Even if your grandfather 's watch is broken and does n't fit on your wrist , you can still carry part of it with you in another fashion ... accessory !
Eva Herman über das Loveparade - Unglück : Gott straft die Sünder
Auf der Internetseite ihres Verlags veröffentlichte Eva Herman einen Artikel , in dem sie das Unglück als Strafe für ausschweifendes Feiern deutet .
BERLIN taz |
Sie ließ sich Zeit .
Erst einen
Tag nach dem Unglück bei der Love Parade in Duisburg meldete sich Eva Herman zu Wort , ehemalige Tagesschau - Sprecherin und inzwischen so etwas wie eine Staubsaugervertreterin für das gesunde Volksempfinden der Nachkriegszeit .
Auf der Internetseite des Kopp - Verlages schreibt Herman , die Tode könnten eine Strafe Gottes für hemmungsloses Feiern sein : " Eventuell haben hier ja auch ganz andere Mächte mit eingegriffen , um dem schamlosen Treiben endlich ein Ende zu setzen .
Was das angeht , kann man nur erleichtert aufatmen ! "
Bevor Herrmann erleichtert aufatmen kann , schimpft sie mit kaum verholener
Wut und - man kann sich des Eindrucks kaum erwehren - zumindest etwas Schadenfreude über das Lotterleben der Jugend von heute .
Und auf die moderne Zeit .
Denn , so hat Eva Herman erkannt : " Dieses » friedliche Fest fröhlicher junger Menschen « ist in Wahrheit eine riesige Drogen - , Alkohol - und Sexorgie , geplant , genehmigt und zum Teil finanziert von der Stadt Duisburg und NRW . "
Im Fernsehen hat sie offenbar Bilder gesehen , welche blankes Entsetzen in der Ex-Journalistin hervorrufen .
" Viele Mädchen haben den Busen blank gezogen , manche sind fast völlig nackt .
Sie wiegen sich in ekstatischer Verzückung im ohrenbetäubenden Lärm , Begriffe wie Sittlichkeit oder Anstand haben sich in den abgrundtiefen Bassschlägen ins Nichts aufgelöst . "
Diesen Klageruf nach christlichen Werten kennt man von Herman schon aus früheren Wortbeiträgen .
Neu ist , dass sie sich als Musikkritikerin betätigt und zwar als eine aus der ganz piefigen Großmutter - Ecke , in der vor allem eine rhetorische Frage gestellt wird : Ist das denn noch Musik ?
Die Antwort muss natürlich nein lauten .
" Das ohrenbetäubende , stereotype Rave - Gehämmere , das nicht mehr im Geringsten etwas mit dem einstmaligen Begriff von Musik zu tun hat , zerschmettert ihnen über zahllose Stunden Trommelfelle und Nervenkostüme . "
Als Alternative bietet Herman tatsächlich an späterer Stelle den Musikantenstadl an und das ist dann so derart spießbürgerliches Klischee , dass man sich fragt , ob dieser
Text von einem ihr böse gesonnenen Double auf die Seite geschmuggelt wurde .
Eines macht der Autorin wahrlich zu schaffen .
Trotz des " Gehämmeres " haben sich die Menschen ganz offenbar " freiwillig dazu entschieden , hierher zu kommen . "
Das ist schwer für eine Frau , die sich doch in der schweigenden Mehrheit verortet , einem Platz also , von dem aus all diejenigen , die Widerspruch üben , als zumindest bemitleidenswert , gerne aber auch als verdammniswürdig beschrieben werden können .
Oder eben als solche , die den Tod verdient haben .
Sie löst dieses Dilemma mit einem alten und recht unoriginellen Trick , der ihr sicherlich den Beifall ihrer Peer Group eintragen wird : Nicht die Jugendlichen selbst sind schuld .
Vielmehr wurden sie verführt vom alten Lieblingsfeind , den 68ern .
" Die unheilvollen Auswüchse der Jetztzeit sind , bei Licht betrachtet , vor allem das Ergebnis der Achtundsechziger , die die Gesellschaft » befreit « haben von allen Zwängen und Regeln , welche das » Individuum doch nur einengen « " , schreibt Herman und fabuliert dann noch einmal über Nacktheit und kleidloses Tanzen .
Fazit dann widerum : " Die Achtundsechziger haben ganze Arbeit geleistet ! "
Die leistet Eva Herman allerdings ebenfalls , denn sie geht auch noch dem Bundespräsidenten an den Kragen .
Christian Wulff ( CDU ) hat ihrer Meinung nach wohl Mitschuld an all der Zügellosigkeit und der Strafe des Herrn , denn er hat dem dionysischen Treiben keinen Einhalt geboten .
Schlimmer noch .
Er lobte .
" Das ist die Kehrseite der Medaille über die Loveparade , die laut dem neuen Bundespräsidenten Wulff ein » friedliches Fest fröhlicher , junger Menschen « sein sollte " , schreibt Herman .
Und : " Man fragt sich , welche Veranstaltung der Mann wirklich meint ?
Den Musikantenstadl vielleicht ? "
Der Bundespräsident und Gott .
Darunter macht es Herman eben nicht .
DOVER — Local libraries were recently the subject of a deliberate and calculating attack — of the bookmark variety .
Volunteers and staff at the Dover Public Library spent 30 hours in May collecting more than 5,000 bookmarks secretly placed inside books at the library sometime before May .
The bookmarks contained information about the beliefs of two organizations , the School Sucks Project and Freedomain Radio .
The School Sucks Project is focused on a call to end publicly funded education because of what the group calls an attempt to stifle creativity and a valuing of order and obedience over all else in the school system , according to the group 's website .
Freedomain Radio describes itself as a philosophical radio show with topics including politics , economics , science , philosophy , relationships and atheism , according to its website .
The discovery of the bookmarks at the Dover library was accidental .
" What happened was a shelf fell out in our stacks and all the books fell on the floor , " Library Director Cathy Beaudoin said .
" When they all splayed open , a little blue bookmark fell out of each one . "
It 's not that it 's unusual for people to leave things in books , Beaudoin said , but it was immediately clear that this incident was more than a case of forgetfulness .
" People leave stuff in books a lot , but these were all identical and in every one , " she said .
So staff members decided to check the shelf below , and then the shelf above , and realized all the books contained one of the blue bookmarks .
Then the search left the science - fiction section , where the original Freedomain Radio bookmarks were found .
Soon staff members had found bookmarks in other nonfiction areas — philosophy , politics , sociology , history .
And in the teen section was where staff found the School Sucks Project bookmarks , with more cropping up on SAT and college preparatory books .
" I think they were very careful in what areas they chose to do it , " Beaudoin said , pointing out that the books that were targeted related to the groups ' message .
It 's not the first time somebody has tried to use library books to advertise a message , but it is the first time locally it was to this scale , Beaudoin said .
" This is the first time we had this kind of inundation of a deliberate attempt to put propaganda in books , " Beaudoin said .
Similar bookmarks were also found in libraries in Portsmouth and at the University of New Hampshire .
Although Beaudoin said she did n't want library patrons to think the library supported the messages on the bookmarks , she would n't have denied a request to post a poster or literature on a public board or display .
But library policy prohibits the dissemination of information through bookmarks in books , she said .
" If I had found 5,000 bookmarks staying ' Stop the oil spill in the Gulf , ' a message I think everyone can get behind , I still would have pulled them , " she said .
" It 's not what it was about , but that the act was done . "
She said she did try to send a copy of the library 's policy to the group , but the e-mail came back as undeliverable .
Attempts to reach a representative of the School Sucks Project were unsuccessful .

Rabbi Yehuda Levin , spokesman for an alliance of 850 Orthodox members of the Rabbinical Alliance of America , has denounced Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan in not just political but Biblical terms .
Proclaiming that Kagan is “ not kosher , ” Levin warned that “ Elena Kagan turns traditional Judaism on its head –from a concept of a nation of priests and holy people , she is turning it into , ‘ Let ’s homosexualize every segment of society .
And by the way , partial - birth babies have no right to be delivered . ’”
He continued , “ It is clear from Ms. Kagan ’s record on issues such as abortion - on - demand , partial - birth - abortion , the radical homosexual and lesbian agenda , the ‘ supremacy ’ of the anti-family panoply over religious liberties of biblical adherents , et. al. , that she will function as a flame - throwing radical , hastening society ’s already steep decline into Sodom and Gomorrah . ”
Wow . . . and I thought this confirmation was going to be boring .
I can see it now .
Jeff Session asks about military recruiters on campus at Harvard and Kagan jumps up with an M2 flamethrower yelling “ say hello to my little friend ! ”
Not since Lot ’s wife at Sodom and Gomorrah has there been such an irresistible scene .

Revealed :
The bizarre new creatures discovered at the bottom of Atlantic Ocean
Oddly - shaped , brightly - coloured or even transparent these are some of the bizarre creatures that scientists did not even know existed until recently .
They are among a host of new animals that scientists have just uncovered in the hidden depths of the Atlantic Ocean during a new study which has ' revolutionised ' thinking about deep - sea life .
Scientists believe they have discovered more than 10 new marine species by using the latest diving technology during the groundbreaking study .
A Benthic Holothurian ( Peniagone diaphana ) from the mid Atlantic ridge , which was caught swimming above the sea floor
A Polynoid Polychaete worm , caught at approximately 2,500 m below sea level in the Atlantic Ocean during the new voyage
A group of creatures thought to be close to the missing evolutionary link between backboned and invertebrate animals are among those captured by the team on the MAR - ECO international research programme .
Many other samples of rare animals were collected on the six - week voyage aboard the research ship James Cook .
Details of the trip were revealed by scientists at the University of Aberdeen , who are leading the UK contribution to the project exploring marine life along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Iceland and the Azores .
Using the UK's deepest diving , remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) to reach depths of between 700 m and 3,600 m , they focused on the area beneath the cold waters north of the Gulf Stream and the warmer waters to the south .
Professor Monty Priede , director of the University of Aberdeen 's Oceanlab , said : ' This expedition has revolutionised our thinking about deep - sea life in the Atlantic Ocean .
The southern purple enteropneust worm , left , which was found attached to seafloor by adhesive tentacles and a Hydromedusa caught at approximately 2,500 m below sea level
' It shows that we cannot just study what lives around the edges of the ocean and ignore the vast array of animals living on the slopes and valleys in the middle of the ocean .
' Using new technology and precise navigation , we can access these regions and discover things we never suspected existed . '
Scientists said they were surprised to see how different the animals were on either side of the ridge .
On the north - west plains they encountered enteropneust acorn worms , of which only a few specimens from the Pacific Ocean have ever been recorded .
Prof Priede said : ' These worms are members of a little - known group of animals close to the missing link in evolution between backboned and invertebrate animals .
' They have no eyes , no obvious sense organs or brain but there is a head end , tail end and the primitive body plan of backboned animals is established .
' By the end of the expedition three different species were discovered each with a different colour - pink , purple and white - with distinctly different shapes . '
A Basket Star - Euryalid Ophiuroid , which was caught at approximately 800 m below sea level
A pale and transparent Holothurian , caught at approximately 2,500 m below sea level
The pale red Acorn worm which was one of the deepest creatures found at 2,700 m below sea level
The voyage was carried out as part of the Census of Marine Life programme and was the last in a series of four annual voyages undertaken since 2007 .
Ben Wigham of Newcastle University , which is also taking part in the project , said : ' We are interested in how these animals are feeding in areas of the deep - sea where food is often scarce .
' The differences we see in the diversity of species and numbers of individuals may well be related to how they are able to process and share out a rather common but meagre food supply .
' We certainly see indications that there are differences between the north and south regions of the ridge . '

Model 500 are soon to release a three - track EP on R&S Records , their first original material in eleven years .
The brainchild of Detroit techno founding father Juan Atkins , Model 500 has largely been a solo project since first blowing minds with the 1985 singles ‘ No UFOs ’ and ‘ Night Drive ’ .
Recently , however , the name has come to describe more of a group entity , with Atkins enlisting the services of Underground Resistance ’s ‘ Mad ’ Mike Banks , DJ Skurge and Mark Taylor for a number of live performances .
Banks contributes a remix of lead track ‘ OFI ’ to the new record .
‘ OFI ’ is exquisitely funky electro - techno the likes of which Atkins pretty much invented , with lyrics asserting that “ the mothership is in the air / the mothership is everywhere ” , and a breakdown to die for .
You can listen to a long clip of it , together with one of B - side ‘ Huesca ’ , over at R&S ’s myspace .
Model 500 has been inactive as a recording project since the release of the 1999 album Mind And Body , also on R&S. ‘ OFI ’/’ Huesca ’ , expected to see release in September , marks the 25th anniversary of its inception .
Artists were given one week to create a comic for this battle , the theme was “ Minor Inconveniences ” .
Our next theme is “ Healthy Living ” , so get your drawing pencils !
The comics are due next Tuesday June 15 at 11:59 pm !
Please vote for your favorite !

( CNN ) --
A former high school teacher in Freeland , Michigan , has been arraigned in two counties on 29 counts of sexual misconduct with an underage student , a Midland County prosecutor said Wednesday .
Marcie Rousseau , a 33 - year - old married mother of two , is accused of having sex with a then - 16 - year - old student from May 2009 to February , according to prosecutor Angelina Scarpelli .
There could be two other alleged victims dating back to 2002 , Scarpelli told HLN's " Prime News . "
Rousseau was placed on administrative leave February 16 while police investigated the allegations .
She officially resigned from her teaching job at Freeland High School on June 16 , Scarpelli said .
She was arraigned Monday in Saginaw County on 21 counts of criminal sexual conduct , and in Midland County on Tuesday on eight counts of criminal sexual conduct , Scarpelli said .
Rousseau picked the boy up in her car and drove across county lines to have sex with him , Scarpelli said .
Rousseau entered not guilty pleas to the charges this week , Scarpelli said .
Rousseau , who was released on bond Tuesday , is the latest in a spate of recent highly publicized cases of teachers accused of having sex with students .
Broward County , Florida , teacher Kristen Sullivan , 25 , was arrested April 20 for allegedly having sex with a 14 - year - old student , and Tampa , Florida , teacher Stephanie Ragusa was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for sexual relationships with two underage students in 2008 .
" We 're finally realizing not only that sexual assault exists and how prevalent it is , but there is such a thing as a female perpetrator , " Robin Sax , a former prosecutor and author of " Predators and Molesters , " told " Prime News . "
CNN 's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report .
Research Box Title
Without warning , a mystery object struck Jupiter on July 19 , 2009 , leaving a dark bruise the size of the Pacific Ocean .
The spot first caught the eye of an amateur astronomer in Australia , and soon , observatories around the world , including NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , were zeroing in on the unexpected blemish .
Astronomers had witnessed this kind of cosmic event before .
Similar scars had been left behind during the course of a week in July 1994 , when more than 20 pieces of Comet P / Shoemaker - Levy 9 ( SL9 ) plunged into Jupiter 's atmosphere .
The 2009 impact occurred during the same week , 15 years later .
Astronomers who compared Hubble images of both collisions say the culprit may have been an asteroid about 1,600 feet ( 500 meters ) wide .
The images , therefore , may show for the first time the immediate aftermath of an asteroid , rather than a comet , striking another planet .
The Jupiter bombardments reveal that the solar system is a rambunctious place , where unpredictable events may occur more frequently than first thought .
Jupiter impacts were expected to occur every few hundred to few thousand years .
Although there are surveys to catalogue asteroids , many small bodies may still go unnoticed and show up anytime to wreak havoc .
" This solitary event caught us by surprise , and we can only see the aftermath of the impact , but fortunately we do have the 1994 Hubble observations that captured the full range of impact phenomena , including the nature of the objects from pre-impact observations " says astronomer Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo. , leader of the Jupiter impact study .
In 2009 Hammel 's team snapped images of the debris field with Hubble 's recently installed Wide Field Camera 3 and newly repaired Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The analysis revealed key differences between the two collisions ( in 1994 and 2009 ) , providing clues to the 2009 event .
Astronomers saw a distinct halo around the 1994 impact sites in Hubble ultraviolet ( UV ) images , evidence of fine dust arising from a comet - fragment strike .
The UV images also showed a strong contrast between impact - generated debris and Jupiter 's clouds .
Hubble ultraviolet images of the 2009 impact showed no halo and also revealed that the site 's contrast faded rapidly .
Both clues suggest a lack of lightweight particles , providing circumstantial evidence for an impact by a solid asteroid rather than a dusty comet .
The elongated shape of the recent impact site also differs from the 1994 strike , indicating that the 2009 object descended from a shallower angle than the SL9 fragments .
The 2009 body also came from a different direction than the SL9 pieces .
Team member Agustin Sanchez - Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao , Spain , and colleagues performed an analysis of possible orbits that the 2009 impacting body could have taken to collide with Jupiter .
Their work indicates the object probably came from the Hilda family of bodies , a secondary asteroid belt consisting of more than 1,100 asteroids orbiting near Jupiter .
The 2009 strike was equal to a few thousand standard nuclear bombs exploding , comparable to the blasts from the medium - sized fragments of SL9 .
The largest of those fragments created explosions that were many times more powerful than the world 's entire nuclear arsenal blowing up at once .
The recent impact underscores the important work performed by amateur astronomers .
" This event beautifully illustrates how amateur and professional astronomers can work together , " notes Hammel .
Occasional dark spots have appeared on Jupiter throughout the history of sky watching .
Observing records of the planet are filled with references to spots , including " white spots , " " peculiar spots , " and " well - defined spots . "
Only a handful may have described possible Jupiter strikes .
In 1686 , the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini reported a dark spot on Jupiter that was roughly the size of the largest SL9 impact .
Nearly 150 years later , in 1834 , British astronomer George Airy independently reported a dark feature in Jupiter 's southern belts that looked nearly four times as large as shadows cast on the planet by the Galilean moons .
Crude telescopes prevented sky watchers from probing the nature of those spots .
The study by Hammel 's team appeared in the June 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
I thought one of the boasts of the Droid line from VZW is that it DOESN 'T have bloatware on it .
Granted , I have n't seen one out of the box yet - all the ones I 've seen have been used already a bit , but what bloatware does it come with , or are we talking about Motorola 's UI that you can't turn off ?
Still , I 'm really glad to see this thing is rootable so quickly after release - people were whining so much about how Motorola was going back to its process of encrypting ROMs that I 'm happy to see we 've moved past it already .
Kapitulation vor der Klientel Jens Berger
Die schwarz - gelbe Gesundheitsreform ist ein Kotau vor den Kostentreibern und ein Schlag ins Gesicht der Arbeitnehmer
Anstatt die Kosten zu senken oder die Basis für die Finanzierung zu erweitern , wälzt Schwarz - Gelb alle künftigen Kostensteigerungen ganz einfach auf die Beitragszahler ab .
Der Glaube an funktionierende Marktmechanismen und an den Wettbewerb im Gesundheitssystem ist ein politisches Dogma .
Diese Reform ist in ihrer gesamten Absurdität aber wohl erst dann zu greifen , wenn man schaut , wer ungeschoren bleibt .
Das Grundproblem des Gesundheitssystems ist eigentlich eher ein Problem des Wirtschaftssystems .
Auf der Einnahmenseite sind die gesetzlichen Krankenkassen auf die Beiträge der Versicherten angewiesen , die wiederum abhängig von ihren Einkommen sind .
Die deutsche Volkswirtschaft ist allerdings dadurch gekennzeichnet , dass niedrige Einkommen langsamer steigen , als hohe Einkommen .
Die Lohn - und Einkommenssteigerungen der Besserverdienenden gehen allerdings dank der Beitragsbemessungsgrenze und der Möglichkeit , zu einer privaten Krankenversicherung zu wechseln , nicht in die Einnahmen der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen ein .
Bei stetigen Beitragssätzen steigen die Einnahmen des GKV - Systems also in dem Maß , wie die Einkommen und Renten im unteren und mittleren Einkommensbereich steigen .
Auf der Ausgabenseite wollen sich jedoch Besserverdienende und die Kapitalseite nicht mit diesen eher mager bemessenen Wachstumsraten abfinden .
Apotheker , Ärzte und Aktionäre von Krankenhaus - und Pharmakonzernen haben ein Interesse daran , dass ihre Einkommen und Gewinne stärker steigen als die Einkommen ihrer Mitarbeiter und werden von demographischen und technischen Entwicklungen dabei zusätzlich gestärkt .
Wenn nun aber die Einnahmenseite jährlich um rund einen Prozentpunkt wächst , während die Ausgabenseite jährlich um mindestens vier Prozentpunkte wachsen will , klafft im Gesundheitssystem zwangsläufig ein Loch .
So lange man sich nicht an eine echte Kürzung der Ausgaben macht , wird jede " Reform " des Gesundheitssystems letztlich nur darin bestehen , die Löcher je nach politischer Präferenz neu zu stopfen .
Klientelpolitik mit gelbem Anstrich
Die FDP gilt als Klientelpartei der niedergelassenen Ärzte , der Apotheker und der Unternehmer .
Dass eine Gesundheitsreform , die federführend von der FDP entworfen wurde , die Stammwähler der Liberalen nicht über Gebühr belastet , ist nicht sonderlich überraschend .
Ärzte und Apotheker können also aufatmen .
Ein niedergelassener
Arzt erzielt im Durchschnitt einen Reinertrag von 142.000 Euro im Jahr – davon gehen nur noch Steuern und Sozialabgaben ab .
Durchschnittlich elf Prozent mehr Honorar konnten die Ärzte in den beiden letzten Jahren verbuchen .
Möglich werden diese phantastischen Einkommenssteigerungen durch ein sogenanntes Regelleistungsvolumen , das in einem Kollektivvertrag mit den Krankenkassen ausgehandelt wird .
Natürlich lässt die Gesundheitsreform der schwarz - gelben Regierung dieses - alles andere als markwirtschaftliche - Honorierungssystem unangetastet .
Auch die Apotheker , die so hohe Margen realisieren können , wie kaum ein anderes Gewerbe , dürfen weiterhin in einem nahezu wettbewerbsfreien Raum abkassieren .
Den Apotheker freut es , Kassen und Versicherte müssen für dieses Monopol kräftig in die Tasche greifen .
Mikrokosmos Krankenhaus
Exemplarisch lässt sich der Konstruktionsfehler des Gesundheitssystems am Mikrokosmos Krankenhaus beobachten .
Die Betreiber moderner Krankenhauskonzerne peilen ein jährliches Renditewachstum von mindestens fünf Prozent an .
Da die Kassen die Einnahmen der Krankenhäuser bezahlen , steigen deren Kosten analog .
Weil die examinierte Krankenschwester allerdings ein Kostenfaktor ist , steigt ihr Einkommen in einem wesentlich geringeren Maße - wenn sie Pech hat , wird sie sogar gegen eine Pflegeassistentin ausgetauscht , die dem Niedriglohnsektor angehört .
Die Krankenkassenbeiträge , die von den unteren und mittleren Angestellten des Krankenhauses abgeführt werden , steigen daher - wenn überhaupt - wesentlich geringer als fünf Prozent .
Die Ober - und Chefärzte , die diese Lücke füllen könnten , sind entweder privat versichert oder fallen unter die Beitragsbemessungsgrenze .
Da die Zusatzbeiträge der Krankenkassen künftig nicht lohnabhängig erhoben werden , vergrößert sich diese Lücke abermals .
Schönes neues Gesundheitssystem .
Wettbewerb oder Kartell der Kassierer ?
Da Philipp Rösler die Ausgabenseite nicht anrühren will - oder kann - , besteht die jüngste Gesundheitsreform streng genommen auch lediglich aus einer Anhebung der Beiträge .
Wenn man nicht sparen will oder kann , ist dies tatsächlich alternativlos .
Im nächsten Jahr klafft nach internen Berechnungen der Bundesregierung bereits ein Loch von 11 bis 15 Milliarden Euro im GKV - System , das gestopft werden muss .
Neben einer Erhöhung der Beiträge , mit der die Demontage des paritätischen Gesundheitssystems zementiert wird , darf jede gesetzliche Kasse künftig Zusatzbeiträge nach ihrem Gusto erheben .
Für die Regierung heißt dies " Stärkung des Wettbewerbs " .
In einem System , das eher an ein Kartell denn an einen funktionierenden Wettbewerb erinnert , und in dem die Kassen , die besser wirtschaften , keine Vorteile haben , ist jedoch eher davon auszugehen , dass die Kassen Seit ' an Seit ' ihre Defizite vom Versicherten ausgleichen lassen .
Der " soziale Ausgleich " ist dabei lediglich ein Feigenblatt .
Wer mehr als zwei Prozent seines Einkommens für den Zusatzbeitrag aufwenden muss , kriegt nämlich nicht die Differenz zwischen der Zwei-Prozent - Marke und dem Zusatzbeitrag erstattet , sondern die Differenz zwischen der Zwei-Prozent - Marke und dem durchschnittlich erhobenen Zusatzbeitrag aller Krankenkassen .
Wer also Kunde einer besonders teuren Kasse ist , bleibt auf einem Teil der Kosten sitzen , selbst wenn diese die Zwei-Prozent - Marke übersteigen .
Da der Ausgleich vom Arbeitgeber als Aufschlag auf den Nettolohn ausgezahlt wird , ist auch noch vollkommen unklar , wie dies bei Freiberuflern und Selbstständigen gehandhabt wird , die freiwillig in der GKV versichert sind .
Da lediglich das Einkommen aus unselbstständiger Arbeit und keine Einkünfte aus Vermögen und Vermietung herangezogen werden , kann man ohnehin nicht von einem gerechten Ausgleich sprechen .
Alternativen
Die größten Probleme im Gesundheitssystem sind hausgemacht und eigentlich unnötig .
Ein kommunal betriebenes Krankenhaus ist nicht nur preiswerter , es lässt sich auch mit " normalen " Wachstumsraten betreiben .
Private Betreiber wollen mehr , die Kapitalrendite , die sie erwirtschaften , verschwindet als Umverteilung von unten nach oben aus dem Gesundheitssystem .
Auch Ärzte und Apotheker müssten Abschied von ihren Standesprivilegien nehmen .
Natürlich haben sie einen Anspruch auf ein adäquates Einkommen - dies schließt aber keine Traumeinkommen mit phantastischen Wachstumsraten mit ein .
Selbstverständlich könnte man auch die Kostenexplosion bei den Medikamenten in den Griff bekommen , wenn man den Pharmakonzernen auf Augenhöhe begegnen würde .
Dafür müsste man dann allerdings in Kauf nehmen , dass Innovationen im deutschen Markt nicht angeboten werden .
Ohne durchdachte Rationierungen erscheint ein Austrocknen des Sumpfes aber nicht möglich .
Das ist freilich unmöglich , wenn man immer nur auf die Frösche der Lobbys hört .
Aber auch auf der Einnahmenseite wäre eine grundlegende Reform möglich .
Warum koppelt man die Krankenkassenbeiträge nicht von den Lohnnebenkosten ab und ersetzt sie durch eine Steuerfinanzierung .
Wenn jeder Bürger einen prozentualen Anteil seines Einkommens in einen
Topf zahlen würde , der dann pro Versicherten an die gesetzliche und die private Krankenversicherung ausgezahlt wird , wäre dies sozial gerecht .
Für Zusatzleistungen á la Chefarzt - Versorgung oder Homöopathie könnten die Kassen immer noch Zusatzversicherungen für die finanzstarke Klientel anbieten .
Nur durch eine solche Finanzierung würde der Chefarzt seinen gerechten Anteil zur Krankenversicherung seiner Putzfrau beitragen .
Aber das wäre wahrscheinlich Sozialismus und wäre unseren Leistungsträgern nicht zuzumuten .

Cross-posted at Love Is n’t Enough .
Diego Costa sent in an image of Jaden Smith , star of the remake of The Karate Kid , at a recent promotional event in China .
In it , 11 - year - old Jaden has lifted his shirt to show off his abs , while co-star Jackie Chan and a man I presume is the event host marvel at them :
What struck Diego is how this image was received differently than a similar image of an 11 - year - old girl pulling up her shirt to show off her abs might be seen .
For instance , The Huffington Post showed the image without any comment about its content .
We might compare that to the public outcry over the images of Miley Cyrus wrapped in a sheet that came out two years ago .
I also suspect The Huffington Post article might say something about the adult men in the above photo if it were a girl rather than a boy they were touching / ogling .
Apparently when he went on The View , Jaden said he ’s “ already a great kisser ” and the audience cheered , though I can’t find a video of it .
Diego says ,
Why is the exposure of boy bodies deemed appropriate whilst the revealing of girls ’ bodies must always accompany relentless probing , judging and outrage ?
If we agree that we should n’t sexualize children , then let ’s not do it to any child .
And , while we are at it , let ’s also not assume infantile heterosexuality by asking if boys already have “ a girlfriend . ”
Excellent points .
I suspect if an 11 - year - old girl went on The View and said she was a good kisser already , she and her parents would be attacked in the press , people would express horror , and rumors would circulate about whether she ’s been sexually abused , is already sexually active , etc. etc .
But when an 11 - year - old boy does it ?
That ’s cute !
He ’s on his way to being a smooth - talking ladies ’ man !
I can’t decide if , or to what degree , race might be at play here .
There is certainly a tendency to adultify non-White children — that is , to treat them as mini-adults rather than children at much earlier ages than White kids are .
This includes sexuality ( for instance , teachers often assume Black girls are sexually active at younger ages than White girls ) .
My recent post on the hypersexualization of a 13 - year - old Latino boy discussed this topic .
But I ’m not sure if that ’s playing a major role here , or if gender assumptions and him being the son of a much - beloved celebrity couple are the more important factors .
Thoughts ?
For another example , see our post on the Rolling Stone cover with Taylor Lautner .
Google has just signed a contract with an Iowa wind farm to purchase clean energy at a set rate for the next 20 years .
This move is in keeping with Google 's strong environmental stance ; with specific regard to energy consumption and wind - generated energy , the company has been championing PowerMeter and has invested $ 38 million in wind farms this year alone .
In fact , Google gained the ability to buy and sell electricity like any other public utility in February in order to achieve its goals for carbon neutrality and more efficient energy use in its massive data centers .
This Power Purchase Agreement is the first deal brokered under the auspices of Google Energy .
On the official Google blog , Google 's SVP Operations Urs Hoelzle wrote , " On July 30 we will begin purchasing the clean energy from 114 megawatts of wind generation at the NextEra Energy Resources Story County II facility in Iowa at a predetermined rate for 20 years ...
This power is enough to supply several data centers . "
The company 's long - term commitment will generate a significant amount of capital for NextEra to develop more wind projects .
" While we are happy to be purchasing renewable energy as part of our environmental commitment , this is also a structure that makes long term financial sense for Google , " wrote another company rep .
" Through the long term purchase of renewable energy at a predetermined price , we ’re partially protecting ourselves against future increases in power prices .
This is a case where buying green makes business sense . "
What do you think of Google 's latest move in its broader push for greener energy sources ?
Do you think the company is making a significant and positive impact on the environment , setting a good example for other corporations , or both ?
TUKWILA , Wash . --
For the fourth consecutive year , the Sounders have reached the semifinal of the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup .
Nate Jaqua scored two second - half goals and Terry Boss held the LA Galaxy scoreless as the Sounders FC blasted past the LA Galaxy 2 - 0 in the quarterfinals of the Open Cup at Starfire Sports Stadium .
Seattle won the Open Cup in 2009 and , in the USL , reached the semifinal in 2007 and 2008 .
“ I thought that we did what I wanted us to do .
We came out and played with a lot of energy , a lot of desire , ” Sounders FC head coach Sigi Schmid said .
“ It did n’t matter who they had on the field .
I know they were missing certain people but I thought it was our energy , our defensive pressure that helped create the game that we wanted to create .
I ’m very happy for the team . ”
Jaqua , starting his second Open Cup match after missing the first 14 games of the Major League Soccer season with a lower abdominal injury , put the Sounders up 1 - 0 in the 50th minute and added a second goal in the 62nd minute to complete the brace .
Terry Boss added two saves in his first start for the Sounders FC .
“ It was a good team effort .
I mean everywhere on the field , everyone battled hard , ” Jaqua said .
“ It was good to get L.A. back after getting beat up down there , it ’s good to beat them up at our place . ”
Playing against the Galaxy for the second time in four days , Seattle battled through the first half against a veteran LA side .
As the second half got under way , Miguel Montano became a menace on the left wing , forcing the Galaxy to commit extra defenders to keep him at bay .
That did n’t prevent the young Colombian from making an impact though .
Montano took a pass down the middle of the box from Mike Seamon and shot a left - footed bouncer at LA goalkeeper Josh Saunders , who made the save , but left the rebound open for Montano .
He pounced on the putback attempt , but caught the crossbar and the ball bounced down to the right post , where Jaqua headed in the carom to give the Sounders a 1 - 0 lead .
It was the second straight Open Cup game in 2010 that Jaqua had opened scoring for the Sounders .
He gave Seattle a 1 - 0 lead in their third round victory over the Portland Timbers as well .
It was also the third consecutive Open Cup appearance that Jaqua had scored in , dating back to a 2 - 1 semifinal win over the Houston Dynamo in 2009 .
“ I was just excited to play and get out there , ” Jaqua said .
“ It ’s been so long watching and then I had some good service .
I should put those in . ”
In the 62nd minute , Montano carried the ball to the endline on the left side , continuing his torment of Galaxy defender Eddie Lewis , before crossing the ball to Jaqua at the far post for a header that he powered into the net for a 2 - 0 lead , putting away a Galaxy team that topped Seattle 3 - 1 in MLS play on Sunday .
“ We have been playing well , ” Montano said of his combination play with Jaqua in recent weeks .
“ We have been practicing well together , even just the two of us , crossing .
That reflected in the game . ”
Seattle held on down the stretch and finished with the 2 - 0 victory .
“ It ’s definitely big , ” Schmid said .
“ It ’s a mentality .
Every game you win it becomes a better habit for your team .
That ’s what we want to establish right now . ”
Seattle advances to face Chivas USA in the semifinal September 1 at Starfire .
They return to league play to face FC Dallas Sunday at Qwest .

Bands of chimpanzees violently kill individuals from neighboring groups in order to expand their own territory , according to a 10 - year study of a chimp community in Uganda that provides the first definitive evidence for this long - suspected function of this behavior .
University of Michigan primate behavioral ecologist John Mitani's findings are published in the June 22 issue of Current Biology .
During a decade of study , the researchers witnessed 18 fatal attacks and found signs of three others perpetrated by members of a large community of about 150 chimps at Ngogo , Kibale National Park .
Then in the summer of 2009 , the Ngogo chimpanzees began to use the area where two - thirds of these events occurred , expanding their territory by 22 percent .
They traveled , socialized and fed on their favorite fruits in the new region .
" When they started to move into this area , it did n't take much time to realize that they had killed a lot of other chimpanzees there , " Mitani said .
" Our observations help to resolve long - standing questions about the function of lethal intergroup aggression in chimpanzees . "
Mitani is the James N. Spuhler Collegiate Professor in the Department of Anthropology .
His co-authors are David Watts , an anthropology professor at Yale University , and Sylvia Amsler , a lecturer in anthropology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock .
Amsler worked on this project as a graduate student at U -M .

Chimpanzees ( along with bonobos ) are humans ' closest living relatives .
Anthropologists have long known that they kill their neighbors , and they suspected that they did so to seize their land .
" Although some previous observations appear to support that hypothesis , until now , we have lacked clear - cut evidence , " Mitani said .
The bouts occurred when the primates were on routine , stealth " boundary patrols " into neighboring territory .
Amsler , who conducted field work on this project described one of the attacks she witnessed far to the northwest of the Ngogo territory .
She and a colleague were following 27 adult and adolescent males and one adult female .
" They had been on patrol outside of their territory for more than two hours when they surprised a small group of females from the community to the northwest , " Amsler said .
" Almost immediately upon making contact , the adult males in the patrol party began attacking the unknown females , two of whom were carrying dependent infants . "
The Ngogo patrollers seized and killed one of the infants fairly quickly .
They fought for 30 minutes to wrestle the other from its mother , but unsuccessfully .
The Ngogo chimpanzees then rested for an hour , holding the female and her infant captive .
Then they resumed their attack .

" Though they were never successful in grabbing the infant from its mother , the infant was obviously very badly injured , and we do n't believe it could have survived , " Amsler said .
In most of the attacks in this study , chimpanzee infants were killed .
Mitani believes this might be because infants are easier targets than adult chimpanzees .
Scientists are still not sure if the chimpanzees ' ultimate motive is resources or mates .
They have n't ruled out the possibility that the attacks could attract new females to the Ngogo community .
Mitani says these findings disprove suggestions that the aggression is due to human intervention .
Lethal attacks were first described by renowned primatologist Jane Goodall who , along with other human observers , used food to gain the chimps ' trust .
Some researchers posited that feeding the animals might have affected their behavior .
The Michigan researchers did n't use food .
He cautions against drawing any connections to human warfare and suggests instead that the findings could speak to the origins of teamwork .
" Warfare in the human sense occurs for lots of different reasons , " Mitani said .
" I 'm just not convinced we 're talking about the same thing .
" What we 've done at the end of our paper is to turn the issue on its head by suggesting our results might provide some insight into why we as a species are so unusually cooperative .
The lethal intergroup aggression that we have witnessed is cooperative in nature , insofar as it involves coalitions of males attacking others .
In the process , our chimpanzees have acquired more land and resources that are then redistributed to others in the group . "
The paper is titled " Lethal intergroup aggression leads to territorial expansion in wild chimpanzees . "
The research is funded by the Detroit Zoological Institute , the Little Rock Zoo , the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation , the National Geographic Society , the National Science Foundation , the University of Michigan , the Wenner - Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research , and Yale University .
As part of an initiative to crack down on Internet piracy and counterfeiting , the US Government recently took action against sites making available movies and TV shows .
Arrests did not feature in the action , but controversially the authorities seized site domain names instead .
TorrentFreak has learned that both The Pirate Bay and MegaUpload domains were also on the target list .
In the final days of last month , US authorities targeted several sites they claimed were connected to the streaming of movies and TV shows .
‘ Operation In Our Sites ‘ culminated in the apparent shutting down of 9 sites – TVShack.net , Movies - Links .
TV , FilesPump.com , Now -Movies.com , PlanetMoviez.com , ThePirateCity.org , ZML.com , NinjaVideo.net and NinjaThis.net – although not in the conventional manner .
Rather than rounding the operators up physically or threatening them with ruinous legal action , the US Government seized at least 7 of the domains instead , and pointed them to their own server which carried an ominous warning .
The action came following recent threats from Vice President Joe Biden and Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator Victoria Espinel which were directed at those offering unauthorized movies and music .
Nevertheless , the domain seizure route came as quite a surprise .
That said , domain seizures are nothing new .
In 2008 the Governor of Kentucky grabbed around 140 domains connected with online gambling but we have to go back seven years to find a comparable copyright related case .
In February 2003 , the US DOJ obtained the domain of release news site IsoNews.com after its owner pleaded guilty to selling Xbox ‘ Enigmah ’ mod chips , a violation of the DMCA .
However , the site ’s domain was n’t taken ‘ just like that ’ , it was handed over by its owner in a plea deal .
So , how did the authorities manage to take control of the streaming - connected sites so easily ?
The answer lies with ICANN .
Amongst other things , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) is the body responsible for managing the web ’s DNS system to ensure that users of the Internet can find websites by using domain names .
Coincidentally , last month Internet policy and security research group KnujOn published a report which suggested that many dozens of Internet domain registrars ( who sell domains to the public ) could be violating their agreements with ICANN , including but not limited to the blocking of Whois information .
The report , which concerned domains through which unlicensed pharmaceuticals are sold online , was later cited by John Horton , the head of a LegitScript , a company which aims to ensure the legitimacy of online pharmacies .
He noted the importance of pointing out to domain name registrars that “ there is no reason to knowingly facilitate criminal activity including activity that violates intellectual property .
Those are the choke points of the Internet . ”
Of course , one such choke point is located a small but significant step above the registrars with ICANN itself and it seems the organization has been working both closely and freely with the authorities in respect of these recent domain seizures .
A source that has proved 100 % reliable in the past told TorrentFreak that ICANN transferred the movie and TV related domains to the US authorities because it was agreed that they were violating their terms and conditions .
We were also informed that , as mentioned in the KnujOn report , some registrars also violate ICANN ’s terms and conditions by anonymizing the ownership of domains .
This , we were told , could make other domains in a similar state targets to be seized by the authorities in the future .
So the basic formula appears to be this – the US Government felt the sites in question were illegal and since they were accessible from the US , they should do something about them .
On its part , ICANN has no problem cooperating with the Government and is happy to act on terms of use violations either by domain owners or domain registrars .
Clearly this development comes as somewhat of a surprise , so naturally we were keen to find out where this policy could end .
How , for example , would it affect some of the biggest sites ?
Naturally The Pirate Bay came to mind .
Shockingly , TorrentFreak was informed that wheels were also set in motion to seize The Pirate Bay domain .
But for reasons that remain unclear that did n’t come to pass .
Our source believes that the US authorities would ’ve had to contact the Swedish authorities on the matter first , but that since there is already an unfinished criminal process against the site , the time was not considered right .
There is an implication , however , that patience wo n’t last forever and may run out after the founders ’ upcoming court appeal .
Another site in the cross hairs appears to be MegaUpload .
Although a domain seizure was suggested , it now seems that another route has been taken , at least for now .
We have also been informed by other sources that further sites are being watched although it proved impossible to discover their names .
We asked ICANN for a reaction on this development , but got no reply .
“ Hollywood lawyers have discovered the soft underbelly of piracy , ” was the reaction of Professor Pouwelse from Delft University of Technology .
Prof .
Pouwelse is no stranger to legal proceedings , he has appeared as an expert witness on P2P matters in numerous civil and criminal court proceedings .
“ This is very effective erosion of Internet rights , if it grows from an obscure practice into standard procedure for taking down entire websites ” .
The Kentucky example is dragging on for years already , so there is still hope .
Clearly the seizure of domains on terms and conditions violations is a worrying development but one that could remain unresolved for sometime .
Are the operators of the above - mentioned streaming sites likely to turn up in a US court to argue for their safe return ?
Hardly … .

The American occupation forces imposed strict censorship on Japan , prohibiting anything " that might , directly or by inference , disturb public tranquility " and used it to prohibit all pictures of the bombed cities .
The pictures remained classified ' top secret ' for many years .
Some of the images have been published later by different means , but it 's not usual to see them all together .
This is the horror they did n't want us to see , and that we must NEVER forget :
1. Signals
All the watches found in the ground zero were stopped at 8:15 am , the time of the explosion .
Within a certain distance from the site of explosion , the heat was so intense that practically everything was vaporised .
The shadows of the parapets were imprinted on the road surface of the Yorozuyo Bridge , 1 / 2 of a mile south - southwest of the hypocenter .
Besides , in Hiroshima , all that was left of some humans , sitting on stone benches near the centre of explosion , was their outlines .
The photograph bellow shows the stone steps of a Bank where a person was incinerated by the heat rays .
2 . The massacre
On August 6 , 1945 , 8.15 am , the uranium atom bomb exploded 580 metres above the city of Hiroshima with a blinding flash , creating a giant fireball and sending surface temperatures to 4,000C .
Fierce heat rays and radiation burst out in every direction , unleashing a high pressure shockwave , vaporising tens of thousands of people and animals , melting buildings and streetcars , reducing a 400 - year - old city to dust .
Housewives and children were incinerated instantly or paralysed in their daily routines , their internal organs boiled and their bones charred into brittle charcoal .
Beneath the center of the explosion , temperatures were hot enough to melt concrete and steel .
Within seconds , 75,000 people had been killed or fatally injured with 65 % of the casualties nine years of age and younger .
Radiation deaths were still occurring in large numbers in the following days .
" For no apparent reason their health began to fail .
They lost appetite .
Their hair fell out .
Bluish spots appeared on their bodies .
And then bleeding began from the ears , nose and mouth " .
Doctors " gave their patients Vitamin A injections .
The results were horrible .
The flesh started rotting from the hole caused by the injection of the needle .
And in every case the victim died " .
This photograph shows an eyeball of an A - bomb victim who got an atomic bomb cataract .
There is opacity near the center of the eyeball .
3. Hibakusha
They and their children were ( and still are ) victims of severe discrimination due to lack of knowledge about the consequences of radiation sickness , which people believed to be hereditary or even contagious .
Many of them were fired from their jobs .
Hibakusha women never got married , as many feared they would give birth to deformed children .
Men suffered discrimination too .
" Nobody wanted to marry someone who might die in a couple of years " .
4. Yamahata , the photographer of Nagasaki
On Agust 10 , 1945 , the day after the bombing of Nagasaki
“ A warm wind began to blow - he wrote later - Here and there in the distance I saw many small fires , like elf - fires , smoldering .
Nagasaki had been completly destroyed "
Mr. Yamahata 's photographs are the most complete record of the atomic bombing as seen in the most immediate hours after the bombing .
The New York Times has called Mr. Yamahata 's photographs , " some of the most powerful images ever made " .
Mr. Yamahata became violently ill on August 6 , 1965 , his forty - eighth birthday and the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima .
He was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the duodenum , probably caused by the residual effects of radiation received in Nagasaki in 1945 .
He died on April 18 , 1966 , and is buried at Tama Cemetery , Tokyo .
The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed about 250.000 people and became the most dreadful slaughter of civilians in modern history .
However , for many years there was a curious gap in the photographic records .
Although the names of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were incised into our memories , there were few pictures to accompany them .
Even today , the image in our minds is a mixture of devastated landscapes and shattered buildings .
Shocking images of the ruins , but where were the victims ?
The American occupation forces imposed strict censorship on Japan , prohibiting anything " that might , directly or by inference , disturb public tranquility " and used it to prohibit all pictures of the bombed cities .

Hibakusha is the term widely used in Japan referring to victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The Japanese word translates literally to " explosion - affected people " .
They and their children were ( and still are ) victims of severe discrimination due to lack of knowledge about the consequences of radiation sickness , which people believed to be hereditary or even contagious .

" Nobody wanted to marry someone who might die in a couple of years " .
On Agust 10 , 1945 , the day after the bombing of Nagasaki Yosuke Yamahata , began to photograh the devastation .
The city was dead .
He walked through the darkened ruins and the dead corpses for hours .
By late afternoon , he had taken his final photographs near a first aid station north of the city .
In a single day , he had completed the only extensive photographic record of the immediate aftermath of the atomic bombing of either Hiroshima or Nagasaki .
“ A warm wind began to blow - he wrote later - Here and there in the distance I saw many small fires , like elf - fires , smoldering .

Well , this is something you do n't see every day .
Ralph Nader hosted this interview segment with Fox News ' Judge Andrew Napolitano and discussed his book , Lies the Government Told You .
I 'm surprised the judge is going to be allowed on Fox after making the statements he did about Bush and Cheney during the interview .
Nader :
What about the more serious violations of habeas corpus .
You know after 9 - 11 Bush rounded up thousands of them , Americans , many of them Muslim Americans or Arabic Americans and they were thrown in jail without charges , they did n't have lawyers , some of them were pretty mistreated in New York City .
You know they were all released eventually .
Napolitano : Correct .
Nader :
Is that what you mean also about throwing people in jail without charges violating habeas corpus ?
Napolitano :
Well that is so obviously a violation of the natural law , the natural right to be brought before a neutral arbiter within moments of the government taking your freedom away from you .
And the Constitution itself , as the Supreme Court in the Boumediene case pretty much said , wherever the government goes , the Constitution goes with it and wherever the Constitution goes are the rights of the Constitution as a guarantee and habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the president ever .
It can only be suspended by the Congress in times of rebellion which in read Milligan says meaning rebellion of such magnitude that judges can't get into their court houses .
That has not happened in American history .
So what President Bush did with the suspension of habeas corpus , with the whole concept of Guantanamo Bay , with the whole idea that he could avoid and evade federal laws , treaties , federal judges and the Constitution was blatantly unconstitutional and is some cases criminal .
Nader : What 's the sanction for President Bush and Vice President Cheney ?
Napolitano :
There 's been no sanction except what history will say about them .
Nader :
What should be the sanctions ?
Napolitano :
They should have been indicted .
They absolutely should have been indicted for torturing , for spying , for arresting without warrants .
I 'd like to say they should be indicted for lying but believe it or not , unless you 're under oath , lying is not a crime .
At least not an indictable crime .
It 's a moral crime .
Nader :
So you think George W. Bush and Dick Cheney should even though they 've left office , they have n't escaped the criminal laws , they should be indicted and prosecuted ?
Napolitano :
The evidence in this book and in others , our colleague the great Vincent Bugliosi has amassed an incredible amount of evidence .
The purpose of this book was not to amass that evidence but I do discuss it , is overwhelming when you compare it to the level of evidence required for a normal indictment that George W. Bush as President and Dick Cheney as Vice President participated in criminal conspiracies to violate the federal law and the guaranteed civil liberties of hundreds , maybe thousands of human beings .
Image caption Teams have been taking bodies to mass graves outside the devastated village
The bodies of some of the scores of people killed in a fuel truck explosion in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been buried in mass graves .
At least 230 people were killed when the overturned oil tanker exploded and sparked a fire in Sange village .
Some of those who died were trying to collect leaking fuel but others were trapped inside buildings , including a cinema , by the blaze .
UN peacekeepers , aid workers and troops have been helping the injured .
As Saturday wore on , Red Cross teams carried bodies wrapped in plastic sheeting to two mass graves outside the village , the Associated Press reports .
Jean - Claude Kibala , South Kivu 's vice - governor , said scenes in the village were " terrible " .
" There are lots of dead bodies on the streets .
The population is in terrible shock - no - one is crying or speaking , " he said .
' Warning ignored '
The accident happened late on Friday in Sange , about 70 km ( 40 miles ) south of the town of Bukavu in South Kivu , near the border with Burundi .
FUEL TANKER DISASTERS
October 2009 :
At least 70 people burnt to death when tanker explodes in Anambra state , Nigeria , setting fire to minibuses
November 2008 : Tanker overturns and explodes in Ghana , killing at least 22 as people scoop up fuel
August 2008 : Similar incident kills dozens of villagers in explosion in northern Cameroon
January 2008 : Dozens of people reported dead as tanker explodes near Port Harcourt , Nigeria
March 2007 : Up to 100 dead in blast after trying to collect fuel from broken - down tanker in Nigeria 's Kaduna State
The truck , travelling from Tanzania , overturned and began leaking fuel .
" Petrol began to leak out but instead of fleeing people came to collect the fuel , " Tondo Sahizira , 28 , told AFP news agency .
" A few minutes later there was an explosion , flames burst from the truck and spread very quickly . "
Bedide Mwasha said that five Pakistani peacekeepers had urged people to leave the area " but people refused to leave " .
" Men , women and children , even [ government ] soldiers were stealing petrol , " the 45 - year - old Sange resident said .
Several homes with thatched roofs were engulfed in flames , as was a cinema where a crowd had gathered to watch the World Cup .
" My children were watching the football match in the cinema and then they ran out to see the petrol , " Kiza Ruvinira told Reuters news agency .
" I went out to see what happened and I found my three children 's bodies myself .
I do n't know how to go on . "
Madnodje Mounoubai , a spokesman for the UN peacekeeping mission , said the latest death toll was 230 , with another 196 people injured .
The Red Cross said that at least 61 children and 36 women were among the dead .
Peacekeepers helped evacuate dozens of the injured to hospitals in towns of Bukavu and Uvira .
Congolese troops have also been sent to Sange help survivors .
The UN's acting special representative to Congo , Leila Zerrougui , said the UN would " do everything possible to help authorities and assist victims " .
Even during the initial period when divorce rates were increasing , several positive trends accompanied the transition to no -fault .
The economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers of the University of Pennsylvania report that states that adopted no - fault divorce experienced a decrease of 8 to 16 percent in wives ’ suicide rates and a 30 percent decline in domestic violence .
Social changes always involve trade - offs .
Unilateral divorce increases the risk that a partner who invests in her ( or more rarely , his ) marriage rather than in her own earning power , and does not engage in “ bad behavior , ” may suffer financially as well as emotionally if the other partner unilaterally ends the marriage .
When courts have not taken this sacrifice into account in dividing property , homemakers have been especially disadvantaged .
Fairer division of marital assets can reduce the severity of this problem .
And fault can certainly be taken into account in determining spousal support if domestic violence or other serious marital misbehavior has reduced the other party ’s earning power .

Still , the ability of one partner to get a divorce over the objections of the other may create an atmosphere in which people think twice before making sacrifices that will be costly if the marriage ends .
Professor Stevenson found that in states that allow unilateral divorce , individuals tend to be slightly less likely to invest in marriage - related capital , like putting the partner through school , and more likely to focus on building individual , portable capital , like pursuing their own education or job experience .
Unilateral divorce has decreased the bargaining power of the person who wants the marriage to last and has not engaged in behavior that meets the legal definition of fault .
On the other hand , it has increased the bargaining power of the person who is willing to leave .
So while some marriages end more quickly than they otherwise would , other couples enter marital counseling because one partner ’s threat of divorce convinces the other that it is time to work seriously on the relationship .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , it is more often the wife than the husband who is ready to leave .
Approximately two - thirds of divorces  including those that come late in life  are initiated by wives .
Paula England , a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families , found that surveys that separately ask divorced wives and husbands which one wanted the divorce confirm that more often it was the woman who wanted out of the marriage .
This jibes with research showing that women are physiologically and emotionally more sensitive to unsatisfactory relationships .
My Vision of a Free Internet April 17 , 2010
Recently on reddit there ’s been some discussion of free ( as in freedom ) alternatives to the current internet structure .
As of now , the only systems to connect people globally via computer networks are hierarchical and state - controlled , even if they are powered by free software .
There are a few localized alternatives ( mesh networks ) , but they typically are very local and depend on non-free software ( at low levels of the wireless stack ) .
I think that the level of focus on wireless systems is probably a bad idea .
As a reddit commenter pointed out ( not that I wholly agree ) :
Wireless networks are a fad and a terrible idea .
They ’re easy to
legislate against , easy for the police to locate , easy to
passively intercept , easy to perform MITM attacks , etc .
I think that the best non-hierarchical internet would be created using existing technologies and protocols – they ’ve served us well in the past and there ’s no indication that they wo n’t in the future .
The only thing that needs to change is the methods of organizing those systems .
Today the LAN …
Starting Out
Rather than being based on wireless systems like mesh networking , local networks should be wired .
I like to think this would start on the house or apartment level , where a group of ( radically - minded ) roommates strings Ethernet through their living space .
Now , instantly , they all have high - bandwidth links to each other – and take note , the " high " in that " high bandwidth " is far beyond anything you could buy from an ISP in the United States , if you ’re a person who is not fantastically rich .
Of course , all those high - bandwidth connections are useless if you are n’t doing anything with them .
In corporate America ’s ideal scenario , people are passive consumers , put into little nesting boxes and fed content from elite sources .
They are forbidden from creating and sharing between themselves .
Free Software and free culture rejects this by explicitly permitting and encouraging redistribution and remixing , and this p2p direction is the one that the world should certainly be going in .
So , the next step is to create some sort of local infrastructure wherein people are encouraged to share with each other .
The most obvious is a multi- terabyte file server , where people can store extra-legally shared data on such that everyone in the space has access to it .
That ’s one example , but really , anything people can put on a server and run is fair game .
Spreading out
After individual living units are fully internetworked , they should approach others in their neighborhood / building / vicinity and invite them to join .
There are two ways to do this : extending the existing network to accommodate the new computers on it , or create a new network in the other space and connect it to the first .
The former approach should be preferred , since it allows for a more fully connected system – instead of one link between the two networks , there ’s One Big Network .
The other advantage of the One Big Network approach is that it encourages people to share internet connections , rather than creating two ( or more ) connections out of the internal network – one for the main Internet pipe and one for the community network .
This is typically against ISP ’s terms of service – however , below a certain threshold there is n’t a reasonable way for ISPs to detect this .
Two households can afford a lot more internet ( especially if redundant high - bandwidth activities are eliminated , like downloading the same movie twice ) together than they can alone , and sharing this resource promotes solidarity and community .
Taking over
Hopefully , this network would spread across its local area .
A block of houses might be internetworked , an apartment floor ( or even building ! ) could be internetworked , and so on .
This should promote local community – if it does n’t , it ’s being done wrong .
Large local networks would have a lot of benefits for the users .
The infrastructure required to route data would be significant , which implies that the community has dedicated " tech people " .
These people can set up services beyond merely routing traffic in and out of the network – services which the users can trust as they trust their community .
Further , this is a much more secure system in terms of certain types of capitalist - forbidden sharing , because most sharing will occur within the extended LAN , rather than on the corporate internet .
This will lead to an increase in forbidden sharing , and as such , an increase in solidarity , as community members help each other violate laws for their mutual gain .
This creates a social system wherein people are encouraged to share data with each other , and to create or remix .
It increases the visibility of running sophisticated computer systems – instead of a SysAd ’min god-king running The Networke , it ’s just the dude on the third floor , or the woman in the house on the left .
Most importantly , it creates a social system within which federated network services have a real place – there is a very real reason to use the local GNU Social node instead of the http://daisycha.in node because you can trust the operator and have a direct line of communication to them .
Tomorrow the world !
Spinning the Grassroots Web
So now we have our fully internetworked apartment building , house block , whatever .
The next step towards creating a free Internet is connecting those extended LANs .
The boundary of the extended LAN should be the farthest reaches of trust .
We should n’t fall into the trap of thinking in terms of physical structures – arbitrary housing blocks or apartment buildings could be in a single extended LAN , provided that the users within those networks are near enough to the administrators to trust them .
When the users in a given LAN no longer can reasonably trust the administrator , they are part of two different communities .
At that point , instead of extending the LAN , a new LAN should be created containing the second community , and the two extended LANs should bridge into each others networks .
Depending on how close the two LANs are , this can be done in a variety of ways .
For geospatially close LANs , the bridge could just be a few Ethernet cables .
For farther LANs , the bridge could be directional wireless internet .
LANs could even bridge over the hierarchical Internet by way of a VPN .
This bridge will represent the highest possible bandwidth between the two communities – administrators should keep that in mind .
Bridges should not be trusted – they inherently lie outside of both communities and should be treated as such .
As a result traffic over the bridges should always be encrypted in a safe and as future - proof as possible manner .
Six Degrees of Solidarity
While geospatial proximity is generally a good indicator of trust and community - ness , it should n’t be over - relied on .
There are other levels of trust , and when building a solidarity - based routed network , those should be taken into account .
The best way to do that is to trust human networks .
Just as we can set up point - to - point encrypted bridges between local communities and achieve a high - bandwidth link , we can set up point - to - point encrypted bridges between remote communities and achieve a lower - bandwidth but equal - trust link .
Over time , this will create a small - world network : a graph of networks linked to other networks where there are , on average , a very low number of edges between any given two nodes .
Take that in for a minute : Humans automatically create decentralized networks that scale all over the world .
This gives us reason to be hopeful about the prospects for a decentralized Internet .
Pulling it off
The technologies needed to accomplish these goals already exist and will only become more available over time .
To deal with allocating our own IP ( internet protocol ) addresses without the oversight of the centralized governing bodies of the hierarchical Internet , communities should use IPv6 , which has enough addresses per person as a metric ton of elemental carbon has atoms .
With IPv6 , communities could pick addresses virtually at random and have some assurance that there were no collisions .
Also , IP v6 includes IPSEC , a standard which assures that all traffic between hosts can be encrypted at the IP level .
Connecting networks via an encrypted link is the very definition of a VPN .
About a half - dozen free software VPN implementations exist – communities can choose a system which works for them .
Systems for making centralized high - capacity file servers have existed for as long as computers , but by donating a portion of their hard drive and using systems like GNUnet , Freenet , or Tahoe - LAFS , users can pool their hard drive space to create distributed and encrypted storage systems .
With GNUnet and Freenet , data can be automatically shared across the network , and accessed / stored anonymously , so even a person from inside the network ca n’t identify to whom a given file belongs .
A variety of services typically delegated to centralized or hierarchical systems have decentralized and federated equivalents .
For instance , instead of the non-free AIM , MSN , YIM , or ICC instant messaging systems , users on a free Internet could use Jabber / XMPP , and instead of using Facebook or MySpace , communities could have local GNU Social or Elgg instances .
Conclusion
The software needed to create a free Internet is free as in freedom , and exists now .
The hardware needed to create a free Internet is readily available , as refuse from digital overconsumption or from shared pre-existing computing resources .
The most pressing limiting factor is not hardware or software , but political will on behalf of those wishing to create a free world with a free Internet .
It is this issue that those concerned with a free Internet should first concern themselves with .

Supporting the Prisoners of the G20 Police State
by Peter Gelderloos
Reposted from Counterpunch.org .
This week , my mind is with the sixteen Canadians who will be transported between their maximum security jail cells and the court to determine whether they will be held in prison until trial or released on extremely restrictive bail conditions .
They are accused of organizing the protests against the elite G20 summit of world leaders that took place in Toronto at the end of June .
At these protests , thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to specific policies of these twenty leading world governments or in negation of the global political and economic system in its entirety .
Protestors enacted their disagreement and outrage in a variety of ways that included protest , counterinformation , and property destruction targeting the summit security forces and several major corporations .
In all , over 1000 people were arrested during three days of protest , many of them detained based on their appearance , put in cages , sexually harassed or assaulted , injured , denied food , water , legal and medical attention , and otherwise abused .
Of those thousand plus detainees , these sixteen are facing the heaviest charges , accused of conspiracy as the supposed ringleaders of the mayhem .
Some of them were arrested in early morning raids , forced half - naked out of bed at gunpoint , assembled on their lawns and handcuffed in the pre-dawn darkness , and hauled off to jail .
Others were picked up while biking or walking around town , sometimes by plainclothes cops making lightning grabs , a tactic perfected by the Stalinist police ( the cops are internationalists , you see , and their methods for control travel across borders with much greater ease than they allow the rest of us ) .
None of this should be surprising .
Powerful men in suits convening to discuss world problems ; heavily armed police kicking down a door and sticking a gun in your face — this is the most ordinary juxtaposition imaginable in a democratic society .
The G20 , just like the G8 and just like the International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organization and just like capitalism as a whole , is an act of exclusion , and when the stakes are this high , exclusion is always a violent thing .
The governments that compose the G20 , like all governments everywhere , base their power on forcibly excluding anyone else from making decisions that affect their lives .
When the G20 convene to talk about global warming or financial crises — problems which they largely created , which they profit from immensely , and which they will escape the worst effects of — they are not making decisions in any positive sense , so much as preventing all the rest of us from addressing teose problems Unfortunately , the policies of the G20 , and the tactical question of the protests against it , generally appear as separate issues in the progressive alternative media .
But in reality , it is impossible to draw a line between the harmful consequences of governmental and corporate policy , the elitist way in which they determine that policy , and the extreme level of police control that accompany their summits .
The fact that the global economy functions simply to keep capital moving , regardless of who is harmed in the process , the fact that elite institutions and politicians can respond to capitalist crisis by funneling billions to the banks and kicking normal people out of their houses , and the fact that people who protest this are surveilled and brutalized through a program of counterterrorism , are all aspects of the same truth : being robbed of our ability to live with health and dignity and being prohibited from intervening in our own lives are the same thing .
The gun in the face and the televised speech are two motions in the same process .
Because this kind of authority always provokes resistance , another fundamental process of authority is not to beat down resistance so much as to discipline it to follow the rules .
So , RBC can fund gentrification and oil drilling , British Petroleum can kill their workers and destroy the Gulf of Mexico , border guards can murder immigrants , cops can torture youths , the normal functioning of the Canadian economy can murder over three times as many people through workplace “ accidents ” as are claimed by homicides , but if protestors smash a bank window or light a cop car on fire , they are denounced as violent .
And above all , this operation is carried out by fellow protestors , who echo the media and Canadian politicians in describing the property destruction that occurred in downtown Toronto as a tragedy .
But downtown Toronto already was a tragedy .
What more human response could there be to a financial district — an urban space devoid of life , deprived of affordable rents , scoured of autonomous livelihoods , subordinated to the needs of traffic and commerce , held under the eye of surveillance cameras , occupied by police , and plagued with corporate outlets and banks — than to destroy it ?
Yet curiously , a chorus of liberals are reproducing the tired lie that only agent provocateurs could possibly be audacious enough to attack the system , that the Black Bloc is comprised partially or entirely of infiltrators .
I can assure these liberals that there are thousands of anarchists in North America who would love to trash a police car or a bank .
There are millions of other people who would love to do these things as well .
The fact that so many liberals denounced these actions would suggest that liberals , along with rich people , are one of the few demographics who do n't harbor any rancor for cops or banks , or that they are the political equivalent of Victorians , suppressing their appreciation of something that is both healthy and necessary .
This level of denial reminds me of the hacks who decried the violence in the Canadian newspapers , speaking of provocations by an irresponsible minority , while the accompanying photographs , careful to always to show only individuals or small groups damaging property , could not hide the huge crowds gathering around the delinquents , composed of unmasked , normally dressed people , taking pictures and smiling as they watched the destruction .
Those bystanders knew what anyone who is still human knows well : that a burning cop car is a beautiful thing .
Anarchists are great organizers : some of us participate in the community groups you admire , set up the alternative media you rely on , arrange housing and logistics for the protests you attend , carry out the direct actions that revitalize the campaigns that are important to you .
It should be safe to assume that at least sometimes we could manage to commit a little property destruction without the help of police infiltrators .
It might also be safe to suggest that those dissidents who mirror the police and politicians in their sycophantic denunciation of “ violence ” share some other points in common with the authorities .
Namely , they assist in the same project of democratic government , which is to convince people to participate in their own exploitation , whether through elections or profit - sharing or whatever other gimmick , and to insist on the validity of rules that will always be applied more harshly to us than to the elite .
The pragmatic justification is that the violence distracts from the real issues , but it is long past the point where we have to recognize that the media will never talk about the issues , except to allow them to be reframed for the benefit of the economy and the government .
This police operation only works if dissidents participate .
If we continue to focus on the reasons for fighting back against the system by whatever means , and there will always be an uncontrollable diversity of means in a diverse struggle , then there will be no distraction , except for the distraction of the corporate media , which is ever present .
Either the media will pull their hair out about our violence , or they will turn the spotlight on the latest celebrity news , the latest politician 's speech .
To talk about anything else , anything real , is up to us .
To talk about broken windows when the G20 come to town is to participate in a policing operation that has our doors broken in and guns pointed in our faces , regardless of whether we justify this collaboration with a discourse of nonviolence or one of security .
It is to contradict even that most tepid of progressive clichés : people over profit .
To consider questions of guilt or innocence in the case of these sixteen people facing conspiracy charges is to indulge in all the hypocrisy of a judge , a prosecutor , or a cop .
It does n't matter that most of these people were already arrested when the property destruction occurred , and it does n't matter that they did n't lead any conspiracies because we anarchists do n't have leaders , and we certainly do n't need them to carry out a little bit of vandalism .
What matters is that when all those workers died , when all those people were evicted , when all that money was taken from us by the banks , when all those bombs fell , when all that air and water were poisoned , no one in power was punished and it did n't matter whether rules were broken or followed .
To speak of rules and laws is to perpetuate one of the greatest lies of our society .
What matters is that a great many more banks and cop cars will have to be thrown on the trash fire of history before we can talk about a new world , so we 'd better stop getting so upset by such a modest show of resistance .
What matters is that the $ 1.3 billion security budget that accompanied the G20 summit is not a concern of the past .
The police still have all that new crowd control weaponry and training , and they still have yet another experience of grinding their boot in our face and getting rewarded for it , while we have yet another experience of putting up with total surveillance and control , of being disciplined to get used to it .
This is their vision of the future : cops and security cameras everywhere , preemptive arrests for simply planning or talking about resistance , people with masks or spraypaint or eye wash for the teargas being treated as terrorists .
We can either get used to this future , and continue to believe in the validity of their rules , or we can fight back .
For just as there is no difference between dispossession and disempowerment , there can be no line between opposing what the G20 stand for and showing solidarity to those who have been arrested for fighting against it .
One of the best ways to keep up the pressure on the banks , the oil companies , the war profiteers , the media , and the politicians , is to support those who are facing charges for organizing resistance .
Because none of us are free until all of us are free .

Peter Gelderloos is the author of How Nonviolence Protects the State .
Last month Turks found they could not access many Google services .
YouTube is already banned .
The BBC's Jonathan Head looks at this brewing battle between Turkey and one of the giants of the internet .
Image caption Ataturk Mausoleum : Turkey bans abuse against its founding father
Sitting in an Istanbul cafe Ozan Tuzun taps away furiously on the keyboard of his laptop , trying to break the invisible walls that surround him .
" I 'm going to DNS.com now to take one of their numbers … I enter it … no that did n't work .
Right let 's try to get a DNS from Google … no… ok we 'll try Ktunnel … "
What Ozan is doing - and it takes him about 10 minutes - is something most of us can do in just seconds .
He wants to watch YouTube .
And he is an expert , a technology buff ; most people trying the same thing from Turkey would give up .
" It 's very frustrating , it makes me feel like I 'm living in a third world country , " he says .
The ban on YouTube was imposed by a court in Ankara on 5 May 2008 , after a series of 17 temporary bans the preceding year .
The grounds by the courts given each time varied , but they followed a number of complaints from Turkish citizens about videos on YouTube deemed insulting to Kemal Ataturk , the country 's revered first president .
Crimes against Ataturk
In 2007 the government passed a sweeping law regulating the internet , known as Law No 5651 .
It allows a court to block any website where there is " sufficient suspicion " that a crime has occurred .
The eight crimes listed include child pornography , gambling , prostitution , and " crimes against Ataturk " .
Insulting or denigrating Ataturk was already a crime .
The Turkish government refuses to publish statistics , but campaigners for internet freedom estimate that more than 4,000 websites are currently blocked , making internet censorship in Turkey amongst the heaviest in the world .
We paid for three years so we would n't have to worry about our server fees , and it turns out ... we paid for a blocked account Ozlem Pekel , Co-founder of graphic design house Bravoistanbul
" For years I wrote about China and Middle Eastern countries that tried to censor the internet , " says Serdar Kuzuloglu , the technology editor for Radikal newspaper , " but I could never imagine that one day I would be writing the same things about my own country . "
" The blocking process is very unclear .
There are eight categories of crimes which allow the courts to block a site , but it can also come from an individual complaint .
" It 's very difficult to find the responsible person . "
No warning
So when , in addition to YouTube , many of Google 's other popular services became impossible to access recently , it was difficult to know who had ordered it .
A court ?
The Information Technologies Authority in Ankara , responsible for enforcing bans ?
There was no warning .
Everyday tools like Google Maps and Google Analytics relied on by thousands of small businesses were blocked .
Image caption
This is all that people in Turkey see when they try to access YouTube
Companies like top graphic design house Bravoistanbul suddenly found they could not access their e-mails or their office server .
" You can't imagine that something like this could happen , " says Ozlem Pekel , one of the company 's founders .
" We paid for three years so we would n't have to worry about our server fees , and it turns out we paid for nothing - we paid for a blocked account .
" And it 's Google !
It just shows you how much respect the government has for us , the taxpayers . "
It turns out that the Turkish authorities blocked a number of IP addresses they thought were being used to access YouTube , but which had been reconfigured by Google for other services as well .
But there is confusion because the government also accuses Google of not registering as a company in Turkey and paying local taxes .
Google runs its European operations , which include Turkey , out of Ireland , and pays most of its taxes there .
The fact that it does not pay tax in other countries is already a source of criticism , but Turkey is the first country to wield the stick of censorship over the issue .
Two different Turkeys
The government 's position gets even more confusing when people recall that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan confessed that he regularly found ways around the YouTube ban , and encouraged others to do the same .
President Abdullah
Gul put a message on Twitter recently saying he was " definitely against " YouTube and Google services being blocked .
I am not bothered by the impact of the court decision Tansel Colacan , Chairwoman of Ataturk Thought Association
There are two different Turkeys talking here .
There is Istanbul , buzzing with entrepreneurial activity and cultural life , where people aspire to European levels of wealth and freedom .
And there is the capital Ankara , a city of bureaucrats , the centre of military and political power .
Ankara is where nearly all the internet restrictions emanate .
The city is dominated by the austere , neo-classical mausoleum of the founding father Ataturk , where people line up every day to pay their respects to modern Turkey 's founding father .
Not far from the mausoleum , in a nondescript residential building , is the office of the Ataturk Thought Association , an organisation dedicated to protecting the secular heritage of the first president .
They have been behind many of the complaints against Google , YouTube and other websites .
Tansel Colacan is the formidable chairwoman of the association , a retired senior judge .
And she is unapologetic about the impact of her complaints .
" For us Ataturk is a symbol of democracy and women 's emancipation , " she says .
" This is about respect for him .
I am not bothered by the impact of the court decision . "
At the offices of the Information Technologies Authority , when asked whether blocking sensitive material was more important than the well - being of thousands of small businesses , there was a more nuanced response .
" If you ask me as a personal question , my answer would be different , " said Osman Nihat , head of the Internet Department .
" But as a government person I would say this is a court decision , and there is a law .
I have to apply the court decision and the law .
Those are insulting videos - they should see this and obey , " he added .
Google has said in a statement that it pays all the taxes it is legally required to pay , and that the Turkish government is asking it to remove offensive material from all YouTube sites , and not just to restrict access to it from Turkey .
Its services have now been blocked or restricted for a month , with no solution in sight .
Leaked documents from the Afghanistan war appear to confirm that Australian forces are backing a local war lord who has been extorting money from NATO convoys carrying supplies to Coalition forces .
Australian troops are working with Matiullah Khan , a powerful war lord in the southern Uruzgan province .
Matiullah , through his private militia , earns millions of dollars a year guarding NATO road convoys and he commands a militia of over 2,000 armed men .
According to Matiullah himself , he works closely with the Australian forces in Uruzgan .
" The Australians have changed their tactics , they were going on missions alone .
The Australians did not know about the Afghan traditions .
Now we work together , " he said .
" For the last six to eight months I have given them my soldiers .
Since then there has n't been any problems in the whole province and nobody has been angry with the Australians . "
But according to a report in the intelligence database leaked to the Wikileaks organisation , Matiullah 's men were caught red - handed in an extortion attempt on the very road they were paid to protect in late November 2009 .
A NATO fuel convoy reported it had been held up by a group of 100 insurgents armed with heavy machine guns .
They demanded payment of $ 3,000 for each truck to pass and eventually it became clear that they were not insurgents , but Matiullah 's militia .
US forces sent two helicopters and an armoured convoy to negotiate , but Matiullah refused to budge , saying he needed the money to run his operation .
Six hours later , after many desperate calls to government officials in Kabul , he let the convoy through without payment .
The Australian Defence Force has refused to comment on any extortion attempts by Matiullah Khan , but said that he is an influential figure in the Uruzgan community and Australian troops engage with him on this basis .
It comes after a US government report released last month labelled Afghan security companies and private militias a " vast protection racket " .
According to Dr Zalmai Zabuli , head of the Parliamentary Complaints Committee of Meshrano Jirga , the companies even resort to paying insurgents to attack the convoys , to make their services more valuable .
" In this case usually the leaders of the security company are paying the money for the Taliban or other local people to attack the convoys , to show the foreigners that if you do n't pay for us , then there 's a lot of problems that can be created , " he said .
There are also concerns that security companies have spawned a whole new range of war lords , growing rich on the huge inflow of foreign cash .
Wardak Governor Muhammad Haleem
Fedayee says the security companies are making the country far more dangerous .
" The complaints are there about the security companies assisting the Taliban , " he said .
" Also on the other side we also receive reports and complaints from the public that there is a negative competition among the security companies themselves .
They are sometimes attacking each other . "
US politicians are becoming increasingly concerned that the massive amounts of money they are pumping into the Afghan economy could actually be fuelling the insurgency .
In the United States , questioning Israel is rarely a wise political move , and even suggesting an alternative to the policy of choice for whatever government is in power there at any given time is often enough to provoke angry responses from much of the US Congress , not to mention protests in Israel .
But increasingly officials are admitting , if not altogether publicly , that Israel ’s current right - far - right government is abusing its “ untouchable ” status and becoming a considerable liability for US foreign policy makers .
Though there are innumerable instances of this abuse , including the serious damage Israel has done to US - Turkish relations recently , the biggest issue for many in the administration appears to be President Obama ’s push for Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
The talks are n’t entirely popular with everyone in Israel ’s current government , and in many cases the announcement of new settlements seems to be timed specifically to do maximum damage to the indirect peace talks brokered by the US .
This has led in at least one case to a complete abandonment of the talks , which took the US months to restart .
More new settlements are being announced all the time , and it seems only a matter of time before the Palestinians take the hint and pull out of the talks again .
When that happens , Israel will insist the Palestinians are entirely to blame , and a number of members of the US government will parrot this claim publicly .
Privately , however , it seems a growing number are seeing beyond their own rhetoric , and sooner or later it seems this must be reflected in a policy change .
Here 's a little experiment .
You know " Greensleeves " — the famous English folk song ?
Go ahead and hum it to yourself .
Now choose the emotion you think the song best conveys : ( a ) happiness , ( b ) sadness , ( c ) anger or ( d ) fear .
Almost everyone thinks " Greensleeves " is a sad song — but why ?
Apart from the melancholy lyrics , it 's because the melody prominently features a musical construct called the minor third , which musicians have used to express sadness since at least the 17th century .
The minor third 's emotional sway is closely related to the popular idea that , at least for Western music , songs written in a major key ( like " Happy Birthday " ) are generally upbeat , while those in a minor key ( think of The Beatles ' " Eleanor Rigby " ) tend towards the doleful .
The tangible relationship between music and emotion is no surprise to anyone , but a study in the June issue of Emotion suggests the minor third is n't a facet of musical communication alone — it 's how we convey sadness in speech , too .
When it comes to sorrow , music and human speech might speak the same language .
In the study , Meagan Curtis of Tufts University 's Music Cognition Lab recorded undergraduate actors reading two - syllable lines — like " let 's go " and " come here " — with different emotional intonations : anger , happiness , pleasantness and sadness ( listen to the recordings here ) .
She then used a computer program to analyze the recorded speech and determine how the pitch changed between syllables .
Since the minor third is defined as a specific measurable distance between pitches ( a ratio of frequencies ) , Curtis was able to identify when the actors ' speech relied on the minor third .
What she found is that the actors consistently used the minor third to express sadness .
" Historically , people have n't thought of pitch patterns as conveying emotion in human speech like they do in music , " Curtis said .
" Yet for sad speech there is a consistent pitch pattern .
The aspects of music that allow us to identify whether that music is sad are also present in speech . "
Curtis also synthesized musical intervals from the recorded phrases spoken by actors , stripping away the words , but preserving the change in pitch .
So a sad " let 's go " would become a sequence of two tones .
She then asked participants to rate the degree of perceived anger , happiness , pleasantness and sadness in the intervals .
Again , the minor third consistently was judged to convey sadness .
A possible explanation for why music and speech might share the same code for expressing emotion is the idea that both emerged from a common evolutionary predecessor , dubbed " musilanguage " by Steven Brown , a cognitive neuroscientist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby ( Vancouver ) , British Columbia .
But Curtis points out that right now there is no effective means of empirically testing this hypothesis or determining whether music or language evolved first .
What also remains unclear is whether the minor third 's influence spans cultures and languages , which is one of the questions that Curtis would like to explore next .
Previous studies have shown that people can accurately interpret the emotional content of music from cultures different than their own , based on tempo and rhythm alone .
" I have only looked at speakers of American English , so it's an open question whether it's a phenomenon that exists specifically in American English or across cultures , " Curtis explained .
" Who knows if they are using the same intervals in , say , Hindi ? "

Volkswagen chairman Dr. Martin Winterkorn has clearly reiterated the company ’s position on electric cars saying that we will see an all electric Volkswagen Golf in 2013 .
Interestingly he also alluded to not compromising on vehicle range , this is currently a big problem with lithium - ion batteries , and would potentially indicate that the VW partnerships with Toshiba and Samsung on battery technology may have made some technological steps forward that have not been made public yet .
Dr. Winterkorn was clear on one point , that Volkswagen cars would undergo a serious weightloss feat utilising ultralight materials like carbon fibre and magnesium .
Volkswagen do have a number of hybrid models on the road currently and are planning to extend their hybrid line up although they have made it clear that they consider hybrids to be a “ bridging ” technology and their strategy calls for an eventual 100 % electric vehicle model line .
VW are on target to be the worlds number 1 vehicle manufacturer by 2018 and in order to attain that position they ’ll need to have at least one foot planted firmly in the rapidly growing electric and hybrid electric vehicle marketplace .
Courage and Consequence : My Life as a Conservative in the Fight by Karl Rove Threshold , 596 pp. , $ 30.00
Karl Rove grew up in Colorado , Nevada , and Utah .
As a student at the University of Utah he joined the College Republicans .
He worked on the 1972 Nixon campaign , and has often been described as a “ protégé ” of Donald Segretti , the virtuoso of dirty tricks who went to jail as a Watergate conspirator .
Whatever the nature of Rove ’s contact with Segretti , the fate of Nixon ’s advisers , campaign organizers , and tricksters doubtless formed a subject of meditation for him in the years 2004 –2006 , when he found himself threatened with indictment by a special prosecutor .
The name of Donald Segretti appears nowhere in the present book .
Rove blames himself for a dirty trick at the start of his career .
In 1970 , he got hold of an invitation to the opening of the campaign headquarters of Alan Dixon , a Democratic candidate for Illinois state treasurer , and used it to counterfeit a flyer : “ Free Beer , Free Food , Girls , and A Good Time for Nothing . ”
The fake invitation spelled out the time and place of the actual opening of the headquarters , and Rove handed out his forgery to “ vagrants , homeless , and drifters , ” as he puts it , “ in bad parts of downtown Chicago and at a free rock concert in Grant Park . ”
He pleads guilty to the misstep but he says it had no successor .
He denies that there was ever a poll in the 2000 South Carolina primary in which voters were asked : “ Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child ? ”
Rove ’s general advice on running a political campaign is pragmatic .
You have to answer the question “ Why elect your guy ? ”
He thinks this means that his approach is not essentially negative , but of course it can end up that way — if , for example , the typical ad closes by saying “ Because my guy loves his country . ”
The ads that Rove still defends for Saxby Chambliss , who defeated the Georgia senator and Vietnam veteran Max Cleland in 2002 , followed precisely that strategy .
They juxtaposed images of Cleland with images of Osama bin Laden .
To justify his party ’s tactics , Rove resorts to a sophistry : no slander was conveyed , he says , since many seconds of montage separated the images of bin Laden from the images of Cleland .
Interspersed with the self - acquittals are judgments of a cleverer sort that show why Karl Rove & Company was a highly prosperous consulting firm in the years between 1981 and 1999 .
Thus Rove recalls how Robert Dole in 1996 asked voters whether they would feel more comfortable leaving their children with him or with Bill Clinton .
“ Were voters supposed to be impressed with that ? ” asks Rove .
It was a cheap attack that nobody could associate with a particular irritant .
“ To be successful , ” he explains , “ an attack must be perceived as both fair and relevant , backed with credible evidence , …

You 've finally been convinced that opening a Roth IRA is a good idea , and you 've decided to take the plunge .
Great !
But what 's next ?
How do you open an account , and where are some good places to hold your Roth IRA ?
Today I 'd like to cover the basics of opening a Roth IRA and look at a few good low cost brokerages where you can keep your account .
Continues after Advertisement
Take Care Of The Basics Before Your Roth IRA
Before we even jump into the basics of opening a Roth IRA , I suggest that you first get the rest of your financial house in order .
That means doing the following things :
Save up an emergency fund :
We 've saved up 12 months of expenses to cover just about any eventuality that might come up .
I 'd suggest you save at the bare minimum $ 1000 , but even better – 3 - 6 months of expenses .
: We 've saved up 12 months of expenses to cover just about any eventuality that might come up .
I 'd suggest you save at the bare minimum $ 1000 , but even better – 3 - 6 months of expenses .
Pay off all debt : I suggest you pay off all debt that you might have .
If you do n't any gains you might realize by investing will be offset by large debt interest payments .
Get it paid off ASAP !
Once you 've paid off all your debt and saved for a rainy day , you 're probably read to start investing .
At our house we follow the Dave Ramsey plan – but not to the letter .
He suggests investing 15 % of income .
We 're going to invest closer to 20 - 25 % .
So what 's an easy way to get started investing ?
When you 've paid off all your debt , take the money you were paying on that debt , and instead start investing it .
My suggestion for investing is as follows .
Invest in a company 401 ( k ) or other employer sponsored plan up until the match ( 100 % return ! ) .
After the match switch over to the Roth IRA ( which we 're talking about today ! ) .
After the Roth IRA switch back over to your 401 ( k ) until it is maxed out .
So again – this is the order :
401 ( k ) til employer match is reached .
Roth IRA til maxed out .
401 ( k ) ( or other plan ) til maxed .
How To Open A Roth IRA
Opening a Roth IRA should n't take very long , and in most cases can actually be done in a half hour to an hour .
When opening an account usually you 'll need the following information – although it may vary a bit from institution to institution .
Social security number .
Bank account information .
Information about employment .
Money to open the account .
( You may need $ 25 or you may need $ 3000 depending on where you open your account . )
An hour or so .
Before you even open an account , however , you 'll need to figure out what financial institution , mutual fund firm or brokerage you want to open your account with .
Banks
Your local bank or credit union can often open up an account for your Roth IRA .
While having an account with your local bank is usually convenient , it is n't often the best option .
The reason ?
The banks usually have limited investment options for your account , usually limited to CDs , money market funds , and other cash accounts .
The fees they charge are also often higher than the fees you would find with a discount brokerage or full service mutual fund firm .
Full Service Mutual Fund Firms
Full service mutual fund firms are typically one of the better places to start your account because they will have a nice variety of mutual fund options with low expense ratios and varied investment options .
They are quite often the best place to purchase index funds , target date retirement funds , mutual funds and similar investments .
Some of the better options that offer Traditional and Roth IRAs and many investment options include .
The downside to investing at one of these firms is that they often have minimum investments that you can make , which if you do n't have a lot to start your account with can mean you 're not able to invest with some of the companies .
Some will also charge more for individual trades , and have account management fees .
Some of these fees can be waived if you make a certain minimum investment and / or if you commit to investing a certain amount every month .
Before you sign up , make sure you know what the minimums , fees and other account terms are .
The key to opening an account with a mutual fund firm is to do your research and to know what you 're getting into .
Never invest in something you do n't understand .
Discount Brokerages & Robo Advisors
If you 're a more hands on investor or you like to invest in single stocks an online discount broker might be a good option for your account ( I like to buy index funds at a mutual fund firm and forget it myself ! ) .
Discount brokerages will allow you to access stock trades , options trades , Exchange Traded Funds ( ETFs ) , mutual funds and other assorted investments .
Individual stock trades will usually cost in the $ 2 – $ 10 range , which is probably going to be cheaper than making stock trades at a mutual fund firm listed above .
Some of the options I recommend :
Listing Of Mutual Fund Companies And Brokerages
To bring it all together , here 's a list of some of the best mutual fund companies , discount brokerages , and their fees .
Account Minimum Mutual Fund Commission Stock Commission Annual IRA Fee Reviews OptionsHouse $ 1,000 $ 9.95 $ 3.95 none OptionsHouse Review Motif Investing $ 1000 $ 9.95 ( per motif / bundle of stocks ) TD Ameritrade none $ 0 $ 9.99 none TD AmeritradeReview Zecco none $ 10 $ 4.50 $ 30 TradeKing none $ 14.95 $ 4.95 none Scottrade $ 2500 $ 17 $ 7.00 none Scottrade Review Vanguard none $ 0 $ 7.00 $ 20 tradeMONSTER none $ 15 $ 7.50 none Fidelity none $ 0 $ 7.95 none Schwab $ 1,000 ?

What To Invest In
The next most important thing to decide is what to invest in once you open your Roth IRA .
If you 're just starting out like I am I 'd probably suggest to find a good index fund and some low cost mutual funds .
If you 're newer to investing as I am or if you do n't want to be actively managing individual stocks / etc , starting out with a good index fund will probably be a good option .
Depending on which Roth IRA account custodian you choose , your options for investments may vary .
Again , do your homework , and choose one that works best for your situation .
Do you have a Roth IRA ?
What type of account custodian did you choose ( mutual fund firm , discount brokerage , bank or credit union ) ?
What types of things are you investing in ?

Audible Audience Reaction To Inception 's Ending : This Is The Sound Of Awesome
Playboy Jesus !
Jose Saramago , Portugal ’s Nobel laureate ( literature ) died last month .
Due to controversies surrounding the censorship of his work , he had moved from his home country to the Canary Islands .
Saramago was notorious for O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo ( The Gospel According to Jesus Christ ) , depicting a passionate personality full of doubt and flaws .
The story uses the framework already set out by the Biblical gospels , but goes into detail regarding the earlier years of Jesus ’ life .
At one point in the tale he becomes apprenticed to a shepherd who gives him a lesson in hedonism .
Sheep are viewed as a sexual outlet , and Jesus is encouraged to make use of this .
God is shown to be petty and jealous , ( not unlike His Old Testament persona ) and dissatisfied with being supreme deity over just one set of people .
The novel concludes with Jesus ’ realizing that God ’s plan , and the ensuing centuries of torture , slaughter , and misery that Christianity will bring , will proceed despite his efforts .
His last words from the cross are “ Men , forgive Him , for He knows not what He has done . ”
( Wikipedia article )
Naturally his iconoclasm was unappreciated by the Catholic church , who accused him of possessing a “ substantially anti-religious vision . ”
He managed to piss off the Jews as well , in effect stating that they play the self - pitying “ Holocaust card ” to trump any assertions that they themselves are behaving in a racist or exclusionary manner .
He calls them out on the racial hubris of claiming to be a “ chosen people ” , basically stating that he is just sick of their collective whining about how their suffering is / was worse than anyone else ’s- especially the Palestinians .
But I am not a Nobel laureate - here is a rant in his own words :
“ Intoxicated mentally by the messianic dream of a Greater Israel which will finally achieve the expansionist dreams of the most radical Zionism ; contaminated by the monstrous and rooted ‘ certitude ’ that in this catastrophic and absurd world there exists a people chosen by God and that , consequently , all the actions of an obsessive , psychological and pathologically exclusivist racism are justified ; educated and trained in the idea that any suffering that has been inflicted , or is being inflicted , or will be inflicted on everyone else , especially the Palestinians , Jews will always be inferior to that which they themselves suffered in the Holocaust , the endlessly scratch their own wound to keep it bleeding , to make it incurable , and they show it to the world as if it were a banner . ”
From a Madrid newspaper El País ( as translated by Paul Berman in The Forward ) on April 21 , 2002
So what does this radical freethinking literary genius have to do with Playboy ?
In his honor , the Portugese incarnation of the magazine has done a photo spread of Jesus ( well , a dude who looks a lot like him ) cavorting with topless women .
While it is true that Jesus did minister to harlots and adulteresses , would it to be wrong to wish they ’d gotten Johnny Depp to pose as Jesus ?

Inciting A ( Human ) Revolution : The Deus Ex Interview
By Chris Remo
With Deus Ex : Human Revolution , Eidos Montreal faces a similar challenge to what Bethesda Game Studios had when developing Fallout 3 .
The team is developing a modern multiplatform follow - up to a classic hardcore PC - oriented franchise whose reputation has arguably greatly exceeded its original reach in the years since release -- and in an endlessly sequelized industry , gamers default to skepticism about such projects , whether or not they were part of the series ' original fanbase .
So it 's down to Eidos Montreal to instill their intended audience with the confidence that the studio can pick up where Ion Storm Austin left off with 2000's Deus Ex and , to a lesser extent , its 2003 sequel Deus Ex : Invisible War .
The series is characterized by an extreme devotion to systems over scripting and player choice over hand - holding -- qualities that are n't always prized in an era of ballooning budgets and attempts to emulate Hollywood rollercoaster - ride action extravaganzas .
Earlier this year , Gamasutra spoke to Human Revolution 's art director Jonathan Jacques Belletete about the game 's unique cyberpunk - meets - Renaissance style .
Now , director Jean - Francois Dugas and producer David Anfossi discuss the unique challenges involved in returning to the world of Deus Ex , adjusting modern level design mentalities , and approaching narrative as part of a player - driven gameplay experience .
The original Deus Ex from Ion Storm was very much part of a lineage , a continuum of a particular kind of PC developer working within a particular design ethic .
As a new team with a different legacy , how did you approach coming in and saying , " Okay , now we have to make today 's version of that " ?
Jean - Francois Dugas :
When we started , basically we said , " You know what ?
We need to go back to the first two games and play them extensively and try to really analyze and identify what the core values were , what made those games so special . "
We did just that , and then after that , we started to work on our game .
One of the first mottos we had was to respect the core values of the story .
For us , that was really , really important , so it drove forward all our design choices for Deus Ex : Human Revolution .
Obviously , we see it as a reboot of the franchise , we see it kind of a new game , with a new character , a new story , and all that , set in the same universe with the timeline of Deus Ex .
But we really wanted to bring that great experience that Deus Ex was ten years ago to a new generation of gamers who might not know it at all , and I think that 's what we 're doing .
We 're trying to come back with the choice and consequence , the different gameplay pillars that allow players to play with a different style ; they want to be Rambo , they want to be the sneaky agent , or they want to be the tech guy -- this is what we 're doing .
It 's interesting that you describe it as a " reboot , " because it seems like a lot of the messaging so far has been to describe the game as more of a direct prequel .
JFD : We respect the timeline -- in the 2020s there were all the chemically augmented people and all of that , and that 's the era we 're exploring .
Basically , our game is a new story .
It 's a conspiracy that you have to unravel .
Of course , there are some similarities with the old Deus Ex games , and probably some tie - in .
Well , more than " probably . " [ laughs ]
Right .
In the demo I saw , you have a guy named Tong , and presumably he 's related in some way to Tracer Tong from the first game , so there must be some fairly direct connections .
JFD : With Tong , I do n't want to speak about anything , but there 's something about that character .
I do n't want to spoil anything at this point .
A lot of first - person games have become more directed and scripted , more about spectacle , in the last several years .
Games in the Deus Ex style are not very common these days .
What kind of experience have your designers had ?
Did it seem like they had to readjust their level design mentality for this ?
JFD : A little bit .
A lot of games we worked on in the past , and for a lot of other developers too , you 're used to thinking that every single bit that you build , players need to see , because it 's so expensive to be making a game .
I will spend three months on something , but if a player does n't see it -- " Oh my God , we can not do that .
We can't afford this . "
But Deus
Ex is all about the things you might miss .
At first , to be honest , it was hard to convince the team and say , " Yeah , you 're building this , " because they 'd say , " Yeah , but the player might not see it . "
It 's not about that .
What it 's about is the consequence of choice , letting them play the fantasy the way they want , letting them explore the maps and find creative ways to achieve their objectives .
This is the heart of the experience .
At some point , everybody got on board with it , but at first it was tough to get all the people on properly , because they are not used to making that kind of game .
As for the more , like you said , spectacular aspects , I think by making great systems , like cool augmentations to use and having great enemies , it 's going to give you those " wow " moments that make you think , " Oh my God -- this just worked into that , and it was really awesome , " while keeping the spirit of multiple pathways and solutions alive .
We 're trying to balance it out -- keeping what Deus Ex is and bringing in a new generation of gamers .
There are different various to player choice .
Games do it differently .
One way is branching , like the scene you showed in the demo -- you guys have decided on a number of different discretely authored options , like convincing the guy to let you through the bar , or finding a particular keycode .
Then you have the approach of just populating the world with a bunch of systems and saying , " Whatever happens , happens . "
Are you falling more in the former category ?
JFD : In that sense , since we 're going with a very detailed art direction , and we push the envelope in terms of the world art , there are not as many physics objects as in the first game .
In the first game , basically everything was a physics object .
But we do still have those , and you still can play with them , and figure out ways to use them as weapons or whatever you want .
There are some funny things we found .
We have sticky mine bombs , and during a play test back in March , one player was struggling with an enemy , and at some point , he threw a sticky mine , but then he moved forward with his gun and the sticky mine got stuck to the gun , and then he was pinned .
He was moving around and going , " Ahh ! " and then , boom !
It exploded .
[ laughs ]
We never thought about those things ; it was not part of our plan .
The day that happened was the first time I knew it was possible .
So , we still have that kind of spirit , but we put a lot of effort into the maps themselves in terms of how you can express yourself through the themes and possibilities .
It 's not just , " Hey , you have to choose to do this or that . "
It 's more subtle than that .
You just play , and you have certain situations to deal with .
Maybe if you tried something else , it would have been a different experience .
We 're trying to keep that alive in all aspects .
Even though the physics system aspect is a little bit toned down compared to the old games , it 's not to the point that it 's non-existent .
You said you 've spent a lot of time with the first two games .
How do you compare them to one another ?
As you know , Invisible War has a certain reputation among some players .
But as someone who 's looking at them from a developer 's eye to figure out what works and does n't work , what conclusions did you reach ?
JFD :
The first thing I would say is the immersiveness , if that 's a word .
The immersion of [ the first ] game was really strong .
You were this special agent , you worked for a governmental organization , and the world was really well set .
It let you play the way you wanted ; you felt very creative in the way you were solving problems .
At the time , it really stuck me -- " Whoa , this is amazing . "
That 's one of the biggest , strongest aspects of the first game .
The second game , even though a lot of people say it 's not good , actually is not bad .
I think it 's a really good game .
I mean , they toned down some things .
They did a lot of things differently that some people did n't appreciate , but when you look at , for instance , the level design -- with all the multiple paths and multiple solutions -- those aspects were more consistent in Invisible War than in Deus Ex .
Deus
Ex was really open in the first few maps , and then it started to become more and more linear with [ fewer ] options , while Invisible War did a better job at staying consistent throughout .
David Anfossi : Personally I prefer the story in the second one , but one point for me is that they lost something when they decided to remove the strong character .
You know you 're J.C. Denton in the first one , and you can pass through the story 's conspiracy with a very strong character , but you do n't have that in the second one .
For me , that was bad .
But in terms of actual story , it was very strong .
On that note , how do you approach story in this game ?
It 's often difficult to convincingly marry narrative and gameplay , especially as gameplay gets more open - ended .
JFD : Huge headache !
[ laughs ]
But seriously , we have a process where we build the story beats .
Obviously , we start with the game design -- what mechanics we want to have , what the players ' possibilities are .
Then we build the story , the eye - level story , and we split it in two story beats .
At some point , we may have seven story beats , and then we ask the question :
What is the player going to need to do to get to that point ?
Then we build the smaller stories within the main story as we go through .
We have a system -- we 're calling it the blueprint -- where we separate the idea of " What are we trying to say here ? " and " What is our objective ? "
That 's not necessarily an in - game objective , maybe it 's just what we want the player to experience .
We refine that and eventually say , " Okay , the player should retrieve this thing . "
Okay , how should he retrieve that ?
Who 's going to face them ?
We just refine it .
We have massive Excel spreadsheets that tie in what gameplay you 'll do and the story elements you need to cover .
It helps us to tie those together , because the thing we do n't want is a story that 'll ruin the gameplay .
We want players to experience them as a whole .
Obviously , if a guy spends an hour playing with a box and just trying to just jump over a thing , there 's no story there .
I mean , there 's the story of a guy struggling in a corner .
[ laughs ]
But that 's pretty much it , and we can't help it .

How to see 3D photos
Photography has an inherent limitation in that cameras typically capture images that do n’t have any true three dimensional depth .
We have two eyes , but with the exception of specialised equipment , cameras only have one lens .
There are ways to “ cheat ” however , and for almost as long as there have been cameras , there have been people trying to find ways to take and view 3D photos .
3D photography is experiencing a rush of interest and innovation , as more people experiment with better digital cameras , and a wave of new 3D movies , including the spectacular 3D epic by James Cameron , Avatar captivates audiences worldwide .
3D is the next big thing , and many want to create and see 3D photography , or stereophotography .
This article is not a history of stereophotography .
The point is to teach you how to see 3D photos on the web .
There are many different ways to see 3D , with just as many gadgets to help .
The technique I will be showing you requires no special equipment .
All you need to do is train your eyes to look at these images in what you might call an “ unnatural ” way .
WARNING : It ’s important to state right up front , that there is a small potential risk to your health with this 3D viewing technique .
The risk is very small , but I must cover myself .
If you have any known problems with your eye muscles , I recommend that you do not attempt this technique .
If you experience any light - headedness , headaches or other symptoms , STOP IMMEDIATELY and rest your eyes .
Everyone will likely experience some slight eye fatigue when learning this technique , so it is very important to rest your eyes regularly , and only look at 3D images for short periods of time .
Even once you have perfected the technique , do not over - exert your eyes .
You have been warned .
If you attempt to learn this technique , you agree not to hold me responsible for any ill fortune that befalls you as a result .
Note :
This technique will be impossible for some people .
If you have poor eye control , a dramatic disparity in eye function or anything along those lines , you may not be able to see the 3D effect no matter how much you practice .
Now that we ’ve cleared that up , lets learn how to see in 3D !
Stereo Pairs
To see a 3D image , each eye needs to see a different view .
There are ways to take photos like this , but I ’ll talk about that another time .
When the two slightly different images are processed , they are placed side - by - side so that the viewer can use a special “ crossed - eye ” technique to overlap them , and see both views together in 3D .
Below is an animation that simulates what it looks like when you view these images in 3D .
The instructions follow .
How to do it
Why crossed eyes ?
When overlapping stereo pairs without special glasses , you can get the 3D effect by crossing your eyes or diverging your eyes .
I prefer the crossed eye method .
I find it easier to control , and it is possible to view larger 3D images than with the diverging technique .
Sit square in front of your monitor , with the image directly in front of you , at about arm ’s length
Sitting further back makes it easier – you do n’t need to cross your eyes as much – but makes the image look smaller
Make sure you keep your head level horizontally , tilting your head will prevent you from merging the images
While keeping the stereo pair of images in the centre of your vision , slowly cross your eyes
The stereo pair will go out of focus and you will seem to see four images , as shown in the animation above
If you find it hard to cross your eyes , it can help to hold a pen in front of you and look at the tip with the stereo pair in the background
Gradually cross your eyes more and more – if using a pen to assist , start it close to the monitor and move it towards your nose
Continue crossing your eyes more , untill the centre two of the four images overlap and you see three blurry images , as in the animation above
Try and hold the centre image together – it is possible to “ lock ” it in place and see it as one image
The “ locked ” centre image should appear in 3D !
Now the tricky part , focus – while holding the 3D image in place , relax your eyes – drop the pen from your field of view if you are using it
If you can keep the 3D image locked and relax your eyes , it should eventually pop into focus , as in the last frame of the animation above
What you are doing here is causing your eyes to look at a space between you and the monitor , but focusing the lenses on the monitor .
Our eyes never naturally need to do this , so it can be tricky to do at first .
Try it !
Try and see the 3D effect yourself with the stereo pair below .
How did you go ?
If you were able to see the effect , congratulations !
It really is very striking is n’t it ?
If you could n’t manage to do it after trying for a while , leave it aside and try again tomorrow .
It can be tricky to get the first time , but the majority of people can do it .
If you find you are unable to see the 3D effect no matter how many times you try , then it may be that you are one of the few who for whatever reason will never be able to do it .
I have no idea why , some people can’t curl their tongues !

Q : Has President Obama taken more vacation time than his predecessors ?
A : According to one count , Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush spent more time on " vacation " during their first year than President Obama did .
Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton spent less time on " vacation . "
FULL ANSWER
President Obama has spent all or part of 26 days " on vacation " during his first year as president , according to CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller .
Knoller , who has covered every president since Gerald Ford and is known for keeping detailed records on presidential travel , counts the following among President Obama ’s " vacations " in 2009 :
A four - day holiday weekend in Chicago in February where the president played some basketball and treated First Lady Michelle Obama to a Valentine ’s Day dinner date .
An eight - day stay with his family at a rented house on Martha ’s Vineyard in August .
A trip out west to the U.S. states of Montana , Wyoming , Colorado and Arizona that combined both business and pleasure .
The president held town hall meetings on health care during the trip .
And he went fly fishing and took trips to Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon with his wife and two daughters .
An 11 - day stay in Hawaii where the president and his family celebrated Christmas and New Year ’s Eve .
Some of the president ’s recent predecessors , however , have spent more days — either entirely or partially — away from the White House " on vacation " during their first year in office .
President Reagan , in 1981 , spent all or part of 42 days away from the White House " on vacation " at his home in Santa Barbara , Calif , according to Knoller .
President Reagan and his wife , Nancy , also spent three or four days around New Year ’s Day each year in Palm Springs , Calif . , at the home of philanthropist Walter Annenberg .
( In 1993 the late Mr. Annenberg founded the nonpartisan Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania , which is FactCheck.org ’s parent organization . )
President George W. Bush spent even more time away from the presidential mansion in the nation ’s capital than Reagan .
Of the 77 total " vacation " trips the former president made to his Texas ranch while in office , nine of them — all or part of 69 days — came during his first year as president in 2001 , according to Knoller .
Bush ’s father , President George H.W. Bush , spent less time " on vacation " during his first year than his son , but spent more days than President Obama .
According to travel records provided to FactCheck.org by the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum , the former president took six trips — spanning all or part of 40 days — to the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine , in 1989 .
The archivist at Bush ’s presidential library told us she did n’t have a list of all vacations but did have the Kennebunkport visits .
But at least two recent presidents — by Knoller ’s count — took less " vacation " time during their first year than President Obama — Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
According to Knoller , Carter spent just 19 days " on vacation " in 1977 .
Most of that time , Knoller says , the former president spent at his home in Plains , Ga. President Clinton took all or part of 174 days of vacation during his eight years as president — most of that " vacation " time was during the summer , according to Knoller .
But Knoller says Clinton only took 21 " vacation " days during his first year .
It ’s worth mentioning that President Obama has also made 11 trips — all or part of 27 days — to Camp David , the presidential retreat in Frederick County , Md. Knoller , however , says he does n’t count trips to Camp David as part of any presidents ’ " vacation " time .
But for the sake of comparison , President George W. Bush , made more trips to that country residence than Obama .
According to Knoller , Bush made 25 trips — a total of 78 days — to Camp David in 2001 .
But no matter how much time a president actually spends away from the official residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. , Knoller says that the commander in chief is never really off the clock .
" I have long held the view that a US president is never really on vacation , " Knoller told FactCheck.org in an e-mail .
" The job – and its awesome powers and responsibilities – is his wherever he is and whatever he ’s doing . "

Why have n’t progressives mounted more of a challenge to the war in Afghanistan ?
Earlier this month , the Pentagon released a 151 - page report outlining the increasingly grim situation in Afghanistan .
The paper highlighted the Afghan government ( and its security services ) lack of capability ; the enduring challenge of endemic corruption and poor governance ; and the Taliban insurgency ’s ability to maintain influence — often via intimidation — across broad swaths of the country .
These challenges have already undermined U.S. military operations in Marjah , and could threaten the upcoming summer offensive planned for Kandahar , the heart of the Taliban insurgency .
The entire U.S. mission in Afghanistan , which is predicated on extending the legitimacy of a flawed Afghan government , bringing good governance to the country ’s most insecure regions , and degrading the Taliban insurgency militarily to smooth the path for political negotiations is becoming eerily reminiscent of the flawed American strategy in Vietnam four decades ago .
While no one can be sure how escalation in Afghanistan will turn out , the warning signs are blinking red .
Yet the reaction from many of the president ’s liberal and left - of - center supporters has been acquiescence and even silence .
The Pentagon report — like much of the recent bad news out of Afghanistan — caused barely a ripple on the left .
It ’s a familiar pattern .
The American Prospect , along with Salon , has devoted enormous and laudable energy to covering civil liberties issues related to the U.S. war on terror , but has run only one major article on Afghanistan since Obama ’s December speech at West Point .
The Center for American Progress ’s Wonk Room blog has not run a headlined story about the war since January .
At Talking Points Memo , which is perhaps the most prominent liberal blog , Afghanistan rarely rates a mention .
Paul Krugman , a frequent critic of the Iraq War ( and President Obama ) , has not written a column on Afghanistan since the president took office .
And The New Republic itself has largely avoided critical consideration of the war .
( The Nation and Mother Jones have been exceptions to this relative silence . )
So why are so many liberal voices muted ?
Why after so many liberals aggressively asserted themselves in criticizing the foreign policy conduct of the Bush administration — and in particular the war in Iraq — have they ignored the war in Afghanistan ?
Over the past several weeks I asked a number of prominent progressives why liberals have been so silent about the war in Afghanistan .
Several themes emerged .
So the trial of the media is all but over .
Rebekah Brooks seems to have skipped all responsibility .
Andy Coulson has been made scapegoat and yet that maybe brought into question due to the bumbling antics of sort of chosen leader David Cameron .
Rupert Murdoch has made a mint .

How has justice been wronged so badly ?
It all starts from power and money .
Rupert Murdoch has it .
Throughout the whole trial he has controlled everything he could control .
Other players like Rebekah Brooks and her coven have been gift a hand from a man I am sure they worship more so than any deity they might have strayed upon during their scrap to what life they perceive was worthy .
Andy Coulson sued News Corp to cover his costs , and indeed News Corp are going to pay at figures around £ 60 million at current estimates for the trial itself , and we the tax payer could be paying around £ 40 million .
That sticks firmly in the craw .
Especially considering by all accounts it could turn out to be the biggest waste of tax payers money .
It may happen that Coulson and his retrial are already compromised by none other than David Cameron .
In terms of what we managed to actually prosecute , we only have one ham - handed success as I see it .
Yet that success is meaningless in terms of goals I would have set for the whole investigation .
At the least I was hoping for punishment to be metered out with the intent to ensure that news companies are governed correctly and understand that the people they make their wages from are to be treated as such .
We did not reach deep enough into the underbelly of what really is going on behind the many powerful doors Rupert Murdoch and in fact he turned the whole darn affair to his advantage .
We have been handed a man to call bad , to be convicted and sent down .
One high ranking member of the chain .
Despite all indications that this who wrong doing ethos was rife and still is rife within the Murdoch empire .
Despite a deep look into the history of Brooks and Coulson which revealed they were the same in many ways .
The drive , the intelligence and the will to do whatever it took to achieve their aims .
Some things to think about .
Firstly , the tactics of the defense played a large hand in how the evidence was delivered .
They played the system of evidence presentation to their advantage .
Evidence had to be submitted without any reference to why they were evidence in the trial .
Therefore the Crown ( thats us ! ) were only allowed to make an opening statement .
This leads just two people attempting to present a story from masses amounts of evidence , with an army of defending lawyers pointing out the haphazard manner in which evidence was pieced together .
The evidence itself was selective to say the least .
A story of a safe being lost .
A safe .
Being lost .
I repeat for gravity .
How could the hierarchy not know about all that went on ?
What exactly is that has all powerful men fawning over Rebekah Brooks ?
What evidence was not presented , due to either off the record evidence or due to deletion and destruction ?
Given all the power in media how much can we trust them ?
How much wool has been pulled over our eyes ?…

" There 's no evidence that we do n't have integrity . "
The Mobile Press - Register published an article on its website Friday alleging that BP has been offering lucrative contracts and signing bonuses to top scientists at universities around the Gulf of Mexico as part of its defense against oil spill litigation .
BP PLC even tried to sign up the entire marine sciences department at an Alabama university .
The university declined due to confidentiality requirements the company sought to impose .
In no other country do people genuinely love their bosses the way Americans do .
They 'll go home after 12 hard hours of capricious superiors peeing in their faces , and the very first thing they 'll do is call up some talk radio show and denounce the graduated income tax that gives them a break at their bosses ' expense .
In other countries bosses need to constantly fend off revolts and strikes ; in America people tune in by the millions to cheer on an impetuous , bloated asshole like Donald Trump as he ritualistically fires a succession of sheepish sacrificial stand - ins who are clearly chosen for their resemblance to the target demographic .
And The Apprentice was just one of many reality shows where people literally jack off to their own job insecurity !
They 've got peoples ' heads so turned around in this country that this ring - around - the - collar self - flagellating terror at being thought of as poor and subordinate has people reflexively worshipping their bosses , to the point where George Steinbrenner -- a workplace Caligula so stupid and self - centered that he could not be convinced George Constanza was n't named after him -- is somehow thought of as cute and lovable .
George Steinbrenner was not cute ; he was the biggest fuckhead of his generation .
Steinbrenner was the kind of guy who would n't accept that two plus two equaled four if a parade of MIT professors proved it to him on a fifty - foot blackboard .
And if you tried to point that out to him , he fired you in the middle of the night , which he thought was funny , except that you were feeding your kids with that money .
Also , expect many , many fake scandals ; we ’ll be having hearings over accusations of corruption on the part of Michelle Obama ’s hairdresser , janitors at the Treasury , and Larry Summers ’s doctor ’s dog .
If you do n’t believe me , you were n’t paying attention during the Clinton years ; remember , we had months of hearings over claims that something was fishy in the White House travel office ( nothing was ) .
The basic idea of the airplane analogy is this :
We do n’t ground all airplanes after a single plane crash , therefore we should n’t stop all drilling rigs if we have a problem with one of them .
Now , if rigs only posed a danger to the workers on them , then the parallel would hold up better .
But , as bad as the deaths on the Deepwater Horizon were , it ’s the catastrophic risks that oil gushers pose to an entire region that make them so potentially dangerous .
This event is so newsworthy because of the resultant oil gusher , not the original rig fire .
Everyone understands that , yet this analogy obscures this central , gruesome fact .
It equates a fiery rig to a fiery plane crash , and complains that we ’re responding to one situation differently than another .
But the oil that ’s currently polluting five Gulf Coast states complicates things a bit , does n’t it ?
Why is the biggest element in this ongoing disaster – namely , the flowing oil – missing from the airplane scenario ?
Feldman ruled that it was too much of a leap to impose a blanket moratorium because of a mishap on one rig , enabling politicians to argue that a resumption of deepwater drilling would entail little risk .
To believe that , it is necessary to assume BP is the wild man of the oil business and other rigs will be operated with sufficient care to obviate any risk of another major spill .
There is indeed some evidence that BP is the most slapdash company in the business ; it has racked up safety violations at a staggering rate .
Thus , the argument against the moratorium goes , the spill happened not because deepwater drilling is inherently hazardous but because Deepwater Horizon was a rogue operation .
Maybe it is so , but anyone tempted to trust the oil companies ' sense of environmental responsibility would be well advised to take a tour of the Louisiana marshes .
Oil spills , albeit on a smaller scale than Deepwater Horizon , are hardly a rare occurrence .
Today I sliced off parts of what could have been several different crappy blog posts and crammed them all together into this one big crappy product which obviously increases its overall market value somehow .
The Lens asks some questions about property tax assessments on a Georges property .
Georges responds in the comments .
According to this article Shinn and Chouest are " barely on speaking terms "
The whole situation is very strange .
But then Shinn has a long track record of being involved in strangeness .
It 's a fun article anyway because it ends on this quote from BP Vice - President Kent Wells regarding the ongoing well integrity testing .
Certainly .
No evidence they can't buy anyway ... I wonder how much they gave Ivor Van Heerden Read this Matt Taibbi post about the ridiculous media love fest following upon the death of George Steinbrenner .
Remember that most Americans are like this come Novemeber as Republicans ride to major gains while blaming the unemployed for not having jobs .
Oh and when that happens , Krugman predicts another Government shutdown just like that which followed the 1994 elections .
Democrats will never get anywhere if all they do is continue making excuses for Wall Street criminals and compromising into impotence on every issue of critical import from health reform to financial regulation .
Do they deserve to have their asses handed to them in November ?
You bet .
Do we deserve the horrifying consequences of that ?
Well of course not but most of us do n't really count for much anymore anyway .
Finally , here 's a pretty good pairing of two recent opinion columns :
Meanwhile James Gill addresses much of the same topic
I first learned of the story below while watching this speech by former New York Times writer Jennifer 8 .
Lee at a TED conference .
The video I linked to is 18 minutes long but worth every second .
It 's a scaled down version of a tome 's worth of information , quite literally : Lee , inspired by the below , traveled around the world to find out more , and in the end , authored The Fortune Cookie Chronicles -- a history of what Americans call Chinese Food . --

The Luckiest Dessert in History
Powerball , a multi-state lottery , has unique rules .
Players pick six numbers : five which they hope will match five randomly selected white balls ; plus one additional number which they hope will match a randomly selected red ball ( the Powerball ) .
Any player who successfully predicts all six balls correctly wins the jackpot .
The odds of hitting the jackpot ?
One in over 195 million .
However , correctly predicting the five white balls only results in a large prize itself , currently $ 200,000 .
The odds here ?
One in 5,138,133 .
But something went wrong during March 30 , 2005 Powerball drawing .
One hundred and ten people hit those one - in - five million odds , winning , collectively , almost $ 20 million dollars .
Immediately , officials assumed rampant fraud .
They plotted the winner 's locations on a map , and , seeing no obvious patterns , dug deeper .
What they found was n't fraud .
It was food .
Specifically , fortune cookies .
Wonton Food , Inc. , in New York , makes fortune cookies .
A lot of them , in fact , with distribution across the country .
They print up thousands of copies of each fortune , replete with lucky numbers .
And as luck would have it , one of these sets of numbers exactly matched the five white balls in that week 's Powerball drawing .
One hundred and ten people played those numbers -- and finding no fraud in the end , Powerball officials concluded that these 110 lucky Chinese food fans were indeed winners .
Bonus fact : Fortune cookies are n't Chinese desserts , historically .
They 're Japanese .

Stephen Strasburg 's phenomenal rookie season has hit a roadblock .
Strasburg was scratched from Tuesday night 's start at Nationals Park against the Atlanta Braves , as Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo made the decision after Strasburg had trouble getting loose in the bullpen before the game .
Strasburg paused during his warmups and , after consulting with catcher Ivan Rodriguez and pitching coach Steve McCatty , ceased his throwing and left the bullpen about 15 minutes before game time .
Rizzo told news reporters during Tuesday 's game that Strasburg was scratched for precautionary reasons and X - rays and an MRI are planned .
Long reliever Miguel Batista started the game in Strasburg 's place .
Rizzo termed the move " erring on the side of caution " and did not specify if the concern was with Strasburg 's elbow or shoulder .
" He 's never had this workload before .
I made the executive decision of saying if you can't get loose , I 'm not going to let you pitch , " Rizzo said on the Nationals ' Mid-Atlantic Sports Network broadcast .
" He hates to disappoint fans , but that 's my call I have to make . "
Strasburg has pitched 54 1/3 innings at the major league level this season and was coming off a 97 - pitch outing in his last start , when he gave up three earned runs in 5 2/3 innings and beat the Cincinnati Reds .
Including his stints at Class AA and Class AAA , Strasburg has pitched 109 2/3 innings , and the Nationals aimed to end his rookie season after he reached 160 total innings .
" As we have throughout the process , we 're being very careful with him , " Rizzo said .
" He wants the ball every fifth day , but it 's my job to protect him . "
Rizzo indicated there were no complications in his normal side session two days after beating the Reds .
Overall , he is 5 - 2 with a 2.32 ERA with the Nationals , and has struck out 75 batters in 54 1/3 innings .

President Hamid Karzai has lost faith in the US strategy in Afghanistan and is increasingly looking to Pakistan to end the insurgency , according to those close to Afghanistan 's former head of intelligence services .
Amrullah Saleh , who resigned last weekend , believes the president lost confidence some time ago in the ability of Nato forces to defeat the Taliban .
As head of the National Directorate of Security , Saleh was highly regarded in western circles .
He has said little about why he quit , other than that the Taliban attack on last week 's peace jirga or assembly in Kabul was for him the " tipping point " ; the interior minister , Hanif Atmar , also quit , and their resignations were accepted by Karzai .
Privately Saleh has told aides he believes Karzai 's approach is dangerously out of step with the strategy of his western backers .
" There came a time when [ Karzai ] lost his confidence in the capability of the coalition or even his own government [ to protect ] this country , " a key aide told the Guardian .
Saleh believes Karzai has long thought this , but his views were crystallised in the aftermath of last year 's election when millions of votes were found to be fraudulent ; Karzai blamed the US , UK and United Nations for the fraud .
According to the source , Saleh is deeply concerned by Karzai 's noticeably softer attitude towards Pakistan .
The president has long dropped his past habit of excoriating Pakistan for aiding the Taliban .
Saleh also echoes complaints of US commanders that Karzai refuses to behave like a commander - in - chief , and is not publicly leading the counterinsurgency campaign devised by Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of Nato forces .
In London today , the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , warned that progress needed to be made .
" In all coalition countries the public expects to see us move in the right direction [ but ] will not tolerate the perception of a stalemate , where we are losing our young men . "
Gates also warned of " a high level of violence , especially this summer " , as US forces push deeper into southern provinces where the Taliban are strongest .
Today in the south , insurgents shot down a Nato helicopter , killing four US troops , while a British soldier died in a separate attack .
In Islamabad in Pakistan , an assault on a depot by insurgents destroyed 50 lorries belonging to the Nato military supply chain .
Saleh 's resignation on Sunday , along with Atmar , was a huge blow to the government , which is otherwise largely lacking in high - calibre senior officials .
He was strongly supported by the CIA and MI6 , and had a reputation as hardworking and honest .
His six years at the head of what is probably Afghanistan 's least dysfunctional state body gave him extensive access to Karzai , a man he still regards as a " patriot " and whom he is reluctant to publicly criticise .
But , according to Saleh 's aides , the final straw came last Sunday when Karzai apparently questioned his loyalty during a stormy meeting at the presidential palace , appearing not to believe Saleh and Atmar 's account of how two insurgents armed with rocket launchers , one dressed as a woman , were able to get so close to a meeting of 1,600 national leaders .
Saleh 's colleagues say that Karzai even accused the two men of a plot with the Americans and the British to wreck his peace plan .
Saleh 's friends say that , because Karzai believes Nato is unable to deal with insurgent sanctuaries on the eastern border , he is looking for an alternative strategy : rather than use western support to " harden " Afghanistan against its neighbour , he is instead striking a less robust attitude to Pakistan and the Taliban .
The former intelligence head is outraged by the tone of the jirga , which stressed the role of the weak and corrupt Afghan state in fomenting insurgency .
And he was appalled by Karzai 's post - jirga announcement that a commission would be set up to release Taliban prisoners not held on solid evidence – such evidence in many cases came from Saleh 's directorate .
But Karzai is not alone .
McChrystal and diplomats have for months argued that Pakistan is rethinking its support for the Taliban after deadly attacks on Pakistani cities , and say arrests of Taliban commanders , such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in February , are proof of the new mood in Pakistan – something Saleh disputes .
Casualties rise
There has been an increase in violence in Afghanistan as US commanders put the final touches to a plan to secure the Taliban 's southern heartland of Kandahar , an operation they hope will turn the tide of the war .
The latest casualties yesterday took Nato 's toll to 29 deaths in nine days , according to an AP count .
The United States , whose some 94,000 troops vastly outnumber the rest of the allies ' contributions in Afghanistan , has lost 17 service members since Sunday .
The downing of an American Blackhawk helicopter in Helmand province saw four American crew die , but a couple of wounded British soldiers being carried on board survived and were transferred to another Blackhawk .
Their injuries are said to be not life - threatening .
Helmand provincial spokesman Daoud Ahmadi said the helicopter was shot down about midday in Sangin district during an operation involving Nato and Afghan security forces .
Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said the insurgents shot off two rockets to down the helicopter .

Those guys have nothing on Kam Ma. Back in 2006 , Ma figured he just was n't famous or metallic enough for his tastes , and decided to kill two birds with one stone .
He located a tattoo artist , Charlie Wilson and , on March 4 , 2006 , the pair set out to break the world record for most piercings in 24 hours .
They succeeded , at a staggering 1,055 piercings in just under eight hours .
Ma , apparently not wanting to waste time on ridiculous things like preventing pain , took every one of the piercings without anesthetic , making himself as figuratively metal as he is now literally metal .
When the smoke had cleared , Ma found himself with 600 new rings all along his legs and arms .
For those of you keeping score , that 's significantly fewer rings than there were holes put in him .
Apparently , in addition to the decorating job , Wilson decided to put another 455 holes in Ma 's body just for the hell of it .
Boredom !

Not surprisingly , this record has not yet been successfully challenged by anybody , as all the viable candidates are probably locked up in padded cells somewhere .
Ma achieved and maintained his goal of being a world - record holder , as well as the auxiliary goals of looking like an incomplete cyborg and never being able to wear a jacket again .

On a seat - by - seat basis , the Liberals would be the main winners of a successful electoral coalition with the NDP .
Based on the results of the 2008 election , a coalition running on a joint platform and a common slate of candidates could add 42 seats to the current NDP - Liberal total of 114 MPs , bringing it on the winning side of a governing majority .
The bulk of those gains would be Liberal ones and more than half of them would be registered in Central Canada .
In Ontario , a combination of the 2008 NDP and Liberal vote would result in the election of 15 more Liberal MPs .
In Quebec , such an arrangement would translate into nine more Liberal seats — almost doubling the party ’s score in that province .
Under such an arrangement , the NDP would add only a handful of new seats to its take , mostly in Western Canada .
The gain for the New Democrats would be the guarantee of a direct role in government for the first time ever at the federal level .
This model has obvious limitations .
It presumes that the votes from the last election are transferable from the NDP to the Liberals and vice - versa and that is certainly not true of every single individual vote .
But polls do show that the NDP and the Liberals are more often than not each other ’s second choice .
In logic , a voter who supported Stéphane Dion and his Green Shift in the last campaign is likely immune to the political charms of Stephen Harper ’s Conservative party , as are , by definition , the bulk of NDP supporters
By tapping into a larger potential pool of support , Liberal and NDP incumbents would also largely be sheltered from whatever fallout could result from an electoral coalition between their two parties and from hostile Conservative takeovers .
On the positive side of the ledger , the model does not reflect the possibility that a significant number of Bloc Québécois and Green Party voters could decide to support a progressive coalition that stood a serious chance of unseating the Conservatives .
The results of the exercise mostly highlight just how difficult the status quo will make it for the Liberals to gain the two dozen or more seats they minimally need to be in contention for a governing role in the next Parliament , as well as how hard it would be for the NDP to vault to a second - place finish .
They have too many occasions to shoot each other in the foot .
For example , the list of Quebec ridings where the Liberal and the NDP basically ensure each other ’s defeat to the Bloc Québécois is almost exclusively made up of ridings that voted No to sovereignty in the 1995 referendum .
The split in the progressive federalist vote has allowed them to fall into the BQ ’s lap .
Last weekend , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff ruled out a campaign alliance with the NDP but left the door open to a joint parliamentary arrangement if the election results warrant reaching out to Jack Layton to deny the Conservatives a third term .
In so doing Ignatieff basically empowered his opponents at his own expense .
He has given NDP supporters a bigger incentive to stick with Layton in the next campaign in the reasonable hope , given the current polls , that their votes would give him a stronger hand in an eventual post-election negotiation with the Liberals .

And he has allowed Conservative strategists to fill in the blanks of his post- election coalition musings in ways that fit their agenda .
As things stand now , Ignatieff is poised to go in the next campaign bearing all the real and imagined risks of a potential coalition with Layton but enjoying none of its probable advantages .

Reports suggest Barack Obama ' wo n't stand in way ' of bid as UK oil firm looks to sell assets to survive
BP was at the centre of fresh takeover speculation after weekend reports suggested the Obama administration has told ExxonMobil – the world 's largest oil firm – that it would not stand in the way of a takeover bid for the stricken British rival .
Before the Gulf of Mexico oil spill BP was Britain 's biggest company with a stock market value of £ 121bn .
Since then more than £ 50bn has been wiped off its share value and a number of potential bidders are rumoured to be circling to take advantage of its weakened state .
Oil industry sources were quoted as saying that ExxonMobil had been given a green light by the US government to " take a look " at BP .
A merger would create a group with a stock market value of $ 400 bn ( £ 265bn ) .
Both firms refused to comment on the speculation .
BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , is well aware of the threat of a hostile bid and last week held a series of meetings with potential " friendly " investors including the Kuwait Investment Office .
A big strategic investor would make it harder for the likes of ExxonMobil or China 's National Offshore Oil Company ( CNOOC ) to win control in a hostile takeover bid .
The Kuwaitis already have a 1.75 % stake , but BP would like it to increase that to as much as 10 % .
Hayward is also understood to have met with another sovereign wealth fund , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) .
The cost of the spill to BP has already past $ 3.1 bn ( £ 2bn ) , and the company has pledged some of its assets as security to the US government while it builds up a promised $ 20 bn compensation fund .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate the final bill for the disaster caused by the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers , could run to $ 70bn .
BP has already began talks with rivals about selling off assets to help bolster its financial position .
CNOOC is interested in buying the Argentinian gas businesses partly owned by BP .
The UK oil firm 's joint Russian venture TNK - BP has also opened talks about buying assets outside Russia .
Today Apache Corporation , the US 's largest independent oil group , was named as being in exclusive talks to buy investments worth $ 12bn from BP , including the stake in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay , the largest oil field in North America .
Neither BP nor Apache would comment .
" We 've said we 're going to be divesting about $ 10 bn over the next 12 months as a result of the spill , but we have no comment on specific deals , " said a BP spokesman .
BP is hoping to have some firm sales to announce before 27 July when it must release its first - half financial results and give a strategic update about the scale of liabilities faced in America .
The oil spill – and BP 's handling of it – has made the firm public enemy number one in the US , with Barack Obama leading the call for blood .
Such is the level of vitriol , that business groups claim American protectionism is on the rise and it is affecting other British firms .
Foreign companies have already been restricted from access to US government bailout money and some important federal contracts .
This week the Washington - based Organisation for International Investment will meet a handful of British business groups including the CBI , the Chartered Institute of Taxation and Business International to discuss the rise in anti-British rhetoric and how to counter it .
· The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday July 19 2010 .

Berkeley , Calif .
HERE in California , where people tiresomely boast that the state ’s gross domestic product exceeds that of all but seven nations , I keep expecting a ballot initiative demanding admission to the Group of 8 industrialized nations .
I ’d consider voting for it , too ; then maybe Washington would work as hard to synchronize its economic policy with Sacramento as it does with Tokyo and Berlin .
The lack of coordination within the United States  and , equally important , the failure to recognize the states as macroeconomic players  helps explain our sluggish recovery .
To make matters worse , several states have country - sized G.D.P.’s , but none has the macroeconomic tools of an independent country .
Every state except Vermont has some sort of balanced budget requirement that prevents it from weathering a recession by running up big deficits to keep teachers employed , students in college , welfare payments flowing and construction humming .
Nor can New York and California stimulate their economies by , say , printing more currency .
Instead , states are managing huge budget crises with the only tools they have , cutting spending and raising taxes  both of which undermine the federal stimulus .
That ’s why the best booster shot for this recovery and the next would be to allow states to borrow from the Treasury during recessions .
We did this for Wall Street and Detroit , fending off disaster .
It ’s even more important for states .
Here ’s how this would work .
States already receive regular federal matching grants to help pay for Medicaid , welfare , highway construction programs and more .
For instance , the federal government pays a share of state Medicaid costs , from 50 percent to more than 75 percent , depending on a state ’s wealth .
The matching rates were temporarily sweetened by last year ’s stimulus .

The birth of Australian wallabies can be traced back to American parentage
The characteristic koalas , kangaroos , possums and wombats of Australia share a common American ancestor , according to genetic research from Germany .
A University of Muenster team drew up a marsupial family tree based on DNA .
Writing in the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) Biology journal , they suggest a single marsupial species moved from the Americas to Australia .
Marsupials differ from other mammals in that mothers carry their young in a pouch after birth .
As well as the familiar Australian species , the family includes the opossums and shrew opossums of North and South America , and also has a presence in Asian countries including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea .
" I think this is pretty strong evidence now for the hypothesis of a single migration [ to Australia ] and a common ancestor , " said Juergen Schmitz , one of the research team .
Tracing relatives
Maybe it 's around 30 - 40 million years ago , but we cannot say because jumping genes do not give this information Juergen Schmitz
What is a genome ?
The research was made possible by the recent sequencing of genomes from two marsupials - the gray short - tailed opossum ( Monodelphis domestica ) from South America , and the Australian tammar wallaby ( Macropus eugenii ) .
The Muenster researchers looked for DNA elements called retroposons .
These are fragments that have been copied and inserted back into DNA in a random fashion at some point during the animal 's evolutionary history .
They are among the " jumping genes " that can scatter genetic information along the genome .
If two species carry the same retroposon but a third does not , that indicates that the first two are more closely related to each other than they are to the third .
Sometimes one retroposon is inserted in the middle of another , again giving vital clues as to the sequence of events in a family 's evolution .
Using this method , they showed that the American opossums separated from the main lineage first .

The most distant marsupial relatives are the opossums of the Americas
Then at some stage an ancestral species migrated to Australia and gave rise to the various families found there now .
When exactly this happened is still unknown , as this kind of analysis does not show when in evolutionary time the retroposons were inserted .
" Maybe it 's around 30 - 40 million years ago , but we cannot say because jumping genes do not give this information , " Dr Schmitz told BBC News .
" It 's now up to other people , maybe from the palaeontology field , to find out when exactly it happened . "
The overall marsupial history is virtually a circular migration .
The earliest identified species ( Sinodelphys szalayi ) is known from 125 - million - year - old fossils found in China .
Subsequently the family - or perhaps a single species - moved across the super - continent of Gondwana into what is now South America .
The marsupial family began expanding about 70 - 80 million years ago .
After crossing into Australia , they penetrated north into the Indonesian archipelago - almost returning to their Chinese homeland .

The following is a post I started a little over 2 years ago explaining my 180 concerning the war in Iraq .
This is easily the most difficult post I ’ve ever written because of the life and death nature of the subject matter and admitting being on the wrong side of this issue for so long .
As tempting as it has been to continue to ignore this issue , I felt that I owed it to the readers of The Liberty Papers to finally explain myself before moving on to other posts .
I think that most Americans on both sides of the Iraq debate have the best interests of America at heart ( to the extent there even is a debate anymore ) .
Much of the Iraq debate seems to be based on emotion rather than reason .
Emotional talking points from the Left such as “ Bush lied , people died ” ( though I do believe he over sold the threat ) , “ Bush wanted to be a war time president , ” and “ the Iraq war is really about Halliburton ” or “ BIG oil ” remain unconvincing to me .
I took great exception to war critics who resort to calling anyone who supports any war for any reason a “ war monger ” or a “ chicken hawk ” ( and I still do ) .
I also took great exception to those on the Right who would say that “ you ca n’t support the troops if you do n’t support the mission . ”
Such a claim is obviously ludicrous because some of the troops themselves do not support the mission .
That would mean they do not support themselves !
Arguments that individuals should not criticize the president because “ we are at war ” have always seemed Orwellian and scary to me .
Though I like to think of myself as a man of reason , reasonable people will fall into emotional traps from time to time ; no one is 100 % logical or reasonable 100 % of the time on each and every issue .
I fell into the emotional traps that many on the Right ( and most everyone else for at least a short time ) fell into in the aftermath of 9/11 : anger , hatred , and fear .
Why I supported the War in Iraq
My immediate response to the aftermath of 9/11 was anger , hatred , and fear ( and I ’m sure I was n’t alone ) .
I was angry that these religious extremists attacked my country , I hated them for their reasons for doing so , and I feared more attacks would come at any moment .
I was n’t interested in justice for those responsible for the attacks , I wanted vengeance !
Though I never believed that Iraq had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks , I believed that it was time to rethink my positions on how America should deal with rogue states such as Iraq .
While I would not have supported invading a nation , overthrowing that nation ’s government , and rebuilding a nation prior to 9/11 , it seemed that America needed to be proactive and “ preempt ” such nations from even the possibility of attacking America first .
I supported the invasion because I truly believed the WMD threat was real and that overthrowing Saddam Hussein would lead to liberty spreading throughout the region and thus would make America safer .
For a short time , this theory seemed to becoming a reality .
U.S. and coalition troops defeated the Iraqi forces in record time .
The cable news channels showed Iraqis pulling down Saddam Hussein ’s statue and in broken English saying such things as “ Thank you America ” and “ Thank you Mr. Bush . ”
Shortly thereafter , President Bush made his infamous tail - hook landing on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln which had a large banner which read “ Mission Accomplished . ”
I thought for sure that this meant the troops would be coming home and that the critics of the war had been proven wrong in their dire predictions .
Sure , Saddam Hussein and his sons were still at large , there was still some violence in the immediate aftermath , and no stockpiles of WMD had been found but all these things would be taken care of in a matter of time .
A few more months perhaps ?
It all made a great deal of sense in theory but the reality seems to be quite different .
What Changed ?
It ’s hard for me to pinpoint exactly when I began to realize the invasion and subsequent occupation Iraq to be a mistake .
When weapons hunters failed to find the WMD in the first couple of years after the invasion , my thinking was that perhaps the “ preemption ” approach was wrongheaded but because the troops were already there , the damage had already been done .
I believed that because American foreign policy lead to the chaos that followed the invasion , it was the duty of our government to clean up the mess ( i.e. the “ you broke it , you bought it ” argument ) .
I further believed that if coalition troops pulled out of Iraq “ the Islamofascists will follow us home ” unless the Iraqi government was stable enough to handle the violence itself .
The truth of the matter is my reasoning was clouded by fear .
This post I wrote in early 2007 illustrates this fear .
We could not afford to allow our enemies to claim victory in Iraq as they would become “ emboldened ” and be encouraged to carry out future attacks both on American soil and abroad .
This is not a war we could afford to lose ; failure was not an option .
But when I was challenged by readers and fellow TLP contributors define exactly what “ victory ” in Iraq would look like , I struggled in vain to find a satisfactory answer .
I now realize that if American troops were to leave tomorrow , next year , or 100 years from now , the radical Islamists will claim victory no matter when the troops leave .
They are master propagandists and those who follow their ideology do not allow facts to get in the way of their beliefs .
Some of these people do n’t even acknowledge that the Holocaust even happened despite all of the mountains of documentary evidence to the contrary .
The first thing that has changed in my thinking is the fear factor .
The whole purpose of terrorism is to cause people to be terrorized .
When we overreact and do such things as pass the Patriot Act , surrender liberties we otherwise would not , or send troops to fight undeclared wars against countries that might have WMD and may directly or indirectly use these weapons against the U.S. or her allies , the terrorist act has accomplished its intended goal .
The second big change is my understanding of contemporary history .
My thinking was that America ’s military might would be enough to transform the Middle East from a region of oppression to a region of freedom .
These were people yearning to be free .
All that needed to happen was for the despots to be deposed , the people liberated , and our world would be more peaceful as a result .
In the Point post “ A Case for Non-Intervention , ” Brad correctly pointed out the flaws of this logic of fatal conceit : that man can shape the world around him according to his wishes .
By the time I wrote the Counterpoint to Brad ’s post , I was already beginning to see the error of my thinking but still holding out hope that somehow we could avoid the “ reverse King Midas effect ” this time .
But why would this time be any different ?
At least since President Woodrow Wilson , the U.S. has been intervening in internal affairs of other countries allegedly to “ make the world safer for democracy . ”
But rather than making the world safer , in most cases it seems , American foreign policy has created more enemies rather than less .
The conditions that led up to the adventures in both Iraq and Afghanistan are in many ways the result of American foreign policy .
The continued presence of American troops occupying and nation building in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere fosters resentment among these populations .
Lessons Learned
One argument I used to make was that leaving Iraq as a failed mission would mean that those troops who had died for the cause would have died in vain .
I no longer believe this necessarily has to be the case if we as a people learn the right lessons of Iraq .
There were people who opposed the war in the very beginning for very principled reasons ( and I ’m not talking about the so - called anti-war Democrats who seem to have nothing to say about Iraq now that their guy is in office ) .
Others like me , unfortunately , had to learn the lessons of Iraq the hard way .
I was naive and trusted that the government was acting in such a way that would make its citizens safer but I now see the error in this thinking .
Neither North Korea nor Iran seems to be slowing down their WMD programs as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
And despite the anti-terror policies that have been enacted since 9/11 and despite this war , our cities are likely as vulnerable if not more so than before 9/11 .
Our own government is a much greater threat to our liberties than al Qaeda ever will be .
It ’s really the open - ended nature of this “ war on terror ” and failure on the part of our government to define who exactly the enemy is that makes the concept of victory unobtainable .
Who specifically is our enemy ?
Is it just al Qaeda and / or the Taliban or is it anyone and everyone the U.S. government calls a “ terrorist ” ?
If we can not even define exactly who our enemy is , how is victory even possible ?
Once the enemy has been identified , the congress ( not the president ) should debate whether or not to declare war on the enemy .
Any declaration of war should include not only who the enemy is but define in precise terms the meaning of victory ( as opposed to making it up as they go along ) .
The idea of going into another undeclared war in the future should be considered a complete non-starter ( and the notion of “ preemptive ” wars of choice in particular ) .
Now What ?
Its time for the people of Iraq to decide for themselves what kind of future they want .
Our brave soldiers have done the heavy lifting for far too long .
Its time for our brave troops to come home to their families and let them move on with their lives .
Ditto for Afghanistan .
The only troops that should be left behind should be those with the sole mission of hunting Bin Laden and his extremist followers .
The nation building mission should be brought to an end .
Its time to completely rethink the American foreign policy of the last 100 years or so .
Has the presence of American troops made the world , and more importantly America safer ?
Is it still necessary to our national security to have so many troops stationed around the globe ?
( Was it ever ? )
What ever happened to the “ walk softly ” part of “ walk softly but carry a big stick ” ?
Its time to move beyond the Cold War posture and allow other nations to determine their own futures .
In the mean time , we should be doing all we can to secure our own futures and help our wounded war veterans put their lives back together .
OpenFeint – a leader in socially - driven games for the iOS platform – is announcing they ’re expanding to include Android .
With their arrival comes 9,200 developers who have already published thousands of titles alongside OpenFeint ’s official SDK , a game discovery platform , and integrated mobile payment solutions .

Just a guess but maybe the scientists were right in saying they would not work .
For yet another so - called fiscal conservative ( whatever that ’s supposed to mean ) it sounds like a bizarre way to waste hundreds of millions of dollars .
The construction equipment is being submerged as this expensive , shoot - from - the - hip program sinks .
Even if the islands were n’t crumbling into the sea they still would severely disrupt fish who need access to the marshes .
Do Republicans ever step back and think about consequences before they rush into massive plans ?
Click through to see the other photos of Jindal ’s expensive mistake .
A dramatic series of of aerial images show that plans to build artificial islands to block oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill from reaching Louisiana ’s sensitive marshland appear to be crumbling .
Literally .
Two months ago , against the advice of many coastal scientists , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal began furiously campaigning for the construction of six artificial islands to hold back the advancing oil .
The federal government quickly granted Jindal his wish , and construction on the islands has been continuing apace .
But images taken of one construction site near the northern edge of the Chandeleur islands appear to show the sea washing away a giant sand berm over the course of about two weeks .
The first image , at top , was taken on June 25 .
The second and third , below , were taken from roughly the same vantage point on July 2 and 7 .
All three images were first published yesterday by coastal scientist Leonard Bahr on his blog , LACoastPost .
Bags of blood collected during donation .
Image : Wikipedia .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- US scientists working for the experimental arm of the Pentagon have developed artificial blood for use in transfusions for wounded soldiers in battlefields .
The blood cells are said to be functionally indistinguishable from normal blood cells and could end forever the problem of blood donor shortages in war zones and difficulties in transporting blood to remote and inaccessible areas .
The blood is made from hematopoietic stem cells from discarded human umbilical cords , which are turned into large quantities of red blood cells by a method called " blood pharming " that mimics the functions of bone marrow .
Pharming is a method of using genetically engineered plants or animals to create medically useful substances in large quantities .
Using this process the cells from one umbilical cord can produce about 20 units of blood , which is enough for over three transfusions for injured soldiers in the field .
The blood is being manufactured for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) by Ohio company Arteriocyte , which has already submitted samples of O - negative blood to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for evaluation and safety testing .
The company received funding of $ 1.95 million in 2008 to find a way of making large quantities of artificial blood .
Don Brown of Arteriocyte said the method works but the production needs to be scaled up to produce enough blood .
Scaling up would also bring the costs per unit ( around a pint ) down from the current $ 5,000 to $ 1,000 or less .
The scaling up could involve improving the technology to produce more units from each umbilical cord , or finding a way to make the culture chambers that mimic bone marrow more efficient and therefore cheaper .
Mr Brown said that in war zones it can take three weeks for donated blood ( which mostly comes from donations made in the US ) to reach patients .
It must be used within a week or two to avoid the risk of organ failure or infection that can occur if the blood is stale .
There are mobile blood banks in the field , but if there are many injured soldiers , there is often not enough fresh blood available .
Human trials of the " pharmed " blood are expected to start in 2013 , but the blood could be available for military use within five years .
It could also eventually be used in hospitals to make up for shortages of blood .
The artificial blood is O - negative , which can be used on all patients , regardless of their blood type .

Hi Everyone ,
In this weeks post I am going to stick to the theme of working smarter and not harder , and I am therefore going to show you a very simple and effective way that you can leverage the work of your competition , and also get some very valuable links from .edu and .gov domains .
Building back links to your website is absolutely key when it comes to getting good search engine rankings .
However if you have spent any time doing this you will realize that it can be hard work .
However there is are free ways that can help you see what your competition have done , in regards to back linking their sites , and that is by using search strings in Yahoo .
The first thing you want to do is get a few url ’s of your top competitors and for example purposes let ’s use this site : www.barkbuster.com.
What I would do is then type this into Yahoo : link : http://www.barkbusters.com
Below is a screen shot with an example of some results :
Keep in mind that when you are searching like this , if you are searching for a professional well established site , you will find that a lot of the links , .edu and .gov included , are natural links and therefore it will be tough for you to get links from these sites .
However if you search for a typical affiliate websites back links then it is a safe bet that these links will be all forced and therefore there is every chance that you can go off and create a link there also !
What I mean by forced is the website owner went off and created them , so they did n’t just get linked to naturally from other sites .
Government and Education Links
Not long ago I did a post on how to search for blogs and forums that were on .edu and .gov domains , which I hope you found helpful , and below is another example of how to to this .
All you need to do is type these strings into Google :
site :.gov blog
site :.edu blog
You can also add you niche keyword before the word blog to find specific blogs to your niche , but to be honest I find this narrows the search field too much so I rarely do it .
By typing this into Google the results are for government and education domains that also have a blog .
Where there is a blog there is often comments , and that is where you want your links to be .
Oh and if you are really lucky you might find a military domain to get a link from : site:.mil
Now you may also want to find forums on these domain also , so one way to do that is to search on :
inurl : edu forum
inurl : gov forum
What you have to realize is that finding these blogs and forums that will allow a link to your site can take time , but you have to remember that these links are worth A LOT more for your search engine results than regular links .
Also if the links you do successfully place are ‘ No Follow ’ then do n’t be discouraged , because many leading SEO experts agree that ‘ No Follow ’ from these trusted domains still getting indexed and help your sites rankings .
My last point before I finish this weeks post , is that once you find a site that you want to post a link on , make sure you use the Google Advanced Search technique that I talked about a few weeks ago .
If you missed it then here is the link to that post : High Page Rank Links
These are just some ways of searching for back links , there are many more , but this should help you find some useful links for your sites .
Have a great day !

David gets steamed up about the state of the nation 's trains , and wonders if we Brits feel that they 're all we deserve
By Richard Cohen - July 13 , 2010
" Facts are the enemy of truth , " Don Quixote tweeted so very long ago -- and as if to prove his point , the Democratic Party in all its tawdry glory unloosed a barrage of facts in the direction of the slyly brilliant Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee and almost certainly to someday take his place in the conservative cable TV firmament .
For saying that the war in Afghanistan is " a war of Obama 's choosing , " he was , for a brief and shining moment , stating the absolute truth .
That moment has passed .
Steele has softened his critique .
These uncharacteristic second thoughts followed mortifying questions about his inner Republicanness by , among others , Sen. John McCain , Sarah Palin 's irritable Geppetto , who created her out of discarded principles and furious opportunism .
Steele has his own principles , however , and declared that he is not going to quit .
" I ain't going anywhere , " he said .
And he has n't .
Of course , Steele was right from the start .
His truth was the larger one , which is that enough time has elapsed so that the war in Afghanistan can be seen as Barack Obama's .
It began , as we all know , under the illustrious George W. Bush , who then got distracted by all that WMD in Iraq and veered off toward Baghdad .
But these are mere details , pesky facts with which we need not concern ourselves .
The truth is that Obama found this war on his doorstep , took it in , nursed and even escalated it and swaddled it in his own clothes : more troops , and still more on the way .
One can appreciate how Steele got his " facts " wrong .
It is how possession of the Vietnam War moved from Lyndon Johnson to Richard Nixon even though they both lacked absolute belief in the cause -- whatever exactly that once was .
Nixon , in fact , even had a secret plan to end the conflict and was furiously de-escalating , rapidly Vietnamizationing and frantically trying to disentangle himself and the nation from the war .
Still , when demonstrators gathered outside the White House , it was not to praise his peace efforts but to denounce him as a warmonger .
The rule in all these cases seems pretty apparent : Either end the war or own it .
As Steele intuited , Obama now reluctantly owns the war in Afghanistan .
He has embraced it with all the enthusiasm of a father of the bride at a shotgun wedding .
The president is no happy warrior -- not much of a warrior at all , to be upfront about it -- and so his fellow Democrats have resorted to ugly demagoguery to keep kicking the war back to where it began , the administration of the suddenly cherished George W. Bush .
To this end , Brad Woodhouse , the spokesman for the Democratic Party , accused Steele of " betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan " -- an ugly smear for which my colleague , E.J. Dionne Jr. , has already administered a well - deserved reprimand .
But the abominable Woodhouse is exhibit A in what , looking back , will be seen as the overselling of this particular war .
The very mention of the troops , as with the invocation of the hallowed word " fan " by the con artists of professional sports , is evidence that something awful is afoot .
A war that is self - evidently right , that is unquestionably worth the lives of Americans , does not have to be hyped or defended in such a squalid fashion .
There was even a bit of hype in the testimony of Gen. David Petraeus in his recent star turn before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
After stating that al - Qaeda had retreated to the " tribal areas of Pakistan , " he explained we nonetheless have to keep fighting in Afghanistan where , to paraphrase the general , al - Qaeda ai n't .
His testimony did not parse .
The reality is that we fight because we have been fighting .
Steele has since moved on .
He had intruded truth into partisan babble -- not merely a sin , but a truly bad career move .
Only one GOP chairman has gone on to the White House and that was George H.W. Bush , a multiplex of a public servant ( president , vice president , congressman , CIA director ) .
Times have changed though ; the media crave their fix of quotes from almost anyone , and Steele is glad to oblige .
For an entire news cycle he had Afghanistan just right and then , castigated by faded facts , he backed down .
A glorious career as a conservative yacker was on the line .
He was right on Afghanistan , but he would rather be rich .

Today is the day gun-rights advocates have had in their sights for a long time .
Starting today , Arizona residents at least 21 years old can carry a concealed weapon without a permit .
The change is part of a broad weapons law by state Sen.
Russell Pearce passed by the state Legislature in April that eases restrictions on concealed carry and stiffens penalties for committing a crime while carrying a concealed weapon .
The law is one of many passed by the state Legislature this past session that go into effect today .
Arizona joins Alaska and Vermont as the only states to allow concealed weapons without a permit .
However , the impact of the law is likely to be different in Arizona than those states because Arizona 's population is much larger and because the state has major metropolitan areas .
" It 's one thing to carry a loaded weapon in public when your closest neighbor is a mile or 5 miles away , " said Brian Malte , director of state legislation for the Brady Campaign , an interest group that lobbies for gun regulations .
" It 's a very different situation when you 're in a densely - populated urban environment . "
But that lack of precedent makes it difficult to predict the law 's impact .
Opponents say that without permitting and training , individuals might place themselves in situations where they might break the law or hurt themselves and others .
Proponents say that concealed carry is not substantially different from open carry , which the state already allows without a permit , and that the new law simply lets law - abiding citizens carry weapons in whatever way is most comfortable .
The law has already created changes for the firearms community , local businesses and police departments .
It has also galvanized gun-rights groups to seek further deregulation .
Concealed carry
The law 's passage is the culmination of several years of political maneuvering to ease gun regulations in Arizona .
During her time as governor , Janet Napolitano vetoed at least a dozen different weapons bills - several similar to the law going into effect today - that would have eased restrictions on gun owners .
But Napolitano's departure and the appointment of Gov. Jan Brewer in January 2009 gave the Legislature and gun-rights groups an ally in the executive office .
Brewer signed the law April 16 .
Last year , legislators passed a law allowing concealed - weapon permit holders to enter bars and restaurants .
In Arizona 's nearly 100 - year history as a state , lawmakers have done little to restrict individuals ' ability to carry weapons openly .
Proponents of the new law argue that open carry has not had any impact on public safety or gun violence and that concealed carry without a permit wo n't alter that .
" It 's really just a matter of preference , " said Rachel Parsons , a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association .
" If a woman wants to carry her gun in her purse , she should be allowed to do that as easily as carrying it on her hip . "
But opponents of the law say that concealed carry creates a different environment that could land untrained individuals in trouble .
" If a weapon is not concealed , you 're aware of a potential problem and it's easier to avoid it , " said Arnold Rudley , a gun owner who took a permit course on July 17 .
" With concealed carry , the knowledge of a potential problem goes away and you might walk into a bad situation without knowing it . "
What changes
The law makes several changes to the permitting process and rules regulating concealed carry :
��It removes the requirement that individuals have a permit to carry a concealed weapon anywhere that open carry is allowed .
Individuals will still need a permit to carry a concealed weapon in bars and restaurants and to qualify for reciprocal privileges when in states that require permits .
��The new law lets individuals obtain permits through means other than the eight - hour training course mandated under the previous law .
These other means include any NRA firearms - or safety - training course and a hunter - education course administered by the Arizona Game and Fish Department .
��It requires individuals to answer honestly if police ask if they are carrying a weapon .
The law also allows police officers to take temporary custody of a weapon during stops .
��It stiffens penalties for individuals who commit crimes while carrying a concealed weapon .
Effects
The law 's provisions have already reached into the firearms community , local businesses and law - enforcement offices .
Local companies that offer the training course for permits have seen business drop about 80 percent since the law was signed , said David White , owner and instructor of Desert West Firearms Training Center in Mesa .
Many of these companies have either lowered their prices or created new , shorter courses to get gun owners to conduct some training before carrying concealed weapons .
Several instructors said that although they support the right to carry weapons without restrictions , they think gun owners should be responsible enough to seek out training .
They say there are complex laws regarding the use of force .
Without any training , they say , individuals could wind up breaking the law .
" I get people coming through my door all the time who know absolutely nothing about the use of force , " said Doug Little , who owns and teaches at Armed Personal Defense Institute in Scottsdale .
" It 's important for them to understand the laws and consequences before they drop that thing in their pocket . "
Local law - enforcement offices have discussed the new law with patrol officers , but a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department said officers have not gone through any special training .
Businesses outside the firearms community have also adjusted to the new law .
Under a 2009 law , bars and restaurants wishing to ban firearms must post signs at their entrances to notify patrons .
The Department of Liquor Licensing and Control , which distributes the signs , has seen as many requests for the signs in the past 3 months as it saw since the law went into effect in October .
What 's next
Gun-rights advocates see the new law as a major victory in their push to further deregulate the carrying of weapons .
Some provisions of the law were removed as the bill wound its way through the Legislature .
Advocacy groups said they will pick up the fight next year to have those provisions passed .

Vorherige Story mit der Einbahnstraße brachte mir ein Erlebnis in Erinnerung .
Ich war derjenige , der verkehrtherum in der Einbahnstraße fuhr .
Mir kam dann einer entgegen , Benz - Bonze mit eingebauter Vorfahrt , und da ich ja verkehrtherum drin war , war für ihn klar , dass ich weg soll , er blieb also vor mir stehen , und gestikulierte , ich solle gefälligst verschwinden .
War aber ein bisserl blöd , weil ich wollte nicht .
Irgendwann wurds ihm zu bunt , er stieg aus und fing nun verbal an , auf mich einzuhacken , ich solle mich sofort ver ..... , weil wegen hat wichtigen Termin und eilig und so , und meine Einwände , dass ich das darf und es einfacher wäre , wenn er 3 Meter zurücksetzt , sich in die Einfahrt stellt und wartet , bis ich vorbeigefahren bin , brachten ihn nur zur Weissglut und er sähe das nicht ein und würde jetzt die Polizei rufen , stürmte in seinen Wagen , schnappte sein Handy und tat , wie angedroht .
Eine Weile später tauchte dann auch ein Streifenwagen an , und noch ehe die Beamten aussteigen konnten , war Benz - Bonze schon bei denen und gestikulierte und wetterte und zeterte und fühlte sich voll toll im Recht und ließ die Beamten nicht zu Wort kommen .
Ich blieb in meinem Wagen und besah mir das ganze , ein Beamter blickte zu mir , ich zuckte nur mit den Schultern und deutete auf den Benz - Bonzen .
Der Beamte nickte mit gen Himmel verdrehten Augen , sprach ein Machtwort , stieg in seinen Streifenwagen und fuhr wieder .
Benz - Bonze fuchtelte noch was herum und setzte dann zurück , machte Platz und ich fuhr grinsend an ihm vorbei , winkte noch mal freundlich zum Abschied .
Hätte er es direkt gemacht , hätte er vielleicht 30 Sekunden seiner Zeit verloren .
So dauerte das Spiel fast 30 Minuten .
Und die Moral von der Geschicht , lässt du den deutlich sichtbaren , weil großen und mit gelben Rundumleuchten leuchtenden Müllwagen mit der Sondergenehmigung für Einbahnstraßen durch , verpasst du deinen Termin nicht .

This week 's budget brings on an awesome economic and political moment .
The former Labour government had already committed to a greater and faster reduction in the budget deficit than any British government in modern times .
The coalition government wants to do more ; to nearly eliminate a structural budget deficit of 8 % of national output – some £ 116 bn – in five years .
Moreover , it wants spending cuts to take 80 % of the load .
No country has ever volunteered such austerity .
It is as tough a package of retrenchment as the IMF imposed on Greece , a country on the brink of bankruptcy .
It is twice as tough as the famously harsh measures Canada took between 1994 and 1997 .
It is three times tougher than Sweden 's measures between 1993 and 1995 .
In British terms , it is immeasurably tougher than what we did after the IMF crisis in 1976 or after the ERM crisis in 1992 .
If we are going to embark on such a course , there has to be a national consensus that it is right .
What is proposed , if we are to believe the pre-budget speeches and leaks , is the closest to an economic scorched earth policy we will ever have lived through .
If it is to work , we have to be prepared to accept not just enormous economic sacrifice , but to regard it as legitimate .
There has to be complete honesty about why the measures are being taken .
The reasons have to be unanswerable .
The economics must be unimpeachable .
The measures themselves have to be extremely skilfully implemented and seen to be fair .
This is not the case just now .
Of course the structural deficit has to be eliminated .
But Britain has time to make the change .
Sweden took 15 years to lower some departmental spending by 20 % , not the five years the government plans .
We are not in the position of Greece .
Britain has a diversified economy .
Our cumulative national debt is not large by international standards .
Uniquely , the term structure of our debt is very long – around 14 years .
Most of this year 's debt will be sold to British domiciled individuals and companies , so the international sovereign debt crisis has much less impact on us .
The level of interest on the national debt in five years ' time as a share of national output is more than manageable .
These are the truths about the situation ; to claim otherwise creates distrust .
I do n't think either coalition partner is aware of how high the stakes are being raised , the degree to which they are unnecessarily backing themselves into a corner , and how much the ground has to be prepared before launching the country on the unprecedented path they plan .
For example , each of the counter - arguments I have raised needs to be carefully argued against , not shouted down by hysterical remarks about the sovereign debt crisis or references to private lectures from the not infallible governor of the Bank of England .
Both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg know that their popularity will fall , but if the coalition really means what it says the consequence could be much worse .
The lack of necessity over what is planned could knock the Lib Dems back to where the Liberal party was in the 1950s – a party of the margins – and irredeemably rebrand the Conservatives as the nasty party .
The revival of liberal conservatism and the hopes raised by this unique experiment in coalition government will collapse .
George Osborne 's aggression is hard to understand .
The forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the outgoing Labour government 's plans were both credible and more than tough enough to arrive at budgetary sustainability .
To go beyond them with between £ 24bn and £ 50bn of extra spending cuts and tax rises , as is rumoured for Tuesday , is unconscionable and will rightly be challenged .
The ground has not been laid ; the economics are dubious even for deficit hawks ; the support tiny ; the implications dire .
It is not too late for a change of course or , at the very least , to reproduce the best of what the Canadians and Swedes did .
In neither country was deficit reduction portrayed as a necessity to keep a triple A credit rating on government debt , nor as a vendetta against a " bloated " public sector , as the coalition has suggested .
Rather , the measures were sold as a vital period of pain in order to create a platform for much - needed public spending growth in the future .
It was important for the legitimacy of both countries ' plans , as an intriguing series of essays , " Dealing With Debt " , from the thinktank CentreForum sets out , that the pain was implemented by parties of the centre and centre - left who believed in public spending .
The public was readier to believe the need for cuts .
The story in Canada and Sweden was that aggressive belt - tightening would release more spending in future .
As a result , both governments could propose short - term reductions in pensions , unemployment benefit , wider welfare benefits and public sector wages as part of the package and get grudging acceptance .
In neither country was any department or area of spending ring - fenced .
There were exceptions .
Both governments symbolically wanted to show their belief in spending even amid the cuts .
The Swedes boosted investment in universities , science and primary and secondry education , and while cutting unemployment benefit , they provided grants for 100,000 young people to go to university .
The Canadians made sure that the poorest in Canada were insulated from the cuts .
They also launched a national consultation to decide on which cuts and explain the rationale .
Even so , it was a hazardous exercise .
As John Springford , the essays editor comments , success depended upon a buoyant world economy .
Osborne is said to have studied the Canadian experience , hence his call for a period of national consultation between Tuesday 's budget and the autumn 's spending review , copying what was done in Ottawa .
The trouble is that the terms of the consultation preclude any genuine consultation ; the assumption is that spending is bad , the state needs to be smaller , nothing is more important than a triple A credit rating , and the British way of life has to change .
It is folly .
Not every penny of public spending is well spent .
There has to be restraint and the deficit must be lowered .
Wages , pensions and welfare transfers must take a short - term hit , as they did in Canada and Sweden .
But the government should also be investing in our future .
It should be raising taxes on those best able to contribute .
Every department should share in the pain .
I am surprised at the Liberal Democrats .
They have an obligation to their party , their tradition and the coalition to argue more fiercely for a better presented , fairer , more legitimate and more balanced approach to deficit reduction than the one that is promised .
And what is proposed is no good for the Tories either .
Number 10 and the Treasury believe the worst can be offset by aggressively low interest rates and more quantitative easing .
They will work to a degree .
But what is proposed still risks everything .
Politicians pay the price with lost office .
Millions of British will pay a higher price – the needless squandering of their lives .
American Crossroads GPS , a spin - off of a 527 group started by Karl Rove , has raised $ 5.1 million in June , its first month of operation .
Rove - linked group uses secret donors to fund attacks
A new political operation conceived by Republican operatives Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie formed a spinoff group last month that - thanks in part to its ability to promise donors anonymity - has brought in more money in its first month than the parent organization has raised since it started in March .
The new group , called American Crossroads GPS , has been telling donors their contributions would be used to dig up dirt on Congressional Democrats ’ “ expense account abuses ” and to frame the BP oil spill as “ Obama ’s Katrina . ”

The GPS group pulled in $ 5.1 million in June , its first month in operation , while the original American Crossroads , which has spent $ 600,000 on tough ads blistering Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , has pulled in $ 4.7 million since its launch .
American Crossroads was incorporated under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Service code , which requires it to disclose its contributions and expenditures on a monthly basis , but also gives it more flexibility in terms of how it can spend its cash , including allowing it to spend most of its money on ads attacking or supporting candidates .
American Crossroads GPS , on the other hand , is incorporated under Section 501 ( c ) 4 , which requires it to spend the bulk of its cash focusing on issues , but frees it from having to disclose the names of its donors .
In fact , it wo n’t be required to publicly report any of its finances until at least May 2011 .
According to a “ concept paper ” that was distributed last month to wealthy Republicans donors , American Crossroads GPS intends to build a “ micro- team (s ) of researchers and polling professionals ” and “ list development professionals and direct contact ( mail / phones ) consultants ” to develop and disseminate “ hard - hitting issue advocacy ” attack Democrats by “ exposing ObamaCare ” as well as “ the great ‘ stimulus ’ rip - off ” and “ the new federal bureaucrat elite – paid for by struggling private sector families . ”
A spokesman on Tuesday said American Crossroads GPS , combined with its parent group , intended to raise a combined total of “ approximately $ 50 million ” to attack Democrats and boost Republicans headed into the 2010 midterm elections .
But that seems to be a downgrading of ambitions , given that when American Crossroads publicly launched it boasted that it would raise between $ 50 million and $ 60 million , while the spin - off has set a budget of $ 43 million , according to the “ concept paper . ”
Jonathan Collegio , a spokesman for both groups , said Tuesday that “ we ’ve consistently said that we intend to raise at least $ 52 million overall for our efforts – the fact that we ’re raising it for two groups instead of one is a distinction without a difference . ”
Steven Law , the head of both Crossroads groups , announced in June that his team had started the GPS spin - off – and that the two groups raised a combined $ 8.5 million June – days after POLITICO revealed that American Crossroads raised just $ 200 in May , prompting mocking reports by liberal media outlets .
But the group had a much better June , bringing in $ 3.4 million and boosting the total it has raised since its inception to $ 4.7 million , according to a report it filed Tuesday with the IRS .
Law conceded that the anonymity of the new 501 ( c ) 4 GPS group was appealing for some donors , but added that was n’t the reason his team formed the spin - off .
“ The genesis of it from our perspective was that there are a number of things that are priorities for us that seemed to fit more into a 501 ( c ) 4 than a 527 , such as doing very legislatively focused issue advocacy activity which we will be undertaking in the next few months , ” Law said , adding that American Crossroads had already received more than $ 30 million in pledged donations .
But a veteran GOP operative familiar with the group ’s fundraising activities said the spin - off was formed largely because donors were reluctant to see their names publicly associated with giving to a 527 group , least of all one associated with Rove , who Democrats still revile for his role in running former President George W. Bush ’s political operation .
GPS ’s concept paper says that if it meets its fundraising goals , it will spend $ 18 million on “ issue advocacy , ” $ 15 million on “ targeted grassroots advocacy , ” $ 3 million on “ issue research , ” $ 2 million on polling and $ 5 million buying , renting and enhancing lists .
The paper says the GPS group will conduct “ in - depth research on congressional expense account Abuses , ” to blame Democrats for “ failed border controls ” and to frame the BP oil spill as “ Obama ’s Katrina . ”
But , Collegio insisted , “ Crossroads GPS does not invest in opposition research . ”
According to the paper , the group promises to “ build the highest - quality national list of center - right advocates ” by early August and to “ deploy advertising and other issue information in August / September in key markets . ”
“ We ’re on track with both of those efforts , ” Collegio said .
Law said GPS has hired an issues director – Steven Duffield , who has worked as a policy aide to the Republican National Committee and the Senate Republican Conference .
And Collegio added that American Crossroads political director - National Republican Congressional Committee veteran Carl Forti , whose consulting firm has been paid more than $ 15,000 by the 527 - is overseeing a “ Crossroads GPS micro- targeting effort . ”
That effort is focused on seven states - Colorado , Florida , Missouri , New Hampshire , Nevada , Ohio and Washington - according to a new website unveiled Tuesday .
Neither Collegio nor Law was willing to discuss much about the new group .
“ We ’re not inclined to get into much detail about the 501 ( c ) 4 on the financial side given its different reporting status , ” Law explained in an email .

The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month ruled that your employer has the right to monitor your text messages .

In this LastWatchdog guest post , Ã‚Â Elizabeth Charnock , CEO of evidence analytics firm Cataphora , points out that employer - monitoring is a time - honored practice .
By Elizabeth Charnock
Given what I do for a living Ã¢â‚¬â€œ conducting digital investigations of various types Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ I hear quite a bit of concern these days over the demise of privacy .
I have to admit that much of it baffles me .
Perhaps this is in part due to my fondness for old movies .
I love the classics for many reasons , but one of them is that they present many aspects of then - contemporary life in a non-self - conscious way .
As such , they provide a window into what has changed , what has stayed the same and what , to paraphrase the French , stays the same the more it changes .
For example , in the 1949 classic Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ A Letter to Three Wives , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  a young Kirk Douglas bemoans the corrupting influence of a new medium whose sole purpose is to influence the American public into believing that happiness can only be achieved through consumption .
The medium in question ?
Radio .
Media change
The office mailroom is another staple of old movies .
In the prehistoric days before email , interoffice mail circulated in manila envelopes with holes in them , secured by string .
There were no cell phones in the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœ40s , hence the often used device of a character whispering into the phone , so their neighbors would be less likely to overhear them .
It is impossible to argue that privacy in the workplace has decreased since the days of the mailroom clerk .
All that has really changed is the medium .
While it could be said that lack of technology was behind that lack of privacy , it does not follow that more technology implies more privacy .
The truth is most people want privacy for Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ the good guys .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
They do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want privacy for terrorists , thieves , sexual predators and other Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ bad guys .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
Which leads us to an unfortunate problem : the only way to separate the good guys from the bad is to empirically observe them .
Why employers watch
Taking that to the workplace , studies show that a majority of American corporations have deployed systems to monitor employee communication .
Two reasons are behind this trend :
1. Many types of Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ badÃ¢â‚
¬Â employee behavior can backfire on the company in the form of lawsuits , fines and damage to its reputation .
In a challenging economic climate , employers are increasingly anxious to avoid such self - inflicted problems .
2. History shows us that incidents of employee fraud rise significantly during down times and employees have greater financial stresses .
For many , there is a big difference between a computer program scanning their communications looking for evidence of specific bad acts , such as sexual harassment , leaking company trade secrets or distribution of child pornography , and a human randomly reading emails and IMs .
In the former situation , if you are nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t doing anything wrong , it is a non-event ; in the latter , all manner of embarrassing or awkward things can potentially be brought to light .
Additionally , there is a common misconception that equates such automated monitoring with employers snooping on their employees to see who is goofing off .
Or just for the heck of it .
The truth is that few employers have the inclination , time or money to do this .
Indeed , most employees simply are nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t interesting enough to merit it .
And in the case of those few employees are , anyone looking for such information can satisfy their curiosity on Twitter or Facebook .
People say personal privacy has gone to hell because of these new social media sites .
While I can see the point of this argument , I believe it too is misguided ; I believe itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s more of an issue of the scope and the type of audience .
For example , today someone tweets they bought a great new pair of sandals ; in the days before social media , you would have just worn the sandals where the whole town or company could see them .
The audience and reach may have changed , but the act remains the same .
A duty to keep up
Organizations have a duty to ensure their systems are not being abused .
Since most communications are now digital , so must be the monitoring that is essential to avoid problems that have the potential to cripple an organization .
That said , it is important to acknowledge that monitoring systems can collect private information that the employer does not need to know .
This is a risk employees take when they entrust personal information to a system that is owned by someone else .
The employer , however , should also ensure that any sensitive information Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ whether it belongs to employer or employee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is appropriately handled .
No matter how good technology is , technology alone is never the complete solution .
Companies should create and enforce policies that make it clear to employees what their duties are , what the employerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s obligations are and how they each affect the other .
A little education can go a very long way to overcoming the distrust that arises when employers try a stealth approach to this very sensitive issue .

An Italian journalist who was detained by the Israel Defense Forces following the raid on the Gaza - bound flotilla says his credit card was used to purchase items after it was confiscated by the Israeli authorities .

Manolo Luppichini was aboard the Sfintoni -8000 , one of the smaller boats in the flotilla , when the naval commandos took it over .
" Nobody was killed on our boat , " Luppichini said in a telephone call from Italy .
" We tried a little passive resistance around the boat 's bridge .
The soldiers fired paint balls and two people were hurt by stun [ taser ] guns . "
After the Israel Navy took over the boat , he said , the soldiers searched every passenger and confiscated everything they found .
" They took two cameras , microphones , a stand and other equipment from me and my photographer .
They took one of the cameras as I was taking photographs , " says Luppichini , who was working for Italy 's RAI - 3 television and an Italian - Swiss television channel when he was detained .
" Afterward they took my wallet , passport , bag and all personal effects on the boat , " he says .
Luppichini was taken to Ashdod port and then transferred to a Be'er Sheva prison compound , where he says he received a form saying his passport had been impounded .
On June 2 he was taken to an Immigration Authority compound and on the following day was deported .
Although he showed the document proving Israel had confiscated his passport , he says he was deported without receiving any of his property or identification papers back .
A few days ago Luppichini discovered that while he was confined in Be'er Sheva and after he was back in Italy - a day after his deportation - purchases were made with his credit card , which the Israeli authorities had confiscated .
One purchase was from a vending machine in Tel Aviv for about NIS 10 on June 2 , he says .
Another purchase , for NIS 240 , was made in Gedera 's Village Market - while Luppichini himself was in Bologna , Italy .
" The sums were not large , " he says , " among other things because it 's a rechargeable credit card that had only 80 euros on it .
But in principle it's theft , for all intents and purposes . "
Luppichini has written a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , President Shimon Peres , the foreign and defense ministers and to Israel 's ambassador and consuls in Italy on the matter .
Luppichini says he wants to know who used his credit card , along with why and how .
He is also demanding that all of his equipment be returned to him immediately .
The IDF spokesman released a statement saying that the flotilla passengers ' personal belongings had been loaded onto the Turkish planes on which they were flown out of the country .
All the magnetic media was confiscated for security reasons and the IDF is considering whether these items will be returned .
If a Foreign Ministry and police inquiry leads to the suspicion that anyone has stolen Luppichini 's credit card , the matter will be dealt with severely .

Funds for $ 10 k fee came from military pay , tax refunds , according to state 's top law enforcement agency ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/11/2010 , 2:58 pm PT
An investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division ( SLED ) , the state 's top law enforcement agency , has concluded that no charges will be filed against Alvin Greene , the mysterious and unverifiable winner of the Democratic Party 's nomination for the U.S. Senate , in relation to the $ 10,440 filing fee the unemployed military vet paid to get onto the party 's June 8th primary ballot .
In that election , the unknown Greene was reported --- by the 100 % unverifiable ES&S e-voting system --- to have defeated former four - term state legislator and U.S. Circuit Court Judge Vic Rawl 59 % to 41 % despite having failed to campaign for the nomination , nor even having a campaign website .
Questions have arisen as to how the jobless Greene , who was recently appointed a public defender in a felony obscenity case he faces , was able to afford the filing fee for the U.S. Senate race .
As noted by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , which requested an investigation into the matter , Section 7-25-200 of the SC Code of Laws prohibits anyone from accepting or offering " either directly or indirectly , money , a loan of money , or any other thing of value ... as inducement to file as a candidate for any state or federal election office . "
Greene , who lives with his father , maintains he used money saved from military pay to cover the fee .
Some , including both state Republicans and South Carolina 's Democratic U.S. House Rep. James Clyburn ( SC ) , have stated the possibility that Greene was a " plant " on the ballot , given a public poll taken in May , as cited by Rawl campaign manager Walter Ludwig here at The BRAD BLOG , just three weeks weeks before the election , which showed Rawl trailing SC 's incumbent Republican Sen.
Jim DeMint by just 7 points , 50 to 43 % .
However , even the " plant " theory can't explain Greene 's nearly 20 - point " victory " as reported in the June 8th election results .
It 's the very last paragraph of CNN 's report on SLED clearing Greene , however , which , for the moment , raises both our eyebrow and , possibly , a curious red flag in the results of the Republican - controlled state 's investigation into Greene 's filing fee ...
Though the law enforcement agency said it determined that Greene used his own money to pay the party 's filing fee , the South Carolina attorney general 's office told CNN that it never received a request from SLED to subpoena Greene 's bank records .
Without having subpoenaed Green 's bank records to determine if he really did save up those funds as he claims , how does the state know where the money came from ?
According to AP 's report , which also notes that the law enforcement agency did not subpoena Greene 's bank records , SLED Chief Reggie Lloyd tells says that Greene cooperated with investigators , apparently allowing them to review his bank records in some fashion :
[ W ] hen state agents reviewed Greene 's bank accounts , they found an October deposit of nearly $ 6,000 , which was Greene 's military exit pay , and about $ 3,000 deposited early this year from state and federal tax refunds , Lloyd said .
The records matched Greene 's story that the 32 - year - old candidate , who has been collecting unemployment benefits since he left the military in August , was able to afford the fee because he saved his money and lived frugally .
" He clearly does not have someone paying him .
He just decided to take his money and run for U.S. Senate .
There 's no big conspiracy , " Lloyd said .
Greene said Friday that SLED 's findings vindicated him .
" It was just as I said : It came from the Army , " Greene said Friday .
" I 'm happy . "
The investigation , however , and the failure to subpoena bank records , has failed to satisfy everyone , including a Republican state lawmaker , as AP reports :
Lloyd had said that agents would use a new law allowing them to issue administrative subpoenas to force financial institutions to produce records during the investigation of financial crimes .
But a spokesman for the state attorney general 's office , whose authorization is needed for the subpoenas , says no applications were ever received .
Rep. Chip Limehouse , the state lawmaker who asked state police to investigate , says he's not satisfied with their probe and will continue to ask questions about where Greene got the money for his filing fee .

For his part , Rawl has largely not focused on the curious circumstances behind Greene 's appearance on the ballot .
Instead , he has focused on what he describes as " systemic software problems " on the oft - failed , easily - hacked ES&S voting system as the reason for Greene 's otherwise inexplicable win , even as he was not allowed by the company or state officials to examine the machines or tabulators prior to their being scrubbed for state run-off elections just ten days after the June 8th election .
A number of statistical and election integrity experts have cited the " staggering " disparities in the 11 - point difference between paper - based absentee results in the election and those from the unverifiable touch - screen voting machines used on Election Day , describing what they see as " clear signs of election fraud . "
Following the race , and a five - hour hearing on his election protest before the Executive Board of the state 's Democratic Party two weeks ago , Rawl has been outspoken about the problems with South Carolina 's unverifiable voting system .
" The issues we raised about the lack of election integrity in South Carolina are real , " he said in a recent statement , " and they are not going away unless people act . "

Enough with the phony war records , politicians .
I 'm talking to you Dick Blumenthal , and you , too , Mark Kirk .
They 're not the first to concoct valorous deeds performed on the battlefield , use them to propel a political campaign , and then get exposed and embarrassed .
But their example is reason enough to make one simple change to election law that would end this charade : have candidates submit their military records to the Federal Election Commission .
The FEC was established as an independent regulatory body in 1975 and it already collects financial information , and investigates and audits campaigns .
So collecting and vetting military records would hardly be a stretch .
Actual investigations of claims like Blumenthal 's and Kirk 's would probably be exceedingly rare and mostly unnecessary , as the very fact of FEC oversight would discourage politicians from making such exaggerations in the first place .
Knowing that someone was watching , and that lying about your war record was as quick and easy to expose as an illegal campaign contribution , you 'd have to be reckless or insane to do it .
And what about those politicians who 've been lying for years ?
Well , if they have ambitions for a political future , they 'll have to 'fess up quickly .
This will have the corollary benefit of getting any admissions out of the way early , so campaigns can be about actual issues .
Maybe the scandal - hungry press will actually cover those issues .
And maybe we 'll be spared the unctuous sanctimony that disgraced politicians like Kirk and Blumenthal resort to when exposed -- corralling the local VFW for a photo op , wrapping themselves in the flag , and whining that their military service is being " denigrated . "
It would be a better world for everybody .

“ There ’s nothing I can really point to that we should n’t have done based on what we knew at the time . ”

Dr. Chu , former director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , said : “ When things are unfolding , there are lots of possibilities and false starts .
If you knew the right path at the beginning , could it have been done a little faster ?
Probably . ”
He said he became involved in the early days of the spill response as a scientific diagnostician  he used the term “ kibbitzer ”  and not as a decision maker .
Early on , he suggested the use of high - energy gamma rays to see inside the wrecked blowout preventer , providing data that helped guide later steps at controlling the oil flow .
His active involvement in decision making in BP ’s Houston control room began in early May after he raised a number of technical points about the blowout in a meeting with President Obama and advisers in the White House Situation Room .
“ You better get down there , ” the president said , according to an aide who was in the meeting .
Dr. Chu has since made six extended trips to the gulf , conferring with his own scientific team as well as top BP engineers and executives in the company ’s command center .
He spends several hours a day on the problem , on the telephone or in meetings with his advisers and with BP officials .
He is not formally part of the chain of command in the spill response , but carries the authority of Mr. Obama as well as his own considerable intellectual heft .
His role gradually deepened as he assembled a team of scientists from the Department of Energy laboratories , universities and other government agencies .
By late May , his confidence had grown and he was giving orders to BP officials , including his demand to stop the top kill effort even though some BP engineers believed it could still succeed .

The Murder of Natalya Estemirova Rights Activists Doubt Moscow's Explanation
This week , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that investigators have identified and are hunting for the killer of human rights activists Natalya Estemirova .
Many , though , think he 's wrong .
For one , the primary suspect is dead .
For another , no one believes he did it .
Many have proposed that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hoax .
Others claim that only half of it is , which seems more plausible .
Can the film 's old footage of not - yet - famous street artists , like Shepherd Fairey and Swoon , really be fake ?
Exactly how elaborate could this ruse be ?
The new FaceTime video calling feature of iPhone 4 does not require mobile service after first use , enabling users to establish video chat from any WiFi hotspot , even while in Airplane Mode .
In reviewing FaceTime and mobile performance , AppleInsider originally reported that that making a FaceTime call requires an activated phone with service .
However , that 's only true for the first FaceTime session made from the phone .
Subsequent calls to FaceTime contacts , including users you 've never contacted before , can be placed with mobile service turned off completely , such as when flying on a plane with WiFi service ( where regulations prevent users from placing mobile phone calls . )
Readers have reported being able to connect via FaceTime from locations where they have no mobile service ( including an airplane ) .
Sure enough , we could successfully set up test calls between two iPhone 4 users across the country while both were in Airplane Mode with only WiFi turned on .
It is also possible to call , without any mobile service , a new contact you 've never previously established a FaceTime chat with , although this must be done from Contacts ( create a contact if necessary , then open it and hit the FaceTime button ) .
The standard phone dialer keypad offers no option to call a number using FaceTime directly ( yet ) .
How FaceTime works
Sources say the reason FaceTime needs initial phone service is because the first time it ever places a video call , it sends a message to Apple 's gatekeeper server , which then registers the user 's phone number as a FaceTime - capable number .
After registering , the phone number likely " works more or less like an E.164 alias in a H.323 call , " according a developer who works with video conferencing equipment .
It 's likely that Apple uses a mechanism similar to Back To My Mac to re-register the network location of iPhone 4 users so that they can accept incoming calls from any hotspot without manually logging into a " Buddy List , " a solution that would enable FaceTime to work without a mobile carrier .
BTMM enables MobileMe users to set up a secure IP v6 tunnel back to their home network from any remote location , without needing to open up firewall ports or expose any information publicly .
Apple has n't yet presented any developer documentation explaining how FaceTime does its magic , but it has announced plans to openly release the specification in a way that anyone can implement .
Existing video conferencing standards
H.323 is the ITU standard for videoconferencing over a LAN , ISDN ( H.320 ) , or other IP network .
A very low bit rate relative of the standard ( H.324 ) was adapted for mobile networks to result in the 3GPP 's 3G - 324 M , a circuit switched video chat standard that works over 3G networks ( and is built into most Nokia phones ) .
FaceTime is based upon the more modern H.264 video codec ( 3G - 324 M uses H.263 " DiVX - era " ) for more efficient delivery of better quality video .
It is also packet switched ( an IP network ) rather than circuit switched ( a phone system connection ) 3G - 324 M , meaning it can operate over WiFi without paying for mobile bandwidth .
In the future , FaceTime will also be able to work over 3G and 4G mobile networks as well , Apple says .
Using packet switching also makes FaceTime potentially compatible with non-phone devices ( like iPod touch ) as well as computers running Apple 's iChat AV or compatible software .

When one officer under his command attempted to stop a convoy of drug smugglers , he had him arrested and eventually killed at the hands of the men whose activities he had been trying to curtail , it is claimed .
I strongly disagree with Barbara Ellen 's premise that men accused of rape should not be given anonymity ( " Do n't give men anonymity on rape " , Comment ) .
A friend was so accused some years ago .
He was a successful businessman who had divorced .
He kept in close contact with his former wife and did all possible both emotionally and financially to support his family .
After the split , he entered into a new relationship .
When this ended , presumably in a fit of pique , she reported him for rape .
He was arrested , charged and kept on remand in prison for some six months until friends could raise surety .
His trial ended when the judge threw out the case .
He was identified in the local press , vilified and lost his health , business and respect .
His young children also became aware , encouraged by his ex-wife .
After his release , he suffered a heart attack .
He was fortunate to survive .
His " victim " is still out there enjoying her life , presumably having not suffered from her lying rape accusations .
Come on , Ms Ellen , get real .
Anonymity for both parties is a must unless expressly requested otherwise .

Barbara Ellen says that " while men are more likely to be falsely accused of rape , they are also , in far greater numbers , the perpetrators of it " .
I see .
In order to maximise rape convictions , it 's an acceptable trade - off that the odd innocent bloke has his ( and his family 's ) life ruined ?
I do n't think so .
Let 's have anonymity for rape suspects now , please .

There may be a gender divide on the government side but there is no such divide among Labour MPs .
Indeed , neither of my male colleagues who spoke in the debate supported the government 's surprising and wrongheaded proposal to extend anonymity to rape defendants alone .
This is because they all understand that the Tory - Lib Dem coalition proposal sends a powerful signal to rape victims , mainly women and children , that they , uniquely among victims of crime , are not to be believed .
The prime minister told the House of Commons that a lot of people are falsely accused of rape ( Hansard , 9 June 2010 ) .
In fact , there is no evidence to suggest more false allegations are made in rape cases than in other categories of crime .
Tory women
MPs spoke against this proposal with power and eloquence , as did opposition MPs .
I hope they will join us in preventing this retrograde step which will deter victims from coming forward and more rapists getting away with this terrible crime .

Most women tend not to report rape , but those who do , such as me , partly do so to ensure that the rapist 's friends and family know what he did .
We know that the chances of him being convicted and sentenced are low .
Women like us do n't report rape for revenge .
We report rape and go through the trauma of a court case to ensure he never rapes again .
The thought of my rapist 's name being kept anonymous would have prevented me from putting myself through the " second " rape , ie the court case .
The anonymity bill would , to my mind , give potential rapists the green light to go ahead and rape as many women as they like .
Name and address supplied
At Family Matters , we see around 700 clients a year .
Approximately 170 are rape victims .
I believe this law would dramatically change the present landscape for reporting rape : at best , only 14 - 20 % of women report rape .
Given that a quarter of the rape victims we see are girls under 16 , it seems certain that some men target these girls specifically .
I can see no argument for giving them anonymity .

You might call Matt Taibbi ’s angry response , on the Rolling Stone Web site , to Lara Logan ’s comments on CNN about how reporters ought to behave a rant — but doing so would imply that he was overreacting , and , as heated as his tone was , he ’s not , really .
So it ’s more like a jeremiad .
Logan , who is CBS ’s chief foreign correspondent , said that she was n’t sure that she would have used the story Michael Hastings , the Rolling Stone writer , had in his hands after spending time with General Stanley McChrystal and his crew .
“ Well , it really depends on the circumstances , ” Logan said .
What circumstances ?
She does n’t quite say ; instead , she immediately launches into what Taibbi calls the part of the interview that made him “ really furious , ” as well it should have : her suggestion that Hastings is a liar .
Hastings , Logan said , “ if you believe him ” — and does she have any solid knowledge of why we should n’t ? —“ says that there were no ground rules laid out .
That does n’t make sense to me . ”
What does n’t make sense is the way Logan contradicts herself , first saying that she can’t imagine the people around McChrystal talking without explicit ground rules ( “ I know these people .
They never let their guard down like that .
To me , something does n’t add up here .
I just — I do n’t believe it ” ) and then , seconds later , when Howard Kurtz asks if there is an “ unspoken agreement ” about not reporting embarrassing “ insults and banter , ” saying “ Yes , yes absolutely , there is an element of trust . ”
So which is it — Hastings must be lying because he said no ground rules were stated , or Hastings is a bad child because he did n’t respect an unspoken assumption that you ’ve been operating under ?
It is also low of her to disparage Hastings for not being a soldier : “ Michael Hastings has never served his country the way McChrystal has . ”
They also serve who only stand and wait for our military and political leaders to say the things that the public needs to know .
McChrystal was not a knight riding across the plain ; he was an officer subject to civilian control .
The most important circumstance , and the reason why Rolling Stone was quite right to publish the article , is that we have a war going on .
We have been in the midst of a debate about its expansion and extent and how it is being waged — and why it is being waged , which is a question for us , not just the generals .
And let ’s be clear : this is not the story of a conquering hero brought down by a non -job - related foible .
McChrystal used bad language , but he also said bad and destructive things that raised questions about the control and direction of our policy and our respect for our allies .
( It ’s not always O.K. to insult the French . )
And he has not succeeded in Afghanistan .
Logan asked , “ Is what General McChrystal and his aides were doing so egregious that he deserved — to , I mean , to end a career like McChrystal ’s ? ”
The answer is yes ; the only pity would be if his dismissal is not accompanied by a thorough questioning of our policies .
General Petraeus , in hearings to confirm him as McChrystal ’s replacement today , said that the “ tough fighting ” in Afghanistan would get tougher in the next few months as our new campaigns began to “ reduce the enemy ’s freedom of action . ”
How long is that arc ?
The war has been going on for almost nine years .
Logan was saying , in her way , the same thing David Brooks did in his column last week .
According to Brooks , people in power are always saying things that might get them in trouble when he ’s around , but he understands why and wo n’t tell on them .
Brooks , never one to miss an opportunity for an elegy to a fairy - tale past in which “ a culture of reticence ” supposedly prevailed , writes that reporters knew how to be polite and discreet until 1961 — between the end of the Chatterley ban and Theodore White ’s first “ The Making of the President ” book .
As I wrote last week , this was never entirely true ; look at the trouble Patton got in .
To the extent that it was and is , one would like to have generals and politicians clever enough to recognize the world they live in , and handle it accordingly — this is a point Hendrik Hertzberg made last week .
Patton , in addition to his habit of saying awful things in the presence of reporters , had , as a young officer , been an expert in the design and deployment of the cavalry saber .
But he did n’t achieve what he did in the Battle of the Bulge by complaining that the Germans were n’t fighting with swords .
We are not going to win in Afghanistan by pretending that our generals , our goals , or the corrupted Afghan government we are propping up are what they are n’t , either .

True Blood ’s newest vampire , Franklin , played by British actor James Frain ( of The Tudors ) , is a delightfully sick bounty hunter who falls madly in love with a human , Tara ( Rutina Wesley ) .
He ’s a possessive fellow with a sadistic streak , and we spoke to Frain about playing him for laughs , his weirdly long fangs , and what the heck a British vamp is doing in Louisiana .
Did you know , initially , what this character was all about ?
No , they did n’t actually tell me much at all .
I went to an audition and we had a couple of scenes — the first meeting with Tara at the bar , and then one of the scenes in which I ’m really distraught at her trying to get away , and really , there was nothing about it that seemed like it was n’t just a torturous romantic story .
It was n’t until I started filming it , and started getting these scripts coming in , when I was like , Oookay !
All right !
I guess I ’m a psycho .
Did that make you happy ?
I thought it was fun .
I ’d have a line like , “ Look how fast I can text ! ”
And I mean , that was just hilarious .
I hoped that the audience would be onboard for the ride .
It seems to be working , and I ’m happy that the humor came out .
How did they actually film that texting scene ?
It ’s weird , the vamp - speed stuff you have to do in super - slow motion , and then they speed it up .
If you do it in regular speed , it does n’t work .
So have to keep super still and do it very slow .
How did you and Rutina Wesley ( Tara ) do that without cracking up ?
I did laugh .
And they just kept filming until I stopped !
That scene was so much fun , and that had to come through as part of it .
Your fangs are scragglier than other vampires ’.
Mine were crazy long .
I do n’t know why — that ’s the design choice they made , but I do n’t know where it came from .
I went and got them fitted , and they handed them to me , and I did n’t know until I got to set that everyone else had smaller fangs than I did .
I was like , Does this mean I get to go to the front of the lunch queue ?
And you sound really silly indeed when you talk with them .
I think they were trying to make some comment about the character .
It almost feels like Franklin and Tara are a good match .
If there ’s any feeling of that , then that ’s fantastic !
He ’s just trying to get her to wake up and see that this is the relationship she ’s been dreaming of !
[ Laughs . ]
You seem to specialize in playing bad guys .
Yeah , creepy characters .
I ’ve definitely been there before .
But this guy ’s pretty special .
I did n’t really think of him as a vampire , but more of as this abusive boyfriend guy who happens to have gotten bit and has strange sleeping habits .
Your next big project is The Cape , a new superhero show on NBC .
Yes .
If you can believe it , I play the bad guy .
Did you know that you were going to use your own accent in True Blood ?
Normally , I like the idea of doing the American thing , and I was assuming that they ’d want to go with the Louisiana accent .
But I got this note saying , “ Do it in my own accent , ” and I thought , That ’s kind of fun .
But no one ever mentions it in the show , no one ever says , “ Are you English or what ?
What the fuck ’s going on with you ?
You sound weird ! ”
But I like that no one mentions it ; in this world of vampires , and werewolves , and heinous , incredible things , one of the strangest things to me is that there ’s this British guy , and no one talks about how he ’s a Brit !
By virtue of its own simplicity , it becomes the weirdest thing about the show .

NEW YORK - After a six - year struggle , domestic workers here won a huge victory over decades of a racist and sexist second class status when state lawmakers finally passed a law on July 1 , ensuring that this state ’s maids , nannies , butlers and other homecare workers are afforded the same rights and protections as the vast majority of other workers .
Governor David Paterson , calling the legislation “ historic , ” said that it would “ enshrine in law the basic rights of a class of workers that has historically and wrongfully been excluded from such protections : the domestic workers who care for our children , clean our homes , and provide the elderly with companionship . ”
According to Priscilla Gonzalez , director of Domestic Workers United , “ The struggle is n’t over , but this is still a victory because domestic workers are recognized for the first time and we have a strong foundation to build upon and that will allow us to build more . ”
Until now , domestic workers have been excluded from all labor standards established by the 1935 National Labor Relations Law , enacted in 1935 .
That law specifically excluded agricultural and domestic workers , the vast majority of whom were female African Americans .
The racist southern Dixiecrat establishment fought to keep these workers in an unprotected subordinate status , in the words of Gonzalez , “ so that these populations would n’t be able to exert any political power . ”
Today the dynamic of racism , sexism and especial oppression is still relevant , though the demographics have changed : in New York , more than 95 percent of domestic workers are “ women of color , ” mainly immigrants from less industrially - developed countries .
With the passage of the new law , more than 200,000 workers won the rights to overtime pay , disability benefits , unemployment insurance and workers ’ compensation .
Additionally , the state ’s labor law has been amended to ensure that the workers receive at least one day off per week and , after a year of employment , a small amount of paid leave .
The new rights mark the culmination of six years of struggle by DWU , which leads the fight , and allied labor unions , religious groups and community organizations .
However , the changes in the law , which will be enacted after Paterson signs the legislation , which was introduced by Assembly Member Keith Wright , and State Senator Diane Savino , are welcome , but , in the eyes of the workers and their advocates , do not go far enough .
DWU and its allies are fighting for a domestic workers bill of rights , which includes all of the rights won , but others , such as the right to paid sick time , vacation days and other benefits that could normally be negotiated through collective bargaining .
However , DWU pointed out the impracticality of such an atomized workforce being able carry out any collective bargaining .
“ We were fighting for sick days because a domestic worker on her own would never be able to negotiate that without putting her job on the line which is what happens all the time , ” Gonzales said .
“ Somebody tries to get a day off to go get a mammogram and they ’re fired .
The alternative is working through illness , basically .
[ Collective bargaining ] is not practical , because there ’s no collective . ”
As a compromise , the legislature agreed to ask the Department of Labor to do a study on the feasibility of collective bargaining .
DWU plans to continue to push for the rest of the bill of rights .
State Democrats have been far more receptive to the needs of these workers than the Republicans .
For example , in the state Senate , all of the Democrats , but only three members of the Republican caucus out of 30 , voted for the bill .
When several right - wing Democrats helped the Republicans stage a brief 2009 coup d’etat in the Senate , the bill was scuttled for months .
“ Now with this bill setting precedent in the country , ” Gonzalez said , “ it boosts efforts in other states like California and Colorado , where people are fighting for similar legislation .
And it also begins to open up the conversation around expansion of labor protection for other sectors of workers that have been excluded , like agriculture . ”

The Viacom copyright infringement case against Google and YouTube has been a long strange journey since it started , but it looks like the first major chapter is over : the federal court today ruled that Google falls under the " safe harbor " provision of the DMCA which protects service providers from liability for user content .
Roughly , that means
Google is n't liable for copyright infringement on YouTube in : it can only be liable for infringing specific copyrighted works , and since YouTube pulls videos as soon as anyone complains , it can't get in trouble .
Of course , Viacom is n't too happy about this decision and has vowed to appeal , but we think it makes sense -- otherwise Viacom could sue and win for things Google did n't even know about , like , say , the music videos Viacom employees covertly uploaded themselves and then demanded be removed .
We 'll see what happens -- in the meantime , we 'll be celebrating by watching as much YouTube as possible .
On its face , the DISCLOSE
Act sounds like a good idea : by forcing big political advertisers to name the group behind their message , a greater level of transparency becomes possible .
But dig a bit deeper into the particulars of the legislation and , according to the American Civil Liberties Union , red flags aplenty appear .
The Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections ( DISCLOSE )
Act is a direct response to the Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC , which lifted restrictions on corporate funding of campaign advertising .
In the wake of the court ’s action , President Obama cautioned that it could herald “ a potential corporate takeover of our elections ” and urged Democrats to prepare new campaign finance legislation .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ruling meant that corporations foreign and domestic would be allowed to run political television advertisements ahead of national and local elections without telling voters who was paying for them , Obama said .
The purpose of the DISCLOSE
Act is to require groups to declare who paid for political advertising , including the naming of donors who ’ve given as little as $ 600 , according to the ACLU .
“ Demanding disclosure for such a small amount of money violates AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ right to privacy , and will have a chilling effect on free speech in our elections , ” the rights group declared in a July 1 post .
“ Regulation like this can become a serious problem for supporters of controversial issues where anonymity is not just a matter of preference or convenience .
The harassment and attacks on members of the civil rights movement show that anonymity can in fact be a matter personal safety . ”
They add that the DISCLOSE
Act contains exceptions for large , mainstream groups with more than 500,000 members , which would not have to provide some details when buying political advertising .
The ACLU contends such exceptions pose a threat to smaller , more controversial groups , which may see their right to political speech run over by the disclosure requirements .
“ The ACLU supports the disclosure of large contributions to candidates as long as it does not have a chilling effect on political participation , but the DISCLOSE
Act would inflict unnecessary damage to free speech rights and does not include the proper safeguards to protect AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ privacy , ” said ACLU legislative and policy attorney Michael Macleod - Ball , in a media advisory .
“ The bill would severely impact donor anonymity , especially those donors who give to smaller and more controversial organizations . ”
Republicans are almost unanimously opposed to the bill .
Most in the GOP credit the Citizens United decision as a triumph of free speech and not , as the ACLU and other groups have said , an actual threat to the integrity of U.S. elections .

“ You ’d think that reducing corporate and even foreign influence over our elections would not be a partisan issue , but of course this is Washington in 2010 , ” Obama said on Monday , slamming Republican opposition and urging Senate Democrats to pass the bill .
“ This should n’t be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue , ” the president argued in early May .
“ This is an issue that goes to whether or not we will have a government that works for ordinary Americans – a government of , by , and for the people . ”

Arpaio brought with him a belt - fed .50 - caliber machine gun that can shoot accurately up to a mile as a display of the kind of force he would use if anyone hurts a deputy .
" I am trying to send a message to Mexico , " he said .
" We will not take anyone hurting our deputies .
We will fight back . "

The 7 - year - old gun has not yet been used , Arpaio said .
" It is more for defense . "
Nor have any of his deputies yet been harmed in a border scuffle .
" We have been very lucky , " he said .
The sheriff said criminals smuggling drugs and immigrants across the border are now carrying AK - 47s along the swath of desert that is seldom patrolled .
The Barry M. Goldwater Range is used for shooting and cannot be patrolled without permission from the United States Air Force .
That gives smugglers an easy path for entry , Arpaio said .
Often smugglers cut through Vekol Valley east of Gila Bend , then come north to vehicles waiting on Interstate 8 , he said .
Those usually head to Phoenix on back roads .
The volunteers and paid deputies arrived in about 20 vehicles to stage the first - ever suppression operation in the desert .
By 8 p.m. Thursday , the deputies had made two arrests at traffic stops , but those were outside their staging area .
One was nabbed for a criminal traffic violation , and the other had a warrant for a criminal traffic violation .
Arpaio 's group planned to stay until 2 a.m. today .
He said the timing of the suppression was not connected to Thursday 's hearing challenging Senate Bill 1070 , Arizona 's immigration law that makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It requires officers engaged in a stop , detention or arrest to , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
The law goes into effect July 29 , which is when Arpaio 's 17th crime - suppression operation is scheduled .
Arpaio said the operation will go on even if the law is struck down .
A team of University of Georgia scientists said Tuesday that they had traced a 15 - mile - long undersea concentration of oil and gas near the BP leak , adding to evidence that the biggest spill in U.S. history is n't just sloshing around on the surface .
Researchers , who had just returned from a two - week expedition aboard F.G. Walton Smith , said the oily undersea zone , three miles wide and 600 feet thick at its core , contained levels of methane gas 10,000 times greater than the norm .
“ I ’ve never seen concentrations of methane this high ” in the Gulf of Mexico , said marine sciences professor Samantha Joye .
Hectic activity by oil - consuming microbes has depleted oxygen levels in and near the petroleum concentration , which diminishes with distance from the blown - out BP well .
“ The entire water column has dispersed oil , ” said Joye , whose sail was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
“ The system as a whole has been substantially perturbed by this event . ”
In a news briefing and in blog posts during the voyage , Joye described the oily area , which forms about 600 feet above the seafloor , as irregular and highly diffuse , like a mist of olive oil .
“ There ’s really no way to get the oil out of the water , ” she said .
“ The stuff is going to stay in there and circulate around and have a long - term impact …
It ’s going to be months or years before we realize the full consequences of the spill . ”
Although BP has released large amounts of chemical dispersants at the well head , Joye said that given the force with which much the oil and gas is spurting into the ocean nearly a mile beneath the surface , it would have spread through the water column even without the help of dispersants .
NOAA had criticized as premature earlier reports of a " plume " of oil and gas by the University of Georgia team .
But the agency on Tuesday separately confirmed the presence of undersea oil from the spill .

Wedding from hell : A page boy fits , the groom 's mother collapses , a guest learns his father has died and two children suffer head injuries
Still smiling : Newlyweds Paul and Vilma Cassidy can now look forward to a happy honeymoon after their eventful big day
You would n't know it from the wedding photographs , but new bride and groom Vilma and Paul Cassidy were left reeling at their nuptials after a series of bizarre misphaps .
It all started with a pageboy having a fit and turning blue , then Paul 's mother collapsing , a guest found out his father had passed away , then their children suffered cut heads .
A stunned Paul said : ' We were relieved the day had finished .
We just thought " What more could go wrong ? "
' It must have been one of the unluckiest weddings in history .
I thought Jeremy Beadle was going to pop out at any minute . '
Paul , who owns a transport business , and Vilma tied the knot at St Mary 's Church in Melton Mowbray , Leics .
But the day began to go wrong before the ceremony had even taken place , as Vilma , 30 , got ready with members of the bridal party at her home .
Her preparations were thrown into disarray when 16 - month - old pageboy , Kenzie Gathercole , started fitting .
Vilma said : ' He was sitting in front of me and his eyes rolled over .
He went blue in a second . '
The toddler , who is Paul 's niece 's son , was given the kiss of life by his grandmother while an ambulance rushed to the scene .
Kenzie was taken to hospital in Nottingham and missed the ceremony - but the same paramedics who attended to him incredibly came face - to - face with Vilma again when Paul 's mother , Christina Wigington , 76 , collapsed outside the church .
Paul , 50 , said : ' When we came out of the church after the service and the photographs were being taken , my mother collapsed .
' I rushed straight to her .
A friend was looking after her , cooling her down .
Mum was concerned that we should carry on as normal .
' They checked her over and were worried about her low blood pressure .
' The paramedics could n't believe it when they saw Vilma again .
They saw more of her on the day than I did !'
Incredibly , the bad luck did n't end there .
Accidents :
The couple pose in front of the lorries used to carry the bridesmaids on their almost disastrous big day
Minutes later , a friend of the couple received a text saying her father had just died .
Paul added : ' What do you say ?
She 's a good friend and we felt for her .
' They came back later in the evening because she said there was nothing she could do . '
Paul and Vilma moved on to the reception , at a restaurant in Melton , with 170 guests believing that ' nothing more could go wrong ' .
But they did n't bargain with their 18 - month - old son , Christopher , and their seven - year - old daughter , Saidi , both cutting their heads open in accidents .
And to top the day off , Paul returned to his car shortly before midnight intending to take medicine to his mother , who had been taken to Grantham hospital - but found it locked in a hotel car park .
He eventually made the trip in his sister 's car .
The tale of woe did have a happy ending , though - both Kenzie and Christina were released from hospital the following day , and Paul and Vilma are now looking forward to a honeymoon in America in the autumn .
Vilma said : ' The day was half nightmare , half brilliant .
' I had a feeling something was going to happen but I did n't think it would be anything like that .
' It was like somebody did n't want us to get married , but we did . '
If it were n’t for that ability to “ aid relaxation ” we ’d have all the power guys .
Alas …
United States politicians have approved a $ US20 million ( $ 23 million ) compensation payout to kidnap victim Jaycee Dugard , who was held imprisoned by a paroled sex offender for nearly two decades before being freed last year .
A bill detailing the compensation package for Ms Dugard and her two children passed through California 's state assembly and senate and now awaits approval from governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , a state official said .
Ms Dugard , 30 , and her daughters fathered by her alleged kidnapper , Phillip Garrido , had filed claims with the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board .
The payment had been recommended by California 's Department of Justice .
A legislative analysis of the bill noted while California 's corrections department usually has immunity from civil claims , Ms Dugard 's case had a " unique and tragic character " , including missed opportunities to catch Garrido .
State attorneys had warned potential jury damages arising from a lawsuit could be " extremely high , " the analysis stated , saying it was a " virtual certainty " that Ms Dugard and her children would need counselling for the rest of their lives .
California 's inspector - general David Shaw issued a blistering report into the case last November , saying a catalogue of mistakes allowed Garrido to walk free for years .
Garrido is accused of kidnapping Ms Dugard when she was 11 outside her home in South Lake Tahoe , California , in 1991 , just three years after he was released from prison after serving only 11 years of a 50 - year sentence for rape .
Ms Dugard was found alive in August after being imprisoned by Garrido for 18 years in a secret backyard compound of the sex offender 's home in Antioch , east of San Francisco .
The case led to angry questions at how Garrido had been free to kidnap Ms Dugard and how authorities had failed to discover his crimes earlier , even though he was on parole and subject to tight monitoring by authorities .

Police are investigating a robbery late Thursday morning at Chase Bank at 4080 Nesconset Highway in East Setauket in which an armed man wearing a Darth Vader helmet and cape fled after receiving an undisclosed amount of money .
Police are still searching for the thief , who fled eastbound through the shopping center parking lot .
An eyewitness said the thief had a " young voice , " as if he were in his late teens or early 20s , and was about six feet tall .
She said the thief stashed the money in a drawstring backpack with a New York Yankees logo and ran after punching a muscular male customer who tried to intervene .
As Keith noted before getting into the meat of this interview , BP apparently does n't understand that they 're not going to improve their image by doing things like this .
In another effort to repair its image , BP picks up tab for fireworks show in Colorado :
In struggling to save its brand name from drowning in backlash from the Gulf oil disaster , BP has launched multiple efforts to revamp its image as “ part of the community . ”
Now , the “ embattled oil giant ” has “ stepped forward to pay ” for the annual July Fourth fireworks display in Durango , CO .
Agreeing to pay for the display five months before the Deepwater Horizon explosion , BP is pitching the display as a community donation .
... Many conservative leaders have jumped on the “ shakedown ” bandwagon , seeing BP ’s $ 20 billion for an escrow fund as a real danger to the company ’s viability .
But if the company can pay for fireworks and baseball trophies while launching aggressive media campaigns and funding a front group to downplay the disaster , BP can cover its responsibility to the victims in the Gulf .
Maybe one of these days the idiots that run PR for BP will figure out that actually taking care of cleaning up and containing rather than hiding and dispersing the oil gushing out of that pipe is the only thing that 's going to satisfy anyone who 's not a complete moron and that is following how they 've handled this disaster .
They 're obviously so used to getting away with this sort of corporate malfeasance that the media generally ignores that they are hoping this wo n't be any different than business as usual for them .
And then we have Haley Barbour , who again is showing himself to be nothing but a puppet of big oil .
Haley Barbour : ‘ No one has more to lose in this deal than BP . ’:
Although the BP oil disaster has killed 11 men , poisoned thousands of animals , and ruined the livelihoods of millions of Americans , Mississippi governor Haley Barbour ( R - MS ) still believes that the foreign oil giant has suffered the most .
Gov. Barbour has dismissed this catastrophe from day one , comparing the toxic oil to “ toothpaste ” and worrying about the impact of paying damages on BP ’s finances .
In an interview with NPR on Thursday , Barbour brushed off the suggestion that the conservative ideology of deregulation should be reconsidered , saying that “ the idea that more regulation is necessarily better , I think a very suspect idea . ”
In fact , Barbour cited the greatest environmental catastrophe in American history as proof that “ the market system works , ” saying that BP is the biggest victim “ in this deal ” : I think right now every oil company in the world says , I do n’t want to pay $ 100 million a day to cut corners on drilling a well .
And that ’s where I believe the market system works .
Nobody ’s got more to lose in this deal than BP .

And last but not least we have Bobby Jindal who is demanding that the federal government comes clean with their record on this response , but when it comes to his own record ... maybe not so much .
Jindal Vetoes Bill To Open Oil Spill Records :
Gov. Bobby Jindal has vetoed a bill that would have required him to preserve and make public all documents his office handles regarding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster .
Jindal , in the veto released Friday , said the legislation would have hurt the state 's position in future litigation against BP PLC .
The oil giant leased the rig which exploded April 20 in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 workers .
Sen .
Robert Adley , the lawmaker who added the public records language into the bill , said Jindal 's position makes no sense .
Adley called the governor hypocritical for asking BP to release records as he 's refusing to release his own .
The Jindal administration has repeatedly fought attempts to open most of his office 's records to public scrutiny -- or to require preservation of those documents .
Looks like a big case of CYA to me .
Gov. Jindal has done a whole lot of screaming about the government not coming to the rescue while doing very little himself from what I 've followed of this mess .
Not that I want to give the response on the federal level a pass .
I 've said this more than once and I 'll say it again .
The criminals should not be in charge of cleaning up the crime scene .
Everyone needs to be letting our elected officials know that this is not acceptable .
If you have decided that the time is right to draft your will or if you need to find the best healthcare option for your elderly parent , you have come to the right place .

I am aware that spending a lot of time Googling yourself is kind of narcissistic , OK ?
But there are situations , I would argue , when it is efficiently – even forgivably – narcissistic .
When I published a book last year , I wanted to know what , if anything , people were saying about it .
Ego - surfing was the obvious way to do that .
Which is how I stumbled across Some Title .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Some Title identified itself as a blog but obviously was n't one .
Here , reprinted in its entirety , is the paragraph from the site that mentioned me :
Show Disputed Vinland Map Was Made Half Century Before Columbus Trip Audio / Video Columbus : Secrets From The Grave quot ; The Last Voyage of Columbus quot ; : An Epic Tale Charles Mann 's quot ; 1491 quot ; ( Audio
In orthodox bloggy style , the paragraph linked to another Web page .
When I clicked on the link , I was confronted with more gibberish : " Below , " it stated , " you will find some grave robbing in ventura california 1985 news that 's relevant for today . "
Blogs like Some Title are known as " splogs " – spam blogs .
Like email spam , splogs use the most wonderful features of networked communication – its flexibility , easy access , and low cost – in the service of sleazy get - rich - quick schemes .
But whereas email spammers try to induce recipients to buy products , sploggers and other Web spammers make most of their money by getting viewers to click on ads that run adjacent to their nonsensical text .
Web page owners – the spammer , in this case – get paid by the advertiser every time someone clicks on an ad .
Some Title 's creator had almost certainly assembled the site by using software that hops from Web page to Web page , automatically copying text that includes potential search terms .
( My name and my book 's title had been included incidentally , because they appeared in a review or blog that happened to contain keywords sought by the spammer . )
Sploggers do n't care if the resulting Web pages are garbled ; the point is to churn them out chockablock with terms that people might use in search queries , leading them to visit the pages and click ( ka - ching ! ) on the ads .
Just as the proliferation of email spam constantly threatens to inundate email providers , the explosion of blog spam is a besetting problem for the blog industry .
Like most people who poke around the blogosphere , I had occasionally encountered splogs before .
But over the months that I monitored the reaction to my book , they seemed to be rising in number .
More and more of the blogs and Web sites that mentioned my book – or any other topic , for that matter – were spam .
Some 56 percent of active English - language blogs are spam , according to a study released in May by Tim Finin , a researcher at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County , and two of his students .
" The blogosphere is growing fast , " Finin says .
" But the splogosphere is now growing faster . "
To Jason Goldman , product manager for Google 's Blogger hosting service , " the ever - increasing number of splogs is a significant problem that we have to combat . "
No search engine wants users looking for information about , say , auto repair to click on a promising link and end up on a page filled with jabberwocky or a collection of advertisements .
Nor does any blog host want to waste its resources and trash its reputation by providing a home to spammers .
A recent survey by Mitesh Vasa , a Virginia - based software engineer and splog researcher , found that in December 2005 , Blogger was hosting more than 100,000 sploggers .
( Many of these are likely pseudonyms for the same people . )
Google , Goldman promises , is paying serious attention to the problem .
It should be :
The pay - per- click advertising that accounts for most of Google 's income ( and , increasingly , for the incomes of Yahoo and MSN Search , the two other big search engines ) has become an irresistible magnet for hucksters , con artists , and chiselers .
" The three main search engines are gateways to a huge percentage of the US and world economy , " says Anil Dash , a vice president of the blog - hosting company Six Apart .
" If your Web site appears high up on their results , thousands or millions of people will go to it . "
If even a small fraction of those people click on the ads on that site , " you 're going to make a lot of money " – and sploggers are going after it .
Because the ad money is effectively available only to Web sites that appear in the first page or two of search results , spammers devote enormous efforts to gaming Google , Yahoo , and their ilk .
Search engines rank
Web sites in large part by counting the number of other sites that link to them , assigning higher placement in results to sites popular enough to be referred to by many others .
To mimic this popularity , spammers create bogus networks of interconnected sites called link farms .
Blogs – most of which are in essence little more than collections of links with commentary – are particularly useful elements in them .
The result , Dash says , " is what you 'd expect :
The blogosphere is increasingly polluted by spam . "
The mess may have consequences beyond the blogosphere , though .
Blogs are the leading edge of what is often called Web 2.0 , the vision of the Internet as a bottom - up , communal platform for data of all sorts that is generated and continually updated by its users : the image - sharing sites Flickr and YouTube , the social bookmarking destination del.icio.us , the collaborative online encyclopedia Wikipedia , the user - generated Slashdot rival digg , and publicly viewable online calendars like Kiko and CalendarHub .
Unfortunately , the very openness and ease of use that make these Web 2.0 sites popular will inevitably make them perfect targets for spammers , says Matt Mullenweg , developer of the popular WordPress blogging system .
" Extreme vulnerability to spam , " he says , is a defining characteristic of Web 2.0 , and splogs are its first manifestation .
People in the industry disagree about how to beat back spam , or whether it can even be done .
But there 's no dispute that if the blogosphere and the rest of Web 2.0 can't find a way to stop the sleazeballs who are enveloping the Net in a haze of babble and cheesy marketing , then the best features of Web 2.0 will be turned off , and it will go the way of Usenet , which was driven to desuetude by spam .
Some Title , the splog that commandeered my name , was created by Dan Goggins , the proud possessor of a 2005 master 's degree in computer science from Brigham Young University .
Working out of his home in a leafy subdivision in Springville , Utah , Goggins , his BYU friend and partner , John Jonas , and their handful of employees operate " a few thousand " splogs .
" It 's not that many , " Goggins says modestly .
" Some people have a lot of sites . "
Trolling the Net , I came across a PowerPoint presentation for a kind of spammers ' conference that details some of the earnings of the Goggins - Jonas partnership .
Between August and October of 2005 , they made at least $ 71,136.89 .
People in Goggins ' business bristle at the term " splogger . "
They like to be called " search engine marketers . "
And they do n't simply throw a mass of blogs online .
Instead they build complex networks of Web sites , entire online ecosystems of sleaze , twaddle , and gobbledygook .
The main goal is to lure unsuspecting blog readers and other Internet users to spam portals .
Sportals , as they are known , are Web pages consisting almost entirely of pay - per - click links , all of which shunt netsurfers to legitimate commercial Web sites , collecting money along the way for the spammers .
Examples of these doorway pages include debts.com , lasvegasvacations.com , and 90210.com , all owned by industry pioneer Marchex of Seattle ; another is photography.com , run by NameMedia , based in the Boston suburb of Waltham .
Naturally , sportal owners want their properties to appear prominently in search engine results .
The precise algorithms that search engines use to rank pages are as closely guarded – and as valuable – as upcoming Intel chip designs .
Spammers figure them out by stuffing individual splogs and spam pages with potential search terms and links to one another , observing how high the sites appear in search results , then tweaking their pages and trying again .
Repeated over time , Six Apart 's Dash says , " the brute - force approach is effective .
Not that the Google guys are n't smart , but the sheer relentlessness on the side of spammers is formidable , and they eventually get what they want . "
In June , a Romanian tech - blogger who calls himself Ionut Alex .
Chitu discovered that Googling " pizza sauce recipe " turned up a spam page within the first 10 results – prime Web real estate .
The page , he and others quickly learned , was a tiny island in a massive archipelago of spam , millions of pages in size , erected by scammers supposedly in Romania or Argentina , depending on which fake registration data one chose to believe .
Having discovered a lacuna in Google 's indexing system , the spammers shoved search terms into their Web sites ' domain names , which the search algorithm regarded as a sign of their importance .
The pizza - sauce inquiry , for instance , directed viewers to the Web address 1059.pizza.eiqz2q.org , which automatically bounced to a sportal ; one incautious mouseclick later and the viewer would be stuck in a near - endless loop of ad sites .
( Google started deleting the spam colossus from its index within hours of its discovery . )
In addition to creating massive numbers of phony blogs , sploggers sometimes take over abandoned real blogs .
More than 10 million of the 12.9 million profiles on Blogger surveyed by splog researcher Vasa in June were inactive , either because the bloggers had stopped blogging or because they never got started .
( The huge mass of dead blogs is one reason to maintain a healthy skepticism toward the frequently heard claims about the vast growth of the blogosphere . )
" Nobody is watching or moderating the comments and posts on those abandoned blogs , " says Tim Mayer , director of product management for Yahoo search .
As a result , he says , scammers are looking for ways to hack the interface of these blogs to post to them and take advantage of their inbound links to increase the ranking of spam sites .
For obvious reasons , it is difficult for a Google or a Yahoo to discern when a previously valuable site and its links slip over to the dark side and become part of a spam empire .
Not only do sploggers create fake blogs or take over abandoned ones , they use robo - software to flood real blogs with bogus comments that link back to the splog .
( " Great post !
For more on this subject , click here ! " )
Statistics compiled by Akismet , a system put together by WordPress developer Mullenweg that tries to filter out blog spam , suggest that more than nine out of 10 comments in the blogosphere are spam .
Partly as a result , prominent blogs like Instapundit , The Corner , and Talking Points Memo simply refuse to turn on commenting .
Almost as pervasive is trackback spam .
Trackbacks are the familiar mechanism – " see which blogs are talking about this post " – by which Blogger A's discussion of a post by Blogger B can be automatically linked to Blogger B's site .
Spammers will claim on a real blog that their splogs continue the thread of discourse , hoping to lure the real blog 's readers to visit them and click on ads .
" All of a sudden a well - known blogger is linking to a spam blog , " says Natalie Glance , a senior researcher at Nielsen BuzzMetrics , the rating company 's blog - analysis arm .
Because of the link , the splog gets a boost in the search engine ranks – even as its link tarnishes the real blog .
The avalanche of spam places an increasing burden not only on blog hosts but on another equally vital component of the blogosphere : blog - search engines like Technorati and IceRocket , and the so - called ping servers they depend on .
Unlike Google or Yahoo , blog - search firms operate in real time , so as to keep pace with ongoing discussions .
Every time bloggers make posts , their software automatically alerts the network of ping servers that track the blogosphere for blog - search engines .
These tap into the feed from ping servers to refresh their indexes and visit the sites that have new material .
Syndication services that use delivery formats like RSS and Atom also use the ping servers to know when they need to deliver content to subscribers .
Unfortunately , splogs generate content faster than real blogs – no surprise , given that the text is churned out by robo - software , with no need for the splogger to write or think .
Maryland researcher Finin and his students found that splogs produce about three - quarters of the pings from English - language blogs .
Another way of saying this is that the legitimate blogosphere generates about 300,000 posts a day , but the splogosphere emits 900,000 , inundating the ping servers .
" It 's not enough to weed out splogs on the level of the search engines ; you also have to get rid of them in the ping servers , " Glance says .
" It 's a whole second front . "
Splogs are annoying but not illegal .
Still , blog - hosting firms like Six Apart , Blogger , MSN Spaces , and Xanga desperately want to get rid of them .
And blog - search companies would like just as much to eliminate them from their results .
For that to happen , though , the companies must identify the splogs they want to weed out – a harder task than it may seem .
Take Some Title , the splog that mentioned me .
Any human reader can tell instantly , as I did , that the site is tripe .
But even if hosting services and search engines hired armies of people , the blogosphere is simply too big to sift through blogs one by one .
Computers are faster but notoriously unable to distinguish sense from nonsense – they can't tell Some Title from Shakespeare .
The way out of this dilemma is to find mechanisms for computers to identify splogs without reading them , says David Sifry , founder of Technorati , the largest blog - search firm .
The key to doing this , in his view , is to understand that real blogs are a form of expression , but " spam blogs are built essentially to fool search engines . "
They have different characteristics than blogs – characteristics that computers can identify and thus use to eliminate spam from their search results .
" If we see 10,000 pings within 60 seconds , and all the blogs point to the same Web site , it 's really easy to recognize that as a link farm , " Sifry says .
There are other ways to spot offenders .
Like most blogs , Some Title consists of a number of 50 - to 100 - word posts ( incoherent ones , in this case ) , all with hyperlinks to other Web sites .
In real blogs , the hyperlinks ' anchor text – the word or phrase users click on – is generally something innocuous like " previous post " or " interesting discussion . "
Splogs , by contrast , often have search terms in the anchor text ; the anchor text for one Some Title link , for instance , was " grave digger freestyle . "
The links in ordinary blogs usually take users to well - known sites like Flickr and YouTube or prominent blogs like Talking Points Memo and Boing Boing .
By contrast , each link in Some Title takes the user to a spam Web page or another splog .
These sites , moreover , often have odd - looking , superlong URLs that are packed with keywords , because search engines tend to award high ranks to Web sites with keywords in their title , and sploggers are constantly looking for ways to increase their visibility in search engines .
One LiveJournal splog that mentioned me , for example , was called New - york - agency - direct - mail - insurance - marketing .
The grave - robbing Web site had the absurd address www.1michaelgraves7.info/conducting-from-the-grave/ grave-robbing-in-ventura-california-1985.html .
" If it 's a Blogspot blog with more than two dashes , it 's spam , " Mullenweg says .
Simply checking for dashes and search terms in links , in other words , will eliminate many splogs .
Another giveaway : Both Some Title and the grave - robbing page it links to had Web addresses in the .info domain .
Spammers flock to .info , which was created as an alternative to the crowded .com , because its domain names are cheaper – registrars often let people use them gratis for the first year – which is helpful for those , like sploggers , who buy Internet addresses in bulk .
Splogs so commonly have .info addresses that many experts simply assume all blogs from that domain are fake .
But even if blog - search firms use these techniques to identify and remove splogs , the struggle against them will never end .
" The sploggers always adjust , " says Nielsen 's Glance .
" As soon as companies like Google and ourselves get better , the spammers get better . "
Every so often , Google revamps its search algorithms , partly to outwit spammers and bloggers .
The update sets off a " Google dance , " in which legitimate Web site owners and scammers both race to maintain high positions in search engine results .
Dismayingly , this endless arms race may actually be a best - case scenario .
The interactivity of the blogosphere – and of the rest of Web 2.0 – means that sploggers will always have multiple ways of infiltrating the system , explains Gilad Mishne , a computer scientist at the University of Amsterdam who focuses on splogs and Web spam .
And for those other paths , he says , " we 're really in trouble . "
On June 19 , Six Apart 's Anil Dash blogged about his experience beta-testing Microsoft Office 2007 .
His positive review attracted considerable attention , with many other bloggers linking to it – so many , in fact , that Dash was surprised to discover soon after that his post was listed second when people Googled " Office 2007 . "
( It was 10th in MSN Search and 17th in Yahoo . )
If the post 's position does n't change , Dash says , " a year from now it could be a gateway for tens of thousands of software sales , maybe hundreds of thousands .
My wife told me to quit my job and focus on exploiting my search rank . "
It 'd be easy , he jokes .
All he'd have to do is stick up some big pay - per - click ads for Office 2007 and watch visitors click through , collecting a fee each time they did .
The possibility was more than theoretical .
Dash 's posts have attracted attention before , and the attention has sometimes been followed by an email asking if he would , for a fee , tuck a new link somewhere on his site .
The emails were from sploggers .
They wanted to add Dash 's highly ranked post to a link farm .
" I get these offers about once a week , " he says .
" I 've always been a little leery of trying to contact them to find out exactly how much they 'd pay . "
The emails , Dash believes , exemplify the fundamental difficulty in fighting splogs and Web spam .
With the rise of pay - per - click advertising , the big search engines have , in effect , created a kind of currency : ranking in search results .
Put up the right Web site , with the right collection of links and keywords , and – ka-ching !
This cash is available to anyone on earth who can manipulate search engines ' site - ranking systems .
Little wonder that the entire world 's supply of spammers is trying to seize the opportunity .
They are combing through the Net so assiduously that they are attempting to capitalize on individual blog posts about products that wo n't even appear for months to come .
No single company , Dash believes , can withstand that much collective rapacity .
As a result , he says , " there 's going to be a reckoning with the economy that 's building up around search engine rankings , one way or another . "
Something fundamental will have to change , either in the search engine world or the blogosphere , because things can't continue the way they are now .
Technorati's Sifry is more optimistic .
Yes , he says , spam is a problem .
But the people who are crying doom are not taking a wide - angle view .
" You have to recognize that spam is doubling every six months , " he says .
With this in mind , Technorati 's engineers designed its spam filters to be scalable right from the start .
Its continually escalating defenses , Sifry believes , will eventually tame the onslaught of spam , though not eliminate it .
But many researchers also fear that an eventual solution will reduce the openness , ease , and accessibility that is at the heart of the blog world and Web 2.0 .
They note that one method by which the blog - search firms weed out spam is by not trying to include comments and trackback in their searches .
The result is to strip out bloggy interactivity – getting rid of spam by treating Web 2.0 as if it were Web 1.0 .
" The whole purpose of Web 2.0 is user - generated content , " Mullenweg says .
" To make that happen , you want the system as easy and transparent as possible .
But that just lets the spammers in .
So you put in hurdles for them to jump over .
They jump over them , so you put in more hurdles .
And at the end of the day , you have a system that 's not nearly as easy and open and transparent . "
One example : Blogger and other blog - hosting sites now require users to prove they are not spambots before posting comments by identifying a series of distorted letters and numbers .
The protective codes are called Captchas , which stands for " completely automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart . "
In theory , sploggers ' autoposting software can't figure out the distorted images , thus reducing the flow of spam .
But Captchas also make commenting harder .
" It 's a big pain for legitimate users , " Blogger 's Goldman says , " and there are many visually impaired people who can't do it at all . "
( Google recently introduced an audio - based form . )
Nor are Captchas completely effective .
Sploggers are believed to be hiring squads of low - paid people to type through the tests .
" We 're seeing Captchas solved in bursts , which suggests they are working in shifts , " Goldman says .
Mullenweg thinks he has come up with a better approach .
He got serious about fighting spam , he says , when his mother started to blog .
" I went through the last hundred or so people who had pinged WordPress with comments and trackbacks , and it was all spam , " he says .
" Mortgages and Viagra , pills and porn . "
Embarrassed and revolted , Mullenweg decided to fight back .
In his view , even the smartest companies – the Six Aparts and Technoratis – represent single points of failure , something that spammers can target and outwit .
But the bad guys , Mullenweg says , can't beat the " collective , distributed intelligence " of the blogosphere .
When bloggers install his Akismet software , it submits all comments and trackbacks to a Web service that tests them for spamminess , quarantines the bogus ones , and posts the rest .
If any of those are spam , bloggers report them to Akismet , which uses the feedback to improve its filter .
Almost 300,000 bloggers use the software , Mullenweg says , and their input improves the filter every day .
" Essentially what we 're doing is working together .
All the kids that got hit by bullies in school have discovered there 's strength in numbers .
I like to believe that , anyway . "
Despite the effort and expertise behind such technical fixes , Dash does n't think any of them will work in the long run .
" They 're making money on beating you , and you 're losing money fighting them , " he says .
" The economics are on their side . "
Ultimately , he thinks , " the solution is going to be accountability .
You have to know that somebody is who they say they are . "
Six Apart 's TypePad blogging service enforces accountability on its bloggers in one of the simplest ways possible :
It charges them at least $ 4.95 a month to host their blogs .
Not only is the token payment enough to discourage scammers who want to operate thousands of blogs at once , but it also establishes bloggers ' identities by tying them to a bank account .
Because not all companies will follow Six Apart 's template , Dash says , there will have to be some kind of global identifier – an Internet Social Security number , so to speak .
Everyone could select a personal URL , he says , such as their blog address .
" If you use your URL as identification , you can use that to get higher search engine placement . "
He employs a similar system on his own blog , he says .
" Anybody that signs in and authenticates themself or provides their URL can immediately comment .
Anybody that wants to be anonymous , I have to approve it . "
Dash concedes that such global identifiers would alarm privacy activists .
But the other solutions are even worse .
For example , search engines could auction off their search results , thus making people pay for ranking .
Just as monthly payments for blogs would be the death of splogs , paying for search rank would be the death of link farms .
But , says Dash , " a blog like mine would n't have a chance of being the second result for ' Office 2007 . ' "
What is not possible , he believes , is to continue to muddle through .
" The spammers are too good . "
Asked what impact he thinks splogging will have on the future of the Web , Some Title creator Goggins pauses .
" I 'm just making my living , " he says .
" I guess I do n't think about that kind of thing very much . "
