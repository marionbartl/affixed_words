“ We want change ! ” yelled Abdi Mubarak , who works in a mosque and who said he voted for Mr. Odinga .
That change may come .
Though official results are not expected to be released until Friday , most polls in the past several months forecast that Mr. Odinga would win the popular vote , and the heavy turnout on Thursday was said to work in his favor .
It seems that he has tapped into frustrations percolating for some time in Kenya , which enjoys one of the strongest and most stable economies in Africa but suffers from deep tribal divisions .
Mr. Odinga has built a coalition of the Luo , the Luhya , the Masai , the Somali and many other tribes who say they feel that the Kikuyu , Kenya ’s biggest tribe , accounting for a quarter of the population , has been politically dominant for too long .

On Thursday , this played out behind the cardboard booths where voters hunched over their ballots .
Of more than a dozen people interviewed , not one crossed tribal lines when voting .
Mr. Odinga , 62 , is a Luo. Mr. Kibaki , 76 , is a Kikuyu .
And the third notable politician in the presidential race , Kalonzo Musyoka , 54 , is a Kamba .
“ I ’m for the president , ” said David Ndagwa , a stocky vendor of vegetables who said he was a Kikuyu .
“ He ’s brought progress . ”
Tribes aside , there are other issues in this race .
Mr. Odinga wants to devolve power from the center of the country and grant Kenya ’s rural areas more autonomy .
Mr. Kibaki has been running strong on education and has already delivered on his promise of free primary school education for all Kenyans .
Mr. Musyoka is a former foreign minister and has said he is the one to expand Kenya ’s links to the wider world .
He has run a distant third in polls .
However , Kenyan law necessitates that to become president , a candidate must win a seat in Parliament and secure at least 25 percent of the votes in five out of eight of the country ’s provinces .
This electoral fine print may mean that even if there is a clear winner in the popular vote , there could be a runoff .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen wants a referendum in the next four years
Back in 2000 , the Danish people voted by 53 % to 47 % not to join the single currency and instead keep the krone .
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen , whose centre - right government was re-elected last week , said " the time was approaching " to reassess the euro .
He said he also wanted the referendum to look at ending Denmark 's opt-outs in defence , justice and home affairs .
Denmark was granted the four exemptions after voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 .
They adopted the document the following year .
It 's a difficult thing to do in Denmark ... because the EU is always controversial
Dan Jorgensen
Social Democrat MEP
" It is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the Danish EU opt-outs , " said Mr Rasmussen .
The referendum will take place at some stage in the next four years , he indicated .
A member of the European Parliament for the opposition Social Democrats , Dan Jorgensen , said his party had been asking for a vote for several years but it was a difficult thing to do in Denmark and its leaders had tended to avoid taking the risk because " the EU is always controversial " .
Nordic scepticism
Denmark previously raised the issue of a fresh referendum on the euro in 2003 , but it did not come to anything on that occasion .
An opinion poll of 1,000 people published last month in the run-up to the election suggested that 51 % of Danes were happy to ditch the opt - out on the euro , and 40 % were opposed .
Economic analysts say that as the krone has been tracking the euro , joining the single currency would have minimal impact .
Finland is the only Nordic country to have joined the euro .
Sweden rejected the single currency in a referendum in 2003 and Norway is part of the European Economic Area rather than the EU .
The Danish prime minister also said that he wanted his country to ratify the EU reform treaty quickly , but he gave no indication that there would be a referendum on it .
The treaty is due to be signed in Lisbon next month and will then require ratification in all member states .
At a news conference in which he set out his government 's priorities for the next four years , Mr Rasmussen said he would try to improve conditions for asylum - seekers and seek to bring down the rate of income tax .
Denmark joined the European Economic Community , the precursor to today 's European Union , in 1973 , at the same time as the UK and the Republic of Ireland .
Poor little war - mongering apologists Republicans , their world is collapsing around them this week .
Case in point :
The Boston Globe reports that Romney is using illegal immigrants to
take care of his lawn .
Is Michelle Malkin disappointed in him for his hypocrisy of tough anti-immigration rhetoric on the campaign trail and actually supporting at home ?
Hell no - she is angry at the " liberal MSM " for reporting it .
( link goes to Malkin 's site - fair warning )
She also says the Dems will use it to attack Romney .
Dems ?
Did n't she watch the YouTube Debate ?

The BBC 's technology boss Ashley Highfield has provoked consternation in the UK 's open source community by claiming that only a few hundred of the corporation 's 17.1 million website visitors use Linux .
In an interview with web design mag .net , Highfield hit back against claims the BBC is too cosy with Microsoft .
He said : " We have 17.1 million users of bbc.co.uk in the UK and , as far as our server logs can make out , 5 per cent of those [ use Macs ] and around 400 to 600 are Linux users . "
A study of BBC server logs in 2005 showed that 0.41 per cent of visitors to the BBC homepage were running Linux .
Assuming the BBC 's traffic has n't gone up by orders of magnitude since then , that would mean more than 70,000 visitors are running the open source OS .
Although many Linux users adjust their browser user agent string , which identifies the operating system in server logs , Highfield 's maximum figure of 600 seems bizarre .
A Facebook group ( membership required ) and an online petition have been started by open sourcers in an attempt to debunk the claim .
Mark Taylor , president of Linux lobby the Open Source Consortium ( OSC ) , poured scorn on the numbers .
He said : " It 's absolutely inconceivable that there are only 600 Linux users in the UK that visit the BBC website .
This misinformation from the national broadcaster demands an explanation . "
We asked the Beeb this morning if it would like to clarify Highfield 's claims on bbc.co.uk 's traffic or has any further comment to make .
They came back with news that Highfield has just posted a response on his blog .
He writes :
The BBC use a range of systems to calculate user levels and the reporting system used to provide the numbers I quoted gave the lowest number ( this is the system we use the most widely , and I 've asked for a thorough check to see if it is correctly picking up all Linux users ) .
Alternative analysis that we have run off which performs the measurement in different ways suggests that the potential number of Linux users could range from 0.3 per cent to 0.8 per cent ( which , from a total UK bbc.co.uk userbase of 12.2 m weekly users [ source : TNS ] could imply a user base between 36,600 and 97,600 ) .
Ooops .
Highfield goes on to say that these users should be seen in the context of the vast majority , who run Windows .
Relations between the BBC and the UK open source community have been strained by the controversy over the iPlayer , the national broadcaster 's Windows - only download service .
Free software activists protested outside Television Centre in August .
Highfield told .net :
" The 12 people who demonstrated outside our offices have every right to demonstrate , but I think ' the 12 people ' says it all . "
His comments are part of a recent PR offensive of interviews with sympathetic technology publications .
In an announcement unquestioningly parroted by much of the national press , the BBC also recently spun a multi-platform Flash - based streaming service as equivalent to the download iPlayer .
In his public statements , however , Highfield pointedly denied being " in bed with Beelzebub " over Microsoft DRM , and has offered to engage with open source advocates .
The OSC replied : " We welcome this .
It is certainly not too late and goes a long way to correcting any potential ' fault in communication ' you take full responsibility for .
" We respectfully request that we keep the discussion grounded on the merits of the case , and avoid ' not in love with the anti-christ ' comments that credit neither of us . " ®
The question of just how long it should take to eat fast food is being answered by the burger giant McDonald 's , which is making customers finish within 45 minutes or face a charge of £ 125 .
Motorists who care to linger over their McMeals for any longer at some drive - throughs are receiving demands from a private company that manages car parks for the burger chain .
If they do not pay , the fee rises steadily and customers are threatened with court action and approached by bailiffs .
A spokeswoman for McDonald 's said the 45 - minute restrictions had been introduced at about 40 restaurants because car parks were being abused .
She said signs explaining the policy were displayed and leaflets given out .
Many supermarkets and restaurants are handing over the management of their car parks to companies which use number plate recognition cameras to log when people enter and leave .
If they stay too long , the details of the registered keeper of the vehicle are obtained from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) , and he or she is billed .
An elderly Wiltshire couple were recently berated by Tesco after taking too long to do their Christmas shopping at the supermarket .
The company that manages McDonald 's car parks , Civil Enforcement , also works with a string of other blue - chip companies .
BP used it until recently to monitor some of its petrol station forecourts .
One motorist , Jamie Thomson , told the Guardian of his experience at a McDonald 's near Gatwick : " I ordered a burger , chips , a doughnut , coke and coffee .
I sat in my car eating my lunch , and listening to the radio .
After eating , I continued to sip my coffee for a time , and ate my doughnut .
Then I left .
All perfectly normal . "
He says he was in his car for about an hour .
Several weeks later , he received a letter from Civil Enforcement demanding £ 125 , or £ 75 if the charge was paid quickly .
At first Thomson , a businessman from Sussex , did not even realise that he was being charged for spending too long at McDonald's , as the notice gave only a partial address .
When he remembered his visit to McDonald's , Thomson asked Civil Enforcement for photographic proof of his " offence " , but was told he would have to pay for a photo .
He contacted the DVLA to ask how Civil Enforcement had obtained his details , and was told the DVLA releases data to bodies which have " reasonable cause " to ask for it .
McDonald 's told Thomson that the use of " enforcement methods " happened only in " extreme " circumstances .
The company added : " At this restaurant we have stipulated that a member of the public may be parked for 45 minutes unless permission is given to stay longer by the duty manager . "
McDonald 's in effect washed its hands of the charge , saying it had been imposed by Civil Enforcement and the burger giant did not profit from it .
Thomson 's charge has risen to £ 213 .
He has been threatened with court action and received a letter from a debt collection company .
He said that neither he nor any member of his family would eat at the chain again .
Civil Enforcement operates more than 700 car parks , and says it issues a " considerable number " of parking tickets every year .
Its founder , Gary Wayne , argued its " hi - tech approach " was " less confrontational than clamping and towing " .
( AOL Autos ) --
Many of us probably do n't think about the tow truck business that often .
We 're grateful when one randomly stops on the road when we 're broken down ( if they ever stop at all ) .
We may think about them when we buy a new car or change our car insurance in determining whether or not we want roadside assistance , but for the most part our paths do n't cross too often .
People examine the tow trucks and wreckers at the International Towing and Recovery Museum and Hall of Fame in Chattanooga , Tennessee .
AOL Autos wanted to find out a little more about the extreme ins and outs of the tow truck business , so we caught up with a former tow truck driver in Virginia .
He asked us to keep his name anonymous , so we will call him Dan , and in return he introduced us to the world of repossession and impound towing -- one that you hopefully wo n't have to visit too often .
Repossession and impound business
Dan worked as a part - time driver for five years and gave us some insight into how the repossession business works .
The first step is simply getting the address of the car .
It does n't matter how they find out where the person lives , they just need to have that address .
Dan said that some finance companies give them an address , but if it 's the wrong one , " They might have someone call the guy and tell him something stupid like he 's won tickets to something and they want to know where to send them -- anything sneaky so they get the guy 's address , " he said .
" Some people are so dumb that that they give their address and their car is just sitting there . "
He said some people know it 's a possibility their car will be repossessed so they park the car a few houses down thinking that the tow truck drivers wo n't be able to find it ... that does n't work .
We asked Dan what the best time to take a car was and he said , " Take them whenever !
Whenever they least expect it . "
Dan not only worked in repossessions , but also impounded vehicles for private companies .
Sometimes he 'd patrol apartment complexes and businesses that had hired Dan 's company to tow away illegally parked vehicles .
He told us many people ignore the " No Parking " and " 24 Hour Towing " signs , and they pay the price .
" It might be parked there all night , it might be parked there for 30 seconds ; it 's just parked there at the wrong time if the tow truck gets it . "
When it comes to patrolling for illegally parked cars , Dan told us that this is where competition between the tow truck drivers kicks in .
He said most tow truck drivers try to work it out , but he had a few issues .
" I know I always had problems with other drivers because I only worked part time . "
Other drivers would claim certain properties belonged solely to them , but Dan still patrolled them .
" It 's not my fault they have n't been going and checking for cars , " he told us .
" They thought no one else would be at that property and little did they know I just rolled up and took all their cars . "
Taking all the cars from a specific lot is referred to in this business as " burning up the property . "
Early one morning Dan and a co-worker found another driver from their company sleeping in his truck , waiting to pick up a few cars .
" We caught him sleeping in the shopping center right around the corner from one of the communities , so we figured there had to be cars and we went over and towed four cars .
He woke up at 6 a.m. thinking he could get cars and he rolled in and there were n't any . "
Normally , these drivers wo n't grab all the cars from a lot because they do n't want people to think there 's a strict policy .
" It 's kind of like fishing , you want to keep some bait out there , " Dan said .
" But when the money 's tight , people take every car they can . "
Selling the cars
Dan told us that most people would come and pay for their cars at the impound lot , unless the cars were in really bad condition .
" Sometimes you 'd have a fairly new car and under weird circumstances the people did n't come to claim the actual nice cars , " he added .
" But it 's pretty rare that the cars were nice . "
He told us that when the smart tow truck companies impound a car , they write down the VIN and the license plate number , then call the DMV and put a lien on that owner for the amount of money it costs to store the car .
" Other tow truck companies might just sell the car off or just apply for the title and sell it off and get what money they can for it , " he said .
We asked him what the company he worked for did in these cases .
" If someone offered them cash for the car they just kind of unloaded it off to them . "
He said they did n't get in trouble for that because , " They had a connection up at the DMV , a lady was making titles for them . "
By law , the towing companies are supposed to wait 45 days before they apply for the title at the DMV .
" But you know , it varies , " Dan said .
Dangers of the job
No one likes having their car towed , especially when you 're actually there to see it happen .
Some of Dan 's co-workers have been shot at , one of his friends had his face slashed with a J - hook and Dan himself had an instance where a group of guys got a little more than angry at him for towing a car .
He and his co-worker were patrolling an apartment community and got out to determine what cars needed to be towed .
" We kind of walked into a group of people who saw that we had our company tow truck shirts on and a friend got into a little bit of an altercation with them . "
Dan tried to stop the situation from escalating , but it did n't work out the way he wanted it to .
" I was trying to tell everyone to not worry about it and go home , but when I was n't looking I got a baseball bat to my face . "
The guys who attacked Dan knocked out several of his teeth and then ran into an apartment building .
" At first I was a in a little bit of a shock because my teeth were busted out , " he said .
" But then I think the adrenaline kind of kicked in and they obviously realized they had made a mistake and ran into an apartment . "
Dan then pinned their car in with his tow truck so they could n't leave and waited for the police to show up .
We asked Dan if he quit after a day like that , but he said he worked there for another two years .
Just part of the job
Even with all the angry people and potentially dangerous encounters , Dan said that there can be good money in towing cars .
Drivers are paid by the number of cars they bring in .
Some nights drivers can bring home $ 700 , he said for some people , the risk is just part of the job and it does n't deter them at all .
Dan 's friend who was slashed in the face six years ago is still towing to this day .
It 's not that they want people to be mad at them or that they particularly enjoy the dangerous encounters , Dan said matter - of - factly , " Some people just tow cars . "

I 'm pretty sure what I write here wo n't be pleasant to read for some people .
But that 's OK - life is never perfect .
To start off my rant about Digg , I 'll just point out that I have no argument with its success or popularity .
I myself have used it on a regular basis - but no more .
Digg is one of the net 's most popular sites , it has a lot of users who enjoy it daily , and the idea behind it was pretty good to begin with .
It 's just that something got rotten along the way .
I 'm not even talking about the " blog spam " or payed diggers that users are complaining about .
I think they are marginal problems .
Digg has bigger fish that smell bad .
So , why do I think Digg is irrelevant ?
Here are my reasons :
Slow : I do n't mean the site is loading slowly ( although that happens a lot , too ) .
I mean to say that Digg is slow on picking up the hot news .
If you want to stay updated in current events - like I do - you can't rely on Digg .
It takes hours , usually , for am item to gain enough popularity to reach the homepage , and by the time it does , you 've already read about it in your favorite news site or RSS feed .
Politics ( External ) : Debating politics is good .
Even excellent .
It shows that you care about your country 's future .
The problem is , if you are not from the US - the debates in Digg are really irrelevant for you .
Further more , seems like the top
Diggs are very one sided and you do n't get to see a myriad of opinions like you would expect in a social news site .
Politics ( Internal ) : Digg has a large variety of users .
Still , it seems like there are certain groups of users , banded together to help each other digg stories .
Not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it means that it 's a hell of a lot harder for a " regular " user to reach the front page .
I have seen it many times - a user posts a great link for a great story and gets no Diggs .
Hours later , a " power user " posts the same story , gathers his first 30 - 40 diggs quickly enough , and gets to the homepage of digg .
That does n't make any sense to me .
It means the " friends " you collect around you are more important than the content you present .
Which means a lot of shitty , old and duplicate stories can get to the homepage simply because a strong user has posted them .
Where is the value in that ?
Which brings me to my next point :
Utterly uninteresting content : Stupid Top - 10 lists , Idiotic New - Age advice , and not -very - funny videos are just a tiny example of the things that get to the front page of digg - and no one even knows who wants to read that .
It 's basically the same stuff over and over again , which gets to the homepage because of the very efficient cliques that help each other " Digg their stuff " .
Thus , the homepage of digg does n't really represent the most interesting news according to the users , but instead it shows the news that the top users think are interesting .
Kinda like editors in a regular content site , is n't it ?
Bad Apple :
Way too many news about Apple .
In a way that makes you wonder whether there are other hi-tech company in the world .
Yeah , OK , we get it - Apple is very co0l .
We are just tired of the hype .
Sometimes there are 3 - 4 Apple items in the front page .
It makes digg look like a site for Apple freaks .
Well , maybe it is .
Angry Mobs :
The general atmosphere is the comments section of digg can get really scary .
People are downright violent sometimes , and users are getting viciously attacked just for stating an unpopular opinion .
Sure , there are trolls everywhere , but in digg they really reign supreme .
Not to mention comment burying : it 's not that rating is a bad thing - it 's because people just can't help themselves .
Put a civilized man behind a keyboard and give him anonymity - and you get an evil , stupid monster .
And that 's really the bottom line - the assumption that many " editors " are better than one has been proved wrong .
One man can be either smart or an idiot .
The mob is always stupid and violent - and that 's Digg for you .
The hol­i­days are approach­ing and you can expect many soft­ware and game devel­op­ers to adver­tise their prod­ucts aggres­sive­ly , try­ing to get you buy their “ brain train­ing ” prod­ucts for you or as a gift for a loved one .
The good news is that there are more and more tools we can use to keep men­tal­ly stim­u­lat­ed and even train and improve spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties ( like pro­cess­ing speed , short - term mem­o­ry … ) .
You may be read­ing about Nin­ten­do Brain Age , Posit Sci­ence , Fast For­Word , Mind­Fit , Lumos­i­ty , Hap­py Neu­ron , MyBrain­Train­er , emWave , StressEras­er and more .
And , of course , there are also non-tech­nol­o­gy based inter­ven­tions .
The bad news is that it is dif­fi­cult to sep­a­rate mar­ket­ing from sci­en­tif­ic claims , and to under­stand which one , if any , may be a good com­ple­ment to oth­er healthy lifestyle choic­es .
To help you nav­i­gate this process , we are pub­lish­ing the Sharp­Brains Check­list below , based on dozens of inter­views with sci­en­tists , experts and con­sumers :
10 Ques­tions to Choose the Right Brain Fit­ness Pro­gram for You ( and a brief expla­na­tion of why each ques­tion is impor­tant )
* 1 . Are there sci­en­tists , ide­al­ly neu­ropsy­chol­o­gists , and a sci­en­tif­ic advi­so­ry board behind the pro­gram ?
( Neu­ropsy­chol­o­gists spe­cial­ize in mea­sur­ing and under­stand­ing human cog­ni­tion and brain struc­ture and func­tion . )
* 2 . Are there pub­lished , peer - reviewed sci­en­tif­ic papers in PubMed writ­ten by those sci­en­tists ?
How many ?
( Pubmed is a ser­vice of the U.S. Nation­al Library of Med­i­cine that includes mil­lions of cita­tions sci­ence jour­nals .
If a sci­en­tist has not pub­lished a paper that appears in that data­base , he or she can­not make sci­en­tif­ic claims . )
* 3 . What are the spe­cif­ic ben­e­fits claimed for using this pro­gram ?
What spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive skill is the pro­gram train­ing ?
( Some pro­grams present the ben­e­fits in such a neb­u­lous way that it is impos­si­ble to tell if they will have any results or not …“ brain train­ing ” itself is a lim­it­ed ben­e­fit , because activ­i­ties like gar­den­ing or learn­ing a new lan­guage pro­vide “ brain train­ing too ” … you need to see some­thing more spe­cif­ic , like what cog­ni­tive or emo­tion­al skill that pro­gram is aimed at )
* 4 . Does the pro­gram tell me what part of my brain or which cog­ni­tive skill I am exer­cis­ing , and is there an inde­pen­dent assess­ment to mea­sure my progress ?
( The ques­tion is whether the improve­ment expe­ri­enced in the pro­gram will trans­fer into real life .
For that to hap­pen we need assess­ments that are dis­tinct from the exer­cis­es them­selves . )
* 5 . Is it a struc­tured pro­gram with guid­ance on how many hours per week and days per week to use it ?
( Cog­ni­tive train­ing , or “ Brain exer­cise ” , is not a mag­ic pill .
You have to do the exer­cis­es in order to ben­e­fit , so you need clar­i­ty on the effort required . )
* 6 . Do the exer­cis­es vary and teach me some­thing new ?
( The only way to exer­cise impor­tant parts of our brain is by tack­ling nov­el chal­lenges . )
* 7 . Does the pro­gram chal­lenge and moti­vate me , or does it feel like it would become easy once I learned it ?
( Good brain exer­cise requires increas­ing lev­els of dif­fi­cul­ty )
* 8 . Does the pro­gram fit my per­son­al goals ?
( Each indi­vid­ual has dif­fer­ent goals / needs when it comes to brain health .
For exam­ple , some want to man­age anx­i­ety , oth­ers to improve short - term mem­o­ry … )
* 9 . Does the pro­gram fit my lifestyle ?
( Some brain exer­cise pro­grams have great short - term results but are very intense .
Oth­ers may be bet­ter over time )
* 10 . Am I ready and will­ing to do the pro­gram , or would it be too stress­ful ?
( Excess stress reduces , or may even inhib­it , neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis - the cre­ation of new neu­rons -.
So , it is impor­tant to make sure not to do things that stress us in unhealthy ways . )
We hope this infor­ma­tion is use­ful .

You have gotten on my last nerve .
Seriously , cut the fucking apron strings already .
Stop " dropping by ' 5 - 7 fucking times a week .
Call first .
If your ' baby ' does n't answer , do n't come by , just to see if we 're home and not answering .
I mean , who fucking does that ?
And if he does n't answer , do n't call my phone looking for him , then my son's cell phone , then leave some fucking smart ass message on the answering machine that you have called every number we have and NO ONE is answering !!!
And then you start all over with calling him , then me , etc ... within 3 minutes of leaving that fucking message !!
And quit just walking into my house when you get there .
Ever heard of knocking ?
I swear , one of these days , we 're not going to see you walking up the driveway and have enough time to scramble and get our clothes back on and you are going to catch your son's big dick in my mouth .
How am I supposed to look at you across the table on holidays knowing you saw me doing that ?
Oh and i KNOW his old loser girlfriends before me did n't mind your incessant calling , dropping by and butting in -- you 've told me enough times -- but his wife DOES !!
We have jobs and kids and lives that do n't revolve around you and you trying to stick your nose into every aspect of our lives - from what movie you think is ' appropriate " for your 14 year old grandkid to watch , to where we go out at on the weekends .
Nothing and I mean NOTHING we do is any of your fucking business .
If I hear you say one more fucking time " OH !
I do n't think that 's right !! " , regarding some decision we 've made when discipling our kids , I swear i will take my frying pan and crack it over your fucking ignorant head .
Did I ask for your opinion ??
Nope , sure did n't and I never will .
Oh and p.s.... Do you see MY mother ' stopping by ' at my house every fucking day of the week ?
No ?
That 's right , we were n't raised that way .
We were taught to CALL first , to see if the person is even interested in having company .
I would never dream of stopping at someone 's house at 10:00 at night to ' visit ' for an hour , when I know my precious son and his wife both get up at 4 am for work , 5 days a week .
Totally unacceptable behavior .
You have really gotten on my last fucking nerve and I really can't stand you .
When I hear my husband mention your name I fucking cringe .
We could have had a decent relationship , but you have messed all that up with your continuous fucking PRESENCE !!
Not to mention the fact that all you do is bitch and complain about how we live our lives and raise our kids .
Nobody fucking asked you .
And NO I am NOT cooking something for Sunday dinner , so quit dropping by at dinner time to see for yourself if I really did n't cook something for your precious baby .
I DIDN'T . I HAVE A FUCKING LIFE .
I have a 4 year old and a 14 year old and a job in another city that I commute to more than 40 hours a week .
I 'm not cooking every night and every fucking Sunday for your precious baby .
Cook it your damn self and invite us over for a change .
And also , quit TAKING A SHIT at my house every single time you stop by .
That grosses me out completely .
You know damn well you live exactly three minutes down the road ( which is a big part of the problem ) , so go shit at your own house , nasty !
I 've just had enough .
Love , ... I am SO over you !!!....
" There may be some truth in that if the Arabs have some complaints about my policy towards Israel , they have to realize that the Jews in the U.S. control the entire information and propaganda machine , the large newspapers , the motion pictures , radio and television , and the big companies , and there is a force that we have to take into consideration .

The message came across the police scanner in October 2006 as Alexander Roy was driving his 2000 BMW M5 west on Interstate 44 in Oklahoma : “ I have a report of a blue BMW speeding , weaving in and out of traffic and driving recklessly .
Be advised . ”
Roy said he heard it shortly after he and his co-driver , David Maher , had been exceeding 150 miles an hour .
As Maher scanned the prairie through binoculars for a place to hide , the car ’s radar detectors lighted up .
They decided to exit the highway and feign a bathroom break while a support team in a Cessna overhead searched for the speed trap that would inevitably materialize .
Having temporarily escaped , Roy eased back onto the highway .
As he approached two state police vehicles waiting on the median , he ducked to the right of a tractor - trailer in a move he called “ the cross - country racer ’s ideal police line - of - sight blocking position . ”
The maneuver , he said , enabled him to break a 23 - year - old illegal endurance - driving record by navigating from New York to Los Angeles in 31 hours 4 minutes .
He said he recorded an average speed of 90.1 m.p.h. over a mapped route of 2,794 miles .
The poor are hit hardest by corruption
The report added that the world 's poor were the hardest hit by bribery .
The police and judiciary were the worst offenders , with one quarter of those who come into contact with the police paying a bribe .
About half believe corruption is on the rise and 70 % said political parties were the most corrupt institutions .
" The police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " said Transparency International managing director Cobus de Swardt .
WHO PAYS THE MOST BRIBES Cameroon - 79 % Cambodia - 72 % Albania - 71 % Kosovo - 67 % FYR Macedonia - 44 % Pakistan - 44 % Nigeria - 40 % Senegal - 38 % Romania - 33 % Philippines - 32 % Percentage of people who paid a bribe in the past 12 months ( Source : Transparency International )
While the police may get the worst criticism on a global basis , within Europe people are most likely to pay bribes for medical services .
Tax on poor
The popular perception may be that bribes are paid by wealthy people to gain influence and oil the wheels of power , but they are mostly paid by poor people to ensure they get basic public services .
" Extortion hits low - income households with a regressive tax that saps scarce household resources , " the report said
Corruption levels vary across the globe .
In Africa , 42 % of people paid a bribe to obtain a service , though this figure is down from 47 % in 2006 .
WHO PAYS THE FEWEST BRIBES Austria - 1 % Canada - 1 % France - 1 % Iceland - 1 % Japan - 1 % South Korea - 1 % Sweden - 1 % Switzerland - 1 % Denmark - 2 % Netherlands - 2 % Percentage of people who paid a bribe in the past 12 months ( Source : Transparency International )
Elsewhere , petty bribery was on the rise , with 22 % of people in the Asia Pacific region paying a bribe in 2007 , up from 15 % in 2006 .
In south - east Europe , 12 % paid a bribe , up from 8 % .
While Africa is the region most affected by bribery , Africans , particularly Ghanaians and Nigerians , were optimistic about their government 's anti-corruption efforts .
But half of those interviewed globally think their government 's efforts to fight corruption are ineffective .
The institutions which fared best were religious bodies and non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) - though the perception of NGOs has worsened since the last survey .
Transparency International 's Global Corruption Barometer 2007 interviewed 63,199 people in 60 countries and territories between June and September 2007 .
How Do You Plan To Get Ahead ?
Ways To Increase Your Income
There are many means to the same end , and many roads to financial independence .
Here are several ways to increase your income .
Would n’t it be a great feeling to finally realize you ’re financially independent ?
I know I would be .
But to get to that point , we all need to build up enough of a nest egg that would be substantial enough for us to live on for the rest of our lives .
In the absence of such a boon , we continue to rely on our own labor to keep us going from day to day .
I look around me and find that lots of people are taking their destinies into their own hands .
A couple of co-workers have begun investing in real estate .
Someone I know “ day trades ” during his spare time ( at his own risk ) — well , he actually does “ night trading ” , since he does it after work and into the wee hours of the morning .
Someone else has an eBay store or two .
What ’s great is that there are many ways to make a living and to earn an income .
I ’ve always functioned with the thought that if I find myself “ stuck ” in any one position without progressing or moving forward in some way after a bit of time , then I need to evaluate where I ’m at and see if there ’s any way I can break the monotony of my situation .
If you ’ve ever asked yourself “ is this all I ’m cracked up to be ? ” or if financial and economic progress is important to you , while you find yourself scraping by , then you may want to look into some ways to change your situation .

Here are a few approaches that I or some friends have taken to get ourselves growing professionally , creatively and financially .
You can also consider these as ways to increase your income , improve your cash flow and build your wealth :
Ways To Get Ahead : Professionally and Financially
Get skills .
If you have any of these things : talent , skill , knowledge , energy , then you are employable .
I know too many folks who are worried they wo n’t be able to find a job that they enjoy .
If you ’re one such person who demonstrates these personal assets , then there is always work out there that fits your capacities .
If you feel that you do n’t have such skills , you may either be underestimating yourself or your ability to gain these skills .
Consider upgrading what you already have in order to qualify for better opportunities .
Become a career or corporate worker with an eye towards job advancement .
If you are happy with your line of work , and see that you have a solid path for advancement in your company , then investing your time , energy and talent at your company may help reward you with a better position after sometime .
Can you see yourself becoming a leader and do you enjoy working in a team ?
Can you manage people ?
If so , you may be a fit for management .
In reality , with dedication and solid performance records , very good worker bees can find themselves promoted to higher levels whether or not they have the management skills .
But like anything else , management ability can be learned , provided that you like working with people to begin with .
Investor , do n’t waste another moment .
Start investing early .
The one thing that we should n’t waste is another moment not being invested in the market .
If your financial house is in order , with your savings accumulating steadily , expenses under control and debt on its way out , then you can work towards the goal of having your money eventually building up enough so that it can do most of the work for you ( instead of you having to work for it ) .
You can open accounts in mutual fund companies or in popular online stock brokerages .
Sign up to automatic investing programs at your investment institutions .
The automatic investing programs allowed me to commit to a savings and investing routine and also made it easy for me to invest even if I did n’t have much to start with .
This way , I was able to begin investing early .
All these years being in the market has paid off as the returns generated by the stock market behave as its own income stream , supplementing any job income we ’ve pulled in .
At a dead end ?
How about job hop till you drop .
What do you seek ?
When looking for a job , you probably have many things you ’re looking for : good position , lucrative pay , benefits , great commute , interesting work , great bunch of people to work with , stability .
You name it .
But one thing you cannot predict is how things will turn out after the “ honeymoon ” is over — that period of time after which you ’ve settled in and figured out how things work at your new company .
Unfortunately , you may realize that reality does n’t match your ideal picture after sometime and the question then haunts you : do you “ settle ” for the job you have at the moment or take the risk and take flight for the seemingly greener grass on the other side ?
I ’ve seen it work both ways : when job hopping yields higher incomes and better matched positions , but I ’ve also seen regret from employees who left a decent job for something less appealing .
Then again , no guts , no glory .
If you ’re going to job hop , maybe these online job resources can help .
Moonlight , with dual jobs and quadruple incomes !
Many families make things work by taking on multiple jobs amongst the breadwinners of the household .
I ’ve even heard of households where both parents maintain two jobs each .
This must be the toughest way to try to get ahead , but people do it for several reasons , including : preparing for a career change by testing the waters before making any job switch , to make more money ( or just to make ends meet ) , or to pursue work they actually enjoy .
A second job can offer the opportunity for someone to decide which work is worth pursuing in the long run , as well as the chance to acquire new skills .
But it can also burn you out , and cause high stress when you find that all your time is spent juggling work obligations .
This may not be a good idea in the long term but could work out if you can take on secondary work on a per project or temporary basis .
Having a primary , stable job and combining it with some freelancing could be a more feasible combination .
Are you a budding entrepreneur ?
Consider building alternative incomes with side businesses .
Here ’s a thought : why not build a side business instead of working a side job ?
If you have a hobby you are passionate about , it may not take much to turn it into a business , especially if you ’re in the creative field .
There could be a market for something you ’re doing and it ’s just a matter of discovering and responding to that demand .
Many of us are “ accidental entrepreneurs ” , people who never knew that a fun diversion actually can pay .
In fact , lots of incredibly successful businesses simply started that way — as somebody ’s part - time project : an experiment that turned into a lucrative venture .
If you ’re a risk taker , become a full - time entrepeneur .
Finally , there are those who have entrepreneurship in their blood .
They do n’t crave stability , and money is n’t necessarily their primary goal .
What they care about most is the nurturing of an idea that has consumed their waking moments and that they ’re convinced will “ change the world ” in some way .
Who cares about a steady paycheck ?
They do n’t .
They ’re aiming for the sky and nurturing grander dreams .
There are also those who ’ve decided to strike it out on their own because they love the independence of working for themselves , of being in control of their own plight and who have decided that the only way they can work is if they ’re their own boss .
-ooOoo -
It ’s a question we ’ve all pondered over : what else can we do to get further ahead ?
Some try to specialize and concentrate on one avenue for increasing their income — say , through career advancement , where they pour all their energies into getting that promotion or big raise .
Others diversify and try out multiple ventures to develop various income streams and reduce the risk of income loss from any one channel .
How about you ?
I ’d love to hear what other things you ’re doing to get closer to your personal and financial goals and what other schemes you ’re implementing to propel yourself forward .

Plastics have dramatically changed the way we live , allowing us to fabricate new and innovative tools , containers and even replaceable body parts like hips and knees , while also spawning a host of undesirable by - products , including nonbiodegradable trash and pollution from fossil fuels such as coal , oil and gas .
Now an emerging industry is trying to polish plastic 's environmentally tarnished image by using waste products such as carbon dioxide and Escherichia coli bacteria to make biodegradable and renewable polymers .
This trend continued Wednesday when Novomer , Inc. , an Ithaca , N.Y. –based company that manufactures ecofriendly plastics and polymers using CO 2 , announced that it had raised $ 6.6 million in a fund - raising campaign ( led by venture capital firms Physic Ventures in San Francisco and Flagship Ventures in Cambridge , Mass . ) .
The company says it plans to use the new monies to expand both its production capacity and development efforts .
This new cash infusion comes on the heels of small business grants from the National Science Foundation ( $ 500,000 ) and the U.S. Department of Energy ( $ 100,000 ) for continued development of its polymerization catalyst systems .
The key ingredients in Novomer 's polymer - making process are metallic catalysts , such as beta - diiminate zinc acetate , which bond greenhouse - gas causing molecules such as CO 2 , as well as carbon monoxide and other renewable materials , to liquid epoxides .
" Plastics are more important right now than at any other point in history , " says Cornell University chemistry professor Geoffrey Coates , Novomer 's co-founder and chief scientific officer , who notes that industry has produced more plastic every year of the past 50 years .
This includes not just commodities like milk jugs or CD cases , but also specialized biomedical devices such as heart stents and emerging technology such as solar cells .
Whereas surgeons today may hold broken bones together with metal screws that subsequently must be removed after the break is healed , bioplastics hold the promise of surgical materials that serve the same purpose but safely degrade within the body negating further surgery .
Technology commercialization firm KensaGroup , LLC , formed Novomer in 2004 based on renewable polymer research conducted by a team of Cornell researchers .
The group was led by Coates and former graduate student Scott Allen , a Novomer co-founder who is now the company 's director of research and development .
Prior to its work , polymers based on biological materials were possible but they were more of a novelty because the prohibitive manufacturing cost discouraged large - scale production .
Novomer 's process is different from other bioplastic - making efforts in several ways , primarily because it is done at room temperature using relatively little energy , says company president , Charles Hamilton .
This means that fossil fuels are not burned during the process .
" We combine liquid epoxides with carbon dioxide in a reactor that 's like a pressure cooker , " he says .
" Throw in a catalyst , and those two parts come together like a zipper .
You create a very long chain of epoxides bonded to carbon dioxide . "
The material that comes out of the reactor — the largest of which is about a one - gallon ( four - liter ) metal tank — is a honeylike liquid containing a small amount of the catalyst material , which is later filtered out .
Novomer develops these polymers for companies that make plastic products , including Kodak .
" It 's very comparable to other large - scale polymers used to make computer cases , films and bottles , " Hamilton says .
Novomer 's plan is to use CO 2 from businesses in other industries , such as concrete manufacturers and hydrogen producers , as the company scales its production systems .
When Cambridge , Mass . –based Metabolix , Inc. , formed in 1992 , the bioplastics industry was built " more on hope than anything else , " says co-founder and chief scientific officer , Oliver Peoples .
The commercialization of bioplastics began in earnest in 2001 when Cargill , Inc. , a Minneapolis - based company that provides everything from agricultural products to risk management services , launched NatureWorks , LLC , to develop biopolymers derived completely from renewable resources at a cost on par with conventional plastics .
Metabolix creates plastic pellets using microorganisms such as E. coli .
" The organism takes sugar and breaks it down , and the polymer is made inside the organism , " he says .
Metabolix extracts the polymer and recycles the waste .
The pellets can be melted down and reshaped to create a variety of plastic products .
Peoples considers other bioplastics producers to be " fellow travelers , " crucial to establishing a good reputation for polymers made from biodegradable and renewable resources .
Such solidarity is important , because " it 'll be a long time before you 'll knock petroleum - based products out of the market , " he says .
" The bottom line is that people need to know these biodegradable plastics are available . "
Efforts to continue making oil - based plastics could be hampered by the growing price of oil , even as the public 's consumption of plastic materials grows unabated .
" The future need for these materials is so great , " Coates says , " there 's plenty of space for all of these [ bioplastics ] companies . "
Longtime viewers of the popular NBC television show Saturday Night Live probably recall " Emily Litella "  an elderly woman with hearing problems commenting on the news on the " Weekend Update " segment , played by the late comedian Gilda Radner .
Litella would read an editorial addressing a public issue , only to be interrupted in the middle of her report by the anchorman , who would point to her error .
" Oh , that ’s very different , " she would humbly respond , adding , " Never mind " and then turn to another topic .
But while Litella was humble enough to admit her mistake and smart enough to change the subject , the proponents of a U.S. military confrontation with Iran will not allow the release of the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran ’s nuclear weapons program to interrupt their march to World War III .
They refuse to accept the collective judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in the autumn of 2003 , and challenge their conclusions by charging that the " anti-Bush " spooks were trying to launch a " preemptive strike " against the White House aimed at undermining plans for air attacks on Iranian nuclear sites .
One could imagine how the neoconservative pundits would be celebrating the quality of the work of the American spy organizations and their professional integrity if the NIE had concluded with " high confidence " that Iran was actually very close to building a nuclear bomb .
That kind of NIE would have become a central weapon in the arsenal of military hard - liners in their political and bureaucratic battles against those whom they would label " appeasers " of Iran , who were proposing that notwithstanding the intelligence indicating that Iran could soon have nukes , President Bush should not rush into another unnecessary and costly war in the Middle East .
Moreover , if after a U.S. military operation against Iran , Americans were to discover that the leaders in Tehran had indeed terminated their nuclear military program in 2003 , the neocons would place the responsibility for the fiasco on the shoulders of the U.S. intelligence agencies , insisting that " virtually every intelligence agency came up with the same assumption , that there would be stockpiles of WMDs in Iran . "
Supporters of what would have proven to be a senseless war with Iran would then lament " second - guessing " and " defeatism . "
After all , they would assert : " We made a decision based on the intelligence that was available .
Instead of whining , how about us doing a ‘ surge ’ of U.S. troops in Tehran ? "
The lesson of the blunders of American spy agencies in Iraq is not that Americans need quality intelligence before going to war .
The fact is that even under the optimal conditions , U.S. intelligence , or for that matter , any intelligence service in the world , will never be " intelligent " enough  in the sense of having complete and accurate information about all the threats facing their " clients . "
Bureaucratic inertia , political pressures , and just plain professional incompetence and personal corruption are all part of the cloak - and - dagger business , which is far from being an exact science .
Intelligence should be utilized by political leaders with skepticism  especially if and when they consider going to war  and then only as part of a larger menu of information and ideas , coupled with a sense of history , not to mention common sense .
The decision on U.S. policy toward the Shi’ite rulers in Tehran , not unlike the approach Washington should have adopted toward the Ba’ath regime in Iraq , should be based first and foremost on a clear consideration of America ’s national interest as part of an open debate involving Congress and the general public .
Such a serious national debate on U.S. policy in the Middle East has not taken place since the end of the Cold War .
Indeed , in order to decide whether Americans should be deploying troops in the Middle East to fight a war against Iran , Americans need to ask themselves and their leaders a simple question : Does Iran pose a major threat to their core national interests ?
Depending on the response to this and such related questions , good U.S. intelligence could certainly provide the American people and their leaders with valuable strategic assets if and when they decide to go to war .
But intelligence  or a lack thereof  should not become the default trigger of that war .

But the services themselves will also aid Wal - Mart ’s bottom line .
Ms. Thompson said that Wal - Mart ’s financial services products provide “ healthy margins , ” and that she expects the overall business to grow 30 to 40 percent over the next year .

Much of what Wal - Mart announced yesterday will be directed at consumers who do not use banks .
Wal - Mart says , for example , that 20 percent of its customers — about 27 million people — do not have checking accounts .
The so - called Wal - Mart Money Card , to be issued with GE Money , a division of General Electric , would allow customers to transfer their paychecks directly onto their cards and make purchases at any retailer that accepts Visa cards .
It will also allow them to check their balances online or on mobile phone , pay certain bills or withdraw cash from A.T.M.’s .
The prepaid card will initially cost $ 8.95 , and comes with a $ 4.95 monthly maintenance fee .
Cash can be loaded on the card free by cashing a payroll or government check at Wal - Mart or having the money directly deposited ; otherwise , cardholders must pay $ 4.64 to reload it .
Those without a bank account can “ finally take advantage of more mainstream financial services , ” Ms. Thompson said .
It also could position the retailer to offer new services , like an interest - bearing savings feature that Ms. Thompson said Wal - Mart was considering .
Analysts said there was ample evidence that Wal - Mart would lower the costs of banking in the United States .
The chain has already cut the cost of cashing checks by 50 percent , and its financial services saved customers $ 245 million last year , according to company executives .
Wal - Mart has never hidden its banking ambitions , but it has arguably masked them from time to time .
In 2005 , Wal - Mart said it would seek permission to open a bank in Utah that would process credit and debit card transactions for its 4,000 American stores .
At the time , it vowed that it would never use the bank to enter the consumer financial services business .
Nevertheless , opposition to its plans , which required the approval of federal regulators , swelled .
Dozens of banking and corporate watchdog groups testified at hearings outside Washington .
Dear reader !
Should this column impress you as being more than usually lyrical , recalling perhaps the imagery and elegance of poetry by Baudelaire or Verlaine ; should it seem a bit decadent , redolent of Oscar Wilde ’s withering hauteur ; should it have a touch of madness or perversity , combining , say , the tastes of Toulouse - Lautrec with the passions of van Gogh ; should it simply sound direct and forceful and knowing like one of Ernest Hemingway ’s characters ; should it do any or all of that , let me credit something that each of these figures fervently paid tribute to : the green fairy , the green goddess , the green muse , the glaucous witch , the queen of poisons .
Absinthe .
For this column was conceived under the influence of a green - colored , high - proof herbal liquor that was illegal in the United States for more than 95 years .
And not just here , for when that mini-Prohibition began in 1912 , alarm bells were ringing all over Europe .
In 1905 a Swiss man murdered his family after drinking absinthe , leading to the liquor ’s banishment from that country , where it originated .
The French thought they risked losing World War I to robust beer - drinking Germans because of the dissolute influence of absinthe , so it was banned in that nation as well .
The medical evidence was also damning .
As early as 1879 The New York Times warned that absinthe “ is much more perilous , as well as more deleterious , than any ordinary kind of liquor . ”
A 19th - century French doctor , who made a lifetime study of absinthism , chronicled its symptoms : “ sudden delirium , epileptic attacks , vertigo , hallucinatory delirium . ”

But recently this anise - flavored spirit has been seeping back into the mainstream .
In 1994 a museum devoted to absinthe opened in Auvers - sur - Oise , outside Paris .
With its limited availability and exotic reputation , the drink inspired cultish devotion .
It tantalized with its promises of visionary consciousness , so elaborately celebrated by a century of artists and writers .
Working shifts including at night is common in the medical profession
By Clare Davidson
Business reporter , BBC News
At only 27 , Abigail Medniuk is resigned to decades of working odd hours .
" I knew my career would be open to a lifetime of night shifts and anti-social hours , " says Dr Medniuk , a senior house officer in anaesthetics at Kent and Sussex Hospital .
Night workers are always fighting the natural light which the body finds hard to adjust to
James Waterhouse , Liverpool John Moores University
In her new job she avoids the long stretches of nights , but jumps between night shifts and day shifts at two or three day intervals .
She accepts the hours , but is emphatic on one point : " You never get used to it . "
Body clock
What becomes immediately obvious from talking to researchers is how disruptive night work is for the body .
This has huge health implications .
The most obvious result of night work or shift work outside normal office hours is the disruption to the circadian rhythm , or body clock .
The body clock helps us stay awake and alert in the daytime and enables us to sleep and recuperate at night , explains Professor James Waterhouse , a sport and exercise science specialist at Liverpool John Moores University .
Our body temperature rises during the day and boosts naturally occurring levels of adrenaline .
In the evenings , the body cools down , reaching its lowest temperature in the early hours .
" Night workers are always fighting the natural light , which the body finds hard to adjust to , " he says .
Doing damage
It is not simply a matter of inadequate sleep .
Even when workers do sleep it is often poor quality and interrupted .
Fatigue has been cited as a factor in major accidents
Fatigue and accumulative sleep deprivation can be insidious , developing slowly over time with workers unaware of its impact , according to the Health & Safety Executive ( HSE ) .
But it can also be potentially disastrous , if judgement is impaired or concentration compromised , especially for operators of machinery .
According to the HSE , the incident of accidents on night shifts are higher .
Night - time workers ' fatigue has been cited as a factor in several well - known disasters , according to a report by the Association of Professional Sleep Societies .
These include the Exxon Valdez oil spill , the Bhopal chemical blast and the Chernobyl nuclear explosion .
Cutting the risks associated with night and shift work would help improve workers ' health and safety .
But the HSE is keen to stress that it could also help businesses financially by reducing absenteeism , injuries and accidents , while also boosting productivity .
24 hour society ?
Accidents aside , researchers say disrupting the circadian rhythm and the resulting lack of sleep can have a range of other effects .
Research has shown gastrointestinal disorders are common complaints by night workers , says Debra Skene , head of the Neuroendocrinology School of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences at Surrey University .
These include indigestion , loss of appetite and peptic ulcers .
In a sense 24 - hour society is here but it is n't here truly
James Waterhouse , Liverpool John Moores University
And increased risks of cardiovascular problems , such as hypertension , are another issue .
What causes this is not exactly clear , says Professor Waterhouse .
But antisocial hours means not only are workers awake when their bodies want to be asleep , they tend to have less access to facilities that help maintain a healthy lifestyle .
For example night workers are less likely to join a gym or association that might have physical and social benefits , he says .
" In a sense the 24 - hour society is here , but it is n't here truly . "
Access to decent healthy food at night is a common problem .
He says often night workers eat their evening meal with their families or partners because it is the main time to catch up .
But this can create problems regarding what to do during the main break at work .
" People do n't feel like a full meal so resort to eating crisps or chocolate , " he adds .
' No solution '
There are better and worse aspects of the different types of rotas used for night work , says Dr Medniuk .
It is a relief that in her new job she does n't face the prospect of seven consecutive nights at work .
On the other hand , her current rota is completely irregular and she says the time off is not enough to do much .
Night work
Night workers are those who regularly work for at least three hours between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am
Employers must offer a free health assessment before starting work at night and regularly after that Fatigue , sleep deficit and a disrupted circadian rhythm are said to be exacerbated by 12 hour shifts
Advancing shifts ( mornings , then afternoons , then nights ) are easier to adapt to than the reverse Source : London Hazards Centre , Health & Safety Executive
These two models - one with the week of nights compared to two and three days stints - are commonly used by employers that operate shift or night work .
A more extreme option involves around a month of nights or late shifts followed by time off .
But fundamentally , the problem with all these patterns is the clash between trying to work at night , when everyone else including family and friends are not , while having a " normal " life in between researchers say .
" There is no solution because we tend to revert to being daytime creatures , " says Professor Waterhouse .
He adds the best way to truly adapt to night work would be to stick to being awake at night even on days off .
A weekend lie - in is not the solution , he says .
Above all , the body wants regularity .
This applies not only to night shifts but also for people working other irregular shifts , says Professor Skene .
Getting up at 4 am or 5 am is likely to mean people are always short of sleep because they are unlikely to have gone to bed the extra two to three hours earlier .
Moreover , constantly changing patterns is disastrous for the body as the circadian rhythm is " completely shot " , says Professor Skene .
It might take several weeks to rectify an irregular pattern over several years .
The inbuilt body clock helps us sleep and recuperate at night
Haphazard
A spokesperson for the Transport and General Workers Union says there is plenty of information available but all too often organisations do n't seek advice when devising shifts .
Professor Horne echoes this , saying firms plan night shifts as if they were day shifts .
Working at night is " fundamentally different " and many decisions about shift patterns " seem haphazard " he says .
This includes the increasing trend of 12 - hour night shifts " even though there is n't the research to show it is a good idea " .
Organisations can gain advice to avoid the worst case scenarios , he adds .
" Employers do n't understand that working at night might be a health issue as well as a safety issue , " says T&G .
Professor Waterhouse sums up the problem by saying society has fundamentally changed in a very short period , but human biology has not .
Some cope better than others , but whatever expectation we have of a 24 - hour society , we can not eliminate our inbuilt body clock .
Two leading scientific journals , Science and Nature , are reviewing their editorial policies after complaints that they published material by researchers with undisclosed financial interests in their research fields .
Thirty - two researchers and ethicists signed the complaint about articles in recent issues of the two journals .
Science recently published five items involving researchers who may have financial biases , the critics said .
The articles in question were generally editorials , commentaries and data reviews of other scientists ' work , which generally are not covered by disclosure policies .
According to the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest , Danforth Plant Sciences Center published an editorial supporting genetically engineered crops .
Danforth has been supported by agri-giant Monsanto , CSPI said .
In another example , critics said Emory University 's psychiatry chairman reviewed mood disorder therapies in the monthly journal Nature Neuroscience without revealing his ownership of a patent on one of the treatments .
Nature 's executive editor said he is considering changing the publication 's disclosure rules and pointing out in print which contributors decline to answer disclosure questions .
But he said most of what the critics described as " academic entrepreneurship " is appropriate and does n't necessarily taint research .

Keeping an eye on SARS : Tracking both rumors and reality , the World Health Organization announced plans to test a new SARS surveillance system next week in the regions of China that were hardest hit by the disease .
Health specialists want such surveillance in place in case SARS , which ebbed in June , returns in the cold weather of coming months .
With a four - week trial run of the system , WHO hopes to see China detecting more suspected SARS cases — even if those cases do n't turn out to be the disease — in the belief that many false alarms demonstrate better medical vigilance .
WHO officials in Beijing have said they were concerned that China , unlike other affected countries , has had very few SARS - related false alarms , or " noise . "
That suggests less information is flowing in or being made public .
The trial will involve between 10 and 14 hospitals in southern China 's Guangdong and northern China 's Shanxi and in Beijing , said WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng .

Cancer vaccine trials suspended : Antigenics said regulators suspended late - stage clinical trials of the company 's cancer vaccine and requested more information about the product before the company can proceed .
The company said just two weeks ago that the vaccine significantly improved survival in 52 percent of patients with advanced colon cancer who responded to the drug .
Antigenics also said on Aug. 18 that all 15 of the colon cancer patients whose immune systems responded to Oncophage were alive two years after the treatment , while only half of the patients who did not respond to the vaccine were alive .
Antigenics said safety of the Oncophage vaccine was not an issue in discussions with the FDA , and patients already enrolled in Phase III trials could continue with their course of treatment .
Oncophage is a personalized vaccine derived from a patient 's own tumor .
Because the injected drug contains the patient 's own genetic codes , it is believed to be more effective in re-programming the immune system to attack the cancer without side effects .

Using fat to fight fat : Scientists have found clues to how a naturally occurring fat compound blocks hunger , which could pave the way for a new class of safer anti-obesity drugs .
In a study published in Nature , scientists at the University of California at Irvine said they had shown how the fatty acid oleyethelanolamide ( OEA ) – found naturally in the diet – bonds with cells to send the body a signal to stop eating .
The researchers fed high - fat diets to two groups of mice : one normal and one mutant group with cell receptors that interact with OEA genetically removed .
Normal mice ate less and lost weight with the treatment , but it had no effect on the mice with their cell receptors removed – suggesting that cell receptors play a key role in how the fat communicates to the body to stop eating .
Other man -made drugs that are now being tested for obesity work in similar ways , but they are seen as potentially more toxic than naturally occurring OEA , researchers said ..

Yesterday , the bank decided that the repo rate would again remain at - 0.5 per cent .
It is the same decision they have made on several occasions before .
It seems that the old plan is still being followed and that one wants to raise the first time in the middle of next year .
It is quite quiet when it comes to the repo rate
No surprises and definitely no stress from the bank , as they stay calm and keep the repo rate at the same low level .
Their major goal is to keep inflation at the level that has been their target for a long time – namely 2 percent .
In the past it has been a little difficult to reach up to 2 percent , but they are now very close .
Even though they are close to their target , they still do not want to start raising interest rates , because they are afraid that they can then destroy the development of inflation so that it does not stay where it should .
The reason for their actions is that they are , firstly , because it has required so much support from monetary policy in the past to raise inflation and secondly that it is a fairly dampened inflationary pressure internationally , with expansionary monetary policy abroad .
In summary , it can be said that the bank wants to take the safe before the uncertain and not destroy what they have so slowly built up .
Some are certainly clearly tired of the negative repo rate and think it is no longer needed or does any major benefit but although this may be true to a large extent , it is not just that it is negative or positive which is the big thing without it is about the raises themselves .
Each increase in the interest rate can affect the country ’s economy in different ways , for example by affecting the housing market , the economy and inflation , so you cannot raise the interest rate anyway .
Often you want to at least warn in advance that raises are on the way so that the market is not shocked .
As the bank follows its plan very closely , there will be no surprises that could adversely affect the market .
When is the interest rate actually raised ?
The bank ’s own forecast says that the repo rate will be raised for the first time in mid-2018 , and then we may not see any major increase .
Perhaps the interest rate will then be - 0.4 percent .
The increases will then come at a slow pace .
In the fourth quarter of 2018 , we aim to have an interest rate of - 0.27 percent .
In 2019 , the plan is to slowly raise interest rates above zero and get a positive repo rate for the first time in several years .
In the fourth quarter of 2019 , the forecast says that interest rates will be 0.24 percent , which is still not very much .
So we can expect slow and small increases that work upwards .
The next few years will probably not present any major hazards in this area .
How does it affect my finances ?
What you should consider , however , is not only what the repo rate is , but also how much it increases in percentage , since it is so closely linked to the mortgage rate .
It is quite important for us where the mortgage rate falls as it affects our housing costs every month .
If we assume that the interest rate goes from - 0.5 ( as it is now ) to 0 percent sometime in the beginning of 2019 , then this is an increase of the interest rate by about 0.5 percent .
That does not sound like much , but if you consider that today the mortgage rate is about 1.5 per cent on average , and that this interest rate also increases in line with the repo rate , then the interest rate on the mortgage can be at 2 per cent in about a year .
It is still a low interest rate of course , but the interesting thing is the percentage increase .
The interest rate has then gone up by about 25 percent compared to the current level .
This also means that interest costs will go up by 25 percent .
If you have a mortgage loan of SEK 2.5 million , this means that you have to pay SEK 4,167 per month instead of SEK 3,125 .
In pure money , therefore , a little more than SEK 1,000 a month extra to pay .
This means that even if the rate hike itself is small , there will be a noticeable increase for you in your expenses and it is something to keep in mind and plan for so that you will not be surprised when it becomes reality .
It is important that you try to save money now that the interest rate is low so that you have a buffer on the day when the interest rate is higher and your loan becomes more expensive .
In the longer term , of course , one can expect that the interest rate will go up even more and even this one should of course try to plan for as best it can go .
Of course , you can fix your interest rate if you feel it is good .
It should be borne in mind that it is not necessarily cheaper to fix the interest rate now that the bank is obviously looking ahead and setting its long - term interest rates at levels that match what they believe the interest rate will end up in the future .
It is therefore difficult to find a way to fix the interest rate when you get an unusually good deal .
However , it is an alternative to consider if you want the extra security to know more exactly how much to pay each month .
You can also tie up part of your loan and have a second part movable , so that you get some security at a slightly higher price and some movable and cheaper .
However , one small advantage of the repo rate starting to recover is that savings rates may finally make sense , so it is worth saving money in a savings account .
Right now , there are few savings accounts that have such high interest rates that it is no idea to save money in this way .
It has been much better to have the money in eg funds , although this also poses a slightly greater risk .
Everyone who wants to save with very low risk or those who just happen to have a lot of money lying in the bank account can hopefully get a little better return in the future .
In the format war that consumers have wisely tried to ignore , HD DVD got one thing right : the name .
Familiar and easy to spell , it sounds like a simple upgrade for something we already own .
Blu-ray , on the other hand , is pretty much better in every other way .
It has a larger capacity and a better range of movies , and it 's slowly edging out HD DVD in the sales charts .
Add to that the PlayStation3 , which includes a Blu-ray drive , and things start to look bleak for HD DVD .
The upside ?

ON a Sunday night last month at Daddy ’s , a bar in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , more than a dozen people in their 20s and 30s gathered at a professional soiree , drinking frozen margaritas and nibbling store - bought cookies .
With their thrift - store inspired clothes and abundant tattoos , they looked as if they could be filmmakers , Web designers , coffee shop purveyors or artists .
When talk turned to a dance party the group had recently given at a nearby restaurant , their profession became clearer .
“ Did you try the special drinks ? ” Sarah Gentile , 29 , asked Jennifer Yao , 31 , referring to the colorfully named cocktails .
“ I got the Joy of Sex , ” Ms. Yao replied .
“ I thought for sure it was French Women Do n’t Get Fat . ”
Ms .
Yao could be forgiven for being confused : the drink was numbered and the guests had to guess the name .
“ 613.96 C , ” said Ms. Yao , cryptically , then apologized : “ Sorry if I talk in Dewey . ”
By definition , the aim of " terrorism " is not to topple the U.S. government , or even to rack up a massive body count ( though that seems to be a perk for them ) .
The aim of terrorism is to cause terror .
It 's to scare us .
Frighten us .
Alter our way of life , and get our government to change its policies .
In this sense , the very people who are supposed to be protecting us from terrorists are playing right into the terrorists ' hands .
Despite the absence of any specific information , and despite the fact that his saying as much would do little if anything to actually thwart a pending attack , Chertoff still feels he has to go public with his " gut feeling " that something awful might happen this summer .
And so the newspapers and Drudge and the blogs run with it .
And now we get to go about our summer business with the foreboding cloud of a possible terror attack looming on the horizon .
This is pretty consistent with how the government has behaved since 9/11 : vague warnings , a lack of specific information , and lots of hassle .
We now go through an expensive , invasive , tedious , basically useless ritual every time we get on an airplane because the government feels like if we 're hassled and frightened , we 'll at least feel safer .
When Britain broke up a half - assed attempt at an attack using liquid explosives , the government decided to add a complicated sorta ' - ban on carrying gels and liquids onto flights , too .
Never mind that the broken - up attack would n't have worked , or that it would be nearly impossible to bring down a plane with liquid explosives stored in a carry - on bag .
And now , Chertoff casts a shadow over the summer based on rumbles in his gut .
Al - Qaeda does n't actually have to kill people to cause terror , especially if we 're doing their PR work for them .
In addition to the inherent hardships and risks that come with serving in the military , many female soldiers are dealing with the potential trauma of sexual assault and rape , according to a PBS investigation for its “ NOW ” TV series .
PBS via Crooks and Liars :
Last year alone , almost 3,000 soldiers reported sexual assault and rape by other soldiers .
One woman recounts her ordeal of rape by her superior officer .
Many more do n’t report the incidents for fear of how it will affect their careers .
The shocking phenomenon has a label : military sexual trauma , or MST .

Housing slump hits Houston renters in wallets Housing slump hits renters in wallets
As mortgage credit tightens , people stay in apartments , pay more for leases
In the past few years , throngs of apartment dwellers ditched their rental digs as subprime credit and loose lending standards allowed more Houstonians to buy homes .
But now that the days of easy money have ended and the apartment market strengthens , renters are feeling the pain .
" We 're not nearly where New York or L.A. are , but we 're going more and more in that direction , " said Tim Brookover , a renter who had a hard time finding anything for less than $ 1,000 a month when he was looking at one - and two - bedroom apartments last spring .
Last year , renters were paying an average of $ 659 a month .
As of October , the average rate was up to $ 681 .
At the same time that more renters are staying put because they 're unable to qualify for a loan or are worried about buying a house in today 's market , Houston companies are adding jobs , and older apartments are being torn down , fueling multifamily demand and allowing landlords to raise rents .
While overall occupancy is flat in Houston — influenced by more than 10,000 new units under construction — rental growth is strengthening , said Bruce McClenny , president of Apartment Data Services .
" There 's enough people looking for apartments right now , and absorption is strong enough to keep prospective renters coming in and renting , to give ( landlords ) the confidence to hold and move their rents , " McClenny said .
Houston - based Camden Property
Trust tracks the percentage of its renters that move out to buy homes .
It 's dropped to 17 percent from 24 percent 18 months ago .
Alan Patton , president of the Morgan Group , a multifamily developer headquartered in Houston , said apartment dwellers may choose to rent longer because it 's harder for people with spotty credit or no down payment to get a mortgage .
" Some people may actually have a wait - and - see approach , hoping that housing prices may come down as a result of the mortgage problems , " he said .
Big landlords are n't the only ones benefiting .
Reasons to lease
In October , more single - family homes , high - rise units and townhomes listed on the Multiple Listing Service were leased than the same month last year , according to the Houston Association of Realtors
Some would - be home buyers are saying , " ' Gee , maybe a single - family home is n't the golden goose investment that everybody said it was a couple years ago , ' " said Camden CEO Ric Campo .
" They 're not buying because they do n't think it 's a good deal . "
Then there are the folks who want to buy a house , but can't .
Lacey Abshire separated from her husband and moved into a rental house in the northwest Stonegate subdivision .
She has had two foreclosures and has been told by three mortgage brokers that buying a house is out of the question .
" I'm now stuck renting to the tune of $ 1,250 a month , which is a house note , " said Abshire , an executive assistant at a real estate company .
She lost the two homes — one of which was a rental property — several years ago after she could n't sell them and was unable to keep paying both notes .
One had a mold problem and the other was in a neighborhood with competitively priced new homes , she said , explaining why they did n't sell .
Her credit score dropped from 680 to the low 500s .
" People with the banks and mortgage companies need to realize that things happen , " said Abshire , 46 .
" They need to take a look at the whole picture . "
While the housing slowdown is helping the business of multifamily developers , new construction , some said , is largely fueled by job creation .
Of the 16,500 units under construction , more than 5,000 will be delivered into the supply by the end of the year , according to Apartment Data Services .
Those numbers are high , McClenny said , but supply has n't become a problem .
And the seizure in the credit market could dampen the number of new apartments because cash is n't as available as it once was .
But there 's a flip side .
A high number of foreclosures — primarily in the most troubled entry - level sector — could create more competition for apartment owners , said Mark Dotzour , chief economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University .
" If those go back to the lenders , they 're going to be purchased by investors who will put them back into the rental pool , " he said .
In the meantime , experts predict continued strong demand and higher rents , particularly in high - end complexes .
Brookover and his partner ended up renting a two - bedroom unit in the Montrose area for $ 850 a month .
The apartment does n't have central air or heat or an ice maker .
But they were willing to sacrifice creature comforts to avoid paying more rent .
" We could have made it work , but we would have been so strapped every month , " Brookover said .

and the Department of Homeland Security are quietly pushing for a set of crazy new rules .
All travellers in the U.S. will be required to get government - issued credentials and official clearance before every flight , both within the United States as well as internationally .
And Monday we received a new political action alert from Edward Hasbrouk , The Practical Nomad blogger who 's been fighting the plan ( and who testified about it at a TSA hearing ) .
" The international Advance Passenger Information System rules were published , as ' final ' effective February 19,2008 , with no further opportunity for public comment even on the changes from the original proposal .
" Hasbrouck sees this as a very ominous development .
" The Department of Homeland Security can now evade debate on the similar elements of their Secure Flight proposal by claiming that it's needed to ' harmonize ' the domestic and international travel restrictions — as though travel within America was tantamount to and subject to the same government restrictions and controls as crossing international borders .
"
The stakes are high — and air travel may never be the same .
" The Secure Flight proposal also includes new and odious requirements that travelers display their government - issued credentials — not to government agents , but to airline personnel ( staff or contractors ) , whenever the Department of Homeland Security orders the airline to demand them … " That alone will create a huge potential for abuse .
" The proposed Secure Flight rules would leave travelers hopelessly at the mercy of any identity thief who claims to be an airline contractor ( subcontractor , sub - subcontractor , etc. ) demanding ' Your papers , please ! ' anywhere in an airport .
" But your personal information faces an even bigger risk .
" In addition , the proposed rules would leave the airlines free to keep all the information obtained from travelers under government coercion , even after they 've passed it on to the government .
Your personal data would continue to be considered , at least in America , solely their property .
Not yours ... " According to Hasbrouk , the Identity Project — an organization defending our right to travel freely in our own country — has made requests under the Privacy Act and they " have uncovered many more details ( and many more problems ) with the U.S. government 's dossiers of travel records , which include everything from what books travelers were carrying to phone numbers of friends and associates to whether they asked for one bed or two in their hotel room .
"
Unfortunately , Monday , October 22 was the deadline for posting public comments on the proposed rules .
But it 's never too late to express your outrage ... against another act in the continuing project to turn the United States into North Korea .
Socialism and Foreign Aid
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
Statement for the House International Relations Committee Hearing on Implementation of the Millennium Challenge Act
Mr. PAUL : Mr. Chairman , though the ill - conceived Millennium Challenge
Act has already become law and therefore we are only talking about its implementation today , it is nevertheless important to again address some very fundamental problems with this new foreign aid program .
I believe that the Millennium Challenge Account ( MCA ) may be one of the worst foreign policy blunders yet — and among the most costly .
It is advertised as a whole new kind of foreign aid — apparently an honest admission that the old system of foreign aid does not work .
But rather than get rid of the old , bad system of foreign aid in favor of this “ new and improved ” system , we are keeping both systems and thereby doubling our foreign aid .
I guess it is easy to be generous with other people ’s money .
In reality , this “ new and improved ” method of sending US taxpayer dollars overseas will likely work no better than the old system , and may in fact do more damage to the countries that it purports to help .
The MCA budget request for fiscal year 2005 is $ 2.5 billion .
We have been told that somewhere between 12 and 16 countries have met the following criteria for inclusion in the program : “ ruling justly , investing in people , and pursuing sound economic policies . ”
It is a good idea to pay close attention to these criteria , as they tell the real tale of this new program .
First , what does “ investing in people ” mean ?
It is probably safe to assume that “ investing in people ” does not mean keeping taxes low and government interference to a minimum so that individuals can create wealth through private economic activity .
So , in short , this program will reward socialist - style governance .
In fact , this program will do much more harm than good .
MCA will hurt recipient country economies .
Sending US aid money into countries that are pursuing sound economic policies will not help these economies .
On the contrary , an external infusion of money to governments meeting the economic criteria will actually obscure areas where an economy is inefficient and unproductive .
This assistance will slow down necessary reform by providing a hidden subsidy to unproductive sectors of the economy .
We thus do no favors for the recipient country in the long term with this harmful approach .
MCA is a waste of taxpayer money .
Countries that pursue sound economic policies will find that international financial markets provide many times the investment capital necessary for economic growth .
MCA funds will not even be a drop in the bucket compared to what private capital can bring to bear in an economy with promise and potential .
And this capital will be invested according to sound investment strategies — designed to make a profit — rather than allocated according to the whim of government bureaucrats .
MCA is corporate welfare for politically - connected US firms .
These companies will directly benefit from this purported aid to foreign countries , as the money collected from US taxpayers can under the program be transferred directly to US companies to complete programs in the recipient countries .
As bad as it is for US tax dollars to be sent overseas to help poor countries , what is worse is for it to be sent abroad to help rich and politically - connected US and multi-national companies .
MCA encourages socialism and statism .
Because it is entirely geared toward foreign governments , it will force economically devastating “ public - private partnerships ” in developing nations : if the private sector is to see any of the money it will have to be in partnership with government .
There should be no doubt that these foreign governments will place additional requirements on the private firms in order to qualify for funding .
Who knows how much of this money will be wasted on those companies with the best political connections to the foreign governments in power .
The MCA invites political corruption by creating a slush fund at the control of foreign governments .
MCA encourages a socialist approach to health care in recipient countries .
In rewarding a top - down government - controlled approach to health care , the program ignores the fact that this model has failed miserably wherever it has been applied .
Ask anyone in the former communist countries how they liked their government healthcare system .
Finally , MCA is another tool to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign nations .
Already we see that one of the countries slated to receive funds is the Republic of Georgia , where former cronies of dictator Eduard Shevardnadze staged a coup against him last year and have since then conducted massive purges of the media and state institutions , have jailed thousands in phony “ anti-corruption ” campaigns , and have even adopted their own political party flag as the new flag of the country .
The current government in Georgia does not deserve a dime of aid from the United States .
Though the Millennium Challenge Account is advertised as a brand new approach to foreign aid — foreign aid that really works — it is in fact expensive and counter - productive , and will be very unlikely to affect real change in the countries it purports to help .
The wisest approach to international economic development is for the United States to lead by example , to re-embrace the kind of economic policies that led us to become wealthy in the first place .
This means less government , less taxation , no foreign meddling .
Demonstrating the effectiveness of limited government in creating wealth would be the greatest gift we could send overseas .

Ex-coalition leader says Bush failed to have plan Sanchez :
It 's time to withdraw troops , let Iraq take responsibility

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , who led coalition forces through the first critical year of Iraq 's insurgency , said Saturday in a nationally broadcast radio address that President Bush had failed to " devise a strategy for victory " and that the time had come to withdraw U.S. troops .
In the Democratic rebuttal to Bush 's weekly radio address , Sanchez offered conditional support to a House war funding bill that requires combat troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2008 .
Bush has threatened to veto the bill , passed more than a week ago .
Sanchez , in an interview with the San Antonio Express - News on Saturday , cautioned that it 's unrealistic to expect all GIs to be out of the country in a year , and noted that Americans could be there a decade or more .
But , he added , " We 've got to transition responsibility to the Iraqis as rapidly as possible and allow for a corresponding drawdown in our forces . "
The White House said in a statement that Bush " appreciates General Sanchez 's service to our country " and that a troop surge " is starting to deliver the intended results , and Iraq is now in a different phase than when he was commander on the ground . "
Sanchez , 56 , of San Antonio , is the first Iraq coalition commander to anchor the Democratic radio address .
He has been critical of the administration 's management of the war since retiring last year at Fort Sam Houston , telling the Express - News this past May that the best Washington could hope for in Iraq was a stalemate .
As the coalition commander , Sanchez said in Saturday 's broadcast , he personally witnessed " the administration 's failure to devise a strategy for victory in Iraq that employed , in a coordinated manner , the political , economic , diplomatic and military power of the United States .
That failure continues today . "
Bush , in his radio address , cited the sacrifices of Americans who have defended the nation over the centuries , including troops and first - responders .
As progress in Iraq continues in fits and starts , Sanchez said that America 's military has become increasingly strained by the war .
He predicted it would take at least a decade to reverse the damage done to the Army 's ability to fight future wars .
The service , he added , is at its " lowest level " of force readiness since Vietnam .

Blunt assessment delivered as British hand over security to Iraqis ( Warning :
The film below contains graphic images which some viewers may find distressing )
The full scale of the chaos left behind by British forces in Basra was revealed yesterday as the city 's police chief described a province in the grip of well - armed militias strong enough to overpower security forces and brutal enough to behead women considered not sufficiently Islamic .
As British forces finally handed over security in Basra province , marking the end of 4 ½ years of control in southern Iraq , Major General Jalil Khalaf , the new police commander , said the occupation had left him with a situation close to mayhem .
" They left me militia , they left me gangsters , and they left me all the troubles in the world , " he said in an interview for Guardian Films and ITV .
Khalaf painted a very different picture from that of British officials who , while acknowledging problems in southern Iraq , said yesterday 's handover at Basra airbase was timely and appropriate .
Major General Graham Binns , who led British troops into the city in 2003 , said the province had " begun to regain its strength " .
He added : " I came to rid Basra of its enemies and I now formally hand Basra back to its friends . "
But in the film , to be broadcast on the Guardian Unlimited website and ITV News , Khalaf lists a catalogue of failings , saying :
· Basra has become so lawless that in the last three months 45 women have been killed for being " immoral " because they were not fully covered or because they may have given birth outside wedlock ;
· The British unintentionally rearmed Shia militias by failing to recognise that Iraqi troops were loyal to more than one authority ;
· Shia militia are better armed than his men and control Iraq 's main port .
In the interview he said the main problem the Iraqi security forces now faced was the struggle to wrest control back from the militia .
He appealed for the British to help him do that : " We need the British to help us to watch our borders - both sea and land and we need their intelligence and air support and to keep training the Iraqi police . "
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , who attended the handover ceremony , acknowledged that the territory was not " a land of milk and honey " and promised Britain would remain a " committed friend " of Iraq .
But he insisted it was the right time to hand back control .
" The key conditions for the transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi security forces are whether they are up to it : do they have the numbers ?
Do they have the leadership and training to provide leadership for this province ?
And the answer to those three questions is yes , " he said .
After the handover Des Browne , the defence secretary , praised British forces - 174 of whom have died since the start of the war in March 2003 .
" Their contribution has been outstanding and their courage inspiring , " he said .
A scaled - down UK force will remain in a single base at Basra airport , with a small training mission and a rapid reaction team on " overwatch " .
Britain now has 4,500 troops in Iraq .
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , has said numbers would shrink to 2,500 by mid-2008 though those released may be redeployed to Afghanistan .
Khalaf , who has survived 20 assassination attempts since he became police chief six months ago , said Britain 's intentions had been good but misguided .
" I do n't think the British meant for this mess to happen .
When they disbanded the Iraqi police and military after Saddam fell the people they put in their place were not loyal to the Iraqi government .
The British trained and armed these people in the extremist groups and now we are faced with a situation where these police are loyal to their parties not their country . "
He said the most shocking aspect of the breakdown of law and order in Basra was the murder of women for being unIslamic .
" They are being killed because they are accused of behaving in an immoral way .
When they kill them they put underwear and indecent clothes on them . "
In his office Khalaf showed the Guardian a computer holding the files of 48 unidentified women .
" Some of them have even been killed with their children because their killer says that they come out of an adulterous relationship , " he said .
Vince Cable , the acting Lib Dem leader , called for a timetable to bring all British troops home from Iraq , adding : " If we are handing power back to the Iraqis , why are 4,500 British troops needed for what is essentially a training mission ? "

A COUPLE of years ago Dick Morris , an estranged former Clinton adviser , published “ Condi vs. Hillary : The Next Great Presidential Race ” , which argued that Condoleezza Rice was the only person who could save America from a Clinton restoration .
Since then Mrs Clinton has gone from strength to strength , and is preparing to announce her presidential candidacy any day now .
Ms Rice has taken a relentless battering .
The secretary of state spent this week on a tour of the Middle East before touching down in Germany and Britain .
Her aim is to encourage Arab moderates to side with America in stabilising Iraq and the wider Middle East .
Her bait is a promise to the Arab world that she will put more American muscle behind the creation of a Palestinian state .
All worthy goals .
But few people think that she can make much difference .
Ms Rice left home with a flea in her ear .
On January 11th the Senate Foreign Relations Committee savaged her for the administration 's failures in Iraq .
Criticism from the newly ascendant Democrats was perhaps predictable .
But she got more of the same from her Republican colleagues .
Chuck Hagel said that the administration 's new plan in Iraq might be “ the most dangerous foreign - policy blunder in this country since Vietnam ” .
The secretary of state kept her famous poise throughout the grilling , even when Barbara Boxer cattily remarked that she did not have any children who might be killed in Iraq ( Ms Rice is unmarried and childless ) .
But the criticisms were nevertheless telling : as national security adviser in George Bush 's first term , Ms Rice bears almost as much responsibility for the mess in Iraq as Mr Bush , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld .
Her fingerprints are on some of the worst mistakes of the first Bush term .
She claimed the White House was unaware of the CIA 's doubts about whether Saddam Hussein had tried to buy yellowcake uranium in Niger , for example , despite the fact that her office had received two memos on the subject and a call from the CIA director .
But her culpability is deeper than that .
When Ms Rice ran the National Security Council ( NSC ) , it was hopelessly dysfunctional — torn asunder by disputes between the hawks ( Mr Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld ) and the doves ( then secretary of state Colin Powell and his deputy , Richard Armitage ) .
Dealing with a feud between such big political beasts was probably too much for anybody , let alone a relatively inexperienced newcomer .
And Mr Bush bears ultimate responsibility for the acts of his administration .
Still , Ms Rice spent more time with her boss than anybody else , briefing him every day and spending weekends with his family .
She could have done more to force him to listen to Mr Powell 's warnings , which he was temperamentally inclined to ignore .
She could also have done more to warn him about the lack of preparation for post - Saddam Iraq .
Ms Rice was given a chance to redeem her reputation when she was made secretary of state in the second Bush term .
Mr Bush signalled that he wanted a different foreign - policy approach from his first , which Mr Armitage once characterised as “ Look , fucker , you do what we want . ”
She dreamed of reinforcing the expansion of America 's hard power with an expansion of its soft power .
And she brought valuable resources to her mission : a close relationship with the president , a penchant for multilateralism , a collection of deputies who wanted to reach out to the UN , and , for a while , an adoring press .
But her bubble was burst by Israel 's invasion of Lebanon .
The administration started by trying to give Israel the time it needed to destroy Hizbullah .
Ms Rice declared that the world was witnessing “ the birth pangs of a new Middle East ” .
The policy was a disaster : America eventually had to broker a deal that left Hizbullah triumphantly in place .
Ms Rice 's words continue to haunt her on her current tour of the Middle East .
If she is so keen on democracy , why is she cosying up to dictators in Egypt and Saudi Arabia ?
The state of State
Ms Rice has also proved a disappointing manager of the State Department — the institution that was supposed to be the engine of a new diplomatic offensive .
She has lost her number two , Robert Zoellick , and her personal adviser , Philip Zelikow , both impressive men , and still has a significant number of positions to fill .
The department spent an unprecedented six months finding a replacement for Mr Zoellick .
These failures are surprising given Ms Rice 's career before she entered government .
As a child growing up in segregated Alabama , she concluded that she needed to be “ twice as good ” as whites in order to succeed , and notched up a stunning record of achievement — becoming a fine pianist and figure - skater as a child , graduating from university with top honours at 19 , earning tenure at Stanford University at a tender age , and becoming provost of the university at 38 .
But the traits that made Ms Rice such a perfect protégée may be working against her now she is at the top of the tree .
Ms Rice made her career by impressing powerful establishment figures — from Brent Scowcroft ( who brought her into the NSC when she was 34 ) to Messrs Bush senior and junior .
But what happens when your patrons disagree about fundamentals ?
Ms Rice tried a dose of fudge during the first Bush administration ( you can find people on both sides of the diplomatic wars of the first term who believed that she was on their side ) .
But mostly she chose to flatter her current patron .
Ms Rice started her career as a tough - minded realist who was sceptical about nation - building and democratisation .
She might have chosen to restrain her boss 's Manichaean instincts with a dose of that realism .
Instead she went along with him .
Being a perfect protégée can get one a long way up the greasy pole .
But it is not the best qualification for being a successful secretary of state — let alone a candidate for president .
The US report confirmed Iran had a covert programme , Mr Gates said
Mr Gates told a Bahrain conference Iran may have restarted its nuclear weapons programme , despite a US intelligence report saying it had stopped .
He urged Gulf states to put pressure on Iran to " come clean " about past nuclear ambitions and stop uranium enrichment .
US efforts to get Iran to suspend enrichment were 100 % diplomatic and economic , he said .
But all options were on the table , he added .
The Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , had been due to attend the conference , but cancelled at the last moment .
Iran has always insisted the aims of its nuclear programme were peaceful .
' Awkward time '
There can be little doubt that their destabilising foreign policies are a threat to the interests of the United States , to the interests of every country in the Middle East
Robert Gates
US defence secretary
Fresh from his recent visit to US troops in Iraq , Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa , Mr Gates told an audience of Gulf Arab defence and security chiefs that Iran remained a serious threat to the region .
" Everywhere you turn , it is the policy of Iran to foment instability and chaos , no matter the strategic value or cost in the blood of innocents - Christians , Jews and Muslims alike , " he said , at a security conference in the Bahraini capital , Manama .
" There can be little doubt that their destabilising foreign policies are a threat to the interests of the United States , to the interests of every country in the Middle East , and to the interests of all countries within the range of the ballistic missiles Iran is developing . "
Mr Gates acknowledged that last week 's US National Intelligence Estimate , which concluded Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme four years ago , had caused problems for President Bush and confused America 's allies .
The report had come at an awkward time , he said , but both the timing and the content were determined by the US director of national intelligence , not the government .
It showed , said Mr Gates , that Iran did have a covert nuclear weapons programme hidden for years and that it had the mechanism to restart it at any time , if indeed , he added , Iran had not done so already .
Iran was also funding militias in Iraq and supporting Islamist organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah , he said .
Credit flowing to American companies is drying up at a pace not seen in decades , threatening the creation of jobs and the expansion of businesses , while intensifying worries that the economy may be headed for recession .
The combined value of two leading sources of credit — outstanding commercial and industrial bank loans , and short - term loans known as commercial paper — peaked at about $ 3.3 trillion in August , according to data from the Federal Reserve .
By mid-November , such credit was down to $ 3 trillion , a drop of nearly 9 percent .
Not once in the years since the Fed began tracking such numbers in 1973 has this artery of finance constricted so rapidly .
Smaller declines preceded three recessions going back to 1975 ; at other times such declines tended to occur in conjunction with an economic downturn .
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve are growing increasingly alarmed about the problem , which is an outgrowth of the woes of the housing and mortgage industries .
Just yesterday , the Fed ’s vice chairman , Donald L. Kohn , said that the latest market turbulence appeared to be reducing credit to businesses and consumers , hinting that the central bank , in response , was prepared to cut interest rates further .

It 's Halloween , and technology news is scarce .
Logos redecorated in Halloween style abound , and perhaps it 's just me , but they mostly seem ugly as hell .
I mean , look at this .
Google has had some really cute / cool logos in the past , but this one is downright fugly .
OK , I get it , the letters are ghosts .
However , only " L " actually resembles one ; the others look like , well , poorly drawn letters ( and moldy , in case of " G " ) .
I admit that it takes creativity to personify each letter into something meaningful , but this is really a sad , sad attempt .
YouTube wo n't win any awards with that genetically engineered pumpkin , too .
It 's not even carved out , losers !
Yahoo actually has quite a cool logo .
Pixel graphic style , cute and spooky , and there 's even an animated family of undeads and ghosts scuttling through the scenery every now and then .
Well done , Yahoo : Google may be owning you in every other sphere of interest , but when it comes to cute logos , you 're the king !
I did not expect this , but Ask.com 's take on Halloween actually scared me .
Well , not in the " I dropped off my chair " kind of way , but those pumpkins are huge , man !
Kudos to Ask for taking the Halloween theme so seriously .
On the other hand , AOL is being too shy with a miniature pumpkin .
Do n't want to scare those young visitors , huh ?
Technorati's take on Halloween is boring as expected : a plain , vanilla - style pumpkin replacing the " O " .
It gets points for looking evil , though .
The result could have been worse , though ; it could have been this :
Photoshop skills ftw .
Just for the record , all of the above at least get points for trying ; MySpace and Facebook still look their boring selves , just like any other day .
Yawn !
If you know of any other cool , funny or just plain awful Halloween logos , feel free to add more in the comments !
From the earliest days of the Web to the present , there ’s been a fundamental split between people who get the value of “ human- readable URLs ” and people who do n’t .
A human - readable URL is a Web address that tells you a lot of useful information about the page it represents .
For instance , Salon URLs always tell you the date an article was posted , the section of the site the article appeared in , and a few words describing the subject matter of the article .
By comparison , the typical URL at , say , CNET , looks like this : http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-10895_7-6782817-1.html.
It is , essentially , human - unreadable .
In the old days , writers and editors who actually knew and used HTML always appreciated a good human - readable URL ; and typically , for the ugly gibberish URLs , we had to thank ( some ) software architects and ( some ) publication managers who ’d never hand - coded a link themselves .
At Salon , we editors knew we ’d be typing ( and proofing ) a zillion of those URLs ourselves ; we insisted on something we could work with .
( Our developers “ got it ” too . )
The cause of human - readable URLs got a great shot in the arm when sites began trying to optimize themselves for Google , because Google gives a little extra weight to text hints in URLs .
So a lot of sites ( like the New York Times ) that had a history of human - unfriendly page addresses began to do better .
Today , though , we ’re taking a step backwards , or at least sideways , in the cause of human readability , thanks to the growing popularity of the “ tinyurl . ”
When the tinyurl first crossed my radar I understood it to be a convenient way to tame unmanageably long Web addresses .
( The Tinyurl site focuses in particular on how long Web addresses break in email messages . )
That ’s all fine .
But the tinyurl giveth and the tinyurl taketh away .
When you encode a Web address as a tinyurl you ’re hiding its target .
Normally , when I read an article on the Web that has a link , I ’ll hover my cursor over the link to see where it points .
Even on a site with human - unfriendly URLs like CNETs , at least I can see that the link points to CNET .
With a tinyurl , I know nothing about the link except what the author chose to say about it .
I ca n’t tell if it ’s a reference to an article I ’ve already read .
If I want to find out , I have no choice but to click .
My sense is that tinyurls have grown in popularity with the rise of Twitter ( where the strict character limit of messages means you do n’t want to fill up a whole message with an URL ) , as well as the growing use of mobile devices for Web - posting activities .
These are perfectly understandable reasons .
But still , each time I see a tinyurl I think , there goes another tiny piece of the Web ’s transparency .

A shocking sing - along children 's DVD which glorifies suicide bombing is being investigated by anti-terrorist police after being found on sale in one of Britain 's terrorist hotbeds .
The disc - part of an Egyptian - made series - is on sale in West Yorkshire , where three of the July 7 bombers lived , and is aimed at youngsters from the local Muslim community .
Introduced by a cute cartoon chicken , it contains three songs in Arabic which are illustrated with a video story .
But any impression of its being an innocent music DVD is immediately dispelled by a song with English subtitles about two children who lose their mother when she blows herself up in a suicide bomb attack .
Scroll down for more ...
The song , sung as if told by the bomber 's daughter , ends with the young Arabic girl vowing to follow in her mother 's footsteps .
It is believed to have been inspired by Palestinian Reem - al - Reyashi , a 22 - year - old mother of two who killed four Israelis when she blew herself up at a Gaza Strip checkpoint on January 14 , 2004 .
In the DVD an Arab woman is seen playing with her two children .
She then makes a bomb out of sticks of dynamite in the bedroom as her young daughter enters .
The woman leaves home with dynamite tucked into her dress
and blows herself up after being challenged by soldiers leaving her children and husband to learn of her death on TV .
Scroll down for more ...
To the sounds of haunting music there are graveyard scenes , along with pictures of the dead bomber looking serene and dressed in white .
Her daughter finds a stick of dynamite in her mother 's wardrobe .
The girl , aged about five or six , turns to
the camera with the subtitles : " My love will not be by words .
I will follow my mother 's steps . "
Scroll down for more ...
The second song , entitled Tear , has a catchy chorus of children chanting a song set to images of women and children crying and flames from explosions .
Over scenes of men fighting and throwing grenades , a young Arab girl sings : " Daddy return to us , We
want you beside us , Fear occupied our hearts ,
And there is no one with us , Oh Allah !
You are our Saviour ... "
Scroll down for more ...
In the third song , Flowers , a group of orphaned children chant a five - minute tribute to Islam and sing about the plight of the Palestinian people .
A copy of the DVD was bought in Bradford .
It has been passed to counter - terrorism police who said they were investigating to see if any offences had been committed .
The DVD box lists the distributor as the Abrar Book Shop in Hyde Park , Leeds .
The shop – less than half a mile from the flat where the 7/7 bombers assembled their explosives – was shut yesterday .
Scroll down for more ...
Philip Davies , Tory MP for Shipley , who was given the DVD by a local resident , said : " My worry is how
many people have had access to this kind of material and how many children may have already been
influenced by it .
" It 's outrageous that this kind of material is so readily available in parts of West Yorkshire and it beggars belief that somebody is prepared to proudly proclaim that they distribute this material .
The MP contacted police and was told that the disc had been sold at a mosque in the city .
" I thought it was sick and totally and utterly unacceptable , " he said .
" It seems to be directed at children and I find it quite disturbing . "
He added : " It strikes me as being incitement to terrorism .
I hope that the people that distribute the material will be arrested and charged . "
Mr Davies said he would be writing to the Home Secretary asking what support the Government was giving to the police to locate and eliminate this kind of material .
The head of West Yorkshire 's counter terrorism unit , Detective Chief Superintendent John Parkinson , said : " The DVD has been initially reviewed and officers are carrying out further inquiries regarding its content to establish whether or not any offences have been committed . "
Yorkshire Muslim peer and shadow communities secretary Sayeeda Warsi said the authorities should not be afraid to come down with the full force of the law on extremists .
" I find it deeply disturbing if this kind of material is available and aimed at children so young , " she said .
" As well as winning over the hearts and minds of our own communities in order to deal with perverted terrorist organisations , we should always stamp down on anything that is nothing short of criminal , using the full force of the law . "
From the Yahoo group : impeach07 — Tonight the City Council of Santa Rosa failed to remain silent ; they failed to close their eyes to the outside world .
Tonight , near midnight , after discussing where to save huge sums in the annual budget , after considering green building practices and campaign finance reform , they took up a resolution that called upon the House of Representatives to Impeach Bush and Cheney .
Two thousand residents in this city of 160,000 had signed a petition calling on them to enact this resolution .
Two hundred residents showed up for the hearing and a hundred , still there at midnight , erupted in joy as the council members individually stated their reasons for acting .
Tonight in a 5 - 1 - 1 vote , the City of Santa Rosa through their council said enough to the tyranny of this Bush - Cheney administration .
Tonight Santa Rosa , the seat of Sonoma County government , the county of Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey and Congressman Mike Thompson , sent a petition to the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Bush and Cheney .
Tonight the City Council of Santa Rosa took a stand against the destruction of our representative form of government , took a stand for the rule of law , for defending our Constitution .
They took seriously their oath of office and the expressions of concern that Santa Rosans regarding the harm that the Bush - Cheney administration is having on our persons our city , our nation , and our world .

Sweet fancy Moses this is awesome !*
BB reader Daniel says ,
Radiohead has just announced the details for their new album , In Rainbows .
They 're only selling it through their website ( at least for now ) , and for the digital download version , they 're letting listeners pick their own price for the album – it 's literally a donation - based product .
Obviously this is sparking confusion among many , but the only help the website provides are the words " It 's up to you . "
Link , album 's out October 10 .
To recap : the box set ( Glorious thick 12 " vinyl ! and " enhanced CD " ) is $ 80 , but the downloads are name - your - own - price .
Some readers are reporting that you get the downloads for free anyway if you buy the box set .
No details on the download file format .
Does anyone out there know ?
DRM - free ?
MP3s ?
What bitrate , what quality ?
I just bought my copy ( download , though I 'll probably go back and buy the boxed set , too ) .
I got wonky html on the purchase confirmation screen indicating some code glurbles going on at the online store — not sure if my transaction actually took .
Perhaps the shop 's overloaded right now , announcement just went live .
This is major , and it 's such a slap in the record industry 's face .
An unsigned superband , treating loyal fans and customers like loyal fans and customers instead of thieves — what a revolutionary concept .
In related news , the band is dismissing a hoax website that duped fans this weekend :
The site — www.radioheadlp7.com — launched on Friday with a countdown timer due to reach zero on Saturday morning .
It claimed it would be making a big announcement about the band .
Fans speculated the " Creep " hitmakers were planning to reveal details about their next album .
But a spokesperson for the band has called the Web site a " hoax " and " nothing to do with Radiohead . "
Link to SF
Gate blog post .
Update :
More on the band 's unusual indie sales approach in these news and blog reports : Green Plastic ( fansite online since 1997 ) Billboard , Idolatr , FQMB .
But Bob Lefsetz , as usual , sums it up best :
It 's not like Radiohead 's living in a different world .
But they 're playing by a different rule book .
One that says the money flows from the music , that people have to believe in you , that you 've got to treat them right .
Shit , you can barely get a ticket to a Radiohead show .
The venues are n't big and the demand is incredible .
They 're doing it all wrong , do n't they see ??
Well , obviously they do n't .
This is big news .
This says the major labels are fucked .
Untrustworthy with a worthless business model .
Radiohead does n't seem to care if the music is free .
Not that they believe it will be .
Because believers will give you ALL THEIR MONEY !
This is the industry 's worst nightmare .
Superstar band , THE superstar band , forging ahead by its own wits .
Proving that others can too .
And they will .

NFP : 88 k ( and I do n't believe even that )
The Payroll numbers are out , and they are not particularly pretty :
88,000 new jobs were created in April , according to BLS .
This is the weakest job gain since November ' 04 .
Cumulative revisions for prior months were to the downside by 26,000 .
As expected , losses were in Manufacturing ( 19 k ) , Retail ( 26 k ) and Construction ( 11 k ) .
The weakness in Construction has been very uted , implying that the full impact of the housing slow down has yet to be fully realized .
Biggest gains were had in Services ( 116k ) , Education and Health ( 53 k ) , Gov't ( 25 k ) Professional ( 24 k ) and Leisure / Hospitality ( 22 k ) .
Temporary help jobs fell for a 3rd month ( January was flat ) making 4 consecutive months of no gains .
Temp help tends to lead employment gains , and this weakness can be read as a future forecastor of employment .
We do n't pay close attention to the Household survey , ( the self reported number is very volatile ) but the drop of - 468 k was an eyebrow raiser .
~~~
Birth Death Adjustment : A whopping 317k B/D adjustment -- that is the single largest " adjustment " on record for any single given month .
And despite that giant add , the number was a very soft 88 k .
To put this into some context , of those 317 k new jobs hypothesized by BLS , 49 k of those supposed jobs are in construction .
Now what are the odds of that ?
While Wall Street celebrates the upcoming recession , let me remind you that this economy requires about 150 k new monthly jobs to merely keeep up with population growth .

Three young men distributing leaflets at a fruit market in the main city of Rangoon were seized as Paulo Sergio Pinheiro prepared to hold talks with the Burmese foreign and labour ministers in the remote jungle capital of Naypidaw .
Their detention followed the arrest in Rangoon yesterday of a leading female activist , Su Su Nway , who had been on the run for a month , as she tried to post a protest leaflet near Mr Pinheiro 's hotel .
It also emerged that U Gambira , leader of the All - Burma Monks Alliance , had been seized .
The new round of arrests followed the UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari 's report to the security council on his second visit in as many months , in which he said the Burmese junta was making progress and that he found a ìqualitative differenceî from his previous trip .
The former Nigerian foreign minister said the 45 - year - old regime had shown signs that it could be responsive to the concerns of the international community , which has roundly condemned the crackdown of the popular protests that left at least 13 dead and almost 3,000 behind bars .
He added that the regime - which last week allowed the detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to meet senior figures from the National League for Democracy - had started a process that could lead to it holding negotiations about moving toward democracy .
But sceptics in the international community doubt that the Burmese regime has altered its mindset .
The US warned that the UN security council should not rule out further sanctions if Burma did not follow through on promises to Mr Gambari , who was denied a meeting the regime 's leader , Than Shwe , on his second visit .
" What has happened does not reflect a fundamental shift , " said the US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad .
" We are of the view that both pressure and engagement have to be on the table ... we do not rule out sanctions .
" The military regime 's so - called ' road map to democracy ' , which excludes Burma 's democratic and ethnic minorities groups from equal participation , is demonstrably inadequate . "
1 Baldwin Street ( New Zealand )
World ’s steepest street
Baldwin Street , in a quiet suburban part of New Zealand ’s southern city of Dunedin , is reputed to be the world ’s steepest street .
It is located in the suburb of North East Valley , 3.5 kilometres northeast of Dunedin ’s city centre .
A short straight street of some 350 metres length , Baldwin Street runs east from the valley of the Lindsay Creek up the side of Signal Hill .
Its lower reaches are of only moderate steepness , and the surface is asphalt , but the upper reaches of this cul - de- sac are far steeper , and surfaced in concrete , for ease of maintenance ( tar seal would flow down the slope on a warm day ) and for safety in Dunedin ’s frosty winters .
At its maximum , the slope of Baldwin Street is approximately 1:2.86 ( 19° or 35 % ) – that is , for every 2.86 metres travelled horizontally , the elevation rises by 1 metre .
The street ’s steepness was unintentional .
As with many other parts of Dunedin , and indeed New Zealand , streets were laid out in a grid pattern with no consideration for the terrain , usually by planners in London .
2 Ebenezer Place ( Scotland ) :
World ’s shortest street
Ebenezer Place , in Wick , Caithness , Scotland , is credited as being the world ’s shortest street in the Guinness Book of Records at 2.06 m ( 6 ′ 9 ″ ) .
There is a single address on the street , 1 Ebenezer Place , which was constructed in 1883 .
The owner of the building , a hotel at the time , was instructed to paint a name on the shortest side of the hotel .
It was officially declared a street in 1887 .
3 Parliament Street ( Exeter , England )
World ’s narrowest street
Parliament Street is a 50 m long street in Exeter , England , which links the High Street to Waterbeer Lane and dates from the 14th century .
It was formerly called Small Lane and was renamed when Parliament was derided by the city council for passing the 1832 Reform Bill .
The street is approximately 1.2 m ( 45 ″ ) at its widest and less than 0.64 m ( 25 ″ ) at its narrowest , which makes it , according to the Guinness Book of Records , the world ’s narrowest street .

Once upon a time , it was the United States that urged all nations to obey the letter and the spirit of international treaties and protect human rights and liberties .
American leaders denounced secret prisons where people were held without charges , tortured and killed .
And the people in much of the world , if not their governments , respected the United States for its values .
The Bush administration has dishonored that history and squandered that respect .
As an article on this newspaper ’s front page last week laid out in disturbing detail , President Bush and his aides have not only condoned torture and abuse at secret prisons , but they have conducted a systematic campaign to mislead Congress , the American people and the world about those policies .
After the attacks of 9/11 , Mr. Bush authorized the creation of extralegal detention camps where Central Intelligence Agency operatives were told to extract information from prisoners who were captured and held in secret .
Some of their methods — simulated drownings , extreme ranges of heat and cold , prolonged stress positions and isolation — had been classified as torture for decades by civilized nations .
The administration clearly knew this ; the C.I.A. modeled its techniques on the dungeons of Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union .
The White House could never acknowledge that .
So its lawyers concocted documents that redefined “ torture ” to neatly exclude the things American jailers were doing and hid the papers from Congress and the American people .
Under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Mr. Bush ’s loyal enabler , the Justice Department even declared that those acts did not violate the lower standard of “ cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . ”
' World 's most valuable car ' fails to sell
Following postponement to research its background , Hitler - era German race car finds no buyer .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After a sale was postponed to answer questions about the car 's racing history , an ultra-rare 1939 German racing car expected to fetch the highest price on record for any automobile did not find a buyer at an auction .
The results of the investigation revealed that the car did not have the exact history that was originally believed , but that was not expected to substantially alter its value , Rupert Banner , head of Christie 's motor cars department , told CNNMoney.com before the sealed - bid auction .
The car , an Auto Union - Grand Prix V12 , is one of five remaining " Auto Union D - Types . "
Its value had been estimated at more than $ 12 million .
Best of the Geneva Motor Show
The sealed - bid auction was completed March 4 .
A Christie 's spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of bids received or the amount of the highest bid .
Christie 's plans to auction the car at a later time , the company said , but a date for that has not been set .
The car was originally scheduled to be sold in Paris on Feb. 17 .
That sale was cancelled Feb. 9 when Christie's and Audi Tradition announced that further investigation was needed to confirm the car 's racing history .
Audi Tradition is a branch of Audi that researches the brand 's history and heritage .
In the 1930s , Audi was one of four brands that made up Germany 's Auto Union car company .
Later , after the firm was reconstituted in West Germany following World War II , the company was named Audi but retained the four - ring emblem that symbolized the combination of four companies .
In 1933 , after becoming chancellor of Germany , Adolf Hitler offered 500,000 reichmarks for a company to design a race car to show off the nation 's technological prowess .
( At the time , 500,000 reichmarks was equal to about $ 150,000 , or $ 2.3 million in modern terms , according to the Economic History Services Web site of Miami University of Ohio . )
Originally , Mercedes - Benz got the nod .
But Ferdinand Porsche , then an engineer working with Auto Union , was able to secure some of that financing to build a revolutionary car he had designed .
That basic design was modified over the next few years to become the 1939 Auto Union D - Type , the last of the line .
The D - type had a number of features that were extremely advanced for its day , including an engine mounted behind the driver and four - wheel independent suspension .
Its twin -supercharged 3 - liter V12 engine can produce 485 horsepower , giving the car a top speed of 185 miles per hour .
In many ways , the D - type offered a glimpse into what would become the future of racing .
It 's fundamentally very similar to Formula 1 and Indy race cars of today .
" It 's the same as a modern day race car , just without fins , " Rupert Banner , head of Christie 's motor cars department , said in an interview with CNNMoney.com in January .
One thing it does n't have , of course , is modern safety technology .
Race cars in those days did n't even have seatbelts .
It was seen as preferable to be thrown from the car in a crash .
One safety advance the D - type did have was a removable steering wheel , allowing the driver to be more easily removed in case of a fire .
D - type cars won several Grand Prix races throughout Europe .
This car was originally believed to be the one that won a Grand Prix race in Belgrade , Yugoslavia , the last race held in Europe until after the war .
In fact , it was not .
The car did race on the famed Nurburgring track in 1939 , the investigation revealed , finishing in 5th place .
It also finished 6th at the 1939 French Grand Prix , a race in which two other D - types finished 1st and 2nd .
The car was one of 18 that were hidden in a mineshaft in eastern Germany during the war .
They were discovered by invading Russian troops at the war 's end .
A number of the cars were subsequently lost or destroyed , according to Christie's .
It was taken to Russia after the war , where it was disassembled to study its technology .
The car was rediscovered in Ukraine in the late 1980s .
It was still in pieces but was otherwise undamaged .
Another car discovered nearby had had its chassis sawed in half , Banner said .
The current record for a car sold at auction , according to Christie's , is £ 5.5 million , or almost $ 11 million .
That was paid for a 1931 Bugatti Type 41 Royale Sports Coupe sold by Christie 's in 1987 .
Ferdinand Porsche also designed another car for Hitler , but for a very different purpose .
That car , inspired by the success of the inexpensive Ford Model T in the United States , ultimately became known as the Volkswagen Beetle .
It also had a rear - mounted engine , as do today 's Porsche sports cars .

About 20 to 25 American soldiers were at the checkpoint at the time of the incident , and at least 10 were exposed to the CS gas after “ rotor wash ” from the hovering helicopter pushed it toward them , according to officers who were there .
A number of Iraqi civilians , both on foot and in cars waiting to go through the checkpoint , were also exposed .
The gas can cause burning and watering eyes , skin irritation and coughing and difficulty breathing .
Nausea and vomiting can also result .
Blackwater says it was permitted to carry CS gas under its contract at the time with the State Department .
According to a State Department official , the contract did not specifically authorize Blackwater personnel to carry or use CS , but it did not prohibit it .
The military , however , tightly controls use of riot control agents in war zones .
They are banned by an international convention on chemical weapons endorsed by the United States , although a 1975 presidential order allows their use by the United States military in war zones under limited defensive circumstances and only with the approval of the president or a senior officer designated by the president .
“ It is not allowed as a method or means of warfare , ” said Michael Schmitt , professor of international law at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I .
“ There are very , very strict restrictions on the use of CS gas in a war zone . ”
In 2003 , President Bush approved the use of riot control agents by the military in Iraq under the 1975 order , but only for such purposes as controlling rioting prisoners .
At the time of Mr. Bush ’s decision , there were also concerns that the Iraqi Army would use civilians as shields , particularly in a last - ditch battle in Baghdad , and some officials believed that riot control agents might be effective in such circumstances to reduce casualties .
A United States military spokesman in Baghdad refused to describe the current rules of engagement governing the use of riot control agents , but former Army lawyers say their use requires the approval of the military ’s most senior commanders .
“ You never had a soldier with the authority to do it on his own , ” said Thomas J. Romig , a retired major general who served as the chief judge advocate general of the United States Army from 2001 to 2005 and is now the dean of the Washburn School of Law in Topeka , Kan .
Several Army officers who have served in Iraq say they have never seen riot control agents used there by the United States military at all .
Col. Robert Roth , commander of Task Force 4 - 64 AR of the Third Infantry Division , which was manning the Assassins ’
Gate checkpoint at the time of the Blackwater incident , said that his troops were not issued any of the chemicals .

Tymoshenko's most recent take on the peasant look
Her ability to stand out among all the men in the country 's power struggles is one that she and her team have honed to perfection .
" Orange princess " , " gas princess " , " goddess of the Revolution " , the " Princess Leia of Ukrainian politics " , " a Slavic Joan of Arc " - her nicknames over the years have acquired mythological proportions .
She has cast herself as a fighter for justice , the conscience of the nation , the saviour of Ukraine , and succeeding in looking the part as well as talking the talk .
World - wide recognition
She has become instantly recognisable the world over for that hair : the artful arrangement of traditional braids - sometimes dubbed " the Yulia " .
The style has been replicated on the catwalks of Milan , in an international perfume ad and , as Ms Tymoshenko proudly boasts on her website , by Kylie Minogue in a recent calendar .
Tymoshenko appeared on the front cover of Elle Ukraine in 2005
Her former image consultant Oleh Pokalchuk - who says he came up with the idea in the early 2000s - explains that the idea was to project Ms Tymoshenko as a Ukrainian archetype .
" It was necessary to work out and implement an image that would block out the image formed by Kuchma propagandists , one of wealth , of envy , hatred , " the social psychologist told the BBC News website .
Ms Tymoshenko's stinging attacks on the oligarchs who prospered under the former administration of president Leonid Kuchma has boosted her popularity among many Ukrainians frustrated by years of economic stagnation and corruption .
" I created an image of a modest village teacher .
A visual type , clothes and haircut , a retro image evoking memories of childhood and schooldays ... simple clothes , simple haircut , a Ukrainian archetype , " he says .
Ms Tymoshenko , 46 , was born in the industrial city of Dnipropetrivsk , in the mainly Russian - speaking east .
" She did n't speak Ukrainian so well then and it was necessary for parts of the country , where nationalism is a powerful force , that she should appear one of us , " says Mr Pokalchuk .
Tymoshenko in 2001 , before she embarked on her new look
He says her image is constantly being reworked .
Originally , he says , the hair was brunette and the image modest .
Now , the hair is lighter - almost the colour of corn - and the clothes " far more sumptuous " .
At one point , such was the national interest in her hair that she was provoked into letting it down on national television , in front of millions of viewers .
" Kuchma 's people were putting it about that her hair was not genuine , " says Mr Pokalchuk .
In an interview with the Jersualem Post earlier this year , Ms Tymoshenko referred to the amount of interest her hair has attracted :
" Let me state for the record that I invented this hairstyle .
And I do it by myself every day .
It has been the subject of endless attention in my country .
Everybody has something to say about it .
But I 've noticed that it 's catching on in all kinds of fashion circles in Europe .
That makes me happy - at least my hair is calling attention to Ukraine . "
She has also revealed that it only takes her seven minutes to do .
Slick campaign
The look was key to the former prime minister 's slick campaign in the latest election .
Tymoshenko , without the usual braid
The campaign for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc ( BYT ) took white as its colour of choice , a red heart as its symbol .
" Her image - making is very interesting and delicately balanced , " says Andrew Wilson an expert on Ukraine at London 's School of Slavonic and East European Studies ( SSEES ) .
" She comes across as feminine but forceful , glamorous but national - and instantly recognisable .
" The heart is a political message - hers is the politics of moral principle as opposed to grubby compromise .
In a way , she is the heart - the conscience of the nation .
It follows on from the way that she campaigned last year , " he says .
Some say her peasant look is somewhat misleading .
Critics say she made a billion - dollar fortune in the privatisation of Ukraine 's oil and gas industry in the 1990s .
" There is certainly a contradiction , " says Mr Wilson .
" She is a kind of Eva Peron figure - on the side of the poor but in a fur coat . "
Ms Tymoshenko's love of expensive , French designer clothes is legendary .
But , in the latest campaign , she had incorporated traditional Ukrainian designs into her mainly white wardrobe .
" Image is very important in Ukraine , " says Mr Wilson .
" It 's a very TV - based society , and television was the primary medium of the campaign . "
Detractors have scathingly described her metamorphosis as pretentious : a near biblical transformation , her hair wrapped on top of her head like a halo , complemented by flowing white angelic dresses .
But it seems to have worked magic on Ukrainian voters .
BYT 's share of the vote - at nearly 31 % according to incomplete results - was entirely unexpected , and gives her every chance of forming the next government .
At the same time , they acknowledge that in retrospect , some of its conclusions appear to have been thinly sourced and were based on methods less rigorous than were ultimately required under an intelligence overhaul that did not begin in earnest until later .
It was also written by some of the same team that had produced key parts of the flawed Iraq estimate .
Robert D. Walpole oversaw both reports as the national intelligence officer responsible for assessing illicit - weapons programs .
Robert Hutchings , who as head of the National Intelligence Council from 2003 to early 2005 oversaw early production of the 2005 Iran assessment , said the quality of information about Iran ’s nuclear program should have made American intelligence analysts wary of judging anything with “ high confidence . ”
That was how the 2005 report described the basis for its assertion that Iran was determined to develop nuclear weapons , a conclusion that has been disavowed .
“ The fact that we ’ve reversed course two years later suggests that the high confidence back then was n’t warranted , ” said Mr. Hutchings , who had left the intelligence council by the time the intelligence estimate was produced in May 2005 .
Paul R. Pillar , another member of the National Intelligence Council in 2005 , said it was a “ fair point ” to criticize intelligence agencies for overstating their confidence in the judgments of the 2005 estimate .
But he said the judgment that Iran is determined to obtain the bomb could prove correct in the long run .
The news today that leading Democrats , including Jane Harman and Nancy Pelosi , were informed about the torture of military prisoners and allegedly did n't just acquiesce but actually approved it is not something that particularly surprises .
The descent into war crimes under this administration provoked very little public Democratic anger or resistance for the years in which it was used most promiscuously .
The presidential campaign of John Kerry offered only token opposition .
The subject never came up in a single presidential debate in 2004 .
And the way in which the torture issue has subsequently been raised by Democrats bespeaks opportunism as much as principled outrage and opposition .
Pelosi's response to the accusation is the weakest .
Harman 's the strongest - she claims she sent a classified letter in opposition in February 2003 ; Bob Graham says he was not briefed on the matter and mercifully now says that there is no doubt that waterboarding is torture .
Rockefeller has n't commented .
At best , it seems to me , Democratic resistance to these war crimes was anodyne .
But this , of course , does not mean that the methods were or are defensible , legal or useful .
Whatever else can be said about this debate , it is not inherently partisan .
After almost 5,000 years of civilized culture ( preceded by 25,000 years of hunter - gatherer triflings ) , the island of Nihon - koku -- ' Japan ' to you lazy round - eyes -- may soon sink into the ocean or be horribly destroyed by some kind of hellish firestorm .
Recent Japanese sales records are out and in accordance with ancient harbingers of doom prophecy , Halo 3 has topped a Pokémon title for the highest selling game in all of Japan .
To quote a completely fictional prophetic haiku :
When Microsoft tops
Nintendo's tiny creatures ,
Nippon shall perish .

It was not the same as handing advocates of so - called " net neutrality " a complete failure , but then again , nearly every US Federal Communications Commission decision of late has been a split at or near the middle .
AT&T 's request for forbearance -- for relaxing of regulation -- of some of its broadband services was partly granted late yesterday , with the result being that the company the FCC acknowledges as dominant in its field has a little more leeway now to charge business broadband customers more negotiable rates .
" The Commission seeks to establish a policy environment that facilitates and encourages broadband investment , allowing market forces to deliver the benefits of broadband to consumers , " reads a statement from FCC Chairman Kevin Martin , released this morning .
" Today , we take another step in establishing a regulatory environment that encourages such investments and innovation by granting AT&T 's petition for regulatory relief of its broadband infrastructure and fiber capabilities .
This relief will enable AT&T to have the flexibility to further deploy its broadband services and fiber facilities without overly burdensome regulations . "
Because AT&T ( both the old and the " new " ) has been considered a dominant service provider ever since its federally - sanctioned monopoly was dissolved in 1980 , it has since been subject to extra federal regulation .
Since it owns a sizable chunk of the cable needed for fiberoptic services , and leases -- under federal mandate -- some of that cable to its own competitors , US law compels the company to provide some of its broadband services to customers at predetermined rates .
These are so - called " basic services , " though value - added features are still allowed to be priced at the discretion of the carrier .
Advertisement
With AT&T 's basic service fees being determined in advance , it just so happens that its competitors know what it charges its customers , and they can adjust their fees accordingly .
This is where Verizon enters the picture .
In December 2004 , Verizon filed a request with the FCC for forbearance of regulations on the rates it charges its broadband customers .
As the amalgam of the former Bell Atlantic and the former fiberoptic champion GTE , Verizon is also considered a dominant player in the broadband space , and is thus subject to extra regulation .
With only four voting commissioners at that time , the FCC was unable to reach a consensus , with two voting in favor of Verizon 's petition and two against .
But internal rules governing FCC voting on forbearance petitions meant Verizon 's wishes were granted by default .
AT&T never saw that as fair , basically having to publish its basic service tier fees for the whole world to see while a competitor that may actually own more cable in certain key areas than it does , is granted an exemption .
So it sought similar forbearance in the spirit of fair play .
With five voting members now , the FCC could n't exactly split itself down the middle .
But it did find another angle in which to apply its proverbial Sword of Solomon : granting relief to AT&T only with regard to basic services , and excluding that relief from applying to so - called " special access services " such as DS1 and DS3 - specific multiplexed channels often leased in their entirety to businesses for very high speed switching , for instance , between branch offices .
There , AT&T is widely believed to play a very dominant role .
According to yesterday 's order , the law currently states that the FCC must grant forbearance if it has analyzed the relevant market and has come to the conclusion that regulation no longer assists that market in maintaining fair prices .
So to that assertion , commissioners added the notion that free markets are better able to attain fairer pricing on their own accord .
" Moreover ... competing carriers are able economically to deploy OCn - level [ high - speed optical carrier ] facilities to the extent that there is demand for such services in AT&T 's incumbent LEC service areas , " yesterday 's FCC order reads .
" These conclusions are consistent with our analysis of retail enterprise services in other recent orders , where the Commission found that ' so long as competitive choices remain ' for retail enterprise services , large enterprise ' customers should seek out best - priced alternatives , ' limiting the ability of a provider ' to raise and maintain prices above competitive levels . " '
Had there been only four commissioners seated yesterday , the outcome would have been similar to the Verizon case two years ago - in which case , AT&T 's request would have been granted by default anyway .
Nonetheless , Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein voiced their opinions in a scathing dissent yesterday , calling to question the precise angle of where its Solomon 's Sword falls this time around .
" First , the definition of the product market to which we should apply forbearance remains in dispute , " their joint dissent reads .
" Merely calling services ' broadband enterprise services ' does not negate the fact that they are tariffed as special access services and have been identified as such in previous orders .
As our colleagues know , there is substantial data available in this and other proceedings to indicate that the special access market is anything but competitive .
In fact , the Commission has committed to completing our long - pending rulemaking on this very topic .
We should not be granting forbearance for rules covering special access services without a rigorous analysis of competition for these services - an analysis wanting in today 's decision . "
The danger here is that " special access services " are subject to government tariffs .
Giving leeway to a company to set competitive prices for services that should perhaps remain under special classification , Copps ' and Adelstein 's argument implies , may cheat the government out of a little extra needed revenue .
But arguing in support of the order , Commissioner Robert McDowell -- an advocate of free - market pricing , and perhaps happy not to be a dissenter this time -- stated it would be premature to render a verdict on special access services just yet , since there 's not really enough data yet for anyone to conclude any one company is dominant there .
That opinion is diametrically opposite of those who contend AT&T is the obvious dominant player there .
" As competition in the broadband market continues to grow , especially through the deployment of new wireless technologies , less regulation should be required , " Commissioner McDowell wrote yesterday .
" However , many parties allege that competition in the special access market is uneven and is limited to certain urban areas , thus creating supply bottlenecks that favor incumbent local exchange carriers in the business broadband and wireless markets .
Despite requests for better data to help us resolve disputes of these material facts , the Commission still has inadequate information to determine whether allegations that competition is scarce in certain segments of the special access market have merit .
I will continue to work to ensure that these questions are explored further in the Special Access proceeding after a more granular record has been established through detailed mapping of business broadband facilities . "
The setback for advocates of net neutrality comes by way of the FCC having allowed AT&T just a bit greater freedom in determining how it prices basic broadband service .
That affair can now be made more private , between itself and its prospective client , taking the basic price tier out of the public eye and making the process somewhat less " open . "
But AT&T 's basic service customers would also include wholesale buyers - companies that resell service access , often on a more local level , to small businesses .
When applied maximally , the principle of net neutrality would have a supplier charge all of its customers the same fee for broadband access regardless of bandwidth or service quality .
This way , theoretically , smaller customers who require lesser bandwidth would not be discriminated against .
The FCC 's reference to how large enterprises should be enabled to seek lower - priced alternatives from service providers with a national footprint , as explained in yesterday 's order , bodes poorly for advocates and lawmakers who prefer a more utilitarian , commoditized pricing model for bandwidth - one which would ultimately require heavy government regulation in order to maintain that uniform pricing tier .
The competing principle to net neutrality is that increased competition should be met with less regulation , not more .
That principle was put forth yesterday by Commissioner Deborah Tate , with this comment : " In taking this step , we recognize the facilities - based competition that exists in the business broadband Internet access market .
I support moving away from regulation where the record shows that a competitive market exists , rendering those regulations unnecessary . "
Generics of a Higher Kind .
Adriaan Moors , Frank Piessens , and Martin Odersky .
With Java 5 and C# 2.0 , first - order parametric polymorphism was introduced in mainstream object - oriented programming languages under the name of generics .
Although the first - order variant of generics is very useful , it also imposes some restrictions : it is possible to abstract over a type , but the resulting type constructor cannot be abstracted over .
This can lead to code duplication .
We removed this restriction in Scala , by allowing type constructors as type parameters and abstract types .
This paper presents the design and implementation of the resulting type constructor polymorphism .
It combines type constructor polymorphism with implicit parameters to yield constructs similar to , and at times more expressive than , Haskellâ€™s constructor type classes .
The paper also studies interactions with other object - oriented language constructs , and discusses the gains in expressiveness .
Many readers will already be aware that Scala has added support for higher - kinded generics , related to Haskell 's type constructor classes .
I believe Scala is the first language to provide this capability in an OO " generics " framework .
This ECOOP submission presents this work , with many practical examples .

Sometimes marketers like to pretend they exist outside the “ real ” world of politics , war and social upheaval .
This attitude is especially evident in certain commercials and ad - heavy publications that reveal a thick - headed cluelessness about life outside the box of privilege .
In the past months , I ’ve seen TV ads mimicking revolution in the street for a frivolous product … and read articles on celebrities that used references to famine and actual murder cases , trying to be ironic and hip .
These efforts are clunky and embarrassing .
Yet , they never abate .
( Mind you , I adore irreverent humor and M * A * S * H - style commentary … but you ca n’t accomplish this kind of wit from the sidelines .
Cluelessness makes knowledgeable people cringe . )
I first noticed this disconnect between pain and fun as a teenager waiting for my draft notice during the Vietnam war .
The evening news was dominated by combat zone film bringing the war right into America ’s homes ( something The Man has since realized should never happen again , if he wants to continue blowing people up for vague and unsupportable campaigns ) … so for half an hour between typical fluff like “ The Beverly Hillbillies ” and “ Gilligan ’s Island ” , we were treated to glimpses of Hell , half a world away .
Guys just a few months older than me crouched behind shattered walls , bullets zinging into the stucco while swaying palm trees burned under distant napalm assaults .
And the wounded were evacuated , swathed in bloody bandages , the stretcher - bearers ducking and weaving .
And then , during the break , here comes this bright and cheerful commercial for laundry soap … with a pretty housewife flying a WWI - era bi-plane , dropping tablets like bombs from the sky .
The slogan — and all TV ads back then were centered on slogans — was some bullshit reference to “ blowing up ” germs in your dirty clothes with this new , improved way of keeping your family clean .
Seconds away from the grime and gore of a real battlefield , here ’s Proctor and Gamble laughing through a pun about bombing soiled tee shirts .
Even back then , I was shocked by the tin ear of the marketers .
There were many other ads revealing an almost total disconnect between reality and selling stuff back then … including Pepsi ’s attempts to co-opt the anti-war “ peace and love ” movement , and mainstream Hollywood ’s endless ( and utterly clueless ) desire to both be super - hip ( never happened ) and entertaining without offending anyone .
The entire culture seemed to be like the Emperor wearing no clothes , and everyone refused to open their eyes .
Say what you will about my generation ( and the mainstream media is very smug about pretending to understand what happened back then ) ( they did n’t then , and still do n’t ) .
We at least had the awareness to be shocked and disgusted by the sad state of the world .
And some of us decided to drop out .
We flailed at the fortress of civilization , trying to change things … and were immediately beaten back and put on the defensive .
The anti-war marches and anti-consumerism of the “ counter culture ” did n’t stop the war , and it did n’t turn the U.S. into a socialist state .
Still , trying to push that kind of passion back into the bottle was even more futile .
However , the reality of those years is very different than the modern myths told about them .
If you allow the media to define that era for you , you might believe that most of the Boomers were hippies and activists and lived in communes .
In truth , only about one in ten tried to drop out or change society .
We were NOT a monolithic generation of the same mind .
If you came out of that period , you are likely dazed by the way history is being twisted into tidy , coherent narratives by the likes of Tom Brokaw .
Things were very much NOT coherent or tidy back then .
It was friggin’ chaos .
Okay , I ’m boring you , are n’t I .
Another Boomer ranting about himself and the times he lived in .
I ’ll stop .
But I wanted to make a point , and I believe it ’s an important one .
It ’s this :
Things have n’t changed much since those bad - old - days of upheaval and tidal social wreckage .
We ’re just more numb about it .
And , if you want to be a real writer , you need to endure a long , forced reality check .
Someone once said that the goal of civilization is to remove the privileged class as far as possible from things that disgust them .
Meat arrives in the supermarket with no trace of blood or violence .
Sewage runs underground , flushed out of the house as efficiently as possible .
Germs and dandruff and zits are dealt with quickly and harshly .
We walk around pretending to be Barbie and Ken dolls , unconcerned with icky odors and death .
And we have , at best , a hazy notion that , somewhere else , people are butchering each other and starving and drowning under tsunamis .
Oh , and glaciers melt and entire species disappear , while fresh water increasingly becomes a luxury .
Today , the news is even more full of rage and despair , horror and danger , than usual .
It ’s a very bad day for the world … and yet I am scheduled to post another blog on marketing and making money .
Will I have to stretch , or hide from reality to make a point ?
Naw .
For me , the sting of experiencing that disconnect between commercials and the news has never left .
Even as I went deeper and deeper into advertising and marketing , I refused to get sucked into the notion that America is somehow encased in protective glass , and I refused to believe it ’s okay or desireable to be oblivious of the rest of the world .
I have , however , made that long painful trek from the edges of the counter - culture ( back when I dropped out ) , all the way back to the realization that capitialism really is a great way to fuel a culture .
It ’s not perfect … but the tools exist to carve out your own personal area of freedom , and also to focus enormous resources on the problems of the world .
No other economic system comes close .
You can set an example , by tending your own garden and living life as well as you can .
( And I ’ve always believed that is part of the job of the entrepreneur … to engage life with gusto , for the sake of every feudal slave in history and every oppressed schlub today who has dreamed of the freedom to think , act and love without censorship and an authoritarian boot on his neck .
You OWE it to him to make the best of your good fortune . )
And when you finally realize you have more dough than you need , you can start spreading the wealth .
Donate , get involved … or , like Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines , roll up your sleeves and actively change things for the better .
( You ’ll have to ignore a thousand choruses predicting your demise and glorifying in your blunders and set - backs .
Small price to pay , though , if you want to make a difference . )
Most entrepreneurs dream of making enough money to indulge in pleasures and bad behavior without consequence .
The jerks succeed .
Yet , an astonishing number of newly - rich business owners become neo-Renaissance forces for good .
It ’s almost enough to restore your faith in humanity .
In fact , increasingly , entrepreneurs are the front line of humanity , as corporations become anonymous headless beasts that ravish the world regardless of which human happens to sit in the CEO chair .
We do have dragons , and the modern world has more in common with Tolkien ’s bracing fantasies than most folks can fathom .
So , yeah , let ’s talk about marketing .
People ask me how I ’m able to write such gritty , fascinating copy .
For products and ventures that seem , to the uninitiated eye , so far removed from anything gritty or fascinating .
And the answer , as you by now must suspect , comes from life itself .
For your entire existence , advertisers have sought to “ get ” to you by being meek and inoffensive and unreal .
So , you ’re excused if you think your own copy should be flimsy and weak .
At least , you ’re excused until you ’ve been exposed to my stuff .
After that , you ca n’t hide any more .
In my world , advertising and marketing is inter -woven with the fabric of life .
I ’m simply not cynical about it .
( ” Cynical ” is the new buzzword on Madison Avenue , by the way — it ’s replaced “ ironic ” , and that ’s why you ’re seeing so many TV spots with absurb comedy and only reluctant glimpses of product .
There is zero evidence that hard - core , big - city comedy sells stuff , but most TV ad creators live in big cities and write copy meant to help them save face among their peers … and to them , it ’s just uncouth to stoop to actual salesmanship . )
I learned long ago that the key to sales is passion .
But I also learned that there are two sides to passion — the good side we all love , centered on indulging in pleasure and meeting goals and moving ahead … and the bad side , which is evident in today ’s sorry news cycle .
Do you understand the kind of passionate rage required to assasinate someone ?
Can you get your mind around the kind of drooling greed required to starve whole populations so you can build another palace ?
Can you comprehend the lust of people who abuse power and privilege ?
Most of us cannot .
Yet , rage and greed and lust are very common human reactions .
The world roils in a tense dance with anarchy and anihilation , struggling every damned day with all its might .
I ’ve known many copywriters who give up in despair .
How the hell can you care about selling crap while fools in authority wreck everything ?
I know well the urge to drop out .
Every generation faces the same dilemna upon becoming aware — they realize the world sucks , and seconds later realize they can do almost nothing to change that fact .
This leads to the kind of rage required to kill and tear fragile things apart .
There are , and always will be , issues greater than your humble goals of bettering yourself or accumulating wealth .
If you want to become a great copywriter , you must learn to face reality .
All of it .
And be okay with what you see .
Most people stumble through life in a haze , half - asleep and yearning to be led like sheep .
The power of being able to write — the power of the pen — is a force that can change history … or change a single person ’s life , in a simple yet positive way .
It ’s easy to mock advertising .
Because most advertising sucks , and is irrelevant .
Yet , people need things .
And they need bargains , and inside info , and the resources of thinking , involved insiders who care enough to push for positive change .
Customer by customer .
It may seem silly to care about soap today .
But bad hygiene continues to be a major killer in the world .
There are places where a bar of Ivory could save lives .
And there are places where simple tips on dealing with the disgusting details of life near the edge can bring entire generations several steps up Maslow ’s hierarchy of needs .
We just forget these facts .
We live inside a box of privilege , spared the gritty details of staying alive in a hostile environment .
You do n’t need to get on a soapbox .
In fact , it would kill sales if your copy swerved off into tangents about the state of the world in irrelevant ways .
Yet , the job of the top copywriter involves being engaged with the reality of the world in a much deeper way than the average prospect .
The more you understand the way things really are — outside of ideology and wishful thinking — the more you become a truly powerful communicator .
It ’s almost like being in a priesthood , of sorts .
Early scribes , in Egypt , were treated and lived as a special privileged class … and formed guilds where the secrets of communicating through the written word were passed on to apprentices sworn to treat their power with respect .
If you ’ve ever hung out with copywriters in the bar after a seminar , you know how esoteric and passionate we can get over what most people consider a very simple craft of putting words on paper .
Your job , as a creator of ads , is to bring with you a nuanced and loving knowledge of life that is beyond the experience of your reader .
It ’s a big damn responsibility .
You must learn to face truths that are , at times , extremely unpleasant .
And you gotta read the news .
But your job is precisely where the necessities of life intersect with the powerful passions of being human .
Let others mock and pretend to be too hip to care or go deep .
Writers — and especially writers who understand the psychology of classic salesmanship — live better lives .
The rest of the population will refuse to feel things too passionately , because it scares them .
They like being numb .
As a writer , you voluntarily give up your ability to remain numb and dreamy about reality .
You engage , and pay attention to your emotions , your passions , and your fears .
You ’ve got a special job .
And civilization is relying on you to do it , no matter what .
Today is a sad day for the world .
Death and chaos abound .
It remains your duty , however , to engage with that sad world .
And to allow your writing to help others engage .
Yes , even on a simple level like advertising a new product .
Civilization may or may not continue on this planet .
Unless you ’re a mover - and - shaker with a finger on a button of mass destruction , it ’s doubtful you can do much on your own to dramatically change things .
Still , each person must confront both reality and the inner turmoil of existence … and if you choose to be a writer , you can not back away from what you discover .
It ’s a complex universe out there .
Sometimes , just doing your job is enough .
Stay frosty ,

The magical mystery withdrawal plan
This lovely chart was a centerpiece of Gen. David Petraeus ’ testimony this afternoon before the House Armed Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee .
It purports to show the level of U.S. troops deployed in Iraq falling gradually over … some period of time .
As withdrawal plans go , it not exactly encouraging .
That bottom line — which would , in this kind of graph , presumably indicate some measurement of time — is a little tough to read .
It says , “ Leading to Partnering to Overwatch ( Tactical to Operational to Strategic ) . ”
And in case you have no idea what that means , that ’s the general name for the strategy Petraeus outlined today for the foreseeable future .
That ’s a perfectly nice name for a strategy , of course , but this chart , while colorful , does n’t actually tell us anything , except the fact that U.S. troops will eventually be in Iraq in much smaller numbers .
Whether that ’s in nine months , nine years , or nine decades remains a complete mystery .
As Matt Yglesias ( from whom I stole borrowed this graph ) said , “ Basically , the idea is that about nine months from now , we ’ll be back to the number of troops we had in Iraq about nine months ago .
After that , more stuff is supposed to change . . . maybe . . . sometime . . . if all goes well . . . maybe . . . at some point . ”
Now , to be fair , I should note that the chart , if you look closely , is not completely devoid of dates .
It notes that by next summer , Petraeus is prepared to bring the overall deployment down to pre-surge levels , effectively ending the escalation , if the conditions meet with his satisfaction .
Except , that ’s not particularly encouraging , given that we ’ll be out of troops by that point .
I ’ll have plenty more about today ’s joint hearing tomorrow , but it ’s also worth noting that Ambassador Ryan Crocker , who was supposed to have something of a moderating influence on today ’s discussion , was surprisingly ineffective and unpersuasive .
In this clip , via TPM , Crocker explains that the surge was intended to give Iraqis breathing room , and it succeeded — Iraqis now have “ time and space to reflect on the kind of country they want . ”
It was , to my ears , the most breathtaking remark of the day .
We ’re spilling blood and treasure to give Iraqis time — not to create some kind of political reconciliation , but so they can “ reflect ” on the kind of country they want ?
Please .
Even Bush administration officials should be able to come up with something better than this .
Owner wants police held responsible for destroyed medical marijuana

The return of marijuana plants to a Colorado couple is being interpreted by some as a milestone in the debate over medical marijuana .
A Colorado District Court Judge ordered police to hand back 39 marijuana plants to James and Lisa Masters more than a year after it was seized from their home .
One problem : the plants were dead .
" The Fort Collins police absolutely did not obey the state law , " says the Masters ' attorney .
" The medical marijuana law in Colorado could not be clearer . "
The plants were not usable , according to Masters .
" This was a bag of marijuana that they had preserved , " he says .
" Now , it 's completely full of mold . "
The Masters were also returned drug paraphernalia , which was broken .
The Masters contend the plants were worth around $ 100,000 , and they will ask the judge for that much in compensation .
According to CNN , " the new medical marijuana laws put police in a strange position .
Seized marijuana plants have to be maintained in their original condition , essentially putting police in the cultivating business . "
Masters joked that he could be of assistance if the police asked him .
" If they need somebody with experience to help them with it , I would definitely give them advice . "

Former stripper Diablo Cody finds a checkered past inspires great writing .
A couple of years ago , Diablo Cody called her parents in suburban Chicago to tell them she was getting her first book published .
That was the good news .
" Then I have to say , ' Wait , the book is about something that I did for a year that I did n't tell you about , that will horrify you , ' " recounts the author .
" My mom started guessing .
I guess the term ' crack dealer ' came up .
" In fact , Cody , whose real name is Brook Busey - Hunt , spent a year stripping in clubs and masturbating for paying customers in a peep show in Minneapolis .
For her parents , hard drugs would have been preferable .
" My mother would have rather I wrote a distaff ' Million Little Pieces ' than a stripper memoir , because I was raised in a Catholic household and sex is the ultimate taboo .
If I do n't cross my legs in a certain way when I 'm seated in a dress , [ my mom ] gets a little nervous . "
Cody 's first screenwriting effort , " Juno , " debuted on Wednesday , and it contains a memorable scene in which 15 - year - old Juno ( Ellen Page ) confesses to her parents that she 's pregnant .
Clearly , shades of Cody 's own past crept into the script , as Juno 's father and stepmom ( J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney ) first try to guess what horrible thing their daughter is trying to summon up the courage to tell them .
( " Do you need a large sum of money ?
Legal counsel ? " )
And after Juno has retreated upstairs , the stunned pair commiserate .
Her stepmom says with a sigh , " I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs , " to which her dad responds , " That was my first instinct too .
Or D.U.I .
Anything but this .
" Like Juno , the 29 - year old Cody has to deal with a birth of her own -- of her film , her meteoric screenwriting career , her full - tilt plunge into the media limelight .
Over lunch recently at a Melrose Avenue restaurant , the writer , a Los Angeles transplant as of April , appeared slightly dazed , as if she were just waking up after a long night of partying .
In fact , this is her first day off from a marathon of travel , a different plane every day , as she 's barnstormed Europe and the U.S. talking to journalists about " Juno . "
She 's dressed in a turquoise T - shirt , with sparkling silver letters proclaiming " Rock and Roll Party all night long , " and has a cap smashed down on her black Louise Brooks bob .
On one arm is a tattoo of a pinup girl , which she recently had burnished , and the newly applied ink left her bedsheets looking like " the shroud of Turin . "
Cody is at once exuberant and wary about the media glare .
About six months ago , when the cognoscenti starting calling her the next big thing , it was easy to see her as a screenwriter with a trick up her sleeve .
Now that the movie 's out , it 's clear that Cody lives up to the hype .
In a town that shells out millions of dollars for screenplays so practiced that they read as though the human element has all but been squelched , hers is an authentic voice , alternately sardonic , wide - eyed , hilarious and sad . "
I 've always gotten a large ration of negative reactions to positive in my writing , " she says .
" For some reason , it tends to provoke reactions on the extreme ends of the spectrum .
I hate the idea that I 'm some sort of self - invented Gatsby - type figure who clawed her way to the top .
I have done nothing of the sort .
I 'm Forrest Gump .
I feel like I 'm superimposed in all these scenarios .
I do n't know what the hell I 'm doing here . "
Cody is certainly a refreshing conundrum , an unexpected mishmash and a self - declared " radical feminist " who 's routinely received angry e-mails from readers who believe that 's she a female chauvinist , complicit with the porn industry .
Her memoir " Candy Girl " is certainly not for the fainthearted , full of the up - close - and - personal details of what it 's like to strip and entertain depraved customers .
Her book combines Diane Arbus prurience with a wacky sense of humor and Midwestern do - it - yourselfness ; it landed her as David Letterman 's one - and - only " Book Club 2006 pick " and a jaunty appearance on the show , where she declared herself the " Margaret Mead of sex .
"
In the book , she glosses over her motivations , except to say she wanted to escape from her life of privilege .
Although she still likes going to strip clubs , today she says " they 're gross places .
They 're little shame terrariums .
I guess I was raised to feel shame more acutely than any other emotion .
Maybe I felt that 's home .
" Perhaps this is why " Juno " might be one of the few movies , indeed one of the first pop-culture artifacts , that has dealt with teen pregnancy without the usual tsunami of humiliation .
Ironically enough , this ardently pro-choice gal has recently had her politics doubted by those who note that her protagonist Juno opts against an abortion after a punky Planned Parenthood receptionist offers her a boysenberry - flavored condom and tells her to fill out a raft of paperwork , adding , " We need to know about every score and every sore . "
" I would have written a really gory graphic abortion movie had I known .
. . .
I 've had to field so many questions about the sinister pro-life agenda of ' Juno . '
There was only one way to get Juno so she 's sitting in the room with Mark and Vanessa .
" Cody is referring to the scene that launched the film in her head , in which the scruffy but bright teen heroine goes to meet the yuppie couple ( played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman ) who want to adopt her unborn baby .
" To me , there was an entire movie about a pregnant teenager , a prospective adoptive mother who 's dying to be a parent , a reluctant adoptive father with a strange connection to the young girl , with Juno 's father mediating the whole thing , and an attorney . "
Indeed , it 's as if different strains of Cody 's persona were having a confab .
Although there 's been a tradition of journalists such as Nora Ephron , Nick Pileggi , Paul Attanasio and Stephen Schiff jumping into screenwriting , Cody is one of the first from the new blogging world to cross over , bringing with her much of the raucous , young , irreverent attitude of the Internet .
She 's an exhibitionist -- but she 's honest .
( Indeed , her own blog -- diablocody.blogspot.com -- is now featuring posts about the breakup of her marriage . )
She launched her first blog in the dark ages of the medium , back in 2001 , not long after she graduated from college .
In those medieval days , she used to take three buses at night to attend a class where she had to learn HTML so she could hand - code her own blog .
She called the site " The Red Secretary , " and it was the faux diary of a secretary in Belarus .
" It was this proto -Borat character .
I would write about my ancient computer , this flat with no hot water .
All I wanted for X - Mas was an American Frisbee . "
The only people who read it were her family .
She then rebooted as a Beach Boys fanatic with a website devoted to them called " Girls , Cars and Surfing . "
On the site , she met Jonny Hunt and later moved to Minneapolis and married him .
She was very bored working as a typist at an ad agency and launched another blog with a name that contains part of the female anatomy that can't be published in a family newspaper .
No one much read her personal chronicles until , on a whim , she tried out for amateur night at a strip club and wrote about that .
Her page views soared .
" Clearly I 'm catching people 's attention with sex .
Who knew ? " she says sardonically .
" I kept stripping and blogging .
It was kind of stunt blogging . "
Eventually , Hollywood came calling .
Cody says her Hollywood manager , Mason Novick , was googling profane names for the female anatomy when he stumbled upon Cody 's blog and became a fan .
After courting her for eight months , he eventually helped her land her book deal and start screenwriting .
In the interim , the jobs have poured in , including a horror - comedy , " Jennifer 's Body , " about a cheerleader ( " Transformers ' " Megan Fox ) who devours men , and " Girly - Style , " her female empowerment answer to " Superbad . "
There 's also a Showtime comedy , based on an idea from Steven Spielberg , " The United States of Tara , " about a mother with a split personality disorder .
It stars Toni Collette and is slated to start shooting when the writers strike is over .
Although she 's talked frequently to Spielberg on the phone , she has n't met the icon yet .
" I 'm looking forward to that .
It 's a tough meeting to get , " she says , adding that despite her flip mouth , she 's a Spielberg nut .
" I genuinely love his movies .
I always have .
I think ' E.T. ' may be the first movie I ever saw in the theater . "
Cody is aware that it's not been a great time for females onscreen , given the paucity of interesting roles .
" It 's a grim time for women , " says the writer .
" I feel sometimes like we live in ' The Matrix , ' " she says , referring to the Keanu Reeves film in which people live in a pseudo - reality .
" People are completely blinded to the patriarchy because we 're so used to it .
I try to live every day completely alert and aware of how I 'm being marginalized .
I do n't have a persecution complex , but I look for it .
" This said , as a screenwriter , and potentially one day a director , Cody hopes at least to keep adding quirky , subversive , original female characters to the Hollywood canon .
" I have a responsibility to write strong female characters .
I 'm going to continue to do it . "

After Ron Paul Supporters Showed Up in Overwhelming Numbers to San Francisco GOP Straw Poll , the Straw Poll was cancelled .
The San Francisco Republican Alliances Common Sense Supper Club announced that local Republicans were invited to attend a holiday buffet party and Presidential straw poll vote on the evening of Tues.
Dec. 4 . On the morning of the event , a Ron Paul supporter spoke by phone with the chairperson and hostess .
The supporter was told that if he and any other Ron Paul supporters wanted to attend , they could either participate in both the buffet starting at 6:45 pm and the later straw poll for $ 33 , or come later at 8:15 pm solely to vote in the straw poll for a discounted entrance fee of $ 5 , provided they did not eat any food .
The Ron Paul supporter then posted the event on Meetup , and we ended up with a huge crowd of Ron Paul supporters arriving at the event .
At least 15 or more of the 80 guests seated at the buffet were Ron Paul supporters , while those who came at 8:15 pm solely to vote for Ron Paul numbered an additional 40 .
These 40 people were forced to wait outside of the event standing in the lobby for at least an hour until 9:30 pm or later .
Finally , the 40 people were allowed into the event room after paying the previously - quoted entrance fee of $ 5 .
The total of approximately 55 or more Ron Paul supporters , who wore Ron Paul buttons and carried Ron Paul signs , made it clear to all in the room that the Ron Paul supporters outnumbered supporters of all other candidates .
As a side note , the Fred Thompson supporters had during the entire event posted a huge Fred Thompson sign on the wall inside the event , and had distributed Fred Thompson campaign literature at every place - setting at every table .
When the Fred Thompson supporters saw that the room was dominated by the huge number of Ron Paul supporters , the Fred Thompson supporters complained to the hostess that the Ron Paul supporters who did not pay the $ 33 should not be allowed to vote .
They said the Fred Thompson supporters had not been given the same instructions the Ron Paul supporters had about the opportunity to come later and vote at a discounted price .
Many Ron
Paul supporters offered to pay the $ 28 difference to vote , but this offer was not accepted .
The hostess in the heat of the moment decided to cancel the poll given the disagreement in opinion as to how best to handle the situation .
A representative of the Ron Paul supporters was given the microphone for about four minutes , during which time he mentioned that there was a Revolution going on , that the Revolution has been censored at previous straw polls and in the corporate media and their debates , and at which time he also mentioned that if the Republicans continue to refuse to learn about Ron Paul and ignore the Ron Paul Revolution , they are destined to likely lose the 2008 general election to the Democrats , given the fact that 70 % or more of Americans want a quick withdrawal from Iraq .
Many Ron
Paul supporters expressed their anger about the sudden cancellation of the straw poll , and demanded a return of their money , which was not refunded to them .
In the end , the attendance of the large number of Ron Paul supporters succeeded in demonstrating our numbers , addressing the audience for four minutes about the Revolution , and preventing what might have otherwise been a Straw Poll win for Fred Thompson , with the end result being the cancellation of the poll .
Some Ron Paul supporters expressed empathy with the hostess , as it was understood that there was no way she was going to be able to make a decision that could have pleased both the Fred Thompson supporters and the Ron Paul supporters .
Girls are threatened and isolated from their families
A working group is being set up to examine " internal trafficking " of girls in their teens or younger .
In some cases , girls as young as 10 are believed to have been groomed by youths pretending to be boyfriends .
They are passed on and end up in prostitution .
Campaigners said the authorities had been slow to react to the problem .
In a report seen by the BBC , the Home Office recommends that " the newly formed UK Internal Trafficking Group will seek to define the extent and nature of this phenomenon " .
It can happen to any child from any family
Hilary Willmer , Coalition for the Removal of Pimping
A victim's story A parent 's story
Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker confirmed it had commissioned work to examine internal trafficking .
He said a film was also being made to be shown in schools to warn children of the dangers .
" There 's work going on with prosecuting authorities to make sure they 're aware of this issue and understand it and then there 's work going on in communities to make sure that people are aware of this as a potential problem , " he said .
" We also want to have services that protect and support victims as well . "
Threats and beatings
The BBC has learned that internal trafficking follows a typical pattern in which a girl aged about 12 is approached and won over by a good - looking , well - dressed teenage boy .
He gives her jewellery , mobile phones and later drink or drugs , and pretends to be her boyfriend .
" Emma " told the BBC she was groomed by a teenage boy
Once under his spell , the girl is turned against her parents and persuaded to have sex with her boyfriend 's older " uncles " or " friends " to pay him back for the money he has spent on her .
Gradually , she finds herself spending all her time with the older men who force her , often with violence , to work as a prostitute .
Meanwhile , her original " boyfriend " is out targeting another young girl .
One victim Emma , which is not her real name , was targeted when she was 13 .
" In schools we 're always warned about a man in a white van , but we 're never warned that someone nearly your own age could be targeting you to groom you for prostitution , " she said .
Emma was too terrified to ask for help .
" They 've threatened to rape my mum and make me watch , " she said .
" Firebomb my house .
Shoot me , shoot my family .
They 've threatened to do all sorts of things . "
Parents ' bewildered '
Hilary Willmer , from the Coalition for the Removal of Pimping ( Crop ) , said she had seen dozens of cases of internal trafficking .
Ms Willmer said : " It can happen to any child from any family .
The men , the gangs have all the experience .
The children , the families and the parents are bewildered , do n't know what 's happening . "
She welcomed the Home Office action , but said part of the problem was the law .
The whole issue with trafficking is that it's a secret , covert crime and there 's a great deal of control placed over the victims
Nick Kinsella
UK Human Trafficking Centre
Once older than 13 , a girl may be asked to give evidence in court against an attacker .
" In practice , unless the primary victim is prepared to give evidence then it's very difficult to make charges stick , " Ms Willmer said .
" The men know this , so they often wait until the girls are 13 before actually having sex with them . "
North Yorkshire Chief Constable Grahame Maxwell said many forces were aware of this problem and officers were now trying to piece together the national picture .
He said : " It is a very difficult crime to detect .
We are talking about people who do n't want to talk about things in the open .
" When they actually find out the extent to which the exploitation has been carried out on them , how much they have been abused , how much they 've been forced to have sexual partners , it 's a very difficult thing to comes to terms with . "
The UK Human Trafficking Centre ( UKHTC ) in Sheffield recently appointed a dedicated detective sergeant to work on internal trafficking cases .
Nick Kinsella , head of the UKHTC , said the scale of the problem was unclear .
" The whole issue with trafficking is that it 's a secret , covert crime and there 's a great deal of control placed over the victims and so that 's always difficult to break down irrespective of the age , " he said .
Opera singing Brit Tony Henry has become a Croatian hero for mispronouncing a line in the country 's national anthem before its team consigned a lamentable England to the dustbin of footballing history on Wednesday night .
The ditty is " written in the old Croat style " , the Telegraph explains , and instead of singing Mila kuda si planina - " You know my dear how we love your mountains " - Henry thundered Mila kura si planina , or " My dear , my penis is a mountain " .
This evidently delighted Croatian players Vedran Corluka and Luka Modric , who were seen " grinning at each other " at the gaffe , and fans claim the slip helped relax the team before its 3 - 2 drubbing of McClaren 's lacklustre side .
Accordingly , Croatians are now calling for Henry to be awarded with a medal and appointed their team 's official mascot for Euro 2008 .
Mate Prlic , of Croatian footie mag Torcida , suggested : " He obviously relaxed the players so why not invite him to Euro 2008 to keep the winning streak going ? "
Henry 's agent , Douglas Gillespie , said : " Tony had a great reception from the Croatian fans and already feels part of their campaign for Euro 2008 . " ®
I feel pretty confident tossing anything with no return address and I 'm slowly catching on to meaningless markings like " Time - sensitive Material " , " Please Do Not Discard " , and " Please Open Immediately " .
I 've noticed that many , if not all , of my monthly bills come in an envelope that 's clearly marked " Your Statement is Enclosed " or " Your Bill is Enclosed " .
I checked the USPS.gov site but could n't find any reference to this as a requirement .
Is it ?
How do you determine what to open or toss without opening and tossing ?
SnailMailFilterFilter :
Are there any failsafe rules to separate USPS junk mail from real mail ( or vice versa ) without opening it ?
I know I need n't worry about an ink SoBig virus , but I just hate being suckered into opening an important - looking envelope only to find another Visa / MC application .

A Pakistani newspaper has accused George W. Bush of thinking that Nawaz Sharif of the Muslim League - N is a Muslim fundamentalist , and of expressing worries about him on that score .
In fact , Nawaz Sharif is a wealthy industrialist and his “ Muslim League ” is mainly a rebranding of the old Unionist landlord party of the colonial era .
It is just an upper class conservative party , and most true fundamentalists vote instead for the Islamic Action Council , in which the Jamaat - i Islami is the major component .
Nawaz showed dictatorial tendencies when he was prime minister , and he pushed for more Islamic law instead of secular law .
But he offered to capture Usamah Bin Laden for the US and was willing to lessen Pakistani support for the Taliban under US pressure .
He was less of a hawk on these issues than the secular Gen. Musharraf .
I cannot find the quote the newspaper attributes to Bush and so cannot vouch for its validity .
But the article ’s rage about Bush interfering in Pakistani politics in an ignorant way is pretty authentic .
This is an excerpt from a piece translated by the USG Open Source Center .
‘ Pakistan : Editorial Urges People To Protest Against ‘ Aggressive ’ Remarks of Bush
Editorial : “ Crusader Bush ’s Strange Logic ”
Nawa-e Waqt

Document Type : OSC Translated Text
. . .
In [ President Bush ’s ] statement , while referring to the former prime minister and chief of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz Group ( PML - N ) , Nawaz Sharif , the US President said : “ He has contacts with religious parties , which makes his capability to fight the war on terror doubtful .
Presence of such a leader in Pakistan , who is unaware of the requirements of today ’s world and does not understand the importance of dealing with extremists nurturing a desire to attack other countries , will be a matter of grave concern for us . ”
President Bush himself pursues deep Christian religious extremist views and has launched a crusade against Islamic countries as a crusader .
He has killed hundreds of thousands of unarmed men , women , and children in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In spite of his claims of friendship with Pakistan , the US President is pursuing a program to deprive it of its nuclear capability and dismember the country .
He has complaints against Sharif , a popular Pakistani leader , only because he regularly offers prayers and is not prepared to accept the so - called enlightened moderation .
President Bush ’s act of expressing such views about an Islamic - minded political leader and religious parties of Pakistan is not only incompatible with diplomatic norms but also a flagrant interference in Pakistan ’s internal affairs .
While forcefully protesting against these aggressive remarks of President Bush , the Pakistani people should strongly condemn them .
. . .
The Pakistani people do not need US aid as it never reaches the masses .
The Pakistan Government should immediately dissociate itself from the so - called war on terror . . .

The Army 's unwillingness to accept openly gay soldiers has always struck me as not just bigoted , but incredibly dumb .
Placing heterosexism ahead of national security looks even dumber than ever at a time when the Army is having a lot of trouble recruiting and retaining people .
But it 's not just gays the Army does n't want .
It 's not even gays and transgendered people .
If you actually read the Army 's Standards of Medical Fitness ( pdf ) , you 'll discover that the Army seems to have a truly bizarre devotion to the idea that only men and women with absolutely , completely normal genitalia and reproductive systems can possibly defend us in time of war .
Among the people who do not meet its standards :
Women who experience unusually heavy menstrual bleeding , or bleeding at irregular intervals , or no periods at all .
Women born without a uterus .
In men , " Current absence of one or both testicles , either congenital ( 752.89 ) or undescended ( 752.51 ) is disqualifying . "
And , for both men and women : " History of major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as change of sex ( P64.5 ) , hermaphroditism , pseudohermaphroditism , or pure gonadal dysgenesis ( 752.7 ) or dysfunctional residuals from surgical correction of these conditions is disqualifying . "
Undescended testicles ???
Unless
I am very , very wrong about what exactly service in the military involves , I can't see that an undescended testicle would affect a soldier 's ability to perform his duties .
I checked to see whether undescended testicles might lead to some more severe problems later ; apparently , they reduce fertility , which is hardly the Army 's concern , and increase the odds that one will get testicular cancer .
But since the Army accepts smokers , I can't see that this explains why they disqualify recruits with undescended testicles .
As far as I can tell , the only remotely plausible explanation is that the Army has decided to constitute itself as a Defender of Binary Gender Norms .
And that seems like a pretty stupid thing to do during wartime .
Or ever , for that matter .
" Last year , the Army had to grant waivers to nearly one in five recruits because they had criminal records . "
If they 're willing to overlook criminal records , I imagine that they 're probably granting waivers to people with undescended testicles as well .
But that 's only a stopgap measure : the real question is : why on earth does the Army care whether or not its soldiers have undescended testicles in the first place ?
Why not just ask whether a soldier is physically able to do his or her duty , and leave it at that ?
How the creature compares for size with a human
The giant beast
The 390 - million - year - old specimen was found in a German quarry , the journal Biology Letters reports .
The creature , which is called Jaekelopterus rhenaniae , would have paddled in a river or swamp .
The size of the beast suggests that spiders , insects , crabs and similar creatures were much larger in the past than previously thought , the team says .
The claw itself measures 46 cm - indicating its owner would have been longer even than the average - sized human .
Overall , the estimated size of the animal exceeds the record for any other sea scorpion ( eurypterid ) find by nearly 50 cm .
The eurypterids are believed to be the extinct aquatic ancestors of modern land scorpions and possibly all arachnids ( the class of animals that also includes spiders ) .
" The biggest scorpion today is nearly 30 cm so that shows you how big this creature was , " said Dr Simon Braddy from the University of Bristol , UK .
It was one of Dr Braddy 's co-authors , Markus Poschmann , who made the discovery in the quarry near Prum in western Germany .
" I was loosening pieces of rock with a hammer and chisel when I suddenly realised there was a dark patch of organic matter on a freshly removed slab , " he recalled .
" After some cleaning I could identify this as a small part of a large claw .
Although I did not know if it was more complete or not , I decided to try and get it out .
" The pieces had to be cleaned separately , dried , and then glued back together .
It was then put into a white plaster jacket to stabilise it . "
Super - sized meals
The species existed during a period in Earth history when oxygen levels in the atmosphere were much higher than today .
The fossil was locked in a siltstone
But Dr Braddy thinks the large scales may have had a lot to do with the absence early on of vertebrate predators .
As they came on the scene , these animals would have eaten all the biggest prey specimens .
" The fact that you are big means you are more likely to be seen and to be taken for a tastier morsel , " he told BBC News .
" Evolution will not select for large size ; you want to be small so you can hide away . "
The scorpions are thought to have made their first scuttles on to land about 450 million years ago .
While some would have taken up a fully terrestrial existence , others like Jaekelopterus rhenaniae would have maintained an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle .

As everyone knows , excessive speed is one of the main causes of traffic accidents .
One of the reasons for reckless speeding is that when we think of the possible impact of a collision , our intuition fools us .
We tend to assume that if we go twice as fast ( say , at 80 km/h instead of 40 km /h ) , then the impact of a collision will be twice as large .
In fact , the impact of a collision is proportional not to the speed ( V ) , but to the kinetic energy of the vehicle ( m /2 * V² ) , which is transformed to work as the car decelerates to zero .
Here m is the mass of the vehicle , which we cannot do much about , but the other term is the square of the velocity .
This means that the “ impact ” of hitting a wall at 80 km/h is four times as large as that of the same collision at 40 km /h .
To capture this intuition , the idea of this post is a speedometer design , that scales as the square of the velocity , to give the driver a more realistic view of the effects of speeding .
( larger image ) Notes : after sketching this drawing , I found that in 1995 Goetz Kluge was thinking along similar lines and produced a similar design .
There are however some differences – see next .
besides showing the speed in the more familiar , circular layout , I also made the decision to draw the smaller lines at uniform density ( i.e. they are spaced proportionally to the kinetic energy , not to the velocity ) .
This design might make it harder to estimate the exact speed , say between 40 km/h and 50 km/h , but it makes the increased kinetic energy easier to grasp – when we speed from 120 km/h to 130 km/h , the hand crosses more “ small lines ” than from 20 km/h to 30 km/h .
while I have n’t seen a similar speedometer in any real car , some of the existing speedometers are in fact nonlinear .
Unfortunately , they seem to achieve the exact opposite effect to the design shown above .
See this example .
On the linked image , and in many other modern speedometers , the manufacturers try to put more resolution in at the lower half of the range , dilating the velocities between 0 and 80 .
My guess is that car makers do this , because the car accelerates faster at low speeds , so dilating the lower range makes the hand movement seem more uniform at all speeds – this is probably aesthetically more pleasing , but it might come at a cost of an increased ( false ) sense of security , and in effect a reduced safety .
( I got this exactly wrong – thanks Tobias for pointing it out – it is actually the opposite , on the proposed speedometer design , the hand would move more evenly – so besides being safer , it would be more aesthetical as well , the only downside seems to be the reduced resolution in the low range )
A few quick web app ideas , to get the ball rolling ..
Some previous ones .
1 . Your English is so 1890 .
There was a popular widget some time ago , in which you paste some text that you wrote ( or it processes your blog ) and through a statistical analysis of word frequencies it tells you whether you write like Hemingway or more like Virginia Woolf or like Edgar Allan Poe or whoever .
Then you get a badge you can put on your blog or on your wall in your favorite social network .
It was quite nice and popular , although I can’t find it anymore ( EDIT : here it is ) .
Mine is a tweak on this idea .
Google has released a data set with the frequencies of words in books throughout the years ( ngrams.googlelabs.com ) .
Say , you might find that “ computer ” appeared in 5 % of the books in 1970 and in 15 % of those in 1985 ( I am making this up ) .
So , given any year , you can easily find out how likely a certain word is to appear in a randomly picked text .
With Bayes rule and some reasonable assumptions we could reverse this and for a given snippet of text , compute the probability that the text was written in 1800 or in 1850 or in 1900 , etc .
We would pretend that a priori the text is just as likely to come from any year .
This is not exactly true , since we know the text comes from the present , or at least we know that the amount of text available from any year grows as we get closer to the present , but let ’s ignore all that for a moment .
It would be more fun than exact science anyway .
However , it could still generate interesting comparisons between the style , choice of words , favorite topics of different people , or the styles of different authors from the past .
For example we might discover that some authors had a language that anticipated ( or influenced ) the future , while others were stuck using the language of the past .
2 . World map with radios .
Online radios are a nice tool in learning any language , but often it is hard to find suitable ones .
For learning or practicing a language the topic is perhaps less important as long as it is at least mildly interesting and as long as there is sufficient amount of talking ( instead of just music ) , with a clear pronunciation that is representative for a given language / dialect .
So what I would like is a world map with a curated list of online radio stations , placed on the map with pins , and for each station it would be given exactly what language / dialect they use , approximately how difficult are the topics discussed , what is the amount of slang , etc .
3 . World map with unofficial regions .
Finding a political map with the official borders for countries / states / counties / etc. is easy .
There exist however , many other types of regions : historical ones ( those that in the past might have formed an administrative unit but they do n’t anymore )
linguistic regions ( the region where a language / dialect is spoken )
geographic regions not necessarily corresponding to administrative units ( Silicon Valley , Gangetic Plain , etc. )
regions of scientific interest : ( the range of the Neanderthal man , the region of influence of classical Greek culture , the range of the Bengal tiger in 1900 )
etc .
It would be nice to have a tool for annotating maps in this way ( possibly based on Google Maps ) just as easily as we can add locations or paths between different points .
Such regions , once drawn could be saved , embedded , printed , used in presentations , news articles , lectures , etc. or shared similarly to how users can share photos attached to places on Google Maps .
Then , instead of the usual political / geographic view of the world , we could choose other filters / overlays created by others .
Another type of overlay would not have strict borders like regions , but would be a mapping of values onto geographical coordinates .
The function value could be shown in colors or using contour curves or any other visualization , and the values could come from uploaded datasets or from some specified function .
These types of visualizations exist of course , but I do n’t know of a simple interface where users could create such maps .
4 . World map live postcard .
A simple service that shows an empty world map and generates a unique url on demand .
If someone visits the url , their geographic location appears on the map .
This can be done of course with analytics software , but the key here is that a ) this is real - time b ) accessible to everyone who has the url and c ) starting a new map is just one click with no registration and then the url can simply be copy / pasted and sent to others .
Example usage : I am regularly visiting a forum , I am curious where the other visitors are from , so I put the link in the message and watch the map in real time .
Example 2 : I am chatting with a group of friends and I hear that a common friend of ours is ill .
I create a new map , and send the link to everyone , so when they click it , they appear on the map .
They can also watch as more and more people click the link .
They can also leave one liner messages that will be displayed on the map next to their location .
As our friend checks the link , he / she can see “ get well soon ” messages popping up from all over the world .
This is all a bit similar to Wikipediavision , but more user - generated and with throw - away urls .
5 . Centralized phpBB spam filter .
PhpBB is a robust , well - known and loved dicussion board ( forum ) software that has been around for a long time .
The main aspect in which I find it inferior to centralized services like Disqus is spam .
Spam filtering is something that is simply easier to do in a centralized way than for each individual board separately .
This centralized filter would be a subscription - based API that I can call whenever I get a message on my board and it returns a spam / not spam flag .
This can be integrated into my phpBB installation and the necessary action is taken automatically .
This way , I would n’t have to bother users with captcha’s , registration , senseless restrictions , and I could still have them use the familiar interface of phpBB .
If such a service works for WordPress comments and other blogging software , surely it can be retrofitted for phpBB ( ? ) .
6 . Name face search .
When picking a baby name , many parents would like to find out as much as possible about it , including the history and etymology of the name , which historical persons have had that name , current popularity of the name , etc .
In this service you type in a first name and it gives you the photos of 100 random people having that name .
Looking at the age of people on the photos , you can guess whether the name was more popular one or two generations ago than it is today .
Also useful if you hear a name in a foreign language and you are not sure whether it is a male or female name .
Images of faces can be found on Facebook or on Google Images , but there are still some technical difficulties : a ) all 100 should be different persons b ) the images should be filtered so that they only contain photos of people and not other random images .
Another bunch of random ideas off my chest .
If interested , check out the previous set also , or the web app ideas before them .
The usual disclaimers apply …
1 . Facebook downvote button Obligatory disclaimer : I do n’t have a Facebook account .
But I did have one for a short period , so I have a rough idea what it is about .
Unless things have changed dramatically , what is sorely missing is the dislike button .
Of course it goes against the feel - goody nature of the whole experience , so probably it will never be added .
On the other hand , many elements that are “ likable ” are also commentable in some way .
So the idea is a browser plugin that adds the thumbs - down button within the browser ( something like a GreaseMonkey script ) .
When the user clicks it , it writes a comment with the text “ I do n’t like this ” .
Those who have the plugin installed will have these comments hidden and only see the dislike - count summary of them .
Those without the plugin will see the comments , which make sense on their own , so the whole system degrades gracefully .
2 . Software feature matrix
This one is a website built around the idea of unbiased comparison of products .
It groups existing software or web apps into categories and lists a large set of agreed - upon features , ticking those that a software product implements , with extra information where it does not fully implement it , etc .
Such tables have been written for many categories of software , for example this list of CMS software on wikipedia , but the hypothetical website would contain tables for every imaginable category , both Desktop software and web apps , with up - to - date price information and many other features .
How to collect the data and how to ensure the information is unbiased , are nontrivial questions , but if done well , such a website could be quite useful .
3 . Namespace explorer
There exist very good services that help us in coming up with domain names for a project .
However , nowadays you might also want to ensure that you can find a matching account name on Twitter , Gmail , Facebook and who knows what other services .
This application would suggest names that are available on all these services and would automate to some extent the creation of accounts .
Some intuitive navigation interface or visualization of these namespaces to help find available names .
4 . Paper airplane simulator Software for modeling paper airplane folding and simulation of their aerodynamic behavior .
Additionally , a system that comes up with new folding designs , evaluates and improves them using genetic algorithms or other optimization techniques .
Karl Sims ’ evolved creatures meet Robert Lang ’s origami work .
5 . Juggling tricks optimizer
And you thought the previous idea was childish and useless .
This one supposes a rich language for describing the mechanics of juggling n balls .
Basic siteswap notation ( although beautifully compact ) does n’t capture the full range of possible patterns .
The hypothetical language could describe throws , catches , multiplexes , hand movements , the anatomically possible range and speed of movements and the physical plausibility of every ball trajectory , possibly including collisions .
Using this language we can describe any juggling pattern ever performed in the past or in the future .
Now all we need is a pair of scoring functions .
The first function tells how difficult a pattern is ( described as a string in our language ) , based on the speed of movement , the resting time between throws / catches and various physiological considerations .
The other function tells how interesting the pattern is .
I am not even speculating on how such function would look like .
Interestingness is related to difficulty , but there are some easy tricks which are very nice ( and vice versa ) , so there is something more happening here .
Having these components in place ( a big if , I know ) , we can start optimizing using our favorite genetic algorithm from the previous idea .
The system then invents the most interesting , most hard to perform ( but possible ! ) juggling trick .
Then it designs the most interesting – yet easy pattern .
Tweak the two functions , optimize again , invent , juggle , etc. 6 . Car parking game A simple game ( mobile or desktop ) with realistic mechanics but extremely simple graphics and control .
Actually control would not necessarily be simple , but it would instead resemble the control of a ( manual ) gear shift car with the 3 pedals and all .
The cars are basically rectangles , but the acceleration , steering , braking , collision are realistic as much as possible .
Possible tasks include parking in some small place , side - parking , turning in 3 steps in a small place , etc. etc .
Also suitable as a programming project for children .
7 . Song illustrator
This plays on a misconception I had when I was 4 or 5 .
I was familiar with audio cassettes , from which I would listen to stories and songs for children that my parents would put on for me to hear .
I had heard about video players before , and I vaguely understood that they are playing moving images ( I was familiar with TV already ) , but I seriously misunderstood something : I thought that video players could play the same audio cassettes I was listening to ( say , “ The Little Prince ” , being read by someone ) .
As they played the audio cassettes , I thought they would render the moving images on the spot , creating vivid animations similar to those I imagined upon hearing the text ( or more interesting ) .
It never crossed my mind that in order to have a video version , a bunch of actors would have to go through the trouble of acting it all out in front of a camera .
That is so much worse than the way I originally imagined it .
So this idea is a modest version of the original concept : take a song together with the lyrics , feed it into this program , which then creates a video for it automatically and synchronizes it to the music .
As a first approximation it finds Flickr images corresponding to the words from the lyrics and makes a slideshow out of those .
I know , reality is not so interesting sometimes .
8 . Visa matrix
Back to more realistic waters , this one is a useful tool for world - travelers and world - citizens .
If there are 200 countries , make a 200 - by - 200 matrix , where the column shows your citizenship , the row shows which country you want to travel to and the entry shows what document you need to travel there .
For a summary view ( for example as a printable poster ) , the entries can be color - coded : from green to red showing “ no document needed ” , “ passport needed ” , “ visa needed ” , “ entry not allowed ” , etc .
In the online version the cells contain links to the embassy websites where more information is available and the visa application can be initiated .
All the necessary information is publicly available already , it is just not collected ( as far as I know ) in one place like this .
9 . Online store where you can negotiate Extremely half - baked , I am thinking this out as I write it down .
They say “ everything is negotiable ” .
While that holds only in a limited way , say in a usual mall in North America , it is very true in a bazaar , in the other side of the world .
The price you get depends on how much you need it , how desperate the seller is to get rid of it , your and his / her negotiation skills and many other factors .
While not all of these can be captured in an online store , certainly some subset of it could be .
Currently the online stores give “ offers ” to you , which is too rigid .
They might even give personalized offers , knowing your shopping history , personal data , etc .
In many cases , however , they might be perfectly willing to sell the product at a cheaper price if they knew for sure that I was not going to buy it for anything more than that .
On the other hand they want me to pay the maximum amount that I can afford and that I am willing to pay .
Probably there are legal restrictions on the exact ways to perform such price segmentation , but in theory there could be an online store where I can make a counteroffer : “ oh no , I ’m not buying that e-book reader for $ 129 , I ’ll pay $ 99 maximum , and that ’s it .
At most , I can spend another $ 20 to buy some books , but that ’s all I can spend today .
Take it or leave it . ”
Once an offer is made ( from either side ) , it is binding .
The online store would have my purchasing - as well as negotiation history , so it could decide whether it would take my offer or would rather make a counter - counter - offer and so on , ad - infinitum .
10 .
Random wiki image as wallpaper Wikipedia has a nice “ Random article ” feature , that can easily take information - addicts on an hours - long semi-pointless article - hopping ride .
Something slightly less addictive is the WikiMedia random file feature : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/File
The results are mostly images .
You clicked it ?
Now click it again !
A slideshow of these would make a nice , educational screensaver or periodically - updated wallpaper .
There should be some check to filter out images that are too small , that are obviously uninteresting ( such as portions of maps or flags of countries ) , and some context would be nice also , such as title , description , maybe titles of a few of the linking articles .
EDIT : I made this : http://lkozma.net/blog/random-wiki-image-wallpaper/
Put these three together today while working on a presentation I will do on Monday to the New South Wales Institute of Sport Network coaches .
Steve Backley , British Javelin thrower
on lessons he has learned ( From BBC Sports Website )
1 : Know your weaknesses - and do something about them
“ The best sportsmen I 've met are n't necessarily fantastic at one particular part of the skill - they 're just good at everything .
I went to train with Olympic javelin champion Jan Zelezny in 1997 , in many ways in search of the Holy Grail .
I thought there would be something he was doing that would just be ' it ' - the ultimate answer .
But if I found out anything , it was that he was good at everything .
He did n't have a weakness , because he'd worked on them all .
Most of us tend to do what we 're good at , because that 's what we enjoy doing .
What 's actually more important is to find out what we 're not good at , and then redress the balance . “
2 : Take your chances
“ In any sport , or in life , you have moments when an opportunity opens up in front of you .
You have to be ready , and you have to grasp those chances with both hands .
At the 1994 European Championships in Helsinki , I was n't expecting much - maybe just a medal if all went as well as possible .
But then I looked around after a couple of rounds of competition , and I could see that everyone was struggling .
A window was opening .
And I thought , " Right - if you lot do n't want it , then I 'll have it - I 'll drive harder than you , I 'll give it a bigger shove . "
I ended up throwing about 85 m , in quite tricky conditions - and winning it by three metres .
I remembered that moment for the rest of my career .
So if you 're thinking , " Should I do the race , or the competition , or play the match ? " - well , throw yourself in , because you never know which opportunities might arise , and what might happen .
3 : Be prepared
“ I used to write down a list of all the things that could go wrong .
People might think - hang on , that 's too negative - you have to be positive .
And you do .
But by having that list , you find solutions to all your potential problems .
What do you do if you 're doing your shoes up in the Olympic stadium just before the final starts , and your lace breaks ?
Solution : carry spare laces in your kit-bag .
You could cross that one off the list .
I would spend two weeks coming up with a long list of everything that could possibly go wrong , work through them all and then end up with a long list of solutions .
You would then sit back and think - whatever happens , I 've got a plan .
And that was a great , great feeling . ”
4 : Pressure can be your friend
“ People tend to view pressure as a bad thing , but it does n't have to be .
For example , in a training session I 'd be delighted to throw 80 or 82 m .
Three days later in a competition , I 'd throw 90 m .
The pressure of competition was worth a good eight metres .
And if you want to escape from pressure , you can do - no matter how bad the situation might seem .
At my first Olympics , I was genuinely very , very scared .
You 've got a billion people watching round the planet , 100,000 in the stadium , the best athletes in the world all in one place - of course you 're going to be scared .
It 's the natural reaction .
So what I did was to tell myself that I was simply doing an ordinary throwing session down my local track .
That worked for me . ”
5 : Have a goal
“ This sounds simple , but it 's the first part of any journey - decide where you 're going to .
Only then do you think about how you 're going to get there .
The outcome I wanted was to win whatever the major championship was that year - Europeans , Worlds or Olympics .
I 'd then ask what performance would help me achieve that outcome - invariably a throw of 88 or 89 metres would be enough to win .
The next question would be : what 's the process that 'll bring about that performance ?
And that 's where it starts to get really detailed - on your technique , the strength required , the power output you 'll need , the nutritional plan .
All the time , you have to make sure you concentrate on the process , not the outcome - although all anyone will want to talk to you about is the outcome .
Your mates do n't want to hear about how your point control is going - they want to know if you 're going to win the Olympics , or throw a world record .
What 's important is to be able to discuss that outcome with your family , your mates and people who want to glamorise the sport , but be able to focus on the process with your coach and yourself .
Because if you 've done the planning right , the outcome should look after itself . “
6 : One man 's sacrifice is another man 's dream
“ The common perception of top sports people is that they have to make huge sacrifices to reach the top .
But if you 're in pursuit of your dreams , there are n't any sacrifices , because you 're doing exactly what you want to do .
If your mates are going down the pub on a Friday night but you have to have an early night because you 've got to be down the track early on Saturday morning , that 's not a sacrifice .
I certainly never felt I was making a sacrifice , because I was doing exactly what I wanted to do .
And if there ever comes a point when you want to go down the pub , go down the pub - because if you resent what you 're doing , then you 're never going to have enough enthusiasm to do what you 're meant to be doing anyway . ”
7 : Believe in yourself
“ All great sportsmen have three things in common .
First , they all believe in themselves - neither a bad day nor a great day will affect their self - belief .
Second , they 're highly motivated , always pushing hard for the next level .
Third , they 're naturally talented .
You might think that last factor is the most important of the three , but I do n't think it is .
If you look across all sports and ask yourself what their most successful performers have in common , they 're all different shapes , different sizes and different personalities , but they all believe in themselves and they 're all highly motivated . ”
8 : Success and failure are not black and white concepts
“ At the Sydney Olympics in 2000 , it seemed all set up for me .
I 'd gone bronze in Barcelona in 1992 , silver in Atlanta in 1996 , and I thought - Sydney , the new millennium - it 's all there .
It had been my dream to throw an Olympic record - and then in the final , I did .
But I still only came away with the silver , because Jan Zelezny went straight out and broke my new record by just 32 centimetres .
People say to me , " That must have been devastating . "
But sometimes you can't have any bearing on a result .
For me it was all about whether you delivered or not - whether you did everything you planned to do and did as well as you could possibly do .
If you can say to yourself after a competition that you did - as I could after that final - then whether you came first or last does n't really matter . ”
9 : Keep changing - whether you win or lose
“ Successful sports people keep re-inventing themselves .
Whether you win or lose , you always need to get up to a new level - and you can't do that if you 're always doing the same old thing .
At the end of every season , I would make an assessment of how the season went .
You'd then draw up a new plan , and work out what changes you had to make based on what went right and what went wrong .
For example , at the end of the 1997 season I decided to join the eastern European coaching system .
By doing that , I learned a completely new way of doing things , and that gave me more armoury , more things to fall back on .
Get advice from other people .
And be creative , particularly if you 've been doing one thing for a long time .
By the time I finished athletics , we were doing all sort of weird and wonderful things in training , just to stay interested . ”
10 : Do n’t get injured
“ It sounds obvious , but it 's true : if you 're injured , you can't win anything .
And injury is n't necessarily something that you have no control over - there are ways to make sure it does n't happen to you .
Go to see a physiotherapist .
Get them to assess your physical strengths and weaknesses .
Then do the exercises that will protect the areas you 'll stress doing your sport .
For me in the javelin , it was my shoulder , back and hips that I had to think about , so I had to made sure I did the ' prehab ' to strengthen and protect those areas , and keep me healthy . ”
Ten Things I Believe
Bob Sutton , Professor Stanford Business School
1.Sometimes the best management is no management at all -- first do no harm !
2.Indifference is as important as passion .
3 . In organizational life , you can have influence over others or you can have freedom from others , but you can't have both at the same time .
4. Learning how to say smart things and give smart answers is important .
Learning to listen to others and to ask smart questions is more important .
5 . You get what you expect from people .
This is especially true when it comes to selfish behavior ; self - interest is a learned social norm , not an inherent feature of human behavior .
6 . Getting a little power can turn you into an insensitive self - centered jerk .
7. Avoid pompous jerks whenever possible .
They not only can make you feel bad about yourself , chances are that you will eventually start acting like them .
8 . The best test of a person 's character is how he or she treats those with less power .
9 . Err on the side of optimism and positive energy in all things .
10 .
Work is an over - rated activity .
The Top 10 Things They Never Taught Me in Design School
by Michael McDonough
1.Talent is one - third of the success equation .
Talent is important in any profession , but it is no guarantee of success .
Hard work and luck are equally important .
Hard work means self - discipline and sacrifice .
Luck means , among other things , access to power , whether it is social contacts or money or timing .
In fact , if you are not very talented , you can still succeed by emphasizing the other two .
If you think I am wrong , just look around .
2.95 percent of any creative profession is shit work .
Only 5 percent is actually , in some simplistic way , fun .
In school that is what you focus on ; it is 100 percent fun .
Tick - tock .
In real life , most of the time there is paper work , drafting boring stuff , fact - checking , negotiating , selling , collecting money , paying taxes , and so forth .
If you do n’t learn to love the boring , aggravating , and stupid parts of your profession and perform them with diligence and care , you will never succeed .
3. If everything is equally important , then nothing is very important .
You hear a lot about details , from “ Do n’t sweat the details ” to “ God is in the details . ”
Both are true , but with a very important explanation : hierarchy .
You must decide what is important , and then attend to it first and foremost .
Everything is important , yes .
But not everything is equally important .
A very successful real estate person taught me this .
He told me , “ Watch King Rat .
You ’ll get it . ”
4. Do n’t over - think a problem .
One time when I was in graduate school , the late , great Steven Izenour said to me , after only a week or so into a ten - week problem , “ OK , you solved it .
Now draw it up . ”
Every other critic I ever had always tried to complicate and prolong a problem when , in fact , it had already been solved .
Designers are obsessive by nature .
This was a revelation .
Sometimes you just hit it .
The thing is done .
Move on .
5.Start with what you know ; then remove the unknowns .
In design this means “ draw what you know . ”
Start by putting down what you already know and already understand .
If you are designing a chair , for example , you know that humans are of predictable height .
The seat height , the angle of repose , and the loading requirements can at least be approximated .
So draw them .
Most students panic when faced with something they do not know and cannot control .
Forget about it .
Begin at the beginning .
Then work on each unknown , solving and removing them one at a time .
It is the most important rule of design .
In Zen it is expressed as “ Be where you are . ”
It works .
6. Do n’t forget your goal .
Definition of a fanatic : Someone who redoubles his effort after forgetting his goal .
Students and young designers often approach a problem with insight and brilliance , and subsequently let it slip away in confusion , fear and wasted effort .
They forget their goals , and make up new ones as they go along .
Original thought is a kind of gift from the gods .
Artists know this .
“ Hold the moment , ” they say .
“ Honor it . ”
Get your idea down on a slip of paper and tape it up in front of you .
7 . When you throw your weight around , you usually fall off balance .
Overconfidence is as bad as no confidence .
Be humble in approaching problems .
Realize and accept your ignorance , then work diligently to educate yourself out of it .
Ask questions .
Power – the power to create things and impose them on the world – is a privilege .
Do not abuse it , do not underestimate its difficulty , or it will come around and bite you on the ass .
The great Karmic wheel , however slowly , turns .
8 . The road to hell is paved with good intentions ; or , no good deed goes unpunished .
The world is not set up to facilitate the best any more than it is set up to facilitate the worst .
It does n’t depend on brilliance or innovation because if it did , the system would be unpredictable .
It requires averages and predictables .
So , good deeds and brilliant ideas go against the grain of the social contract almost by definition .
They will be challenged and will require enormous effort to succeed .
Most fail .
Expect to work hard , expect to fail a few times , and expect to be rejected .
Our work is like martial arts or military strategy : Never underestimate your opponent .
If you believe in excellence , your opponent will pretty much be everything .
9.It all comes down to output .
No matter how cool your computer rendering is , no matter how brilliant your essay is , no matter how fabulous your whatever is , if you ca n’t output it , distribute it , and make it known , it basically does n’t exist .
Orient yourself to output .
Schedule output .
Output , output , output .
Show Me The Output .
10 . The rest of the world counts .
If you hope to accomplish anything , you will inevitably need all of the people you hated in high school .
I once attended a very prestigious design school where the idea was “ If you are here , you are so important , the rest of the world does n’t count . ”
Not a single person from that school that I know of has ever been really successful outside of school .
In fact , most are the kind of mid-level management drones and hacks they so despised as students .
A suit does not make you a genius .
No matter how good your design is , somebody has to construct or manufacture it .
Somebody has to insure it .
Somebody has to buy it .
Respect those people .
You need them .

After Downing Street — Your Representative Is Only a Modem Away
By David Nather , CQ [ who pretends there is no public push for impeachment without citing a shred of evidence , even while reporting on the public push for impeachment ]
The town hall meeting in the Philadelphia suburbs was advertised as an opportunity to talk with Rep. Joe Sestak about the Iraq War .
But when the freshman Democrat and former Navy vice admiral stood up in the lecture hall on the Swarthmore College campus Aug. 16 , the first half hour of questioners demanded to know why Congress would not impeach President Bush .
And Vice President Dick Cheney , for that matter .
Sestak did n’t try to please the crowd .
Impeachment would fail , he told the audience of roughly 200 people , and “ we will have spent a year and a half on nothing . ” 
They did n’t buy his reasoning .
“ Republicans would not have given that answer .
. . .
They stand up for what they believe , ”  one woman said .
From that , one might conclude that Sestak was facing a groundswell of public demand for Bush ’s impeachment .
But he was n’t , and he knew it .
A local group , Delaware County Wage Peace and Justice , had warned him in advance that it planned to raise the subject .
Sestak already had talked about the Iraq War at a previous town hall meeting , and the group told him its members wanted to talk about impeachment this time .
The meeting was a classic example of how hard it is for members of Congress — or any politicians , for that matter — to accurately gauge public opinion .
National polls may not reflect the feelings of a particular state or district .
Traditional town hall meetings such as Sestak ’s , dozens of which were held in congressional districts across the country once again this August recess , are sometimes stacked by activist groups on a favorite issue or attended by the same 20 people each time .
Phone calls , letters and e-mails can be generated in bulk by special interests .
So what can lawmakers do when many of the usual methods of measuring public opinion are broken ?
One answer that is quickly gaining popularity among members of Congress from both parties is to use Internet technology to call thousands of constituents and have a massive conference call with people they might never hear from otherwise .
These “ telephone town halls ”  are a relatively recent development , since the technology to call so many people at once , as opposed to advertising a call - in number and hoping people will use it , has become widespread in only the past two years .
Think of it as a radio talk show where the host calls the listeners , or as a twist on “ robocalls , ”  the automated election - year messages on which the technology is based .
In this case , however , there is a live person on the line , and the listener has a chance to talk back .
The calls allow constituents to vent about hot - button subjects such as immigration ; grill lawmakers about local issues such as traffic congestion or property taxes ; share personal stories of struggles with medical bills or unemployment ; or simply ask what Congress plans to do about such issues as college costs or veterans ’ health care .
The technology allows lawmakers a bit more control over the discussion than they might have in a traditional town hall .
A computer monitor displays how many callers are waiting to speak and summarizes the topics of their questions , so the politician can decide whether to spend time on the hottest topic of the moment or mix up the issues to get more of a variety .
“ Because they ’re random and they reach more people , I think they give you a better feel for the district and they give more people a chance to ask questions , ”  said Republican Rep .
Dan Lungren of central California , who was one of the first members of Congress to try the calls .
“ You can get a better feel for the intensity of an issue , and you can get an early alarm about issues that may not get written up a lot in the press but are becoming more important in your district . ” 
Indeed , some lawmakers look for patterns of questions and pick up on emerging problems that they might have missed through other methods .
Rep. J. Randy Forbes , a Republican from southeastern Virginia , noticed that several senior citizens who participated in his telephone town hall meetings reported their private medical insurance policies had been canceled after they missed one premium payment , and they were n’t allowed to reinstate the coverage even if they ’d had it for most of their lives .
Forbes said his staff has solved their problems case by case , but he also is trying to persuade insurance companies to change their policies , and he says he may propose legislation if the negotiations do n’t work .
“ That ’s something we never would have picked up in a letter , and we certainly would n’t have heard about it in a town hall meeting , ”  he said .
“ ˜Completely Different Universe ’
The lawmakers who have tried the technology , which is catching on in the House but not yet in the Senate , think it ’s a useful source of information to double - check what they find out through the more traditional methods of gauging public opinion : letters and e-mail , talking to people in grocery stores , and appearances at Rotary clubs and other community events .
They say the technology has the potential to offer a less - skewed picture of their constituencies ’ views , thanks to the sheer number of constituents they can reach — often thousands in one phone call — and the fact that they ’re more likely to reach people who are interested in politics but do n’t have the time or ability to participate in the same way that activists do .
“ It ’s a completely different universe of people than you would get otherwise , ”  said Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner , who at one point during a telephone town hall meeting in August had 3,000 New Yorkers on the line .
“ The primary objective is to engage people who have largely checked out . ” 
Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn , whose district in western Tennessee is almost 200 miles long , spent nearly an hour fielding questions about immigration in a conference call the week after Labor Day and said the calls reach enough people to give her a credible picture of what issues are rising in importance for her constituents .
“ It tells you what is resonating , what people are concerned about , ”  she said .
The calls get broad audiences because they ’re capable of reaching thousands of households , even allowing for hang - ups and answering machines .
When House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland conducted a telephone town hall on May 1 , his vendor dialed nearly 40,000 phone numbers .
Only about 5,500 of the households , or 14 percent , answered the phone ; roughly 2,000 agreed to take part in the call , and an average of 700 callers stayed on the line throughout the course of the discussion .
But that ’s far more than most lawmakers say they could ever get to attend an in - person town hall .
The trade off , though , is a loss of personal contact .
“ I do n’t feel it ’s the same , ”  Sestak said .
“ I like the fact that I ’m getting out to a place where people can come and see me . ” 
Even political scientists , who have criticized public officials for being too distant from the public and too reliant on the views of wealthy contributors , and political activists say the usefulness of the telephone town hall only goes so far .
Electronic meetings are “ still an unrepresentative sample of politically interested people who participate , but probably more representative of the active electorate than the more usual sources ”  of information , said Morris P. Fiorina , a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of political science at Stanford University .
Democratic pollster Jeremy Rosner , who finished his doctoral dissertation this spring on how members of Congress measure public opinion on national security issues , said telephone town halls can be a useful tool to reach more people — as long as members do n’t use them as an excuse to avoid eye contact with their constituents .
“ You ’re just sitting in your office , so you do n’t have the randomness of running into someone in the hall , ”  he said .
“ The smarter members realize that , and they ’re taking steps to make sure the new technologies do n’t cut down on their contact with people face - to - face . ” 
Going “ ˜Ballistic ’
The issues at the top of national opinion polls dominate telephone town meetings as well .
Listening to the pulse of calls that both Democrats and Republicans receive on immigration — almost always hostile to illegal immigrants , rarely focused on the debate about giving them a path to citizenship — makes it easy to understand why legislation to revamp federal policy stalled this year .
Blackburn , for example , touched a nerve among her reliably Republican constituents when she opened her conference call by describing a bill she planned to introduce that would crack down on illegal immigrants with criminal records .
The rest of the session was dominated by constituent frustration about the current system : jobs lost to illegal workers , troubles in the schools and Congress ’ inability to agree on solutions .
“ It just makes me absolutely ballistic , ”  one woman said , when she calls a government agency and has to press “ 1 ”  for English .
“ Are these Mexicans not going to be happy until we rewrite our Constitution in Spanish ? ” 
Blackburn listened sympathetically to each call , then told the audience that her legislation was one answer to most of their problems .
Weiner ’s telephone audience was more liberal — not surprising given the reliably Democratic nature of the parts of Brooklyn and Queens he represents .
Callers asked about corporations that allegedly profit from the Iraq War and about the lower cost of prescription drugs in Canada .
But even he faced demands for Congress to do more to deport illegal immigrants .
One caller noted that an illegal immigrant from Peru was one of those charged last month in the execution - style slaying of three college students in Newark .
The other national issue that tends to dominate the calls , not surprisingly , is the war .
Unlike immigration , though , there is no clear pattern to the kinds of questions lawmakers get , so they draw different conclusions .
Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren , who represents most of San Jose , a Democratic bastion , said the war was the top issue in her August telephone town hall meeting and most of the callers wanted a total withdrawal of U.S. troops .
But Lungren , who represents solidly Republican Sacramento suburbs , said he found that “ the temperature on the war was much higher six months ago , ”  suggesting that “ people are taking note of some of the changes on the battlefield , and now they just want to know , what do we do now ? ” 
But Republican David Dreier , who holds monthly telephone town hall meetings for his constituents in the northeastern Los Angeles suburbs , said no one participating in the last session , held the same night as the Blackburn call , brought up either Iraq or immigration .
Often , callers focus on issues that affect them more directly .
In May , for example , Hoyer fielded questions about Washington - area traffic congestion and related topics , such as encouraging employers to offer telecommuting as a partial solution .
Iraq never even came up .
Republican Frank R. Wolf , who represents Washington ’s Northern Virginia suburbs , says that while Iraq and immigration tend to dominate his telephone town halls , congestion ranks a close third .
One of Blackburn ’s exchanges was a vivid illustration of how random constituent concerns can appear .
A caller complained that a 1986 law requiring emergency rooms to treat those in dire need , even if they lack medical insurance , has transformed the ER where she works into “ a walk - in clinic ”  for the poor .
She even cited the law ’s formal name : the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act .
Revisiting the law is far from the front burner in Congress right now , but Blackburn promised to take a look at the issue from her seat on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health .
Growing Competition
So far , few senators have tried the telephone town halls , and there has n’t been a big push from the leadership of either party to do so , possibly because anyone who represents an entire state would have too many calls to make .
One senator who has tried , Republican Lindsey Graham , addressed that problem by holding sessions for different sections of South Carolina .
Since 2005 , the telephone town halls have been an increasingly competitive business for the vendors who offer them , including Tele Town Hall of Washington , iConstituent of Los Angeles and The Franking Group of Salt Lake City .
Each charges from $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 , on average , to stage a town hall , depending on the number of calls made .
Rosner , the Democratic pollster , said lawmakers he interviewed for his dissertation who had the best sense of their constituents ’ views were the ones who used a variety of techniques — not just traditional or telephone town halls , but random conversations at grocery stores , talks with well - connected people such as city council members or even barbers , and casual strolls through their own neighborhoods .
And that ’s how most lawmakers see the telephone town halls : as one more barometer of public opinion , a promising method for reaching people who are often tuned out of politics .
“ It ’s a wonderful supplement , ”  said Blackburn .
“ It ’s another tool in the toolbox . ” 

After Downing Street Post
DBエンジニアの皆さん、こんにちは。そろそろ刊行から2ヶ月が過ぎようとしていますが、『SQLパズル 第2版』は読み進んでいますか？
ナニ、難しくて挫折しそう？ そろそろ古本屋に売っぱらおうと考えている？
フフフフフ、そうですかそうですか。難儀していますか。大丈夫、そんな嘆き節のあなたに朗報です。このたび、私の初めての自著が出版される運びとなったのです。はい拍手！
特に嬉しくなくてもここは拍手しておきましょう。「セルコは難しくてついていけないよー」とねをあげる皆さんを一人も取りこぼさずきっちり救済して差し上げようという優しさ満点の企画。この馬の骨を再び起用する豪胆な出版社は、もちろん翔泳社。
書名は『達人に学 ぶ SQL徹底指南書』（仮）、来年の2月6日に刊行の予定です。自分で自分のことを達人と呼んでしまうずうずうしさは、ご祝儀と思って免じてつかあさい（私が自分で考えたんじゃないよ。反対はしなかったけど）。
本書は、実践と基礎の両面からSQLという言語の強力さをこれでもかとアピールしつつ、初級から中級への皆さんのステップアップを支援することを目的にしています。SQL関連の書籍は、初級者向けは豊富にあるのですが、「そこから先」へつながる本が少ないので、何とかその溝を架橋する本を用意したかった。入門書を読んだらもうセルコやデイトしか読む本がない、という「二極化」状況が教育上決してよろしくないことは、誰の目にも明らかです（最近はオライリーががんばってくれているけど、やっぱりちょっと「中の上」向けだし）。
言ってみれば今の日本のDBエンジニアは、バイエルの次にいきなりショパンを弾けと強要されているようなものです。本当はもっと段階的にステップアップできた方が望ましいに決まってます。だから私は最初『ステップアップSQL講座』という書名を考えていたのですが、「インパクトが薄い」ということでこれは却下。
内容は大きく3部だてとなっていますが、第1部は主にCodeZineに連載していた記事に加筆・修正を加えたもので、ケーススタディの形式をとっています（こちらが「実践」）。対して第2部は「原理」や「基礎」を解説したエッセイ集で、書き下ろしが多いのですが、書いていて「ああ、自分はやっぱりこういうの好きだなー」ということを再認識した楽しいテキスト。1部は、具体的なコードを中心に話を進めるし、一度完成形として出したテキストの修正という性格も手伝って、割と慎重にコリコリと作業をしていたのですが、その反動で2部を書いているときは弾けてしまい、結構大胆なことも書いてしまった。多くの方々にとって有用なのは間違いなく1部だし、ボリュームも倍以上違うのですが、もし2部を読んで「おもしれーこと言うな、こいつ」と感じていただいた方は、きっと私とも波長があうはず。
書籍を出せるなんて、人生に二度とあるか分からない機会なので、この数年間ためてきた貯金を全て吐き出した形です（でもそうしたら吐き出しすぎて、軽く当初の分量をオーバーして、結局、泣く泣く削ったテーマも多く出た。入れ子集合モデルの話などはまるまるカット。面白いんだけど、背に腹はかえられません）。
というわけで、話が長くなりましたが、要は『SQLパズル』を古本屋に持ち込むのはまだ早い、ということです。私の本を読んでからでも遅くない。まあ期待して待っていてください。
データベースとSQLが面白くないなどと、もう誰に言わせるものですか。

Early reports suggest that about 40 shots were fired when soldiers crossed into the demilitarised zone .
Meanwhile , South Korea has welcomed a statement by the United Nations Security Council urging North Korea to abandon plans to test a nuclear weapon .
Seoul joined in calling on the North to return to six - party talks .
Some observers have warned that a nuclear test could come as early as this weekend .
After intruding some 30 metres ( yards ) , the Northern troops returned to their side of the military demarcation line , it added .
One Southern military source , speaking anonymously to The Associated Press , said it was unclear whether the intrusion was " intentional or whether it was to catch fish " .
' No pre-conditions '
In its statement , the Security Council warned of unspecified action against North Korea if it went ahead with a test explosion .

A nuclear test would " jeopardise peace , stability and security in the region and beyond " and , in the event of a test , the Security Council would " act consistent with its responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations " .
South Korea said it supported and welcomed the " UN Security Council 's clear and strict position " against the threatened test .
" North Korea must scrap its plan for a nuclear test and return to the six - party talks immediately and without any pre-conditions , " its foreign ministry said .
The BBC's Charles Scanlon reports from Seoul that a nuclear test could raise regional tension and even spark an arms race , as well as affecting the South 's policy of reconciliation .
South Korea is sending its top delegate to the six - party negotiations , Chun Yung - Woo , to Beijing on Monday for talks with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei .
North Korea has been boycotting the six - party talks - which involve the two Koreas , the USA , China , Russia and Japan - in protest at US sanctions against it .
Japanese Vice - Foreign Minister Shotaro Yachi told Japanese TV after talks with US officials in Washington that it was possible a test could come this weekend .
" Based on developments so far , it would be best to view a test as possible this weekend , " he told Japan 's Asahi TV channel .
The Federation of Small Businesses ' annual Index of Wealth compared 10 countries on economic performance , employment rates , health and education .
Scotland 's life expectancy rate was a major factor in it coming bottom .
FSB Scotland said the new SNP government had its work cut out to improve the nation , but ministers said Scotland " can and will do better " .
Scotland also fell by one place , to 17th , in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 's table of the world 's 24 most developed countries .
We are already far down the table of comparator countries , and on every count we are travelling in the wrong direction
Andy Willox
FSB Scotland policy convener
The FSB Scotland index examined countries with fewer than nine million people , including Norway , Iceland and the Republic of Ireland .
The report was written by John McLaren , honorary research fellow at the University of Glasgow .
He said Scotland had fallen one place from ninth after the previous bottom country , Austria , improved its employment rate .
" The reason why Scotland is stuck at the bottom of the pile is largely due to our poor health and our low life expectancy , " he said .
Figures released last year by the Office for National Statistics said Scotland had the lowest life expectancy in the UK for both men and women .
' Fairly low '
The figures were 74.2 for men and 79.3 for women , compared to the UK average of 76.6 and 81 years .
Other statistics released by the Registrar General for Scotland last year showed that life expectancy was rising , but that the gap between rich and poor was widening .
However , Mr McLaren added that even if health was taken out of the equation Scotland would still be " fairly low " on the table , in about fifth or sixth place .
FSB Scotland policy convener Andy Willox said : " The index clearly shows that , on these indicators , Scotland is the worst small country in western Europe , and requires urgent action to improve both our life chances and life expectancy .
There are calls for health to be put at the heart of decision - making
" Coming as it does so soon after the election of an SNP government , this year 's index shows the new First Minister Alex Salmond will have his work cut out for him if he is to match reality with his aspiration of making Scotland healthier , wealthier and fairer . "
Despite being above average on three of the four indicators , life expectancy in Scotland remains well below the OECD average .
" We are already far down the table of comparator countries , and on every count we are travelling in the wrong direction , " Mr Willox added .
" Health , education , the employment rate and economic performance are all interlinked .
" Improvements in health or education should help businesses recruit and retain healthy and highly skilled staff , thus boosting productivity and ultimately economic growth . "
' More dynamic '
The index showed Glasgow City is the worst performing local authority area in Scotland , with the poorest record in three of the four indicators : mortality , education and employment
Mr Willox added : " That Glasgow is the worst performing part of Scotland on all but one of the indicators is deeply troubling . "
Finance Secretary John Swinney said he was not surprised by the report 's conclusions .
" This reflects some of the arguments we have put forward for a very long time that Scotland is under - performing , " he said .
We have made it very clear that our purpose is to increase sustainable economic growth in Scotland
John Swinney
Finance Secretary
" This directly challenges some of the rhetoric from the previous government ... everything in the garden is far from rosy in Scotland .
" This report is an indication of the scale of the challenge that the government faces . "
He said that transforming economic growth would address a number of other problems highlighted in the report .
" We have made it very clear that our purpose is to increase susrtainable economic growth in Scotland . "
The BMA wants the Scottish Executive to introduce health impact assessments for all government policies .
Living in poverty
Dr Peter Terry , chairman of the BMA in Scotland , said health needed to be put at the heart of decision - making .
" Our public health is affected by a whole range of factors in society , " he said .
" It is widely known that people living in poverty or those from disadvantaged communities are more likely to experience poor health . "
" Health is improving , although the improvement is greater in more affluent areas . "
ACCURACY
Although the hostages were freed less than an hour after Mr. Reagan was sworn in as president , the complex deal that led to their release was brokered by President Jimmy Carter ’s administration .
The hostages were released because the United States agreed to return nearly $ 8 billion in frozen assets to Iran , most of which Iran used to pay off foreign creditors .
Some suggest that the Iranians continued to hold the hostages until Mr. Reagan was sworn in as a final affront to Mr. Carter ; others say that there were logistical reasons for the delay .
And while the advertisement seems to invoke Mr. Reagan as an example of standing up to terrorists , some members of his administration later went on to sell arms to Iran as ransom for hostages held in Lebanon , and to divert the profits to rebels fighting the Marxists in Nicaragua , contrary to official government policy .
SCORECARD
With this commercial , Mr. Giuliani , who is now competing heavily in New Hampshire , is bringing the conversation around to terrorism , a signature issue for a man who was brought to national prominence by the Sept. 11 attacks .
At the same time , he is casting his peace - through - strength vision of foreign policy as a continuation of the policies of President Reagan , whom he often invokes on the trail .
In invoking the Iranian hostage crisis , he may be trying to call the current Iranian threat , which he speaks about frequently , to mind .
But Mr. Giuliani ’s muscular approach toward Iran may have been complicated by Monday ’s release of a National Intelligence Estimate that said Iran had halted its covert program to develop nuclear weapons four years ago .
MICHAEL COOPER
US agency OKs slashing of health benefits for over - 65 retirees
By Bill Van Auken
28 December 2007
Using the slow period between Christmas and New Year ’s as cover , the US federal agency charged with enforcing laws against discrimination issued a controversial new ruling that allows employer and union - run health - care plans to reduce costs by slashing or totally eliminating benefits for retirees once they turn 65 .
The ruling by the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission affects some 10 million American retirees who rely on health plans sponsored by their former employers .
It marks a significant step in further shifting the burden imposed by spiraling health - care costs from the corporations to working people .
In reporting the ruling , the New York Times Thursday cited a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that premiums for employer - run health insurance have risen by 78 percent since 2001 .
Wednesday ’s announcement of the new ruling follows a lengthy court battle over the issue .
In 2000 , the US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia held that the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment
Act barred employers from spending less on health benefits for older retirees than for younger ones .
It has long been common practice for employer - run health plans to factor in benefits available to those over 65 under Medicare , often providing supplemental benefits to make up for costs not covered by this government - run program .
The 2000 ruling would have compelled health care plan administrators to demonstrate that the benefits — taking Medicare into account — were equal for those over and under 65 .
In 2004 , after the EEOC first attempted to issue a ruling that exempted employer - run retiree health plans from the age discrimination act , AARP ( American Association for Retired People ) took the agency to court , charging that the action flouted the anti-discrimination law .
The same appeals court reversed the thrust of its earlier decision , ruling last June that the EEOC could issue an exemption on the grounds that a strict reading of the age discrimination act would run counter to “ public interest . ”
“ We recognize with some dismay that the proposed exemption may allow employers to reduce health benefits to retirees over the age of 65 while maintaining greater benefits for younger retirees , ” the court declared , but nonetheless found that the exemption represented a “ proper exercise ” of the EEOC ’s authority .
EEOC Chairwoman Naomi Earp issued a statement in defense of the agency ’s ruling , claiming that by opening the door to the slashing of retiree benefits , the EEOC was protecting retirees .
“ Implementation of this rule is welcome news for America ’s retirees , whether young or old , ” she said .
“ By this action , the EEOC seeks to preserve and protect employer - provided retiree health benefits , which are increasingly less available and less generous . ”
The logic underlying this Orwellian statement is that , without the exemption , employers would scrap retiree health benefits altogether .
As it is today , only one out of every three large US companies — and one out of ten small ones — provide such benefits .
This compares to about 70 percent of US companies offering such benefits in the 1980s .
“ Employers are not legally obligated to provide retiree health benefits , and many do not , ” the EEOC noted .
Its new rule states that retirees ’ health benefits may be “ altered , reduced or eliminated ” once they are eligible for Medicare .
The agency continued : “ In order to ensure that all retirees have access to some health care coverage , the ADEA will not prohibit employers and unions from providing retiree health coverage only to those retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare .
They also may supplement a retiree ’s Medicare coverage without having to demonstrate that the coverage is identical to that of non-Medicare eligible retirees . ”
In other words , the ruling provides explicit approval for the creation of two - tier retiree health plans in which older retirees would be forced to accept inferior benefits .
AARP denounced the action .
“ This rule gives employers free rein to use age as a basis for reducing or eliminating health - care benefits for retirees 65 and older , ” the group ’s lawyer , Christopher Mackaronis , told the Times .
“ Ten million people could be affected — adversely affected — by the rule . ”
The EEOC statement on the ruling repeatedly cited the support for the agency ’s reactionary measure from “ labor unions . ”
The unions , the agency said , had expressed the opinion that any attempt to enforce the age discrimination act would only provide “ an additional incentive to reduce or eliminate employer - sponsored retiree health benefits . ”
Gerald Shea , assistant to AFL - CIO President John Sweeney , told the Times : “ Given the enormous cost pressures on employer - sponsored health benefits , we support the flexibility reflected in the rule as a way to maximize our ability to maintain comprehensive coverage for active and retired workers . ”
Aside from the American labor bureaucracy ’s concern about providing US corporations the “ flexibility ” to boost profits by slashing the benefits of retired workers , the unions have a far more immediate interest in the new ruling .
Most private sector unions run the health plans covering retirees , and therefore the bureaucracy has a direct — and often thoroughly corrupt — stake in the “ flexibility ” provided by the EEOC decision .
These union - run health insurance funds provide the union officialdom with the ability to hand out patronage jobs to friends and relatives , obtain second careers for themselves and receive perks and , not infrequently , direct kickbacks from health - care providers .
The latest union to join this racket is the United Auto Workers .
As a result of concessions agreements negotiated with the Big Three US automakers earlier this year , the UAW has become the largest provider of health - care benefits in America , outside of the US government .
Under the sellout contracts with GM , Chrysler and Ford , the UAW has been given control over an under - funded health - care trust known as the Voluntary Employees ’ Beneficiary Association ( VEBA ) .
With the Big Three having provided funding that accounts for barely half of their health - care liabilities — and thereby writing off tens of billions in obligations — the UAW has essentially been handed a huge pile of cash — an estimated $ 54.4 billion — along with the job of sharply slashing benefits .
The EEOC ruling provides the UAW , as well as other unions , with another instrument for cutting benefits and jacking up costs for the workers on second - rate health - care plans , while boosting the already considerable income of the bureaucrats and their associates .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British private security company is being sued in the United States over the death of a U.S. soldier hit by one of its convoys in Iraq , according to court documents .

The case , believed to be the first of its kind , comes six weeks after Iraq accused the U.S. security company Blackwater of using excessive force in an incident where 17 Iraqis were shot dead in Baghdad .
The case against Erinys , filed in a court in Houston , Texas , on Wednesday and also in London , was brought by the Perry Monroe , father of Christopher Monroe , a U.S. soldier who was struck by an Erinys vehicle while on duty in southern Iraq in October 2005 .
The lawsuit accuses the Erinys convoy of ignoring warnings and traveling at excessive speed after dark without lights fully on , leading to an accident in which Monroe was hit , suffering severe injuries that led to his death .
“ Even though warned that the remainder of the U.S. convoy was ahead , the Erinys PSD team employee with reckless disregard accelerated to a high rate of speed and struck Christopher with his armored Suburban , tearing off his right leg .
“ Mr. Monroe has been compelled to file this lawsuit to require the Erinys PSD team to account for its action that led to the death of his 19 - year - old son , ” reads the suit , which also seeks unspecified damages .
Erinys , which provided security to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the time of the incident , denied any wrongdoing .
“ This was nothing but a very , very tragic accident , ” its chairman Jonathan Garratt told Reuters in London on Friday .
“ There was a full and very thorough investigation by the U.S. military into the case at the time , and both Erinys and its employees were fully exonerated . ”
The case is the latest to shine a critical light on the work of the two dozen or so private security companies operating in Iraq , some of which have earned hundreds of millions of dollars from contracts awarded by the U.S. government .
While Blackwater , which the Iraqi government wants to ban from Iraq , has received the most high - profile criticism , other companies have also been accused of using excessive force or of having little regard for Iraqi civilians .
The case filed in Houston is the first time that a private security company has been accused of negligence in the case of the death of a U.S. soldier , lawyers said .
Asked why the suit was being brought now , Tobias Cole , the lawyer who filed it , denied it had been motivated by the Blackwater incident .
“ There ’s not necessarily some strategic timing to this lawsuit , ” he said .
“ The family wanted answers and under Texas law you only have a certain amount of time to seek those answers . ”
Garratt said he believed the case had been filed within one day of the expiry of the statute of limitations .
The off - shore island is meant to provide extra land for housing and offer coastal protection to the low - lying nation .
The Dutch government has asked a governmental advisory body , the Innovative Platform ( IP ) , to carry out research into the feasibility of the proposal .
IP officials regard it as a good opportunity to showcase the country 's expertise in hydro - engineering and water management .
The Dutch have been battling against the sea and the threat of floods for centuries and their skills are of world renown .
But up to now , Dutch contractors have only been commissioned to build grandiose projects overseas , in countries like Dubai with its famous Palm Islands .
Now , it could become a reality closer to home .
And what could be more Dutch than the image of a tulip ?
Proposal for tulip - shaped island sparks debate
One of the draft designs envisages building wind turbines on the island
Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende , the chairman of IP , praised the body 's work in the water sector .
" We are good at hydraulic engineering and we should hold on to this leadership position , " he said .
" The tulip island has got the discussion going and has mobilized creative forces .
That is just how it should be if we want to innovate . "
The project was floated by Joop Atsma , a member of Balkenende 's center - right Christian Democratic Appeal party ( CDA ) .
Atsma envisages an island around 50,000 to 100,000 hectares in area situated off the coast of the Randstad .
This is the country 's most populous area and includes the Netherlands ' four largest cities : Amsterdam , Rotterdam , The Hague and Utrecht .
A CDA spokeswoman said the research should show if the proposal is affordable .
She added that the price of land in the area had risen to such heights that creating an island could bring some relief to the real estate market .
" It could be a solution to the lack of space we have in the Netherlands , " she said .
" In addition , it could act as a buffer , improving coastal protection . "
Worries about the impact of an island
Rivers are set to become an increasing threat in the future
But the idea has triggered mixed reactions .
Environmental groups and some hydro - engineering firms believe other solutions might be cheaper , more effective and have less impact on the landscape .
One thing that 's clear is that more action is needed to protect the Dutch from the effects of global warming .
Experts from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that the sea will rise by anything between 9 and 88 centimeters ( 3.5 to 35 inches ) by the end of the 21st century .
Coastal surges are set to become an increasing threat to life and property in years to come .
Holland already has one of the world 's most ambitious flood defense systems , which has been described by some as the eighth wonder of the world .
Its construction was prompted by the flooding tragedy of 1953 , in which more than 1,800 people lost their lives and tens of thousands of people had to be evacuated .
Consisting of dams , sluices , locks , dikes and storm surge barriers , the Delta Works block the estuary mouths of a number of major rivers in the southwest of Holland and controls the entry of water into those rivers that have to remain navigable .
Recent studies have , however , shown that defenses on eight stretches of the coast are too weak .
The government is planning to rectify this matter by 2015 and has allocated 741 million euros ( $ 1 billion ) to this end .
Ellen Verkoelen , director of the Environmental Federation of Southern Holland , said she believes that an artificial island does not really address this problem .
She said she thinks it is more about creating additional space for real estate .
Extending dunes and beaches is another option
Holland 's system of sea and river dikes date from medieval times
Verkoelen said she favors extending the coastline with sand .
Her organization has been working with the government on the problem for two years and is about to carry out a pilot scheme to test the idea .
" Five kilometers ( 3.1 miles ) more beach and dunes would give more safety and recreation , " she said .
" It 's also the least expensive way of dealing with the problem .
Twenty to 50 years from now we would have a lot of new coast . "
" The sea level change can be stopped in this way , but not with the island , " she added .
" It would have to be an island as big as Holland .
This is a marketing strategy .
It 's the same as in Dubai . "
The extension of dunes and beaches is also an idea that could be copied in less wealthy countries with similar problems unlike the costly island project .
A similar solution is supported by the North Sea Foundation , an environmental group .
Their spokesman , Jaroan Dagevos , said he is worried about the visual , environmental and even psychological impact of the proposed island , which he said would stretch along about a fifth of the coastline .
" Holland is one of the most crowded countries in the world and if you want to enjoy some open space , you go to the sea , " he said .
" We do n't have many spaces like that .
This is one of the last big nature areas in this region .
" We have to do more to keep the coast as it is , " he added .
" An island is not a solution .
The whole view of the North Sea will disappear and this will upset streaming patterns of larvae and fish . "
Trend towards cheap solutions
God made the world and the Dutch made the Netherlands is a common saying in Holland
Even the marine contractors responsible for building Dubai's Palm Islands , Van Oord , expressed their backing for a cheaper solution .
" I think it 's more realistic to widen the beaches and dunes into the North Sea , " said Van Oord 's spokesman , Bert Groothuizen .
" It 's not very revolutionary .
The idea has been about for the last 30 years .
But it 's a very economical option . "
The trend generally appears to be towards less interventionist schemes .
" We are moving away from engineering solutions and towards building with nature , " he said .
Mark van Zanten , of the maritime consultancy firm Royal Haskoning , took a more positive approach towards the proposed island .
He said it would have the advantage of being both a protective measure and an area for potential development .
" We can design it so it will serve both purposes , " he said .
" If we built it high enough , it will probably be one of the safest places in the Netherlands . "
But he did not rule out other coastal protection options .
" We are looking into the possibility of building an artificial reef made of sand and stones that would protect the coast from heavy storms , " he said .
Of course , the Netherlands -- once described by the Dutch government as the " drain of Europe " -- does not just face a threat from the sea .
Thanks to climate change , the risk of flooding inland is also growing .
The Dutch are now leading the way in the design of floating homes .
The Technical University in Delft is working on a project that even investigates the possibility of building an entire floating city .
James D. Watson , who shared the 1962 Nobel prize for deciphering the double - helix of DNA , apologized “ unreservedly ” yesterday for comments reported this week suggesting that black people , over all , are not as intelligent as whites .
In an interview published Sunday in The Times of London , Dr. Watson is quoted as saying that while “ there are many people of color who are very talented , ” he is “ inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa . ”
“ All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours — whereas all the testing says not really , ” the newspaper quoted him as saying .
In a statement given to The Associated Press yesterday , Dr. Watson said , “ I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said .
There is no scientific basis for such a belief . ”
CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - A tiny oil - eating bug that lives deep underground may allow the world ’s oil industry to unlock energy trapped in trillions of barrels of heavy crude , which is costly and dirty to produce using today ’s methods .
British , Canadian and Norwegian researchers have shown how microbes in oil reservoirs break down crude and release methane gas , a discovery that could spur much more environmentally friendly energy production as resources get more scarce .
The trick now will be to pump up the organisms with the equivalent of steroids so they can perform their task in 10 years instead of 10 million , said University of Calgary geologist Steve Larter , who led the team ’s Canadian contingent .
The study is published in the science journal Nature .
The result : the ability to produce natural gas from oil reservoirs , rather than burning it from conventional sources to aid production of gooey heavy crude .
“ If it can be done economically , that ’s a game - changer , because the average heavy oil recovery worldwide is 17 percent , ” Larter said .
“ If you can suddenly liberate a tiny additional fraction of that as methane rather than as heavy oil , with all of its environmental and cost footprint , then it ’s a huge thing . ”
The process of “ feeding ” the microbes nutrients works in the laboratory , but it is not known yet if it can be done over the expanse of an oil field , he said .
Still , some major oil companies , faced with spiraling costs and environmental headaches as they try to coax more of the poorer quality , cheaper crude from the ground , are taking notice , Larter said .
He declined to name them .
Over the years , the industry has come close to exhausting reserves of easy - to - find and valuable light oil , which needs the least refining to turn it into gasoline and other fuels .
Now , companies are faced with having to pump , or even mine , an estimated 6 trillion barrels of thick heavy oil and oil sands crude , which is far more costly and ecologically damaging to produce but sells for a discount in the market .
It is conceivable that converting 20 percent of a giant , billion - barrel heavy oil field could yield one trillion cubic feet of methane , which would rival some of the largest recent conventional gas finds in size , Larter said .
The team , which includes petroleum geologists , microbiologists and organic geochemists from the University of Newcastle in England and Norway ’s Statoil Hydro ASA , is aiming for field tests within the next year .
The western Canadian province of Alberta , with its vast deposits of heavy oil and oil sands , is a prime target .
Scientists have known for decades about the microbes in oil reservoirs , and some researchers have believed biodegradation was caused by aerobic bacteria , which use oxygen .
But the team found anaerobic bacteria -- those that do not use oxygen -- actually cause fermentation in the oil pool .
The scientists also discovered a step midway through the biodegradation process , in which a separate family of microbes produces carbon dioxide and hydrogen from partly degraded crude , before they turn it into methane .
That may lead to using microbes to capture the CO2 , which is blamed for global warming , and recycling it into methane fuel in a closed - loop energy system , they said .
A person ’s father ( or father figure ) is one of the biggest , if not the biggest , influences in their life .
This influence can be either bad or good , but it ’s almost always there .
If you want to give your kids a headstart on life , if you want to make life easier on them all the way from childhood up to middle age , and sometimes beyond , one of the best ways to do it is to be a dad they can count on .
What does it mean to be a dad you can count on ?
It ’s somewhat subjective , of course , but there are some underlying principles , or pillars , that are consistent .
These pillars , as I ’ve mention in my first and second 7 pillars articles , are underlying supports .
They all work together to support the whole , the being a dad you can count on , while at the same time supporting each other .
That connection between the different pillars means that strengthening any one pillar strengthens them all … but also that weakening , or worse yet removing , any one weakens the rest as well .
So , here are seven pillars of fatherhood :
Loving – No Matter What
The most important thing you can do for your child is to let them know , through your words , your actions , and all other means , that you love them , no matter what .
Let them know that you do n’t just love them when they ’re good , that is n’t their actions that you love , but actually them .
If you do that , they will always have a place to fall back to if they get lost , a place to get their bearings and regain their strength before going back out into the world .
Attention
As with any relationship , your relationship with your kids requires you to devote your attention to them .
You should regularly have time with each of your children that is exclusively theirs … no other kids , no wife , just them and you , so that they can have your full attention .
This one on one time goes an amazingly long way to making them understand that part of you belongs to them , that they are worthy of your time all on their own , and that if they need your attention , they can get it … definitely part of being able to be counted on .
Respect Treating your children with respect can make a huge difference in their strength of character , in their ability to be their own person .
One of the clearest ways to show them that you respect them is to treat them as much like adults as they can handle … do n’t talk down to them , listen when they speak , stop and take time for them when they request your attention , etc .
Treating them as an adult obviously has to be tempered by their age and maturity … but if you consistently treat them as an adult , their “ maturity age ” will quite likely be higher than their actual age .
This does n’t mean expect them to be adults … that will lead you to being more harsh than you need to be .
It means give them the opportunity to act as adults …
the more opportunities you give them , the more likely they are to take them .
Consistency
One of the most important , and one of the most overlooked , aspects of being a father is consistency .
Consistency is how children build up a strong foundation for their lives … if you are unpredictable , delivering harsh punishments for a minor infraction one time , and little or no punishment for something major another time ( without special circumstances ) , if you give them loads of love and attention one moment and turn on them angrily the next , it throws their life into chaos .
If , on the other hand , you are consistent , with the same punishment nearly always given ( everyone needs a break sometimes ) for the same breaking of a rule , reliably loving and supportive , then you provide them a safe base that they can count on , that they can return to when the rest of life gets chaotic .
That allows them to build much stronger foundations for themselves , making their life easier for , well , the rest of their life .
Support
One of the biggest things you can do for your children is to stand up for them .
When someone does something wrong to them , confront that person and tell them it was wrong .
When they stand up for themselves , assuming they are not in the wrong , back them up .
Let them know that they can count on you for support when they need it … it reinforces their own strength and sense of worth .
Never underestimate the impact of having someone stand up for you … especially someone that is an authority figure to you .
Teaching
An essential part of being a good father is teaching your children from your own experience , hopefully saving them from going through some of the painful lessons you had to go through .
This can include things like teaching them what is important in life and what is n’t , how to do the things they ’ll need to do as an adult ( basic finances , for example ) , or even just certain actiivities that sound a lot better than they actually are … including any scars those activies may have left .
Speaking of teaching your kids what is important and what is n’t , the best way to teach them , and the way they will learn from the most regardless of what comes out of your mouth , is by your own actions …
Your actions and what has your attention will always reflect what is really important to you , rather than what you think , or say , is important .
Listening
It is pretty easy as a parent to slip into a habit of not really listening to your kids .
That is , you hear what they say , but you run it through your own filter of what ’s important , rather than listening to what is important to them , and addressing it .
It ’s easy to dismiss things that you have learned along the way are n’t really important and forget that at one point those things were front and center in your life .
Just because something is unimportant to you now , or to you in general , does n’t mean it ’s unimportant … and you need to listen to your kids and learn what is important to them .
These seven things are all related , and all feed on each other .
If one falls , it can lead to the quick crumbling of another , and then another , in a chain reaction .
On the other hand , strengthening one can easily improve all six of the others , and lead to you improving your father - child relationship considerably .
You can focus on any one of these and improve your relationship , as long as you do n’t totally neglect any of the others .
Being a dad that your kid can count on is one of the best things you can do for them … it will help them greatly throughout their entire life , giving them at least one place that theyknow is safe , one person they know will be there when they need them .
That anchor ( ironically ) can sometimes be the only thing that keeps you afloat .
When ever we get together with friends to slaughter these bundles of vegitation , the subject of how different what we are doing is from what you see in the movies comes up .
One of my far too numerous hobbies is " primitive archery " .
My wife and I own replicas of medieval English longbows , and we occasionally take them out and shoot our replica arrows ( some with lovely vicious " bodkin " and " broadhead " points ) at evil straw bales that really need killing .
Hollywood loves to have groups of archers draw their bows to full span , and then have them hold their bows drawn while waiting many suspenseful moments for their leader to drop his sword to signal the deadly storm to follow .
( Think " Lord of the Rings " )
Here 's the problem with that :
In choosing a longbow , you should pick one that is hard to pull .
Not back - breaking hard , but it needs to give you some real resistance .
This only makes sense .
A bow is only as strong as the archer , but if the archer selects a wimpy bow , then his strength is wasted .
Now , when you are pulling one of these hefty bows , pulling it pointing it and shooting it are n't too tough .
What is tough is holding it at full span .
Unless you are shooting a toy bow , your arms will almost immediately start to quiver and the pain will begin .
Furthermore , your bow does n't like staying at full draw any longer than it has to either , and you could do it some real damage .
The only documentable medieval words of command for archers seem to have been " Knock " and " Streach " .
These make sense , and presuppose that telling an archer to draw his bow is essentially the same as telling him to shoot it .
The problem , of course , is that people think of bows through the lens of hundreds of years of firearm use .
Firearms were fired in volleys , on command .
This was a good idea , since it maximized the trauma of noise , death and injury that guns do so well .
It would not make sense to shoot bows in vollies .
People in the open could n't do much to protect themselves from a musket volley , but if they had shields , and the arrows come in precise vollies , they could just hide during the brief arrow storm , then rush forward - - only to hide again during the next arrow storm ( which they could , of course , see coming ) .
It makes far more sense to shoot bows in a continuous stream , so there never is a time when it is safe to peek out from behind your shield .
My next archery pet peeve is the ubiquitous fire arrow .
The battle at the beginning of " Gladiator " is a fine example of Hollywood 's obsession with fire arrows .
Yes , fire arrows did exist , but they were for very specialized purposes .
To make a fire arrow , you need to put a nasty great glob of pitch on the end of your arrow .
You might also add a bit of fabric to this to keep it compact .
Since arrows are n't , as a general rule , balanced to have a nasty great glob of pitch on the end of them , there is a major drop in aerodynamic efficiency in a fire arrow .
Fire arrows would suffer a serious loss of range and accuracy .
Then , of course , you would need to have immediate access to fire .
There was no automatic pilot light on medieval bows , and if you had lots of archers shooting fire arrows , then they would need small fires burning all along their lines .
This would , of course , seriously limit their ability to move around and still shoot fire arrows .
It would also make it pretty tough to surprise anyone with your sudden fire arrow storm , as the enemy could watch you lighting and carrying around your little fires to well within the range of their own archers .
So , when would you see fire arrows ?
Since they are a big logistical hassle , they would not really be a good idea in a field battle , where archers might have to maneuver quickly to close the range with the enemy or get out of the enemy 's way .
They would make sense in sieges though , where there could be time to deploy pitch pots , firebrands and the like , and cover behind which to do it .
So , when they were used in sieges , what would they be used for ?
Would they be used , in Hollywood fashion , to target people who could then do spectacular man-on - fire stunts as they fall off castle walls ?
Of course not .
If you want to shoot a man , you will shoot him with a simple old non-burning arrow .
Your odds of hitting him are far better , and it 's ever so much less trouble .
People might get in the way of fire arrows , but targeting them deliberately with such a weapon is just dumb .
Fire arrows would , of course , be used primarily to set things on fire .
These things could be thatch roofs , siege towers , and perhaps wooden palisades , though getting the fire hot enough to really ignite big ol ' hunks of wood like you would see in a wall might be a challenge without a bit of additional fuel .
That 's not a really big target set , which would mean that you would n't really see a lot of fire arrows on a medieval battlefield .
I have a few more archery grumbles for Hollywood , but this is enough for now .
Cheers ,
Walter
New Study Shows Islamist Minority Interior Ministry Warns of Radicalization of Muslims
A new study commissioned by Germany 's Interior Ministry warns of a growing threat from the radicalization of Muslims in the country .
Six percent of Muslims in Germany support violence in the name of Islam , the authors write .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Several months ago one of National Review ’s blogs ran posts by contributor W. Thomas Smith , Jr. from Beirut .
Smith described several things — ” a sprawling Hezbollah tent city ” with “ some 200 - plus heavily armed Hezbollah militiamen , ” and “ 4,000 and 5,000 HezB gunmen deployed to the Christian areas ” — that appear not to have existed .
Thomas Edsall has the details here , with more here from David Kenner .
This in itself is no judgment on National Review .
While some publications do better fact - checking than others ( Mother Jones is one of the best , in my experience ) , no one can produce 100 % error - free journalism .
What does matter is how editors react when problems are brought to their attention .
Glenn Greenwald explains what ’s happened to date here .
National Review ’s online editor Kathryn Jean Lopez was alerted to the implausibility of Smith ’s claims six weeks ago by two journalists with experience in Lebanon .
Yet she appears to have acted only when she realized Edsall would be writing about it .
( ADDED CLARIFICATION : Mitchell Prothero , a Beirut photographer , writes here that he contacted National Review “ more than six weeks ago . ”
Harper ’s publishes here an email sent by journalist Chris Allbritton on October 6th calling Smith “ a liar . ”
However , it ’s unclear who at National Review would have received it .
Lopez posts here her version of events , which does not mention Prothero or Allbritton . )
This reminds me of my own experience with Lopez .
In October of last year , she wrote a post about the Johns Hopkins study estimating the number of deaths in Iraq since the invasion as 655,000 .
Lopez printed email from “ A Hill Guy ” reading :
The article below will be a story today , even though it should n’t … Even Human Rights
Watch said the earlier report by these same researchers was “ certainly prone to inflation due to overcounting . ”
This quote was accurate , so far as it went .
Marc Garlasco , a military analyst for Human Rights Watch , said it in a 2004 Washington Post article .
However , since then Garlasco has repeatedly disavowed it ; e.g. , in this Chronicle of Higher Education story :
Mr. Garlasco says now that he had not read the paper at the time and calls his quote in the Post “ really unfortunate . ”
He says he told the reporter , “ I have n’t read it .
I have n’t seen it .
I do n’t know anything about it , so I should n’t comment on it . ”
But , Mr. Garlasco continues , “ like any good journalist , he got me to . ”
Mr. Garlasco says he misunderstood the reporter ’s description of the paper ’s results .
So when I saw Lopez relying on the original Garlasco quote , I sent her a polite email , suggesting she should update the post .
I also pointed out there was a real story here : a Capitol Hill staffer , who presumably was involved in America ’s Iraq policies , did n’t know basic information about the subject .
It was n’t hard to learn , either : out of the top five results in a Google search for “ Garlasco Lancet Iraq ” , one is the original Post story and the other four refer to Garlasco ’s disavowal .
In any case , Lopez never responded to my email and never updated the original post .
As far as I know she ’s never addressed her source ’s mistake anywhere , much less pointed out its significance .
Still , it ’s always best to give people the benefit of the doubt ; perhaps Lopez just missed what I sent her .
I ’ll try her again now , and update this if she ’s willing to say anything further about it .
Nick Breese , a senior security consultant at Auckland - based Security - assessment.com , has come up with a way to drastically increase the processing capability of cracking passwords , using a PS3 .
By implementing common ciphers and hash functions using vector computing , Breese has pushed the current upper limit of 10 - - 15 million cycles per second -- in Intel - based architecture -- up to 1.4 billion cycles per second .
Breese , who has been working on the project , called " Crackstation " , for the past six months , used the Sony PlayStation 3 gaming console for his break - through research .
PS3's Cell Broadband Engine technology was created by IBM , Toshiba and Sony .
The companies collaborated to create the CBE , commonly known as Cell , processor , which consists of one scalar processor and eight vector processors .
By design , PS3 is very suitable for cryptography , says Breese .
Intel processors are designed to do all kinds of complex calculations , whereas the PS3 is good at doing simple things very quickly .
" And believe it or not , cryptography really is simple , " he says .
" Lots of simple operations being done one at the time . "
The strength of cryptography implementations is usually based on its cracking time -- how long it would take for someone to sit down and crack it , says Breese .
His discovery has demonstrated that the capability of cracking encryption algorithms has multiplied by 100 .
Breese 's discovery " will unfortunately make cryptography cracking faster " , he says .
However , he hopes that his research will help drive the need for stronger cryptography to be used , and push for better implementations of cryptography .
The big implication for the industry is the fact that using Intel processors as a benchmark just is not good enough anymore , he says .
Within PS3 , in Breese 's case running Linux , there are six SPU ( Synergistic Processing Unit ) processor cores .
Each core is able to do four calculations -- so across all of the cores it is possible to do 24 calculations at the same time , he says .
The simplistic design of the processor architecture also helped increase the speed , he says .
Breese was looking for a way to optimize processing to make MD5 calculations go very quickly , he says .
MD5 ( Message - Digest algorithm 5 ) is one of the most used cryptographic hash functions .
The PS3 managed to conduct over 1.4 billion MD5 calculations a second , he says .
But the speed increase relates to the use of SIMD ( Single Instruction , Multiple Data ) computing , rather than solely the PS3 , he says .
" It 's just that the Cell processor cluster within the Playstation 3 is very good at it , " he says .
Vector , or SIMD , computing involves performing calculations against a data group , rather than against a single piece of data , which is known as scalar computing , says Breese .
Using vector computing allowed him to run cryptography calculations in parallel , he says .
Breese presented his findings at the Kiwicon hacker conference , held in Wellington earlier this month .
" We seem to have a world 's first here , with potentially huge implications around the validity of some encryption algorithms going forward , " says Security - assessment.com chief executive Peter Benson .
" While we have not currently worked on distributing load across PS3s , the theory is there to increase this level of performance further . "
The team rewrote some of the code to run under the vector - based methodology , and as soon as they did that they started getting " some pretty spectacular results " , says Benson .
It took a while before the company decided to release the numbers " because we just did n't believe them , " he says .
Breese also increased the speed in x86 processors by using the same method on the x86 - equivalent technology known as SSE ( Streaming SIMD Extensions ) , but the increase was not as significant .
He found that the x86 SSE2 implementation could conduct over three times the number of MD5 calculations than the scalar equivalent .
Breese says the initial reason for embarking on the research project was to get the company to buy him a PS3 .
This story , " Hacker Uses Sony PlayStation 3 to Crack Passwords " was originally published by GamePro .
Muhammad Yunus , winner of last year 's Noble Peace Prize and founder of The Grameen Bank , lived amongst the poorest of the poor in Bangladesh , where he worked as an Economics professor in 1974 .
He wanted to see how he could best help this growing group of famished people , out of an unrelenting guilt that would n't let up after the number of starving seemed to increase all around him and he literally saw people dying right in front of him .
Muhannad Yunus decided to let those , in the process of perishing or suffering severely from hunger , teach him the best way to help them out of this nonexistence .
He started offering them tiny loans for self - employment .
These microloans provided them the opportunity to start generating their own income based on the skills they already had .
Now his microlending program serves 2.5 million people in more than one hundred countries spanning five continents .
In the beginning , the bulk of the money used in microlending has come from philanthropic groups but pension fund giant TIAA - CREF , and other millionaires , investors and institutions are pointing micro-finance toward a more commercialized route providing a way for lenders to get a steady return on capital and practice social responsibility at the same time .
Micro -finance loans earn relatively competitive interest rate of return , approximately 5 - 7 percent and loan repayment for micro finance is over 97 % !!
Yet , only four percent of the demand for micro finance is being met right now , according to MicroCapital .
The problem seems to be that technology is not available to track and account for loans to meet the huge demand .
IBM has launched a new partnership with CARE that promises to change all that in the very near future .
Micro -financing is where we should invest our money .
There is a wide - open market in need and now that the technology will soon be available , there is little excuse not to lend .
It sure beats investing in sub prime mortgages .
“ While Americans gave record sums to charity last year , some are finding that loaning their money can be altruistic as well ...
The basic idea is to make small , short - term " microloans " to impoverished entrepreneurs who do n't otherwise have access to capital -- helping improve their businesses and therefore their lives .
”-- Wall Street Journal
" The starving people did not chant any slogans .
They did not demand anything from us well - fed city folk .
They simply lay down very quietly on our doorsteps and waited to die .
There are many ways for people to die , but somehow dying of starvation is the most unacceptable of all .
It happens in slow motion .
Second by second , the distance between life and death becomes smaller and smaller , until the two are in such close proximity that one can hardly tell the difference .
Like sleep , death by starvation happens so quietly , so inexorably , one does not even sense it happening .
And all for lack of a handful of rice at each meal .
In this world of plenty , a tiny baby , who does not yet understand the mystery of the world , is allowed to cry and cry and finally fall asleep without the milk she needs to survive .
The next day she may not have the strength to continue living .

F - 35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter to use speech recognition
by Dhiram Shah
The U.S. Air Force revealed that the F - 35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter , which will be out in 2008 , will be the first U.S. fighter to respond to voice commands .
The Air Force Research Laboratory ’s Human Effectiveness Directorate has been deliberating on the idea for some time , and has even tried out different systems from a variety of companies .
They have finally zeroed in on The DynaSpeak speech recognition software , which has been developed by SRI International in conjunction with Adacel Systems .
The system hooks on to the plane ’s onboard computer .
It will be used to give commands for both communication and navigation .
The requested data will then come up in the pilot ’s helmet display .
With voice recognition commands handy , the pilot will be able to stay focused on maneuvering the planes and will not have to flip switches or press buttons to retrieve information .
The DynaSpeak system for the military requires no particular accent or speech directives to be used .
Any pilot flying the F - 35 can start using it immediately .
For many years the Air Force has been testing speech - recognition system that works from a microphone within a pilot ’s oxygen mask in spite of loud ambient noise in the cockpit .
The DynaSpeak system was first tested in flight simulators in which data was collected on which words were apt for commands .
The Warfighter Interface Division of the Human Effectiveness Directorate is now trying out the system in real planes .
They are collecting data on its accuracy to ensure that it ’s ready for operational tests , evaluation and implementation in 2008 .
Mention the words “ 3D scanner ” and the first thought that should pop into your mind is the ZScanner .
This device uses lasers and dual cameras to digitize any object into a three - dimensional polygon mesh within minutes .
Best of all , everything is done in real - time for instant results .
In other words , the image appears live on your laptop / computer as its being scanned , enabling you to interact with the object .

If you want the features of Solaris , then just use Solaris ! cropping up .
Not because I think everyone should use Solaris ( which I do , but that is beside the point ) but because it shows that some people still think about choice of OS rationally .
There is a lot of bias among open source operating systems users – most of it completely blind .
I wo n’t pretend to be innocent of this – I was very involved with Brown ’s LUG in the past , and was for a time one of the Linux zealots ( mostly desktop users ) you will occasionally encounter , who treat anyone who favors any other OS with great disdain , and even resentment .
Fortunately I mellowed out .
Why should you pick an OS ?
You should pick the one which best suits your needs .
And you should always be open to the possibility that a different OS may serve your needs better than your current one .
The main criteria for deciding this tend to be ease of general desktop use , support for common software uses ( e.g. Firefox , Thunderbird , office suites ) , and hardware support .
But in the world of open source UNIX - like operating systems , after configuration , for most desktop users it does n’t matter .
You can use any CLI shell , and you can use any windowing environment .
And most open source software will compile on ( and is generally available in a package form for ) any UNIX - like OS .
Most desktop users only go through one main round of software installs , so as great as tools like apt - get are , most people wo n’t get that much use out of them .
For a few the licensing and copyleft ideaology are really key .
But for most desktop users , the deciding factor is ease of initial configuration – this is something that more polished Linux distributions * like Debian , Ubuntu , and Red Hat do well , and they certainly deserve credit for it ( yes , I said Debian is polished – mostly because of apt - get ) .
Do you really want to be a ( possibly unjustified ) elitist snob over some nice configuration utilities ?
Developers and power users make use of a much wider range of software – compilers , code editors and IDEs , debuggers , more sysadmin- ish command line utilities for resource management and so on and so forth .
These are the areas where differences start to emerge .
Any of the BSDs , any Linux distribution , Solaris , and with Cygwin even Windows , can run vim / emacs , Eclipse , gcc , gdb and so forth .
Want to track down a kernel bug easily , either on a live kernel or on a real , complete crash dump ?
Solaris is the clear winner : kmdb .
Want to track down performance problems easily using a kernel tracing framework that goes through every part of the system and has no performance hit when it ’s disabled ?
DTrace is only available on Solaris , and hopefully soon ( eventually ? ) will be stable on FreeBSD .
Need top - of - the - line security ?
You ’re looking at Solaris and OpenBSD .
Need fine - grained resource control ?
Solaris .
A copy - on - write shadow - paging filesystem with cheap snapshots and a variation on RAID which can withstand two disk failures in a single disk array ?
You ’re either looking at ZFS on Solaris and FreeBSD , or forking many thousands of dollars over to NetApp ( there are other similar filesystems in development , but they ’re not very far along ) .
In - kernel support for some variety of native ( same - OS ) virtualization ?
FreeBSD , Solaris , and Linux all have their own versions , with their own ups and downs .
Notice any patterns in those lists ?
Like the fact that FreeBSD has adopted many of the innovations Solaris created and provides as open source ?
Or the fact that Linux has not ?
Why is that ?
Partly it ’s licensing – the CDDL and GPL are not compatible , so code written under the two licenses cannot be linked and redistributed .
Part of it is the fact that many of the notable Linux kernel developers carry this bias I described earlier .
Some of you probably noted the fact that I did not mention SystemTap when I mentioned DTrace earlier .
Look at the comment battle on lwn.net or Adam Leventhal ’s comments on SystemTap at OSCON and comments responding to his proposal for a DTrace Linux port .
You ’ll see why .
Andrew Morton has also made some small news with a wonderful quotes which have already been commented on by someone else .
Do n’t get me wrong – I love Linux .
I use it almost every day at school .
I used it exclusively for a number of years , with great pleasure .
But now that I ’ve seen what else is out there , I sometimes wonder if it ’s lack of innovation that ’s holding Linux up , or the attitudes of its leaders and much of its community , of elitism and NIH ( not - invented - here ) syndrome .
There are so many smart people involved , I strongly suspect the latter .
* For the BSDs : I have n’t played with PC - BSD , though I ’ve heard good things .
I ’ve had bad experiences installing FreeBSD .
Installing OpenBSD was a breeze , but getting * any * software installed on it was a royal pain in the ass .
At some point I want to get around to playing with DragonflyBSD and it ’s new vkernel take on virtualization .

In Tremulous there are two teams : Aliens and Humans .
Aliens can have such awesome feats as wall - walking ( dizzying to say the least ) , pouncing from great distances , and spraying poisonous gases .
Humans can obtain advanced weaponry and armor , and plant strategic devices such as turrets to defend their base .
Tremulous features a unique upgrade system , where players from each team must make a certain number of kills to gain new upgrades ( aliens can evolve into more powerful aliens , and humans can obtain better items and gear ) .
To install under Ubuntu :
sudo apt - get install tremulous
2. Gridwars
Grid wars has been removed from the creators website , however you can still install it in on Linux , Windows , or Mac by doing a quick search .

The Metropolitan police was today found guilty of a catastrophic series of errors during the operation that led to firearms officers shooting Jean Charles de Menezes dead on the London underground .
The force was fined £ 175,000 and ordered to pay £ 385,000 costs after an Old Bailey jury found it had breached health and safety rules and failed in its duty to protect members of the public in the killing of the innocent Brazilian electrician at Stockwell station , south London , on July 22 2005 .
De Menezes was shot seven times in the head by police who mistook him for one of four men who had failed to detonate bombs on the capital 's transport system the previous day , the court heard during the four - week trial .
The prosecution alleged that the police operation to follow and stop the 27 - year - old - who lived in the same south London block of flats as the terror suspect Hussein Osman - was carried out " so badly that the public were needlessly put at risk " .
The Met denied a single charge of breaking the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 , which requires an employer to ensure the safety of non-employees .
It had faced a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine .
The Met commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , said after the verdict that he would not be resigning and would go back to New Scotland Yard to " get on with my job " .
The prime minister , Gordon Brown , and the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , said Sir Ian retained their " full confidence " .
In a highly unusual move , the judge , Mr Justice Henriques , allowed the jury to insert a rider , or caveat , into the verdict stating that Cressida Dick , the commander in charge of the operation on the day , should not be held personally culpable for the events .
The judge called the case a " corporate failure , not an individual failure " .
He said it was hard to decide the appropriate fine because " any costs to the police is a cost against a police officer on the streets " .
" This was very much an isolated breach brought about by quite extraordinary circumstances .
One person died and many others were placed in potential danger , " the judge said .
Sir Ian was in court to hear the guilty verdict delivered .
Afterwards he gave a statement in which he expressed his " deepest regret " over the death of De Menezes .
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said he should resign .
" This guilty verdict makes it unavoidable that Ian Blair should take responsibility on behalf of his whole organisation and resign , " Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said .
The Tory home affairs spokesman , David Davis , described Sir Ian 's position as " untenable " .
Len Duval , the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority , said much work had been done to improve the force 's procedures since the killing .
During the trial , the jury heard that a surveillance officer was " relieving himself " just as De Menezes left his home for the last time , and this meant an opportunity to identify him was missed .
To complicate matters , a specialist firearms unit , SO19 - since renamed CO19 - had been called to detain suspects but had not arrived .
One special branch officer , known in court as Alan , told the jury he believed the delay was " totally unacceptable " given that specialist units were told they were needed at 5 am but had not been in position until 9.30 am .
That meant surveillance officers were told by superiors in Gold command to wait for specialists to arrive - in the apparent but ultimately mistaken belief that they would be in place before De Menezes entered Stockwell station .
Commanders twice changed their minds about who should move in on the suspect , the court was told .
CCTV footage played to the court showed De Menezes walking down an escalator to the platform .
Moments later , firearms officers arrived and shot him .
Crucial to the case was evidence concerning whether the police 's shoot - to - kill command - a codeword , Kratos - was ever given .
Ms Dick , who has since been promoted , said she had only issued a command to " stop " De Menezes , implying a " conventional challenge " by armed officers .
The prosecution sought to portray the police operations room as chaotic .
Ronald Thwaites QC , defending , claimed De Menezes had been killed because he acted in an " aggressive and threatening manner " when challenged by police .
He claimed the Brazilian could have failed to comply with officers because he thought he had drugs in his pocket - the court heard traces of cocaine were found in his urine - or because he had a forged stamp in his passport .
However , Clare Montgomery , prosecuting , told the court De Menezes had been acting no differently to " hundreds of others " when he was gunned down .
When Kate Webb reported from the battlefields of Cambodia , she kept her chestnut hair cropped G.I. - short and wore jeans and loose shirts to obscure her breasts .
This was 1971 .
Only a handful of women were full - time correspondents in Vietnam , and even fewer women roughed the front lines next door in Cambodia , where military officers believed foreign women were , at best , a distraction .
At worst , they were bad luck .
Bad luck was a virus among foreign correspondents in Cambodia .
Unlike in Vietnam  where Webb arrived four years earlier at age 23 with a philosophy degree , a one - way ticket from Australia , a Remington typewriter , $ 200 in cash and a whiskey - and - cigarette voice so soft people leaned in to hear her  there were no reliable phone lines in Cambodia to call your editor in an emergency .
There were no American military hospitals to sew up your bullet wounds ; no helicopters to evacuate you when things got bloody .
By April 1971 , several years before the Killing Fields , at least 16 foreign correspondents were missing and 9 were dead .
On April 7 , it was Webb ’s turn .
A 28 - year - old bureau chief for United Press International , Webb was covering a clash on Highway 4 , south of Phnom Penh .
As bullets flew from every direction between North Vietnamese and United States - backed Cambodian troops , Webb and her Cambodian interpreter plunged into a ditch .
By the time they eventually belly - crawled their way out , four other refugees from the attack had joined them : a Japanese photojournalist and his Cambodian interpreter along with a Cambodian newspaper cartoonist and a Cambodian photographer .
Throughout that afternoon and night , the six of them crept through the wooded foothills of Cambodia ’s Elephant Mountains , holding their breath as they stood within inches of chatting North Vietnamese soldiers .
At 11:30 the next morning , tired , thirsty , their clothes and skin shredded by branches , they were crouching in the underbrush when they looked up to see two skinny North Vietnamese soldiers with AK - 47’s .
The soldiers bound Webb ’s arms behind her back with wire , vine and tape and roped all of the captives together in a single line .
They confiscated their notebooks , their ID cards , their cameras , their watches .
Then they took one thing that Webb held dear : a gold Chinese charm that she wore around her neck .
She had clung to that charm in foxholes and always came out alive .
Now without it , she felt naked .
This was n't working for me until I realized how important it is to bring your 2nd pinch hand BEHIND your 1st pinch hand when you reach for the 3rd pinch .
It does n't work if you bring the hand in front of the other one .
And I could n't make head nor tail with what this guy was saying , the quality of the audio is so poor .
I just did a YT search for " how to fold a t - shirt " - the first one that comes up is the one to watch .
I do n't actually care that this is supposed to be a " fast " way to fold a t - shirt - in my case , I did n't know how to fold one at all and have just crammed them in my drawer .
This is actually one of the most satisfying skills I 've learned in ages !

" Once again a master criminal stalks the city streets -- a criminal weaving a web of death about him -- leaving stricken victims behind wearing a ghastly clown 's grin -- the sign of death from THE JOKER ! "
-- Batman # 1 , 1940

Green hair , white skin , a red grin and an unlimited supply of purple suits -- when a certain playing card made its appearance at the end of the big - screen relaunch " Batman Begins , " fans started clamoring for every grainy image or leaked plot detail about everyone 's favorite Bat-villain .
The Joker , played by Heath Ledger , made his return to the big screen in " The Dark Knight " in summer 2008 .
But long before the Joker was mixing it up in big - budget summer movies , he was making Batman 's life miserable in the monthly titles of DC Comics ' Batman and Detective Comics series .
The Joker 's First Appearance
The Joker was originally conceived during the Golden Age of comics as an evil court jester .
He made his first appearance in Batman # 1 ( 1940 ) .
The original Joker resembled actor Conrad Veidt as he looked in the silent film " The Man Who Laughs . "
Baffling both Batman and the Gotham Police Department , the Joker made his debut as a master thief and mass murderer .
He announced the name and exact time of death of his next victim over the radio .
The Joker accomplished this feat by poisoning his victims with a time - released , facial - contracting poison known as Joker Toxin .
" " The Joker first appeared in Batman # 1 ( 1940 ) .
His first cover appearance followed in Batman # 11 .

In this first portrayal , the Joker was a calculating killer who left victims with a permanent death grin .
While he was slated to be killed off from a knife wound in his second appearance in the same issue , the DC editorial department felt the character had potential .
At the last minute , a panel was added at the end of the comic revealing that the Joker was still alive .
This started the trend of having the Joker meet his apparent demise only to be revealed as alive and well .

Average album price paid is 4 quid ...
A poll of in excess of 3,000 people on a Record of the Day website has found that the average price a Radiohead fan paid for a copy of ‘ In Rainbows ’ was £ 4 .
Corroborated with our exclusive that the Oxford band shifted 1.2 million copies of the album – thanks to inside knowledge of a source close to the band – it means that Radiohead could have potentially earned a massive £ 4.8 million from the album already !
Because the band does n’t have a record deal , they get to keep the vast majority of the money with minimal overheads .
If they were to sell the album through an online distributor , for example , they could see as little as a quarter of that money .
Of course , the band are netting more money via the £ 40 album box set sales and also the physical CD when it ’s released early next year .
Download sales are also set to continue .

New Attorney General stonewalls Senate over CIA tapes RAW STORY
Published : Friday December 14 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy said Friday he is disappointed at the Justice Department for its outright refusal to hand over any information about the interrogation videotapes destroyed by the CIA two years ago .
Leahy , and the Judiciary Committee 's top Republican Arlen Specter , wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey after news broke last week that the CIA destroyed several hundred hours of recordings depicting harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists .
 I am disappointed that the Department of Justice declined to provide us , either publicly or in a classified setting , with any of the information Senator Specter and I have requested , " Leahy said in a statement released Friday .
" The Judiciary Committee has an important role in the oversight of the Department of Justice .
Oversight fosters accountability .
This Committee needs to fully understand whether the government used cruel interrogation techniques and torture , contrary to our basic values . "
The Vermont Democrat warned he is not giving up on his quest for information on the tapes ' destruction , and he implied the Bush administration 's stonewalling could hamper its efforts to get new appointees confirmed by the Senate .
 I will ask Attorney General Mukasey -- in public and on the record -- more about the Departments knowledge of and role in the existence and destruction of these videotapes at the Committees next oversight hearing , which I intend to call early next year .
The Committee will also look forward to hearing from Deputy Attorney General nominee Mark Filip about this matter at his confirmation hearing on December 19 . 
The full letter from Mukasey is reprinted below .
Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Specter :
Thank you for your letter of December 10,2007 , regarding your concerns about the reported destruction by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) of videotapes showing interrogations of detainees and the Department 's review of this matter .
As you note , the Department 's National Security Division is conducting a preliminary inquiry in conjunction with the CIA 'S Office of Inspector General .
Enclosed please find a letter from Assistant Attorney General Kenneth L. Wainstein to CIA Acting General Counsel John A. hzzo which provides some further detail regarding this inquiry , and which was released to the public on December 8th .
As to your remaining questions , the Department has a long - standing policy of declining to provide non-public information about pending matters .
This policy is based in part on our interest in avoiding any perception that our law enforcement decisions are subject to political influence .
Accordingly , I will not at this time provide further information in response to your letter , but appreciate the Committee 's interests in this matter .
At my confirmation hearing , I testified that I would act independently , resist political pressure and ensure that politics plays no role in cases brought by the Department of Justice .
Consistent with that testimony , the facts will be followed wherever they lead in this inquiry , and the relevant law applied .
Finally , with regard to the suggestion that I appoint a special counsel , I am aware of no facts at present to suggest that Department attorneys cannot conduct this inquiry in an impartial manner .
If I become aware of information that leads me to a different conclusion , I will act on it .
I hope that this information is helpful .

A significant number of electronic - voting machines in use in Colorado are n’t reliable enough nor secure enough for compliance with state laws , the Colorado secretary of state said today .
“ The results today will have national repercussions across the country , ” Mike Coffman said during a press conference .
Coffman announced his office had determined that Sequoia ’s electronic - voting machines — the Edge II and the Edge II Plus — both failed due to security - risk factors .
He also said the optical - scan devices eScan and BallotNow , manufactured by Hart , showed they could not accurately count ballots .
ES&S optical - scan devices failed as well because of the inability to determine whether they worked properly .
That manufacturer ’s electronic - voting machine , iVotronic , also failed because it can be easily disabled by voters .
In addition , that system lacked an audit trail .
Premier , formerly Diebold , machines did pass muster with the state .
A meeting is scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday at the state Capitol , with Coffman and key legislators discussing the issue and trying to come up with solutions .
Coffman ’s announcement means counties across the state either will have to come up with alternative voting systems in time for the 2008 presidential primaries or somehow convince Coffman to change his mind .
“ We will do whatever we need to do to make sure in the 2008 election , everyone who wants to vote can vote and that the votes will be counted accurately , ” said state Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon , a Denver Democrat .

" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Hi , Michael , my name is Becka Baker .
I ‘m from Tulsa , Oklahoma .
My question for you is with 71 percent of the American people dissatisfied with this country today , dissatisfied with the war , health care , education , that the sky is blue , you name it , they ‘re dissatisfied .
Do you think America is ripe for a revolt ?
Will a revolution put this nation back on track ? "
I have noticed something recently , both around the " water cooler " at work and creeping into the public discourse .
I keep hearing the same sentiment expressed in conversations between ordinary Americans : " things in this country are only going to continue getting worse until we have an armed insurrection .
" And it is n't just progressives and liberals .
I have heard some conservatives say the same thing .
Everyone is thinking the same thing ;
Are we headed toward another civil war ?
Also recently , Hugo Award winning Author Orson Scott Card wrote " Empire " , a fiction about a near - future revolution in the United States between liberals and conservatives .
This thought is on every one 's mind , because there are no practical solutions being offered .
The corporate control of our government seems total and immovable without violent overthrow .
The conservative world - view that government cannot do anything right and that only private , for - profit enterprises can do anything for America infects our media and therefore infects a great many Americans , to the detriment of all Americans .
We are being polarized into classes again and the media is keeping everyone ignorant to that fact .
That is what John Edwards is talking about when he talks about " Two Americas " .
My brother delivered a truckload of relief supplies to the Gulf Coast after Katrina and afterwards he told me that " those people needed those supplied desperately ... before Katrina had ever hit .
" There is a new book , " Richistan " , that talks about how the wealthy live in a completely isolated world of their own .
They send their kids to private schools and use private hospitals .
Executives have private parking spaces and private entrances in most of the largest corporations .
They live in gated communities and use personal assistants to do their shopping .
The corporate media keeps telling us that the economy is doing great , but their only evidence for that is that corporate profits have been going up .
At the same time , for average workers , real wages have been falling and our benefits have been drying up right before our eyes .
We are watching our neighbors and families going bankrupt and losing their homes because of medical costs , outsourcing of jobs or because they were patriotic enough to go over and serve in Iraq .
Protests have not worked .
Writing letters has not worked .
Calling our Representatives has not worked .
They just caved - in AGAIN and gave into Bush on his warrentless wiretapping .
And the rightwing is thinking about it too .
They are waiting and watching for the straw that breaks the camels back .
After Supreme Court Justice Roberts collapsed this week , rightwing radio host Michael " Savage " Wiener claimed that it was because of a " conspiracy by Democrats " .
This country is headed straight for another civil war .
The signs are right under all our noses .
A Democratic victory in 2008 will only prolong the inevitable unless something radical happens and a real progressive populist is not elected .
That will only happen if enough concerned Americans get together and take back the Democratic party .
A Republican victory in 2008 will only guarantee that the next American civil war happens sooner rather than later .

I ’M SITTING in a darkened hall listening to neuroscientist Anders Sandberg describe how to scan ultra - thin sections of brain .
First , embed the brain in plastic , then use a camera combined with laser beam and diamond blade to capture images of the tissue as it is sliced .
The method is being developed ( in mice , so far ) to better understand the architecture of the brain .
But Sandberg , who is based at the University of Oxford , has a rather more ambitious aim in mind .
For …
One Russian man builds new cases for mobile phones from apple tree wood .
He fully disassembles the new devices and carve a piece - of - art wooden cases for them , each small part gets its own wooden case – the antenna , the sim-card , the battery .

A battery is hidden inside a wooden bar .
A sim -card comes in the smaller bar ..
And antenna is also… wooden .

This kind of thinking can do enormous damage to a free society :
As Congress debates new rules for government eavesdropping , a top intelligence official says it is time that people in the United States change their definition of privacy .
Privacy no longer can mean anonymity , says Donald Kerr , the principal deputy director of national intelligence .
Instead , it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguard people ’s private communications and financial information .
[…]
“ Our job now is to engage in a productive debate , which focuses on privacy as a component of appropriate levels of security and public safety , ” Kerr said .
“ I think all of us have to really take stock of what we already are willing to give up , in terms of anonymity , but [ also ] what safeguards we want in place to be sure that giving that does n’t empty our bank account or do something equally bad elsewhere . ”
Progress in the War Against Advil , from the always wacky Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals :
Safford Middle School officials did not violate the civil rights of a 13 - year - old Safford girl when they forced her to disrobe and expose her breasts and pubic area four years ago while looking for a drug , according to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling .
The justices voted 2 - 1 in favor of the Safford School District on Sept. 21 .
The decision upheld a federal district court ’s summary judgement that Safford Middle School Vice Principal Kerry Wilson , school nurse Peggy Schwallier and administrative assistant Helen Romero did not violate the girl ’s Fourth Amendment rights on Oct. 8 , 2003 , when they subjected her to a strip search in an effort to find Ibuprofen , an anti-inflammatory drug sold over the counter and in prescription strengths .
(…)
The girl ’s mother filed a federal law suit against the district and Middle School officials because they forced her daughter to strip down to her underwear then move her bra and panties in such a way that her breasts and pubic area were exposed .
The mother also asserts that she was not notified of the impending search .
In the opinion written by Judge Richard Clifton , “ Based on the information available to them , defendants ( Safford School District , Wilson , Schwallier and Romero ) had ‘ reasonable grounds ’ for suspecting that the search of ( the girl ’s ) person would turn up evidence that ( the girl ) had violated or was violating either the law or the rules of the school . ”
Clifton wrote that Wilson and the others had reasonable grounds for believing the girl had Ibuprofen based on conversations with two other students .
Democrat says ' king '

Print This Email This Newly confirmed Attorney General Michael Mukasey will not rein in President Bush , who views himself as having the nearly unchecked executive power of a monarch , Sen . Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) says .
" Are we just going to have another attorney general that 's just going to kowtow to the king -- the president .
I 'm sorry I get those terms kinda confused here when I 'm talking about Bush ; I do n't know if he 's king or president , " Harkin told his colleagues from the Senate floor Thursday .
" According to the last attorney general ( Bush ) was king , and maybe this one believes the same thing , he can do whatever he wants to , " Harkin continued .
" But even in 1215 , the King of England was held to the standard of habeas corpus .
I guess we want to turn the clock back to before the Magna Carta . "
Harkin spoke shortly before the Senate voted to confirm Mukasey as attorney general , after the nominee weathered criticism of his refusal to declare waterboarding illegal torture .
The Iowa Democrat criticized that position and the nominees refusal to commit to the notion that detainees in the war on terror -- including American citizens -- deserve habeas corpus guarantees , which require that anyone in captivity be charged with a crime or released .
" We need an attorney general to tell this king that he 's wrong , and that the rule of law will apply and the rule of law says we will not torture , " Harkin said .
" We will not be like our enemies .
That will send a stronger signal to the world than anything else we can do . "
The following video is from C - SPAN 's Senate debate on Mukasey nomination , broadcast on November 8 , 2007 .

I recall something that I believe I heard Carl Sagan say either in an episode of Cosmos or in one of his earlier books , that one could store enough information to hold an entire encyclopedia by putting a notch in a stick , if only one could measure where the notch lies to some absurd astronomically precise figure .

Rumors spread out once Bethesda bought the domain naime elderscrollsonline.com .
What ’s true so far though is that Pete Hines of Bethesda has NOT yet confirmed an MMORPG installment in the works for the Elder Scrolls series .
Here ’s the statement that caused all the confusion :
I do n’t think that this funding changes our focus in terms of what we are about and are trying to accomplish .
The additional resources will allow us to expand our publishing efforts - both our own titles and those of other studios - and to pursue development of more titles , working with internal and external development teams .
No official announcement has yet to be released by Bethesda confirming that an Elder Scrolls MMO is in the works .
The $ 300 million dollars bounced around the news was received by Bethesda ’s parent company , ZeniMax Media and will be invested across a “ multititude of projects . ”
For the MMO project , again , no such announcement has been made .
If you analyze the quote above , there ’s no real proof that an actual game is in the works ( except perhaps for the acquisition of elderscrollsonline.com ) and the “ confiremation ” is simply non existant .
While many speculate that such a project will give current MMO giants ( WoW for one ) a run for their money , we ’ll just have to be patient and wait it out for any more developments .

In - depth investigation shows how Vice President Dick Cheney pressured federal energy regulators to conceal evidence of widespread market manipulation by energy companies during the California electricity crisis in 2001 .
In March 2001 , while California ’s two largest utilities were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy , and the state ’s electricity crisis was spiraling out of control , Vice President Dick Cheney summoned Curt Hebert , the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , to his office next to the White House for a hastily arranged meeting .
Cheney had just been informed by his longtime friend Thomas Cruikshank , the man who handpicked the vice president to succeed him at Halliburton in the mid-1990s , that federal energy regulators were close to completing an investigation into allegations that Tulsa , Oklahoma - based Williams Companies and AES Corporation of Arlington , Virginia had created an artificial power shortage in California in April and May of 2000 by shutting down a power plant for more than two weeks .
Cruikshank was a member of Williams ’s board of directors , and perhaps more importantly , had been one of many energy industry insiders advising Cheney ’s energy task force on a wide - range of policy issues , including deregulation of the nation ’s electricity sector , that would benefit Williams financially .

LONDON ( Reuters ) --
An asteroid is on a collision course with the earth and you have one hour left to live .
What would you do in your last 60 minutes ?
Not surprisingly , the majority of people questioned in a survey -- 54 percent -- said they would like to spend it either with or on the phone to their loved ones .
But the survey revealed a strong hedonistic streak -- 13 percent would sit back , accept the inevitable and reach for a glass of champagne .
Sex appealed to only nine percent while just three percent would turn to prayer .
Two percent intriguingly said they would reach for some fatty food while another two percent decided , with just an hour ’s life to go , that it was time to start looting .
The survey was commissioned by Ziji Publishing to mark the release of “ Cloud Cuckoo Land ” by debut novelist Steven Sivell who “ uses the classic premise of an impending meteorite collision as a metaphor for threats to the human race . ”

A spokeswoman for Hoyer , who drafts the calendar , said Democrats were n’t planning a leisurely pace next year .

Congress scuttles longer workweek
Having made a five - day congressional workweek de rigueur for much of the year , House Democrats are planning an easier schedule for next year .
A 2008 calendar distributed to congressional offices Monday shows the House holding five - day weeks only three times next year , exposing Democrats to charges that they are backing away from a pledge to work harder than Republicans did when they ruled the House .

“ You have to hand it to Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats for … rewarding themselves with another broken promise , ” said Ken Spain , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
“ With a record low approval rating , … you would think they would start getting to work instead of planning extra vacation days . ”
Still , the schedule , while lighter than this year ’s , is more rigorous than ones in Republican years .
Republicans typically held a three - day week , from Tuesday night to Thursday afternoon , allowing lawmakers Mondays and Fridays in their districts .
When Democrats took over this year , they demanded more time in Washington .
“ Most weeks , not every week , but most weeks , yes , we will be working Monday , we will come in Monday at 6:30 [ p.m. ] , and be working on Friday , as we used to do , until about 2 in the afternoon , to give people time so they can get home , ” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) told reporters last December .
Hoyer delivered on that promise .
This year ’s legislative calendar shows 16 weeks in which the House was set to work a five - day week , although the actual number may differ due to subsequent schedule changes .
Next year ’s planned schedule falls in between the past two years in terms of legislative activity .
It shows the House holding four - day weeks most of the time , arriving on Monday night and leaving Thursday , or arriving Tuesday night and leaving Friday .
A spokeswoman for Hoyer , who drafts the calendar , said Democrats were n’t planning a leisurely pace next year .
“ We have already made significant progress for the American people this session , and the bottom line is we will be in Washington as many days as needed next year to complete the people ’s business , ” said the spokeswoman , Stacey Bernards .
Bernards noted that Republicans had presided over the lightest congressional schedules in recent years .
“ As is so often the case , Republican criticism has no credibility .
The last Republican Congress was in session significantly less than this Democratic Congress has been and will be , ” she said .
In the proposed 2008 schedule , the House will meet 248 days in the 110th Congress , compared with 211 days in the last Republican - led Congress , according to figures maintained by the majority leader ’s office .
President Bush would deliver his last State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 22 .
And the targeted adjournment date is Sept. 26 .
For Democrats , it was nearly inevitable that they would back off this year ’s hectic pace .
Many lawmakers had complained that the weeks were too full , allowing them little time at home to meet with constituents .
Freshman Democrats , in particular , eager to solidify their hold on their districts , have called for more time to campaign .
“ You come in late on Friday .
It ’s hard to do anything on Sunday , so you really just have one day : Saturday , ” freshman Rep. Phil Hare ( D - Ill. ) told Politico in October .
“ I have n’t complained about it , but I understand those who have . ”
Republicans , too , protested the longer weeks .
Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - Ga. ) told The Washington Post in January : “ Keeping us up here eats away at families .
… Marriages suffer .
The Democrats could care less about families — that ’s what this says . ”
Already , though , Hoyer has taken some steps to back off the demanding schedule .
The House did not meet on Fridays in October , a concession to Washington - weary lawmakers .
Congress typically works fewer days in election years to allow time for campaigning , and it appears the new Democratic regime will offer a similar reprieve .
“ We will be in less than this year , as is always the case for an election year and was also always anticipated , ” Bernards said .
Andy Sternberg reports :
Californians who choose not to register as a red , blue , or third - party voter — “ Decline to State ” voters — comprise nearly one - fifth of the state ’s registered voters according to the Secretary of State ’s office .
That ’s a 50 percent increase in voters registered “ Decline to State ” compared to the same point in the 2000 election cycle , according to California voter registration data .
( In the 1999 survey of registered voters 46 percent were registered Dems , 35 percent Republicans ; in 2007 , those numbers are 43 and 34 , respectively . )
But Decline to State or unaffiliated voters will not necessarily be allowed to participate in the February 5th California primary .
Why ?
The California Republican Party decided only to accept ballots cast by registered Republicans for next year ’s presidential primary .
Over the centuries and millennia , the " Have 's " controlled and enslaved the " Have Not 's " , not only with police terrorism , but also by keeping the peasants , peons , serfs , etc. ( i.e. , US ! ) propagandized into impotent stupor .
And how absurd to call this a Class War .
This is like saying a class war exists between cattle and the factories that butcher them .
This point is infinitely important !
Elite terrorism has NEVER been enough to permit the 1 % to enslave the 99 % .
This has always been the paradox of history .
How can Greek God like elites ( the 1 % ) so abjectly subjugate all the rest of the human race ( the 99 % ) ?
The answer is obvious .
The pig , pig rich have always been masters of propaganda .
They have contrived thousands of different ways to convince the rest of the human planet that “ being a slave ” is not only normal but pathologically moral .
Extreme examples of this stand out like : " Divine Right " or " survival of the fittest " ( political / social , not scientific ) , " Manifest Destiny " ( a sadistic fairy tale of American elites ) , and on and on .
The point is , WITHOUT this brainwashing and basically totally lack of communication among the " lower and middle classes " ( shall we say it like that ? ) ; the pitiful 1 % would be eaten alive , sadistic goose steppers , or no sadistic goose steppers .
But now , the internet !
And FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY the suckers and slaves are communicating among ourselves in the millions .
Very rarely in human history has some event or technology " quantum jumped " the human race into a different dimension .
Certainly atomic energy would be a candidate , but far less spectacularly , so has the internet .
There 's probably no human being alive who comprehends even a TENTH of how the internet is mutating the human condition .

10 . Myth :
The US public no longer sees Iraq as a central issue in the 2008 presidential campaign .
In a recent ABC News / Washington Post poll , Iraq and the economy were virtually tied among voters nationally , with nearly a quarter of voters in each case saying it was their number one issue .
The economy had become more important to them than in previous months ( in November only 14 % said it was their most pressing concern ) , but Iraq still rivals it as an issue !
9 . Myth :
There have been steps toward religious and political reconciliation in Iraq in 2007 .
Fact :
The government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has for the moment lost the support of the Sunni Arabs in parliament .
The Sunnis in his cabinet have resigned .
Even some Shiite parties have abandoned the government .
Sunni Arabs , who are aware that under his government Sunnis have largely been ethnically cleansed from Baghdad , see al - Maliki as a sectarian politician uninterested in the welfare of Sunnis .
8. Myth :
The US troop surge stopped the civil war that had been raging between Sunni Arabs and Shiites in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad .
Fact :
The civil war in Baghdad escalated during the US troop escalation .
Between January , 2007 , and July , 2007 , Baghdad went from 65 % Shiite to 75 % Shiite .
UN polling among Iraqi refugees in Syria suggests that 78 % are from Baghdad and that nearly a million refugees relocated to Syria from Iraq in 2007 alone .
This data suggests that over 700,000 residents of Baghdad have fled this city of 6 million during the US ‘ surge , ’ or more than 10 percent of the capital ’s population .
Among the primary effects of the ‘ surge ’ has been to turn Baghdad into an overwhelmingly Shiite city and to displace hundreds of thousands of Iraqis from the capital .
7. Myth : Iran was supplying explosively formed projectiles ( a deadly form of roadside bomb ) to Salafi Jihadi ( radical Sunni ) guerrilla groups in Iraq .
Fact : Iran has not been proved to have sent weapons to any Iraqi guerrillas at all .
It certainly would not send weapons to those who have a raging hostility toward Shiites .
( Iran may have supplied war materiel to its client , the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) , which was then sold off from warehouses because of graft , going on the arms market and being bought by guerrillas and militiamen .
6. Myth : The US overthrow of the Baath regime and military occupation of Iraq has helped liberate Iraqi women .
Fact : Iraqi women have suffered significant reversals of status , ability to circulate freely , and economic situation under the Bush administration .
5. Myth : Some progress has been made by the Iraqi government in meeting the “ benchmarks ” worked out with the Bush administration .
Fact : in the words of Democratic Senator Carl Levin , “ Those legislative benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon law , approving a debaathification law , completing the work of a constitutional review committee , and holding provincial elections .
Those commitments , made 1 1/ 2 years ago , which were to have been completed by January of 2007 , have not yet been kept by the Iraqi political leaders despite the breathing space the surge has provided . ”
4. Myth : The Sunni Arab “ Awakening Councils , ” who are on the US payroll , are reconciling with the Shiite government of PM Nuri al - Maliki even as they take on al - Qaeda remnants .
Fact :
In interviews with the Western press , Awakening Council tribesmen often speak of attacking the Shiites after they have polished off al - Qaeda .
A major pollster working in Iraq observed ,
‘ Most of the recent survey results he has seen about political reconciliation , Warshaw said , are “ more about [ Iraqis ] reconciling with the United States within their own particular territory , like in Anbar . . . .
But it does n’t say anything about how Sunni groups feel about Shiite groups in Baghdad . ”
Warshaw added : “ In Iraq , I just do n’t hear statements that come from any of the Sunni , Shiite or Kurdish groups that say ‘ We recognize that we need to share power with the others , that we ca n’t truly dominate . ’ ” ‘ ‘
The polling shows that “ the Iraqi government has still made no significant progress toward its fundamental goal of national reconciliation . ”
3. Myth : The Iraqi north is relatively quiet and a site of economic growth .
Fact :
The subterranean battle among Kurds , Turkmen and Arabs for control of the oil - rich Kirkuk province makes the Iraqi north a political mine field .
Kurdistan now also hosts the Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas that sneak over the border and kill Turkish troops .
The north is so unstable that the Iraqi north is now undergoing regular bombing raids from Turkey .
2. Myth : Iraq has been “ calm ” in fall of 2007 and the Iraqi public , despite some grumbling , is not eager for the US to depart .
Fact : in the past 6 weeks , there have been an average of 600 attacks a month , or 20 a day , which has held steady since the beginning of November .
About 600 civilians are being killed in direct political violence per month , but that number excludes deaths of soldiers and police .
Across the board , Iraqis believe that their conflicts are mainly caused by the US military presence and they are eager for it to end .
1. Myth :
The reduction in violence in Iraq is mostly because of the escalation in the number of US troops , or “ surge . ”
Dec. 3 , 2007 -- Children are developing potentially dangerous peanut allergies at a much younger age , according to a new study .
And that 's not all :
The study researchers found more parents are feeding their children peanuts at an earlier age .
" This should be a wake - up call to all parents of young children , " says researcher Wesley Burks , MD , chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Duke University Medical Center , in a news release .
" Kids are being exposed to peanuts and having allergic reactions much earlier than they did five or 10 years ago . "
About 1.8 million Americans are allergic to peanuts , and researchers say the number of peanut allergies diagnosed in children has doubled in the last decade .
They say these results suggest earlier exposure to peanuts may be a major factor behind that rapid increase .
" There 's a valid reason to delay introduction to products containing peanuts , " says researcher Todd D. Green , MD , assistant professor of pediatrics at Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh , in the release .
" When kids are older , it can be easier to manage bad reactions .
They can tell you right away if their mouths feel funny .
For that reason alone , it 's worth delaying exposing your child to a peanut product , especially if a child is at high risk . "
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents not give peanuts to children until age 3 if there is a strong history of allergies in the family .
What is the most critical element to taking amazing photographs ?
There are a number of candidates including lighting , focus , timing and camera type , but one device has been at the heart of producing some of the funniest and strangest pictures around : proper angle .
Sorted into three categories , here are some awesome examples of images taken at just the right angle !
If you enjoy these , you may want to look at the others in the series : 20 Photos at the Exact Right Angle and 25 Photos at the Exact Right Time .
These also follow in the rich tradition of The 7 Giants in the Streets and The Amazing Little People of London .
Also check out other Urban Art and Street Art and Urban Videos from around the world .
Illusions of Overlap : perhaps the most common trick , usually used to comic effect in perfect - angled photographs , is the use of overlap to create an illusion of an impossible , unlikely or entirely strange set of circumstances .
These kinds of images are easy to stage , it ’s catching candid ones or creating compellingly staged ones that is the real challenge .
Unusual Moments in Time : sometimes a photograph taken at just the right angle and time takes advantage of the peculiarity of a circumstance , such as a man at an intersection with an uncommonly relaxed dog or a worker in a hole with a pudding - covered spoon .
Focus is critical , with the first image capturing the expressions of curious bystanders and the latter revolving around the hat and spoon .
Juxtaposition of the Similar : catching similar objects or like poses can create chance relationships between apparently completely different kinds of options , connecting them across scale , material and purpose in curious and comical ways .

Laurent Nkunda says he cannot accept an order to lay down arms
Speaking to the BBC , General Laurent Nkunda , a Congolese Tutsi , accused the government of forming an alliance with Hutus to attack his troops .
Heavy fighting is reported in the Kivu region , with the Congolese army moving troops into the area .
The UN refugee agency says tens of thousands have fled from their homes .
The UNHCR says people are afraid of being caught between government forces , former Rwandan rebels and troops of General Nkunda .
Uneasy standoff
General Nkunda told the BBC his forces had handed over Rwandan Hutu FDLR rebels to the UN peacekeeping mission , known as Monuc .
" For me it 's a state of war ... we have prisoners of war from the FDLR who were attacking with the government troops , " he said .
He said he could not support a government that was working with Hutus and would not accept an order to disarm his forces .
The BBC's Africa analyst , Martin Plaut , says that the government and the general are now well armed and supplied and an uneasy standoff is currently in place .
DR Congo Defence Minister Tshikez Djemu said that if soldiers allied to General Nkunda refused to lay down their arms , they would be considered bandits and be dealt with accordingly by the army .
Tension is nothing new to North Kivu but it has suddenly increased after the government 's decision to dismantle what are known as the mixed brigades , our correspondent says .
These brigades , created earlier this year , were made up of government soldiers and more than 7,000 former rebels .
They joined the brigades on condition that they would remain deployed as a group to protect their own community , the Tutsis , against Rwandan Hutu rebels , some of whom took part in the 1994 genocide of Tutsis .
But since the beginning of this year , military operations launched by the mixed brigades against the Hutu rebels have created more instability and the UN says more than 170,000 civilians have been displaced .

White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , like Scott " The Lyin ' King " McClellan before him , does a great job serving up lies every day on behalf of George W. Bush .
If the president or Dick Cheney told Snow to go before the media and say that today is actually Christmas , he would do it and treat everyone in the room like idiots for being unaware of that altered reality .
So there was Snow yesterday sounding a lot like a Democrat and detailing the amount of Congressional investigation that 's been necessary on the corrupt administration for which he is the mouthpiece , but actually using it to illustrate how the current Congress doesnâ€™t understand the view from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on their role -- that they only exist to rubber stamp King George 's policies .
Here 's
Snow in his opening statement for the Wednesday press briefing :
" As you probably know , the House Judiciary Committee has just voted along partisan lines to have a criminal contempt of Congress referral against White House legal counsel and the White House Chief of Staff .
For our view , this is pathetic .
What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults , insinuations , inquisitions and investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of trying to pass major pieces of legislation , such as appropriations bills , and to try to work in such a way as to demonstrate to the American people that Congress and the White House can work together .
" In any event , it 's worth putting this in perspective in terms of the accomplishments of the present Congress .
If you take a look at the 110th Congress right now , which had promised to have all of its appropriations bills done this month , here 's what we have seen since the beginning of the Congress :
More than 300 executive branch investigations or inquiries ; 400 requests for documents , interviews , or testimony ; we 've had more than 550 officials testify ; we 've had more than 600 oversight hearings ; 87,000 - plus hours spent responding to oversight requests ; and 430,000 pages made available to Congress for oversight .
That 's pretty significant . "
" That 's pretty significant , " he says .
But what he means is that Congress is wasting their time doing the oversight inherent to that body -- because , as far as Snow is concerned , Congress represents the White House and not the American people -- and that they should spend more time helping Bush in his failed national agenda or , like their GOP predecessors , focusing on issues like Terri Schiavo or flag burning .
And then one intrepid reporter tries to remind Snow of that boring old checks - and - balances thing :
Q : Tony , this country -- if I 'm correct from our history books , was n't this country based on the system of checks and balances ?
You say they 're not doing the people 's business , but is n't that the people 's business ?
If there is something in question -- granted , there might have been 400 investigations , but if there was something in question , is n't that the people 's business ?
Snow :
That 's a very good question .
But what if there is n't anything in question and somebody is going on a --
Q : There are things in question .
Snow then goes on to explain how Congress is only on a partisan " fishing expedition " and that Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are guilty of creating " a toxic atmosphere " in Washington .
I seeâ€ ¦
We have a Supreme Court - appointed president who has done everything but go up to Capitol Hill and urinate on the Senate floor and has systematically shredded our Constitution , but it 's the people in the legislative branch who have polluted the political atmosphere .
And Snow wrapped up soon after one reporter expressed why Congress might be issuing contempt citations -- " you have n't made everybody available .
You 've made them available if they go without the oath , if they go without the transcript , and if they go in private " -- and another asked about Alberto Gonzales and whether Bush is " troubled by senators questioning his truthfulness and by Specter saying that he does n't think he has any credibility . "
Snow said the president " stands by the Attorney General " and , perhaps to lighten things up , " the president is bothered sometimes by the tone of debate in Washington . "
Well , at least he ended on a comic note .

Naomi
Wolf presents the ideas in her book , The End of America , at the University of Washington .
Video is a bit long , but the illuminating introduction explains what drove her to write it , and promises some hope by the end of her talk .
Wolf argues that the language , images , and manipulations that despots used in the past to break down democracies have a consistent pattern , and are being employed here and now .
From Italy in the 1920s , Germany in the 1930s , and to the present , she finds that all modern despots do the same things .
Mussolini created the formula , Hitler followed it , and Stalin studied Hitler – this pattern gets passed down .
Wolf summarized this blueprint in ten points :
Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy Create a gulag Develop a thug caste Set up an internal surveillance system Harass citizens ’ groups Engage in arbitrary detention and release Target key individuals Control the press Dissent equals treason Suspend the rule of law
In the video , Wolf argues that all of these factors are now underway in the USA .
It ’s a different take on the popular 14 points of fascism – without invoking the " f " word .
Her phrase " shutting down a democracy " , gets past the objections associated with " fascism " .
However ,
Wolf goes beyond a simple list of features and demonstrates both the predictive nature of her model , and the non-linear nature of change as a democracy weakens .
She closes with :
… History shows it ’s not enough to impeach criminals and murderers .
You have to put them behind bars .
The Founders did not intend for us to delegate the defense of liberty to a professional class of pundits or politicians or constitutional scholars .
The Founders intended for us to do it .
What the Founders intended was for ordinary Americans , ordinary people to assume the patriot ’s task and lead the fight to restore democracy , and to see themselves as leaders .

Fighting carbon monoxide danger

GREAT BARRINGTON 
A few months ago , according to Fire Chief Harry Jennings , his department received a potentially bad call : high levels of carbon monoxide in a house .
" It was nasty , " Jennings said .
" More than 400 parts per million  way above healthy levels .
This was a family with kids and everything . "
Fortunately , the house had a carbon monoxide detector .
" They were all OK , " he said .
The cause of the buildup was a blocked chimney .
According to both The Associated Press and several local officials , carbon monoxide emergency calls have roughly doubled in the past year since state lawmakers passed a law requiring homes to install the alarms .
In the Albany area on Nov. 11 , six people were hospitalized after a faulty furnace vented carbon monoxide into a house on 174 South Swan St .
The most high - profile case in Berkshire County happened in February , when a brother and sister on Dalton Avenue in Pittsfield were nearly overcome .
There were a total of 10,000 carbon monoxide - related calls statewide in 2006 , compared with about half that amount in 2005 .
Jennings said that sounds about right .
" We 've had twice as many calls this year compared to last year , " he said .
" The volume is up significantly . "

" Nicole 's Law " was passed a few months after 7 - year - old Nicole Garofalo died from carbon monoxide poisoning in her home after mounds of snow clogged a boiler vent in January 2005 .
The law requires a battery - operated or plug - in detector with battery backup in homes where gasoline , oil , wood or propane are burned .

The law is enforced mainly on the sale or transfer of property .
It also is enforced whenever a fire department is called to a home for an inspection , such as an addition .
Building inspectors statewide , such as assistant inspector Donald Fitzgerald of Lenox , say that every home or building that burns gas , oil or wood should have one .
" It 's just common sense , " Fitzgerald said .
" If this happens in your home , you 're going to go to sleep and never wake up . "
Many still without detectors
State officials say that , although awareness has been raised for many homeowners in the past several months , many still have not installed the devices , which are priced at between $ 30 and $ 120 .
Some of the confusion about carbon monoxide poisoning has come because some homeowners believe that if they replace their furnace , they will have less cause for worry .

Not so , according to local chimney sweeps .
" The big problem , " said Steve Graves , owner of Sweep N' Scan Inc. of Pittsfield , " is that the new burners are so efficient that almost all the heat stays in the house . "
Because of that , he said , the waste vapor vented from the burner no longer goes all the way up a chimney .
Instead , the gases cool and condense inside the chimney , in particular an older chimney , and eat away at the interior of the structure .
" You got this acidic water that condenses on the inside of chimneys and just chews it up , " he said .
' No more grandfathering '
Graves said the state already is mandating chimney liners for new houses and soon will be mandating them for older chimneys as well .

" No more grandfathering : You 're going to need a liner , " he said .
The good thing is that the new laws are working , Graves said .
His company used to install five liners a month .
Now , he said , he does five a week .
He urged residents with furnaces , old or new , to get their chimneys checked .
" Every year we see cases of blocked chimneys that could be avoided if people checked them , " he said .

Great new read by Ben Wallace - Wells in this month 's Rolling Stone that exposes how the $ 500 Billion spent on the Drug War over the last 35 years has been all but a complete waste of time and money , and an absolute failure by any standard of measure .
[ A] fter U.S. drug agents began systematically busting up the Colombian cartels - doubt was replaced with hard data .
Thanks to new research , U.S. policy - makers knew with increasing certainty what would work and what would n't .
The tragedy of the War on Drugs is that this knowledge has n't been heeded .
We continue to treat marijuana as a major threat to public health , even though we know it is n't .
We continue to lock up generations of teenage drug dealers , even though we know imprisonment does little to reduce the amount of drugs sold on the street .
And we continue to spend billions to fight drugs abroad , even though we know that military efforts are an ineffective way to cut the supply of narcotics in America or raise the price .
All told , the United States has spent an estimated $ 500 billion to fight drugs - with very little to show for it . [...]
Even by conservative estimates , the War on Drugs now costs the United States $ 50 billion each year and has overcrowded prisons to the breaking point - all with little discernible impact on the drug trade .

On three consecutive days last month , about $ 150 went missing from schoolbags , which students must store in the hat room during recess .
Harry was a victim - he lost $ 18 - and other students had cash and bus passes nicked .
Harry , 11 , sprang into action .
" The teachers said ' wait , wait , wait ' and they were n't taking any action , " he said .
" I decided to act because I was annoyed that they had robbed a lot of classes , and a lot of people were missing $ 20 . "
Harry drew on know - how acquired from hours spent glued to the History Channel , his favourite program being a documentary about Vietcong - made traps in the Vietnam War .
On the fourth day , he placed a mouse trap with a $ 5 note attached in his school bag during recess .
He had squirted the device 's main bar and metal fittings with green food colouring , cutting a small hole in the note and securing it on the bait hook with sticky tape , so that the thief would have to wrestle with it , thereby setting off the spring and getting hit with the coloured bar .
To his surprise , the thieves took the bait and - after he spread the word among classmates - a witch - hunt began .
" I thought ' Oh my God , I might catch these guys ' , " Harry said .
" Everybody was running around seeing who had green on their fingers . "
One of the offenders was caught green - handed en route to the bathroom in a desperate bid to wash off the evidence .
The younger boy confessed his guilt .
An accomplice in the same year was also nabbed .
The pair had amassed a booty of $ 165 from their crime spree - blowing $ 15 on lollies at the canteen .
Harry 's mother , Michaela , 38 , a nurse , could not be more proud of her son .
She said she had grown up around mousetraps and did not believe any child could have been seriously injured .
" Harry has a strong concept of fairness and did n't want to see anyone else lose their money , " Mrs Cordaiy said .
" Initially , the vice - principal had to say it was a little extreme and we do n't condone it - but privately teachers were , like , ' Good on you , mate ' .
" [ The offenders ] probably just did n't realise how much trouble they 'd really caused .
This is the northern beaches , for God 's sake .
Nobody is that poor . "
When he's not busy fighting crime , Harry plays rugby union and league and dreams of putting his technical skills to use as an engineer .
He has been voted in as a school leader next year .
Principal Rob Richmond said the two students involved in taking the money had been disciplined .
" Birth Control " Pills cause early Abortions By J.T. Finn ( updated April 23 , 2005 ) Physicians across America -- and around the world -- are now confirming that the Pill , IUDs , Depo - Provera and Norplant cause early abortions .
First , a look at the Pill .
Research shows that in many cases the Pill causes early abortions -- abortions the mother may not even know she 's having .
You may find this shocking , but the facts are clear after reading Randy Alcorn 's book , titled ; " Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions ? "
Here 's what 11 physicians and medical professionals are saying about the book Randy Alcorn published in 1998 : 1 . " From medical textbooks and pharmacy references , to statements from the Pill - manufacturers themselves , this book proves , beyond any doubt , the abortion - causing action of birth control pills .
This book should be read by everyone interested in knowing the truth . "
~ Paul L. Hayes , M.D. , Board Certified Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians / Gynecologists 2 . " Does the birth control pill cause abortions ?
Using research results from medical literature , Randy Alcorn has convincingly shown that the answer is `yes . '
He has , with care and compassion , given us the truth .
The question for us as Christians is how we will respond now that we know . "
~ Linda Martin , M.D. , Pediatrician 3 . " By carefully detailing the available medical information concerning the abortifacient effects of oral contraceptives , Randy Alcorn has developed a logical and thoughtful challenge to every prolife person .
The conclusions of this study are scientifically accurate .
Birth control pills usually prevent pregnancy , but sometimes they cause an abortion .
Questions ?
Objections ?
Randy has addressed them in a gentle but firm way .
This is the manner in which the often fiery debate over prolife subjects should be carried out - unemotionally , intelligently and quietly .
The evidence is before us . . .
` How should we then live ? ' " ~ Patrick D. Walker , M.D. , Professor of Pathology , University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences 4 .
" In this challenging book Randy Alcorn has the honesty to face a tough and uncomfortable question .
This compelling evidence will make you rethink the question of birth control pills . "
~ John Brose , M.D. , Surgeon 5 . " In this impeccably researched book , Randy Alcorn takes an unblinking look at what medical experts know about how birth control pills work .
I painfully agree that birth control pills do in fact cause abortions .
Our individual and collective Christian response to this heretofore varnished - over information will have profound consequences for time and eternity .
This is a disturbing must - read for all who profess to be prolife . "
~ Beverly A. McMillan , M.D. , Ob / Gyn 6 . " Randy Alcorn has done exceptional work .
The facts in this book parallel much of my own research .
I am delighted he would undertake such a work when others seek to avoid the subject .
This book is a must for Christians , particularly those in medicine and Christian ministries . "
~ Karen D. Garnett , R.N. 7 . " No prolife physician can rightly prescribe BCPs [ birth control pills ] after reviewing this data .
I have started circulating this information . "
~ Randall Martin , M.D. , Chairman , Department of Anesthesiology , Columbia Willamette Valley Medical Center 8 .
" Scientific papers suggest that escape ovulation occurs 4 - 15 % of all cycles in patients taking birth control pills .
Thus , as this booklet points out , early chemical abortions are a real and significant concern . "
~ Paddy Jim Baggot , M.D. , Ob / Gyn , Fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics 9 .
" Randy Alcorn has thoroughly studied and written on an area where little published scientific information exists .
His responses to this issue , and his outstanding appendices , are must reading . "
~ William M. Petty , M.D. , Surgeon , Gynecologic Oncology 10 .
" Randy Alcorn has once again demonstrated his tenacity and integrity in pursuing the truth .
He has exposed the abortifacient properties of so - called birth control agents .
This booklet should be required reading for all discerning Christians who wish to fully live out their faith . "
~ William L. Toffler , M.D. , Professor of Family Medicine ,
Oregon Health Sciences University 11 .
" I endorse Randy Alcorn 's book with gusto .
He has answered the title question with the care and compassion of a pastor , having searched out the facts with the diligence of an experienced researcher .
He has provided all women in their reproductive years with an invaluable resource which will allow them to be fully informed about the birth control pill . "
~ William F. Colliton , Jr. , M.D. , Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology ,
George Washington University Medical Center

More facts about the Pill , IUDs , Depo - Provera and Norplant : Again , if you 're reading about CHEMICAL ABORTIONS for the first time , this may surprise , or even shock you .
Most Americans are not aware that the Pill and other chemical " contraceptives " cause millions of " non-surgical " abortions each year in the early weeks of pregnancy .
If you are using the Pill , Depo - Provera or Norplant , you need to know the truth about how these products work .
Most women take these " contraceptives " because they do n't want to have a baby .
But how many women know they can have BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS and become pregnant while using these " contraceptives ? "
Very few !
And how many of these women know that if they become pregnant after a BREAKTHROUGH OVULATION , these " contraceptives " will almost always kill any son or daughter they 've conceived ?
Most people do n't know the real facts about how " contraceptives " work .
And because of this lack of knowledge , most women are not aware that they may be having BREAKTHROUGH OVULATIONS , and conceiving children that are killed very early in the pregnancy .
Women using these " contraceptives " almost never perceive that they have become pregnant , or that chemicals have killed their tiny baby .
What is Breakthrough Ovulation ?
While using the Pill and other chemical " birth control " products , many women 's ovaries continue to release eggs .
This is called " Breakthrough Ovulation " and it occurs in millions of women each year .
Once an egg has been released via ovulation , a woman can become pregnant .
You can still conceive a child . . .
If you 're using " birth control " products and you have a breakthrough ovulation that releases an egg , sperm can then reach and fertilize your egg .
At that moment -- you would be pregnant !
Fertilization means conception has taken place and you now have a brand new son or daughter who is as complete genetically as he or she will ever be throughout life .
When Does Human Life Begin ?
Internationally - known geneticists and biologists have testified that human life begins at conception .
In 1981 ( April 23 - 24 ) a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings on the question :
When does human life begin ?
The following doctors testified : Dr. Hymie Gordon , Chairman of the Department of Genetics at the Mayo Clinic , said : " By all the criteria of modern molecular biology , life is present from the moment of conception . "
Dr. McCarthy de Mere , a medical doctor and law professor at the University of Tennessee , testified : " The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception . "
Dr. Jerome Lejeune , The Father of Modern Genetics , testified that , " Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell , the fertilized egg , and this is the moment of fertilization .
There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon we call the DNA . "
The late Dr. Lejeune of Paris , France , discovered the genetic cause of Down Syndrome .
He received the Kennedy Prize for this discovery , as well as the Memorial Allen Award Medal , the world 's highest award for work in the field of Genetics .
How does the Pill work ?
The Pill has three mechanisms of action which can easily be looked up in the Physician 's Desk Reference .
1 ) Sometimes , the Pill suppresses ovulation .
When this happens , an egg is not released and conception cannot occur .
( It 's important to read on and find out about the high rates of breakthrough ovulation .
When ovulation is not suppressed , pregnancy can occur . )
2 ) The Pill also works to thicken the woman 's cervical mucus which can " restrict " sperm from moving up the reproductive tract toward the egg .
3 ) One way the Pill causes early abortions is that it interfers with the flexing motions and the cilia movement of the fallopian tubes .
These changes slow the transportation of newly conceived child from the fallopian tubes to the womb .
Unfortunately , many small babies starve to death in the fallopian tubes because chemicals caused changes that prevented them from reaching the womb in time to be nourished .
4 ) Another way the Pill causes early abortions :
If your tiny baby survives the ride down the fallopian tube to your womb , the Pill will almost always cause the endometrium ( the lining of your uterus ) to reject your child .
Chemical reactions often cause the lining of your womb to become thin , shriveled and unable to support implantation of your newly conceived child .
This means that in almost every case , your new child will not be able to attach to the wall of your womb where he or she would normally live , grow and receive nourishment for 9 months .
This means your tiny baby will starve to death and his or her remains will be passed along in your next bleeding cycle .
( The " Study of Abortion Deaths Commission " estimates that this happens in women in America who use the Pill approximately 1 to 4 million times each year . )
The chemicals that cause these early abortions are called abortifacients which is the medical term for any chemical agent that causes an abortion .
Depo -Provera , Norplant and IUDs Depo - Provera and Norplant both use chemicals that work in very simlar ways on a woman 's body and womb .
Depo -Provera and Norplant are also considered chemical abortifacients .
IUDs or Intra -Uterine Devices , are small plastic devices that are inserted into the womb .
Some IUDs contain copper or a time released hormone .
It is believed that the IUD causes a low grade inflammation in the lining of the womb .
As a result , the lining of the womb is imperfect and the fertilized egg will not implant .
( Source :
This paragraph on IUDs is quoted directly from the Calgary Regional Health Authority 's web site . )
Because of the chemical effect an IUD has on a woman 's womb , tiny babies are aborted .
Therefore , IUDs are also considered abortifacients .
Breakthrough ovulation proved long ago . . .
Birth control advocates and manufacturers of the Pill have known these facts for years .
Have they done a very good job of informing women about how the Pill really works ?
( Please email us and let us know if you were aware of how the Pill worked before you read this . )
When chemists devised the Pill that debuted in 1960 , they gave it a huge dose of a chemical that caused most women 's ovaries to stop secreting eggs ( i.e. , to stop ovulation ) .
The theory was " no egg , no pregnancy . "
However , some women continued to release eggs and get pregnant while on the original Pill .
( Studies have shown that an even higher percentage of women release eggs while using today 's newer , re-formulated Pills .
More about today 's Pills in a moment . )
In her award winning study of women taking the earlier high dose Pills , Dutch gynecologist Dr. Nine Van der Vange showed " proof of ovulation based on ultrasound exams and hormonal indicators occurred in about 4.7 % of the cycles studied . "
( Source : Sterns , Dr. David , " How the Pill and the IUD Work : Gambling with Life , " American Life League , PO Box 1350 , Stafford , VA 22555 )
And the " Textbook of Contraceptive Practice " states that , " Among women who have been followed over a considerable number of cycles , breakthrough ovulations occur in 2 to 10 percent of cycles . "
( Source : Dr. J. Peel & Dr. Malcolm Potts , Textbook of Contraceptive Practice , 1969 , Cambridge , Cambridge University Press )
Please note that these references are to the lower breakthrough ovulation rates of the Pills of the 1960's .
The new Pills of the 1990's work differently and have much higher breakthrough ovulation rates .
This will be explained as you read on .
Why the big secret ?
Why are n't most women aware that the Pill causes early abortions ?
Let 's look at the large pharmaceutical companies who advertise , market and sell the Pill .
They make huge profits from the Pill -- and they 'll continue to make mega- profits -- if women are convinced they 're not getting pregnant and they keep buying and taking the Pill everyday .
But are they being honest with you ?
Have they clearly explained that their products cause millions of early chemical abortions each year ?
The New Pills : Much Higher Rates of Breakthrough Ovulation . . .
The original Pill of the 1960's had to be modified due to harmful side effects that women were experiencing because of the powerful chemicals .
All versions of today 's " Combination Pill " have a reduced hormonal content .
When compared to the Pills of the 1960's and 1970's , this reduces the chance of harmful side effects for women , but it also increases their chances of ovulating and conceiving a son or daughter .
Dr. Ronald Chez , a scientist at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , publicly stated that the new Pills of today , with their lower estrogen dose , allow ovulation up to 50 % of the time !
( Source : Sterns , David , M.D. , Sterns , Gina , R.N. , B.S.N. , Yaksich , Pamela , " Gambling with Life , How the I.U.D. and ' The Pill ' Work " ( www.top.net/vitalsigns).
With these newer Pills , simply missing one tablet , or failing to take the Pill at the same time each day increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation .
Reactions with other drugs increases the chances of breakthrough ovulation , especially with caffeine and nicotine , or some prescription medicine ( Source : " Abortifacient Contraception : The Pharmaceutical Holocaust " by Dr. Rudolf Ehmann , Human Life Intl. , 1993 , p.15 ) .
Makers of the new " mini- pill " claim it does not have the side effects of the combination pill .
However , they do n't tell you that scientific research shows the mini- pill does not stop ovulation at all in 67 - 81 % of the women who use it , so the probability of conception is much higher .
( Source : Tonti-Fillippini , Nicholas , Linacre Quarterly , 1995 ) Breakthrough Ovulation Estimates for other " Birth Control " Methods : 1 ) Norplant has breakthrough ovulation 50 - 65 % of the time .
2 ) Depo -Provera has breakthrough ovulation 40 - 60 % of the time .
3 ) The IUD has breakthrough ovulation 100 % of the time .
4 ) With over 17 million American women using the Pill and other chemical abortifacients , it is estimated that breakthough ovulation and pregnany occurs so often . . . that between 7 to 12 million newly conceived children are killed by chemical abortions in the womb each year .
And most of these women never even knew they were pregnant .

Betrayed !
If you are taking these products to avoid pregnancy ( and abortion ) , now you know that the makers and promoters of " birth control " products have betrayed you and your children .
It has been proven many times that these products do not completely stop ovulation and conception .
In fact , depending upon the product you 're using , you could be at risk of ending the life of a newly conceived son or daughter every month by birth control 's chemical abortions .
More Proof . . .
The Food and Drug Administration stated in 1978 that : Combination oral contraceptives . . . [ make ] alterations in the genital tract including changes in the . . . endometrium ( which reduce the likelihood of implantation ) . . . but progestogen only contraceptives [ re : mini- pills ] are known to alter the cervical mucus , exert a progestational effect on the endometrium , interfering with implantation .
( Emphasis added ) Medical Publications confirm the facts . . .
" The Physicians ' Desk Reference " quoted a Searle brochure ( Searle is a major pharmaceutical manufacturer of the Pill ) which states that the mini-pill : makes the womb ( uterus ) less receptive to any fertilized egg that reaches it .
( Emphasis added ) " Nursing ' 85 Drug Handbook " states :
Progestogen ... also caused endometrial changes that prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum .
( Emphasis added ) " The Pill - How Does It Work ? "
By Albert D. Lorincz , M.D. : Cites a study of 1,200 women given a daily amount of progestogen equivalent to many birth control pills .
60 % of them ovulated .
" Birth Control : Why Are They Lying to Women ? " By J.C. Espinoza , M.D. ( page 27 ) cites research which showed a 30 % ovulation rate in women taking a combined Pill preparation .
From Birth Control Advocates Lawyers from organizations that promote abortion have admitted in print and in legal briefs that these products cause abortions .
A Tulane Law School Professor wrote : ... nearly all birth control devices , except the diaphragm and the condom , operate between the time of conception and implantation ... ( Emphasis added ) Attorney Frank Sussman argued in the U.S. Supreme Court :
... IUDs [ and ] low dose birth control pills ... act as abortifacients .
The Big Lie Propoganda from many pharmaceutical companies promotes a new definition of CONCEPTION .
Their new definition is absolutely untruthful and totally unscientific .
They created this new definition of when a child is conceived to help them sell their products with the label " contraceptives . "
Their new definition says that conception occurs only when your baby successfully attaches to the lining of your uterus .
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE !
The real medical truth .
It 's very important to understand that when a sperm penetrates one of your eggs , you have conceived a child .
Again , this is called fertilization or conception and from that point on , you have a brand new , genetically complete son or daughter .
Every conception is a very unique moment .
For example , at your own conception , 46 chromosomes with 30,000 genes combined to determine all your physical characteristics ; sex , facial features , body type , color of hair , eyes and skin .
Even more amazing , intelligence and personality -- the way you think and feel -- were already in place within your genetic code .
At the moment of conception , you were essentially and uniquely " you . "
This is the same for every human being at the moment of conception .
Remember , the pharmaceutical industry has a multi-billion dollar business selling these abortifacients .
Unfortunately , many of the people who prescribe these products are not aware of their homicidal properties .
They may have a sincere desire to help women , but their lack of knowledge makes them uninformed accomplices to these early abortions .
As recent as 25 years ago , most doctors took the Hippocratic Oath .
They pledged never to perform an abortion .
Tragically , many working in the medical profession today betray your trust by renouncing this ethic .
Many know the truth but do not inform you that " birth control " devices are abortifacients which cause abortions .
Did you know abortion was defined in a Public Health Service document published by the U.S. Department of Health , Education and Welfare as follows : " All the measures which impair the viability of the zygote anytime between the instant of fertilization and the completion of labor constitute , in the strict sense , procedures for inducing abortion " ( source : Public Health Service Leaflet no .
1066 , US Dept of Health , Education , and Welfare , 1963 , 27 ) .
This includes chemical abortions like those caused by the Pill , Depo - Provera and Norplant .
Now That You Know The Truth . . .
If you have used these products , this is very sobering news .
Pharmaceutical companies and medical providers have made many parents unwitting accomplices to their own children 's death by birth control abortion .
The Pill and its " cousins " kill children earlier in their life than surgical abortion .
In America , chemical abortions are estimated to kill more than 7 million babies each year -- while surgical abortions kill about 1.5 million babies each year .
What will you do ?
Scientists agree that a new human life begins at the moment of conception .
If you believe this , then you know that abortion is wrong no matter how early in the pregnancy .
Now that you know the facts , statistics show that if you continue using abortifacient products , you will be aborting ( killing ) your own children each year .
Do more research if you need to , but please stop using abortifacient chemicals immediately .
( If you want to investigate further , another web site that contains more research and much greater detail is listed at the end of this article .
It is highly recommended that you go to that web site today or sometime soon . )
Healing & Forgiveness !
If you have used these products -- there is a very real possibility that you unknowingly aborted one or more of your tiny sons or daughters .
Please do not despair !
Know that you may receive comfort in your sorrow .
If you did not know these " birth control " products cause early abortions , then you are not " culpable . "
This means you 're not morally responsible in God 's eyes .
And because you did not know the true consequences of chemical " birth control " products , you will not be held morally responsible for any harm they may have caused .
Remember , for anyone to commit a sinful act , all three of the following circumstances must be present :
1 ) The act must break one of God 's Laws ,
2 ) The person must know they are breaking God 's Law , and
3 ) The person must freely choose to break God 's Law with their own free will .
Again , if you 've used " birth control " pills and you were unaware of the consequences , God will not hold you morally accountable .
Our God is a merciful , loving Father .
He will only judge us based on our knowledge of right and wrong .
And when we do wrong ,
He 's always ready to forgive us -- no matter how serious the sin .
At the same time , He has given us guidelines to protect us and to help us be happy .
And now that you know the truth about " birth control " pills -- if you 're using them -- is n't it time to stop ?
God calls on each of us to avoid and eliminate all sin from our lives .
Please think about the day in the future when you will meet your Maker face to face .
On that day , if you continue using chemical abortifacients after you read this information , He will ask you , " Why ? "
Why not stop today ?
Why not purify your soul by receiving God 's healing Grace ?
God will forgive us for our past sins , no matter how serious they are , but only if we sincerely ask for His forgiveness with a humble , repentant heart , while also being firmly resolved not to commit the sin again .
Our God is merciful , forgiving and gracious to all who repent .
No problem is so great that the God who created us cannot solve it .
Saint Paul wrote about God 's great mercy for sinners in a letter to Timothy .
He said , " Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners -- of whom I am the worst .
But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me , the worst of sinners , Christ Jesus might display
His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on Him and receive eternal life . "
( 1st Timothy , 1:15 - 16 ) Final Notes . . .
It is important that you seek spiritual direction from your priest or pastor regarding decisions about your family and the dreadful effects of artificial contraception .
Please feel free to print a copy of this article to bring with you when you go to meet with your pastor .
Ask him if he understands the destructive and sinful nature of the Pill and other forms of artificial contraception .
And please remember , if you are a Catholic , the Catholic Church offers God 's mercy and forgiveness in a beautiful way through the Sacrament of Reconciliation ( Confession ) .
If you 've committed a serious sin , you should go to confession right away .
Priests are very understanding and they are there to help you .
Confession is a great place to begin the process of forgiveness and healing .
Go ahead and go today -- you 'll feel like a ton of bricks was lifted off your shoulders .
Natural Family Planning . . .
Natural Family Planning ( NFP ) is a healthy alternative to artificial birth control .
With NFP , there are no drugs , no devices , no surgical procedures , no threat of death , no side effects and no chemical abortions .
NFP is not the old Rhythm Method that was developed in the 1930's .
NFP has been thoroughly tested and is proven to be highly effective .
NFP is only recommended for married couples who have some burden ( financial , emotional , health or other ) causing them to need to space or limit the size of their family .
It is suggested that you speak with your pastor or a spiritual director for spiritual guidance in this area .
Reports show NFP to be about 99 % effective in determining when a woman is at the stage where she will conceive .
This can help with trying to get pregnant as well as trying to avoid pregnancy .
" Using NFP has been a blessing !
We have found a greater appreciation for being able to make love .
We also are learning other ways to express our love . . . " -- E.M. , Ohio " . . .
Wonderful for our marriage .
We are comfortable using it . . . " -- L.L. , Iowa

Cover Changing the Rules Most cyclists already treat stop signs as yields without incident .
Why not make it official ?
By Sean Burak
Published June 27 , 2007
When people think of transportation reform , the immediate feeling is that it will take too long , cost too much , and be too difficult for the general public to commit to .
However , shifting the transportation paradigm in our city does not have to be expensive .
There are several things we can do right now , for very little money , and with immediate benefits to everyone in Hamilton ( and the surrounding regions ) .
Most would agree that there are severe problems with the current transportation system .
The recent pedestrian deaths in our city are a clear indication of the meager safety levels of our roads .
Regular air quality warnings leave no question that we are pumping too many smog - forming chemicals into the air on a daily basis , the majority of which come from the tailpipes of our automobiles .
We can't afford to wait any longer : we need to make changes now .
Strength in Numbers
The best way to reduce the number of injuries to pedestrians and cyclists is to increase the number of pedestrians and cyclists on the road .
This is counterintuitive , since we would expect to see more injuries within a given group as the group size is increased .
The reasoning behind this unexpected result is that motorists become more aware and more respectful of cyclists and pedestrians if they encounter more of them on a daily basis .
Additionally , an increase in human - powered transportation generally results in a decrease in car use - and automobile involvement is the major factor in almost every case of pedestrian or cyclist injury .
Likelihood of an injury decreases as walking or bicycling increases .
( Image Source : injuryprevention.bmj.com )
A neat side effect of increasing pedestrian and cyclist activity is a reduction in emissions due to the decrease in automobile kilometres travelled .
Reducing the number of car drivers will also directly save lives : in the year 2000 [ PDF ] , 77.7 percent of the people killed on Canada 's roads were drivers or passengers , 12.6 percent were pedestrians , and only 1.4 percent were cyclists .
Clearly , one of the most important things we can do to improve the safety of our roads ( and reduce the overall impact of daily travel ) is to get as many people as possible out of their cars and onto their legs .
While many approaches to acheiving this goal cost vast amounts of money , the cheapest solution ( and the one we should start with ) is to change local laws such that they encourage these transporation methods and discourage vehicle use .
Specific Laws for Specific Users
We already have many traffic laws which differentiate between different types of vehicles .
Based on their size and manoevreability , trucks have extra restrictions regarding where they can go and what they can do .
Buses are often allowed to pass through intersections and utilize lanes where other vehicles are restricted .
Transit lanes , carpool lanes , truck routes , taxi zones , bike lanes and pedestrian crossings are all examples of laws which cater to specific road users .
Most traffic laws exist for the primary purpose of protecting the safety of travellers .
On the other hand , there are some laws which exist purely to provide convenience and to speed the flow of traffic .
Examples of such laws include specialty lanes for taxis and buses , advanced green lights and permitting turns on red lights .
If we want to entice people toward riding and walking , we need to strengthen the safety - oriented laws and beef up their enforcement .
We also need to shift the convenience - oriented laws from being car - centric to being human - centric .
We need to recognize that cyclists are not cars and pedestrians are not cars - and we need to change the rules of the road to reflect these facts .
Pedestrian - Friendly Possibilities
It is no wonder that people are afraid to take to the sidewalks in our town .
Most of our streets look like highways , feel like highways , and attract driving habits to match .
We need to consider seriously some new laws that would heavily promote their safety :
Give pedestrians right of way at all intersections , and reprogram light cycles where possible .
Give pedestrians time to cross streets in a safe manner , and reduce their wait times .
Allow parking on high - speed streets , especially those whose sidewalks abut the road .
This will provide a buffer between potentially dangerous cars and the unprotected pedestrians .
Reduce the speed limits throughout the city .
We will soon be surrounded on all sides by highways .
We need to ensure that all of the highway mentality stays on the highways .
Disallow turns on red lights .
Allowing turns on red lights creates situations in which cars are moving through crosswalks where pedestrians may not expect them to be .
An advantage shared between all of these law changes is not only an increase in convenience and safety for pedestrians , but a decrease in convenience for motorists , which is exactly what we need to be aiming for .
In addition , we need to ensure that all future development is pedestrian friendly .
This should happen through vast changes to the building code and bylaws , including :
Reduce or completely remove the arcane parking requirements for new businesses .
Allow for higher density living arrangements in all neighbourhoods .
Allow ( and in fact , encourage ) mixed use development , so that residents can access all essential services within a few blocks intead of having to drive across town .

Selling it to Cyclists
Getting more people onto bicycles has the potential to create an even larger positive impact on the transportation system as a whole .
Since a cyclist 's range ( and speed ) is much greater than that of a pedestrian , people will be more likely to replace their car with a bike than simply to walk everywhere .
While the measures listed above will benefit bikers as well as pedestrians , we need to work even harder to protect cyclists and encourage cycling as much as possible .
Unfortunately , the traffic code currently treats bicycles as second - class citizens .
Since it is horribly dangerous to ride a bike on sidewalks ( both to the rider and to pedestrians ) , it makes sense to ride bikes on the road .
The rules of the road , however , were written with cars in mind - and we have tried to apply these rules to cyclists as if they were cars .
It is a simple fact that bikes are not cars .
A bicycle ( with rider ) weighs a fraction of even the smallest car ( even when empty ) .
A cyclist has no physical protection from surrounding vehicles .
A bicycle has no engine with which the operator can zoom away to evade a dangerous situation .
A bike is n't equivalent to a car any more than a car is equivalent to a train .
It is time to change the laws governing bikes - for the cyclists ' safety and for the good of our community .
Once again , it is possible to make cycling a much more attractive alternative without the huge expenditures required when creating dedicated lanes , installing traffic calming devices , and cutting specialized trails through the city ( although these would be great too ) .
It is possible - and desireable - simply to change some existing traffic laws to favour cyclists over cars :
Allow cyclists to treat red lights as if they were stop signs .
A cyclist stops on a red , and proceeds when the intersection is clear .
Allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs .
A cyclist slows down when approaching a stop sign , stops if another vehicle is approaching , and proceeds when safe .
While these two proposed changes will provoke very strong knee - jerk reactions from most motorists , they have actually been practised successfully for quite some time in other jurisdictions ( such as the state of Idaho ) .
The following arguments should also be considered :
Most cyclists treat all intersections in this manner now and cause a statistically tiny number of incidents .
By making the most common choice legal , and by making the legal choice the most convenient one , we can be sure that almost all cyclists will follow the new rules .
This will make the cyclist / car interaction at intersections much more consistent , and will remove the guesswork currently required by motorists when they reach an intersection alongside a bike .
We already rely on motorists to use their discretion when turning right on a red light - it is up to them to decide when it 's safe to proceed .
These new laws would extend this " trust of the operator " to cyclists , at the same time giving them a slightly higher degree of freedom .
Cyclists are in a much better position to judge the safety of an intersection .
They sit higher than most cars , and can stand to get a better view .
They have no engine or passenger compartment blocking out traffic noise , and their relatively light weight allows them to stop in much less time and distance than a car .
Stop signs and lights were designed specifically to control the flow of car traffic , primarily due to the safety threats they pose .
They were not designed to accommodate cyclists , whose potential to inflict damage on others is miniscule in comparison to even the most compact of cars .
Frequent stopping is physically demanding and highly detrimental to cyclists , who must rely on their own muscles to return to cruising speed .
For example , the average speed of a typical rider on a street with stop signs every 90 metres will be 40 percent lower than on one with no stops .
Alternatively , to maintin the same average speed , the rider will have to use five times as much muscle energy [ PDF ] .
Cyclists tend to aviod routes that require frequent stops , yet these routes are typically the safest for them .
By allowing cyclists to use their judgement at each intersection , they will be more likely to choose the safe route regardless of the number of stop signs , and they will be less likely to ride on the major corridors where there are no stops .
Encouraging cyclists to move off of the major streets will also benefit drivers , since there will be fewer occasions where a motorist has to slow down to safely pass a bicycle .
It is much easier to make already - safe streets more attractive to cyclists than it is to make dangerous streets safer .
Mock - up of potential signage that could be used to make the new laws clear to all road users .
Which Laws and When
As part of a long term strategy to increase cycling and walking , simple law changes are the fastest and cheapest solution , and should be implemented as a first step .
We should start with promoting the pedestrian to king of the road , and give them right of way everywhere .
We should follow that by changing the laws at intersections for cyclists .
We can then proceed with lowering speed limits , eliminating turns on reds for cars , and bylaw changes , since these will likely take much longer to be accepted and applied .
Once we have the foundation set in terms of laws , we can get serious about changing the face of transportation in this city through physical construction projects such as traffic calming , transit improvements and walkable neighbourhoods .
The geography of this city is perfect for creating a beautiful transportation system that takes everyone 's needs into account .
Let 's stop talking about it and start making it a reality .

McClaren and wife Kathryn leave the venue of the news conference
Assistant coach Terry Venables has also lost his job in what the Football Association said was a unanimous decision by its board .
The FA brought a swift end to McClaren 's 18 - match reign as England 's head coach at an emergency meeting .
McClaren 's position had become untenable after the 3 - 2 defeat to Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday .
McClaren said at a news conference on Thursday that losing the England manager 's job was " the saddest day in my career " .
" Eighteen months ago [ when I was appointed ] was the proudest day of my career and I was honoured to be the England head coach and for 18 months I 've enjoyed every minute .
606 : DEBATE
" It is a sad day to have been relieved of my duties but I understand the decision of the FA .
" I have huge disappointment for the nation and fans .
But I will learn from my failure , " added McClaren .
His failure to qualify for Euro 2008 cost him his job , said FA chief executive Brian Barwick .
" I spoke to Steve this morning - we get on very well with him .
I 've had many grown - up conversations and had another one with him this morning - and I can only wish him well .
But in the end , not qualifying for Euro 2008 comes up short , " said Barwick .
McClaren 's reign was the shortest tenure of any England coach .
FA chairman Geoff Thompson said : " Like every England fan , we are all bitterly disappointed that we have failed to qualify for Euro 2008 , and I know Steve feels that disappointment more than anyone .
" Of course we have no divine right to play in major tournaments , but it is quite right that qualification is expected .
" I would like to thank Steve for the work he has done since taking on the position last summer .
His commitment to the job could not be questioned and I wish him the best for the future .
" The recruitment process for the new coach begins now and we will do everything to get the right man for the job . "
McClaren , 46 , who had a four - year deal , is expected to be paid more than £ 2 m in compensation and ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and Martin O'Neill were the bookies ' early favourites to succeed him .
However , former Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello was first to declare an interest in the job .
We have let the fans down , and I apologise for that
FA chief executive Brian Barwick
BBC football correspondent Jonathan Legard said : " There will be plenty of pressure within the media to have Martin O'Neill but the FA may feel that is a backwards step - he was n't good enough when McClaren was appointed , so is he the one to take England forward now ? "
The FA has plenty of time to search for a replacement with the next scheduled fixture a friendly in France at the end of March .
Barwick confirmed that nationality would not be an issue as he leads the search to find McClaren 's successor .
He also admitted that errors were made in the selection process when McClaren was appointed in May 2006 .
" The recruitment process for the new coach begins now and we will do everything to get the right man for the job , " said Barwick .
" It will be done differently .
We 've got to learn lessons from the way we did it . "
" Qualification for a major tournament is probably a minimum requirement . "
Barwick also said he did not regret giving McClaren a four - year contract .
" The contract is a private contract .
I do n't regret that now ; I think he has tried very hard . "
FA board director and Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards defended Barwick , saying : " Brian has taken a lot of stick about him being the sole person to appoint McClaren .
" This responsibility has to be shared among us all .
It 's unfair to say he was Brian 's man - he was the FA 's man . "
On the issue of the number of overseas players in the top flight , Richards added : " You would know as well as anybody that the Premier League is the best in the world , because it has the best stars in the world .
" There are also rules in the European Union that allow players to come , and clubs will pick the best stars . "
The financial loss to the FA of not qualifying is less than £ 5 m
FA chief executive Brian Barwick
Barwick said he felt embarrassed and disappointed about the situation .
" I 'd like to apologise to the fans personally .
" I care about this passionately , it has never been just a job .
I 'm in it because I care about football , football fans and football teams .
" Last night was a tough , tough night .
We care about this very much .
I understand we have let them down and apologise for that . "
Former Middlesbrough boss McClaren admitted before the Croatia match that he would " take responsibility " if England failed to reach the European Championship finals in Austria and Switzerland .
The FA took action to dismiss McClaren ahead of the 2010 World Cup qualifying draw in Durban , South Africa , on Sunday .
England 's failure to reach a major tournament for the first time since the 1994 World Cup finals will cost the FA no more than £ 5 m in lost revenues , said Barwick .
Thompson promised the FA would conduct a " root - and - branch " review of the England team set - up , and that would be led by chief executive Brian Barwick with immediate effect .
ATLANTA --
An NAACP leader said Michael Vick should be allowed to return to the
NFL , preferably the Atlanta Falcons , after serving his sentence for
his role in a dogfighting operation .
" As a society , we should aid in his rehabilitation and welcome
a new Michael Vick back into the community without a permanent loss
of his career in football , " said R.L .
White , president of the
NAACP 's Atlanta chapter .
" We further ask the NFL , Falcons , and the
sponsors not to permanently ban Mr. Vick from his ability to bring
hours of enjoyment to fans all over this country . "
White said the Falcons quarterback is a human being who has made
a mistake and should be allowed to prove that he has learned from
that mistake .
On Monday , Vick said through a lawyer that he will plead guilty
to a federal charge of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce
in aid of unlawful activities and conspiracy to sponsor a dog in an
animal fighting venture .
Three Vick associates have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy
charge and say Vick provided nearly all the gambling and operating
funds for the " Bad Newz Kennels " dogfighting enterprise .
Two of
them also said Vick participated in executing at least eight
underperforming dogs , raising the possibility of the animal cruelty
charges .

One of the most heavily criticized actions in the aftermath of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 was the decision , barely two months later , to disband the Iraqi army , alienating former soldiers and driving many straight into the ranks of anti-American militant groups .
But excerpts of a new biography of President Bush show him saying that he initially wanted to maintain the Iraqi army and , more surprising , that he cannot recall why his administration decided to disband it .
“ The policy was to keep the army intact ; did n’t happen , ” Bush told biographer Robert Draper in excerpts published in Sunday ’s New York Times .
Draper pressed Bush to explain why , if he wanted to maintain the army , his chief administrator for Iraq , L. Paul Bremer III , issued an order in May 2003 disbanding the 400,000 - strong army without pay .

“ Yeah , I ca n’t remember ; I ’m sure I said , ‘ This is the policy , what happened ? ’ ” Bush said , adding : “ Again , Hadley ’s got notes on all this stuff ” -- a reference to national security advisor Stephen J. Hadley .
Spokesmen for the White House and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld declined to comment about the excerpts Sunday .
Bremer could not be reached for comment .
Douglas J. Feith , then undersecretary of Defense for policy and an architect of the Iraq invasion , said the excerpts raised interesting questions about how the pivotal decision was made .
Feith was deeply involved in the decision - making process at the time , working closely with Bush and Bremer .

In February 2003 , the month before the invasion , Feith briefed Bush about plans Rumsfeld had signed off on to maintain the Iraqi army .
The assumption at the time , based on information provided by the CIA , was that the army would remain intact after the invasion , Feith said .
Instead , Iraqi officers fled their posts , which were ransacked and looted .
U.S. officials inherited a military that would have to be overhauled or abandoned , Feith said in an interview Sunday , and they opted for the latter .
Feith said he could not comment about how involved the president was in the decision to change policy and dissolve the army .
“ I do n’t know all the details of who talked to who about that , ” he said .
Advertisement
But he said the decision warrants scrutiny .
“ I know there are people out there who say one of the most significant decisions the United States made [ in Iraq ] was the dissolution of the Iraqi army , ” Feith said .
“ So it ’s an interesting question .
But very often on these things , until everybody writes memoirs and all the researchers look at the documents , some of these things are hard to sort out .
You could be in the thick of it and not necessarily know all the details . ”
Feith , a visiting professor at Georgetown University , is the author of a forthcoming memoir , “ War and Decision , ” about his work in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Draper ’s book “ Dead Certain ” is to be released Tuesday .

Keith Olbermann : What to do when O'Reillyists attack Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This " The Bill O'Reilly saga continues , " said Keith Olbermann on Monday , adding that " the principal issue now is how to defend yourself from O'Reilly unplugged . "
Olbermann explained that Bill O'Reilly has responded to coverage of last week 's story about his racist remarks after visiting a black restaurant " by threatening to ' come after , hunt down ' all those who criticized him , adding he fantasized about ' strangling ' all of us . "
Olbermann then promised to use " state of the art video techniques " to show how to defend yourself " when an O'Reillyist attacks , " pointing out that " Mr. O'Reilly 's reference to hunting you down and coming after you is a dead giveaway that he plans another onslaught of attacks by his stalker producers . "
Olbermann illustrated what he meant by showing Fox News video of one of their people approaching NBC military analyst Bill Arkin as he was loading his car up in a parking lot and asking him , " Could I talk to you about some of the comments that you made ? ...
How could you say what you said ?
Do n't you think that was really hurtful and harmful to the military families ? "
" The safest thing to do is to assume that Bill is sending one of these junior jagoffs with a camera to stalk us , " Olbermann continued .
" So if we know they 're coming , how do we protect ourselves ?
How do we keep Bill - O from getting anything he would want , or even legally could put on the air ? "
Olbermann then introduced " a special segment we call ' How to talk to Bill O'Reilly 's stalker - producer in a way that guarantees the interview does not get on the air ! ' "
He began by showing three clips of himself being approached in a parking lot by someone representing a Fox producer in order to dramatize all the wrong responses .
" Intellectual , physical , or scatological arguments are just not going to work , " Olbermann stated .
" You 're being ambushed by Bill O'Reilly 's minion from Hell .
You have to fight fire with fire .
You -- as in example number four -- ambush back . "
He then provided three more clips illustrating the strategic use of references to Malmedy , Andrea Makris or loofahs -- all keywords to particularly embarrassing incidents in O'Reilly 's past .
" And there you have it , " concluded Olbermann .
" When the O'Reilly minion comes to your door to wreak revenge by proxy because Bill is too scared to try to do it himself , just keep your wits about you and keep those three words in your head .
Repeat them in any combination , intelligible or not , and you will be safe when the O'Reillyist attack inevitably comes .
Malmedy .
Makris . Loofah . "

ROME ( Reuters ) - Italian archaeologists believe they have found the cave where , according to legend , a she - wolf nursed Romulus and Remus , the twin founders of Rome .
An underground cavity decorated with seashells , colored marble mosaics and pumice stones was discovered near the ruins of the palace of Emperor Augustus on the Palatine hill .
Experts say they are “ reasonably certain ” it is the long - lost place of worship sacred to ancient Romans and known as Lupercale , from the Latin word for wolf .
“ This could reasonably be the place bearing witness to the myth of Rome , one of the most well - known in the world , the legendary cave where the she - wolf suckled Romulus and Remus , ” Culture Minister Francesco Rutelli told a news conference on Tuesday .
The cave was found 16 meters ( 52 feet ) underground in a previously unexplored area during restoration work on the palace of Augustus , the first Roman emperor .
Archaeologists investigating Renaissance descriptions of the sanctuary used a camera probe and the images suggest the vault , which has a white eagle at the centre , is well - preserved .
“ You can imagine our amazement , we almost screamed , ” said Giorgio Croci , head of the archaeological team working on the restoration of the Palatine hill overlooking the Roman forum .
According to the myth , Romulus and Remus , the twin sons of the god Mars , were abandoned in a cradle by the banks of the river Tiber where a wolf found them and fed them with her milk .
The brothers are said to have founded Rome at the site on April 21 , 753 B.C. and ended up fighting over who should be in charge .
Romulus killed Remus and became the first king of Rome .
SACRED SITE
Archaeologists said the location of the cave reinforced their belief that it was the Lupercale .
“ It is clear that Augustus ... wanted his residence to be built in a place which was sacred for the city of Rome , ” said Croci .
The emperor restored the sanctuary and probably connected it to his own palace , he said .
Finding out more about the cave without damaging it or the foundations of the surrounding ruins will not be easy .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
More than two - thirds of the cavity , which is about 8 meters high and 7 meters wide , is filled with debris and earth after part of it collapsed , and it is not clear where the entrance is .
“ We have to investigate with extreme caution ...
This is a precious thing which is certainly more than 2,000 years old , ” said Croci .
Andrea Carandini , an archaeologist specializing in ancient Rome , said he was stunned by the find and called it “ one of the most significant discoveries ever made ” .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The pagan cult of the Lupercale , which involved men whipping women around the Palatine in a fertility rite , continued until the fifth century , when Pope Gelasius I banned it .
Long accused of neglecting its ancient treasures , the Italian government is spending 12 million euros ( $ 17.7 million ) to restore the Palatine ruins .
After being closed for decades due to the risk of collapse , Augustus ’s palace will reopen to the public in February 2008 .
Borrow a few kids .
An infant , a toddler , and a pre-schooler would be good .
Put them in house with intern Ben .
Have him get up at five , get the kids up , fed , bathed , dressed , and ready for day - care , which is , of course at three different locations .
Get them there , on time , and him to work , on time while simultaneously taking care of his aging stand - in parent who can't care for himself .
Who also lives there .
Have him work a monster day , while having to go pick up the kids , one at a time , about two hours apart , because they have all caught something from each other .
Have him get home , cook supper , wipe runny noses / bottoms / mouths / other orifices while also feeding / wiping orifices of aging parent .
Laundry has to be done , cause kids have gotten sick all over the clean clothes .
They have to be bathed again , same reason .
And they need medicine , so they all have to be bundled up and taken to the drug store .
And he has to catch up on his work at home since he had to leave the office several times .
He has a deadline to meet at work .
Get the kids fed / clean again / medicated and in bed .
By then it will be about 12 am .
If he 's lucky , the baby will sleep a few hours before he 's up at 3 to feed it , then up at 5 a.m to start all over again .
Welcome to the world of very many single and working women .
Computing Thoughts
The End of the Vista Experiment
by Bruce Eckel
December 25 , 2007
Summary
Over a year ago , I bought a new computer .
This was a carefully considered decision , as I do n't change computers that often and so try to get something I will be satisfied with for as long as possible .
Advertisement
The machine itself is a marvel : A silent computer , completely fanless ( from http://www.endpcnoise.com).
It weighs a lot because it 's basically a big finned heat sink , with heat pipes connecting to the motherboard .
Future upgrades will definitely not be replacing this case ( A TNN500AF ) , but just swapping out processors or boards .
Years ago , in order to run concurrency experiments , I got a dual - processor machine that had so many fans it was like being at the aft end of a jet engine ; I even took to wearing ear defenders while programming .
Since then I have been much more aware of noise in my computers .
My father even built me a special desk with an insulated cubbyhole for the computer , but the ventilation fans for that box turned out to be no quieter ( the cubbyhole is now being retooled for conventional drawers ) .
Subsequently , I discovered the fanless machine ( which also has two processors , but as dual cores rather than separate boards ) .
Whereas the agile approach would be to try out one small experiment at a time , I am prone to overreaching .
I change these things so infrequently , I think , that I might as well move to the latest and greatest MS OS in the process .
This was not so rash a decision as it might seem ; the process of installing new software is consuming enough that not doing it twice ( once for a new machine , and again later for a new OS ) constitutes significant time savings .
Since the old XP system was still working , the Vista experiment on the new box became a side project in which I occasionally dabbled .
There were definite incompatibilities : I had to upgrade the machine 's BIOS by downloading and flashing new code into an EEPROM , which was fairly straightforward but not really designed for the average computer user .
Some drivers had to be chased down .
There may have been a hardware incompatibility in the sound card , or the sound card may have just failed at the same time I was installing Vista ; in either case the company that built the machine sent me a new one .
Eventually , Vista booted .
Over the past six months I 've used it effectively for exactly one thing : pulling video from my camera and making DVDs .
The program that does this came with my version of Vista ( I do n't know if it comes with all versions ) and it does it quite well ; in fact , the only flaw I found in the Macbook was that its video creation program did n't quite recognize my video camera ( it saw the camera , just could n't properly download the video ) .
Leopard will probably work correctly , and in any event XP also has a DVD creation program , possibly the same one .
Also about a year ago , I was setting my dad up with some new software that involved a Java applet for printing postage .
His machine , which was ancient but still quite functional , took so long to load and start this applet that we thought it had hung .
I decided it was time for a new one , went to Costco and bought what they had , which was a Gateway dual - core Vista machine .
It was all preconfigured and preinstalled so it seemed to work fine -- but kind of sluggish considering what a huge improvement in hardware it is over his previous machine .
Dad complained about the new UI for awhile but eventually got used to it .
One thing I notice is that his disk seems to be working all the time -- Vista performing mysterious tasks in the background .
So yes , it works for him .
It 's tolerable .
But it also seems like we 're going in the wrong direction ; progress either slowed or going slightly backwards .
You do n't really get a sense of any big improvement in the OS , which is n't surprising since they ripped all the interesting stuff out ( the new file system , etc. ) .
The chrome is prettier , but that wears thin fast .
And in exchange , you get software compatibility problems .
There will be the inevitable comments to this story saying " why do n't you just quit Windows altogether ? "
Indeed , my experiment with the Macbook has been quite successful and I have taken to traveling with it quite happily ( at first I thought I 'd need to carry a Windows notebook as well , but that has yet to be an issue ) .
And I 've just installed Parallels and XP within Parallels , and that seems to work fine as much as I 've tried it .
So there 's a lot of promise there ; I could even imagine just having a desktop Mac ( one of those 8 processor ones ) and doing all my Windows work inside Parallels .
Linux is also attractive .
At Javapolis I heard talk that Acer is releasing a $ 300 Linux subnotebook with a Flash disk ( no hard drive ) , and it sounds like it will have no hiccups when suspending and resuming .
That will be worth buying just to play with .
I 'm still tied to Windows because certain software tools only work on Windows .
Although OpenOffice is great , its word processor can't handle documents the size of a book ( initially it would crash , now it does n't but it runs so slowly it 's unusable ) .
MS
Word is still the only word processor that can produce camera - ready documents that are book - sized ( Yes , I do know about all the two - step approaches : " just write it using this one tool , and lay it out using this other one . "
It 's only efficient when you say it like that , not in reality ) .
Camtasia is another tool that only seems to run on Windows , and it has recently become important to me .
Then there are all the programs around the edges , both payware and freeware , that have been written for the largest market and not yet ported to the other machines .
I use enough of those that it 's still useful to have a Windows box running .
They may in fact run on a Mac , but now I have this big heavy silent machine ( applying the " sunk cost " economic model ) .
But back to Vista .
I kept putting off the transition , partly because I kept hearing about problems people were having .
I did n't want to try moving over to the new machine only to discover that several key pieces of software did n't work on it right in the midst of an important project .
So I put it off , and eventually came up with the idea of using a Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) disk as a transition device .
All my data files would go on the NAS disk , and if I discovered I could n't do something on the Vista machine , I could just fire up the old XP box and work on the same files .
Although I got the NAS disk , I ( fortunately ) did n't go through with the plan .
My brother Todd is a sole proprietor who keeps small business systems up and running in San Diego and the surrounding area .
He 's on the ground all the time and knows what 's happening with both hardware and software .
He 's a target for canvassing by Microsoft in their attempts to figure out how to get people to " accept " Vista .
( They went as far as to try to educate him about how to " market against Linux . "
Todd shrugs and says " Why do I care about marketing against Linux ?
If Linux is better I 'll install that . " ) .
So if there are problems , Todd knows about them .
Vista has problems .
A number of business programs require a ( paid ) upgrade to work on Vista ; you can't just reinstall your existing programs .
This is after paying for the heftier hardware and for the OS that slows it down without producing a discernible benefit .
After that you do n't know if you 'll have to pay more to upgrade other software .
Or worse , whether you 'll even be able to get a version of the program at all that will work on Vista .
Years of FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt , generally spread by larger companies in an attempt to prevent positive changes fomented by smaller companies or sometimes just groups of people ) in the computer industry have come home to roost , this time on Microsoft 's doorstep .
Microsoft 's traditional approach has been to create something buggy in order to hold the market space , then to fix it with subsequent service packs .
It 's possible that Vista Service Pack 1 will arrive in time to save the day , and if that happens it will certainly be an amazing recovery .
But in the meantime , Vista has become a disaster : both as a product , and even more as the once - legendary Microsoft marketing team goes down in flames .
But really , what could those marketers do when the majority of consumers can easily discover that there 's " no there , there ? "

" Vista , both with and without SP1 , performed notably slower than XP with SP3 in the test , taking over 80 seconds to complete the test , compared to the beta SP3 - enhanced XP 's 35 seconds . "
[ So it looks like Vista SP1 is n't really going to do anything about the speed problem , and we can expect less than half the performance of XP for at least another year . ]

" Any operating system that provokes a campaign for its predecessor 's reintroduction deserves to be classed as terrible technology .
Any operating system that quietly has a downgrade - to- previous - edition option introduced for PC makers deserves to be classed as terrible technology .
Any operating system that takes six years of development but is instantly hated by hordes of PC professionals and enthusiasts deserves to be classed as terrible technology . "

" While Vista was originally touted by Microsoft as the operating system savior we 've all been waiting for , it has turned out to be one of the biggest blunders in technology ...
Microsoft has once again lost sight of what we really want . "
The torrent of stories expressing disappointment with Vista only seems to grow .
Operating systems account for 1/3 of Microsoft 's income , and Office accounts for another third .
Although I'm ( so far ) still stuck using Word , I 've become very reluctant to upgrade to new versions .
In the past , I would upgrade when Word started crashing too badly , but at some point it became reasonably stable .
But it 's as if there 's no more work for the Office group to do , so instead they rearrange features in the products .
One version , style sheets are fairly quick to access , the next version they completely change it around so you have to learn and remember an entirely new sequence which is not particularly intuitive .
These " improvements " come from their so - called " usability lab " where they are apparently testing out new features using golden retrievers ( who , in case you do n't know one , are enthusiastic about everything ) .
As a result , I resist upgrading to new versions of Office for as long as possible , because I know there will undoubtedly be a lot of hassle involved .
Better to stick with what you know than risk having your time sucked up by another Microsoft experiment .
What 's amazing is that the only really innovative operating system that has appeared in at least 25 years was crushed , probably with a lot of help from Microsoft while at the same time they were claiming to be innovative .
This was BeOS , and life would have been much better right about now if Microsoft had bought them instead , because it was designed around creating lots of processes , which would be awfully useful as multicores come online .
( BeOS has been resurrected in the open - source world as Haiku so there 's still hope , although I do n't have any sense of the state of that project ) .
So does this mean all the innovation has gone out of Microsoft ?
No , I do n't think so .
For one thing , I think C# and .NET are significant improvements in programming , and what I 've seen of Silverlight is quite impressive ( Silverlight is included in the upcoming RIA Jam in Ann Arbor , January 14 - 16 ) ; if I knew that I was only going to live in a Microsoft world I would definitely be moving in that direction .
In fact , I can only see hope for Microsoft in the OS world if they create an operating system which is basically .NET sitting on a thin layer of hardware glue .
That would be a big step forward ; innovative , even .
And I recently made a fast pass through cell phone technology , which was largely disappointing when it comes to getting the phone to interact with your computer .
In that area , it looks like Windows Mobile is a strong contender .
But as far as my desktop OS , yesterday I reinstalled XP on the silent machine , and it does n't look like I 'm going to be trying Vista again until I hear some really , really good things about Service Pack 2 .
Basically , I 'm done experimenting with Microsoft OSes for at least a year and a half .

As she races through Iowa in the days before next week 's caucuses , Hillary Clinton is taking few chances .
She tells crowds that it ’s their turn to “ pick a president , ’’ but over the last two days she has not invited them to ask her any questions .
Before the brief Christmas break , the New York senator had been setting aside time after campaign speeches to hear from the audience .
Now when she ’s done speaking , her theme songs blare from loudspeakers , preventing any kind of public Q&A .
She was no more inviting when a television reporter approached her after a rally on Thursday and asked if she was “ moved ’ ’ by Benazir Bhutto ’s assassination .
Clinton turned away without answering .
Her daughter , Chelsea , had the same reaction when a reporter approached her with a question .
Hillary Clinton ’s no-question policy did n’t sit well with some of the Iowans who came to see her speak .
“ I was a little bit underwhelmed , ’’ said Doug Rohde , 46 , as he left a rally at a fire station in Denison .
“ The message was very generic -- and no questions . ’’
Clinton campaign officials said that she may take questions in the coming days .
But her focus is on seeing as many voters as possible before the caucuses next Thursday -- and spotlighting the messages she wants to deliver .
Spokespeople for her two main rivals in the Hawkeye State -– John Edwards and Barack Obama -– said the candidates would continue fielding questions as they troll for support .

-- Peter Nicholas
The latest National Intelligence Estimate has been greeted by a mixture of relief and alarm .
As I have been saying all along , Iran indeed poses no quantifiable imminent nuclear threat to us or her neighbors .
It is with much alarm , however , that we see the administration continue to ratchet up the war rhetoric as if nothing has changed .
Indeed nothing has changed from the administration ’s perspective , as they have had this latest intelligence report for some time .
Only this week has it been made known to the public .
They want it both ways with Iran .
On the one hand , they discredit the report entirely , despite it being one of the most comprehensive intelligence reports on the subject , with over 1,000 source notes in the document .
On the other hand , when discrediting it fails , they claim that the timing of the abandonment of the weapons program , just as we were invading Iraq , means our pressure must have worked , so we must keep it up with a new round of even tougher sanctions .
Russia and China are not buying this , apparently , and again we are finding ourselves on a lonely , tenuous platform on the world stage .
The truth is Iran is being asked to do the logically impossible feat of proving a negative .
They are being presumed guilty until proven innocent because there is no evidence with which to indict them .
There is still no evidence that Iran , a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , has ever violated the treaty ’s terms  and the terms clearly state that Iran is allowed to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful civilian energy needs .
The United States cannot unilaterally change the terms of the treaty , and it is unfair and unwise diplomatically to impose sanctions for no legitimate reason .
Are we to think that Iran has n’t noticed the duplicitous treatment being received by so - called nuclear threats around the globe ?
If they have been paying attention , and I think they have , they would see that if countries do have a nuclear weapon , they tend to be left alone , or possibly get a subsidy , but if they do not gain such a weapon then we threaten them .
Why would n’t they want to pursue a nuclear weapon if that is our current foreign policy ?
The fact remains , there is no evidence they actually have one , or could have one any time soon , even if they immediately resumed a weapons program .
Our badly misguided foreign policy has already driven this country ’s economy to the brink of bankruptcy with one war based on misinformation .
It is unthinkable that despite the lack of any evidence of a threat , some are still charging headstrong into yet another war in the Middle East when what we ought to be doing is coming home from Iraq , coming home from Korea , coming home from Germany , and defending our own soil .
We do not need to be interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and waging war when honest trade , friendship , and diplomacy are the true paths to peace and prosperity .

You may or may not be aware that there is debate going on about the “ right ” way to implement heterogeneous application - to - application communication :
While the current mainstream clearly focuses on web services based on SOAP , WSDL and the WS -* specification universe , a small , but very vocal minority claims there ’s a better way : REST , short for REpresentational State Transfer .
In this article , I will try to provide a pragmatic introduction to REST and RESTful HTTP application integration without digressing into this debate .
I will go into more detail while explaining those aspects that , in my experience , cause the most discussion when someone is exposed to this approach for the first time .
Key REST principles
Most introductions to REST start with the formal definition and background .
I ’ll defer this for a while and provide a simplified , pragmatic definition : REST is a set of principles that define how Web standards , such as HTTP and URIs , are supposed to be used ( which often differs quite a bit from what many people actually do ) .
The promise is that if you adhere to REST principles while designing your application , you will end up with a system that exploits the Web ’s architecture to your benefit .
In summary , the five key principles are :
Give every “ thing ” an ID
Link things together
Use standard methods
Resources with multiple representations
Communicate statelessly
Let ’s take a closer look at each of these principles .
Give every “ thing ” an ID
Related Sponsored Content 3 Common Pitfalls in Microservice Integration – And How to Avoid Them
I ’m using the term “ thing ” here instead of the formally correct “ resource ” because this is such a simple principle that it should n’t be hidden behind terminology .
If you think about the systems that people build , there is usually a set of key abstractions that merit being identified .
Everything that should be identifiable should obviously get an ID — on the Web , there is a unified concept for IDs : The URI .
URIs make up a global namespace , and using URIs to identify your key resources means they get a unique , global ID .
The main benefit of a consistent naming scheme for things is that you do n’t have to come up with your own scheme — you can rely on one that has already been defined , works pretty well on global scale and is understood by practically anybody .
If you consider an arbitrary high - level object within the last application you built ( assuming it was n’t built in a RESTful way ) , it is quite likely that there are many use cases where you would have profited from this .
If your application included a Customer abstraction , for instance , I ’m reasonably sure that users would have liked to be able to send a link to a specific customer via email to a co-worker , create a bookmark for it in their browser , or even write it down on a piece of paper .
To drive home this point : Imagine what an awfully horrid business decision it would be if an online store such as Amazon.com did not identify every one of its products with a unique ID ( a URI ) .
When confronted with this idea , many people wonder whether this means they should expose their database entries ( or their IDs ) directly — and are often appalled by the mere idea , since years of object - oriented practice have told us to hide the persistence aspects as an implementation detail .
But this is not a conflict at all : Usually , the things — the resources — that merit being identified with a URI are far more abstract than a database entry .
For example , an Order resource might be composed of order items , an address and many other aspects that you might not want to expose as individually identifiable resources .
Taking the idea of identifying everything that is worth being identified further leads to the creation of resources that you usually do n’t see in a typical application design :
A process or process step , a sale , a negotiation , a request for a quote — these are all examples of “ things ” that merit identification .
This , in turn , can lead to the creation of more persistent entities than in a non-RESTful design .
Here are some examples of URIs you might come up with :
http://example.com/customers/1234
http://example.com/orders/2007/10/776654
http://example.com/products/4554
http://example.com/processes/salary-increase-234
As I ’ve chosen to create human - readable URIs — a useful concept , even though it ’s not a pre-requisite for a RESTful design — it should be quite easy to guess their meaning :
They obviously identify individual “ items ” .
But take a look at these :
http://example.com/orders/2007/11
http://example.com/products?color=green
At first , these appear to be something different — after all , they are not identifying a thing , but a collection of things ( assuming the first URI identifies all orders submitted in November 2007 , and the second one the set of green products ) .
But these collections are actually things — resources — themselves , and they definitely merit identification .
Note that the benefits of having a single , globally unified naming scheme apply both to the usage of the Web in your browser and to machine - to - machine communication .
To summarize the first principle : Use URIs to identify everything that merits being identifiable , specifically , all of the “ high - level ” resources that your application provides , whether they represent individual items , collections of items , virtual and physical objects , or computation results .
Link things together
The next principle we ’re going to look at has a formal description that is a little intimidating : “ Hypermedia as the engine of application state ” , sometimes abbreviated as HATEOAS .
( Seriously — I ’m not making this up . )
At its core is the concept of hypermedia , or in other words : the idea of links .
Links are something we ’re all familiar with from HTML , but they are in no way restricted to human consumption .
Consider the following made - up XML fragment :
< order self = ' http://example.com/customers/1234' > < amount >23</amount > < product ref='http://example.com/products/4554' /> < customer ref='http://example.com/customers/1234' /> </order >
If you look at the product and customer links in this document , you can easily imagine how an application that has retrieved it can “ follow ” the links to retrieve more information .
Of course , this would be the case if there were a simple “ id ” attribute adhering to some application - specific naming scheme , too — but only within the application ’s context .
The beauty of the link approach using URIs is that the links can point to resources that are provided by a different application , a different server , or even a different company on another continent — because the naming scheme is a global standard , all of the resources that make up the Web can be linked to each other .
There is an even more important aspect to the hypermedia principle — the “ state ” part of the application .
In short , the fact that the server ( or service provider , if you prefer ) provides a set of links to the client ( the service consumer ) enables the client to move the application from one state to the next by following a link .
We will look at the effects of this aspect in another article soon ; for the moment , just keep in mind that links are an extremely useful way to make an application dynamic .
To summarize this principles :
Use links to refer to identifiable things ( resources ) wherever possible .
Hyperlinking is what makes the Web the Web .
Use standard methods
There was an implicit assumption in the discussion of the first two principles : that the consuming application can actually do something meaningful with the URIs .
If you see a URI written on the side of a bus , you can enter it into your browser ’s address field and hit return — but how does your browser know what to do with the URI ?
It knows what to do with it because every resource supports the same interface , the same set of methods ( or operations , if you prefer ) .
HTTP calls these verbs , and in addition to the two everyone knows ( GET and POST ) , the set of standard methods includes PUT , DELETE , HEAD and OPTIONS .
The meaning of these methods is defined in the HTTP specification , along with some guarantees about their behavior .
If you are an OO developer , you can imagine that every resource in a RESTful HTTP scenario extends a class like this ( in some Java / C# - style pseudo - syntax and concentrating on the key methods ) :
class Resource { Resource ( URI u ) ; Response get ( ) ; Response post ( Request r ) ; Response put( Request r ) ; Response delete ( ) ; }
Because the same interface is used for every resource , you can rely on being able to retrieve a representation — i.e. , some rendering of it — using GET .
Because GET ’s semantics are defined in the specification , you can be sure that you have no obligations when you call it — this is why the method is called “ safe ” .
GET supports very efficient and sophisticated caching , so in many cases , you do n’t even have to send a request to the server .
You can also be sure that a GET is idempotent — if you issue a GET request and do n’t get a result , you might not know whether your request never reached its destination or the response got lost on its way back to you .
The idempotence guarantee means you can simply issue the request again .
Idempotence is also guaranteed for PUT ( which basically means “ update this resource with this data , or create it at this URI if it ’s not there already ” ) and for DELETE ( which you can simply try again and again until you get a result — deleting something that ’s not there is not a problem ) .
POST , which usually means “ create a new resource ” , can also be used to invoke arbitrary processing and thus is neither safe nor idempotent .
If you expose your application ’s functionality ( or service ’s functionality , if you prefer ) in a RESTful way , this principle and its restrictions apply to you as well .
This is hard to accept if you ’re used to a different design approach — after all , you ’re quite likely convinced that your application has much more logic than what is expressible with a handful operations .
Let me spend some time trying to convince you that this is not the case .
Consider the following example of a simple procurement scenario :
You can see that there are two services defined here ( without implying any particular implementation technology ) .
The interface to these services is specific to the task — it ’s an OrderManagement and CustomerManagement service we are talking about .
If a client wants to consume these services , it needs to be coded against this particular interface — there is no way to use a client that was built before these interfaces were specified to meaningfully interact with them .
The interfaces define the services ’ application protocol .
In a RESTful HTTP approach , you would have to get by with the generic interface that makes up the HTTP application protocol .
You might come up with something like this :
You can see that what have been specific operations of a service have been mapped to the standard HTTP methods — and to disambiguate , I have created a whole universe of new resources .
“ That ’s cheating ! ” , I hear you cry .
No - it ’s not .
A GET on a URI that identifies a customer is just as meaningful as a getCustomerDetails operation .
Some people have used a triangle to visualize this :
Imagine the three vertices as knobs that you can turn .
You can see that in the first approach , you have many operations and many kinds of data and a fixed number of “ instances ” ( essentially , as many as you have services ) .
In the second , you have a fixed number of operations , many kinds of data and many objects to invoke those fixed methods upon .
The point of this is to illustrate that you can basically express anything you like with both approaches .
Why is this important ?
Essentially , it makes your application part of the Web — its contribution to what has turned the Web into the most successful application of the Internet is proportional to the number of resources it adds to it .
In a RESTful approach , an application might add a few million customer URIs to the Web ; if it ’s designed the same way applications have been designed in CORBA times , its contribution usually is a single “ endpoint ” — comparable to a very small door that provides entry to a universe of resource only for those who have the key .
The uniform interface also enables every component that understands the HTTP application protocol to interact with your application .
Examples of components that benefit from this are generic clients such as curl and wget , proxies , caches , HTTP servers , gateways , even Google / Yahoo ! / MSN , and many more .
To summarize : For clients to be able to interact with your resources , they should implement the default application protocol ( HTTP ) correctly , i.e. make use of the standard methods GET , PUT , POST , DELETE .
Resources with multiple representations
We ’ve ignored a slight complication so far : how does a client know how to deal with the data it retrieves , e.g. as a result of a GET or POST request ?
The approach taken by HTTP is to allow for a separation of concerns between handling the data and invoking operations .
In other words , a client that knows how to handle a particular data format can interact with all resources that can provide a representation in this format .
Let ’s illustrate this with an example again .
Using HTTP content negotiation , a client can ask for a representation in a particular format :
GET / customers / 1234 HTTP/1.1
Host : example.com Accept : application/vnd.mycompany.customer+xml
The result might be some company - specific XML format that represents customer information .
If the client sends a different request , e.g. one like this :
GET / customers / 1234 HTTP/1.1
Host : example.com Accept : text /x-vcard
The result could be the customer address in VCard format .
( I have not shown the responses , which would contain metadata about the type of data in the HTTP Content - type header . )
This illustrates why ideally , the representations of a resource should be in standard formats — if a client “ knows ” both the HTTP application protocol and a set of data formats , it can interact with any RESTful HTTP application in the world in a very meaningful way .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have standard formats for everything , but you can probably imagine how one could create a smaller ecosystem within a company or a set of collaborating partners by relying on standard formats .
Of course all of this does not only apply to the data sent from the server to the client , but also for the reverse direction — a server that can consume data in specific formats does not care about the particular type of client , provided it follows the application protocol .
There is another significant benefit of having multiple representations of a resource in practice :
If you provide both an HTML and an XML representation of your resources , they are consumable not only by your application , but also by every standard Web browser — in other words , information in your application becomes available to everyone who knows how to use the Web .
There is another way to exploit this :
You can turn your application ’s Web UI into its Web API — after all , API design is often driven by the idea that everything that can be done via the UI should also be doable via the API .
Conflating the two tasks into one is an amazingly useful way to get a better Web interface for both humans and other applications .
Summary : Provide multiple representations of resources for different needs .
Communicate statelessly
The last principle I want to address is stateless communication .
First of all , it ’s important to stress that although REST includes the idea of statelessness , this does not mean that an application that exposes its functionally cannot have state — in fact , this would render the whole approach pretty useless in most scenarios .
REST mandates that state be either turned into resource state , or kept on the client .
In other words , a server should not have to retain some sort of communication state for any of the clients it communicates with beyond a single request .
The most obvious reason for this is scalability — the number of clients interacting would seriously impact the server ’s footprint if it had to keep client state .
( Note that this usually requires some re-design — you ca n’t simply stick a URI to some session state and call it RESTful . )
But there are other aspects that might be much more important :
The statelessness constraint isolates the client against changes on the server as it is not dependent on talking to the same server in two consecutive requests .
A client could receive a document containing links from the server , and while it does some processing , the server could be shut down , its hard disk could be ripped out and be replaced , the software could be updated and restarted — and if the client follows one of the links it has received from the server , it wo n’t notice .
REST in theory
I have a confession to make :
What I explained is not really REST , and I might get flamed for simplifying things a little too much .
But I wanted to start things a little differently than usual , so I did not provide the formal background and history of REST in the beginning .
Let me try to address this , if somewhat briefly .
First of all , I ’ve avoided taking great care to separate REST from HTTP itself and the use of HTTP in a RESTful way .
To understand the relationship between these different aspects , we have to take a look at the history of REST .
The term REST was defined by Roy T. Fielding in his PhD thesis ( you might actually want to follow that link — it ’s quite readable , for a dissertation at least ) .
Roy had been one of the primary designer of many essential Web protocols , including HTTP and URIs , and he formalized a lot of the ideas behind them in the document .
( The dissertation is considered “ the REST bible ” , and rightfully so — after all , the author invented the term , so by definition , anything he wrote about it must be considered authorative . )
In the dissertation , Roy first defines a methodology to talk about architectural styles — high - level , abstract patterns that express the core ideas behind an architectural approach .
Each architectural style comes with a set of constraints that define it .
Examples of architectural styles include the “ null style ” ( which has no constrains at all ) , pipe and filter , client / server , distributed objects and — you guessed it — REST .
If all of this sounds quite abstract to you , you are right — REST in itself is a high - level style that could be implemented using many different technologies , and instantiated using different values for its abstract properties .
For example , REST includes the concepts of resources and a uniform interface — i.e. the idea that every resource should respond to the same methods .
But REST does n’t say which methods these should be , or how many of them there should be .
One “ incarnation ” of the REST style is HTTP ( and a set of related set of standards , such as URIs ) , or slightly more abstractly : the Web ’s architecture itself .
To continue the example from above , HTTP “ instantiates ” the REST uniform interface with a particular one , consisting of the HTTP verbs .
As Fielding defined the REST style after the Web — or at least , most of it — was already “ done ” , one might argue whether it ’s a 100 % match .
But in any case , the Web , HTTP and URIs are the only major , certainly the only relevant instance of the REST style as a whole .
And as Roy Fielding is both the author of the REST dissertation and has been a strong influence on the Web architecture ’s design , this should not come as a surprise .
Finally , I ’ve used the term “ RESTful HTTP ” from time to time , for a simple reason :
Many applications that use HTTP do n’t follow the principles of REST — and with some justification , one can say that using HTTP without following the REST principles is equal to abusing HTTP .
Of course this sounds a little zealous — and in fact there are often reasons why one would violate a REST constraint , simply because every constraint induces some trade - off that might not be acceptable in a particular situation .
But often , REST constraints are violated due to a simple lack of understanding of their benefits .
To provide one particularly nasty example : the use of HTTP GET to invoke operations such as deleting an object violates REST ’s safety constraint and plain common sense ( the client cannot be held accountable , which is probably not what the server developer intended ) .
But more on this , and other notable abuses , in a follow - up article .
Summary
In this article , I have attempted to provide a quick introduction into the concepts behind REST , the architecture of the Web .
A RESTful HTTP approach to exposing functionality is different from RPC , Distributed Objects , and Web services ; it takes some mind shift to really understand this difference .
Being aware about REST principles is beneficial whether you are building applications that expose a Web UI only or want to turn your application API into a good Web citizen .

This may come as a surprise to absolutely no one , but what Rudy Giuliani says and what he does are frequently at odds with one another .
In the latest example , Candidate Giuliani hates earmarks , but Businessman Giuliani loves ‘em .
Giuliani , the Republican presidential front - runner , last month pledged to “ get rid of ” so - called earmarks , which cost taxpayers about $ 13 billion this year , saying his party should promote “ fiscal discipline . ”
Just weeks later , Bracewell & Giuliani LLP won $ 3 million worth of projects for its clients in defense - spending legislation . [… ]
In all , Bracewell & Giuliani sought federal earmarks for 14 companies this year , 11 of which hired the firm after Giuliani joined in March 2005 , Senate records show .
Giuliani , 63 , is n’t registered as a lobbyist .
The firm paid him $ 1.2 million last year , according to his personal financial - disclosure form .
The defense - spending legislation approved this month by Congress contained funding for three of those clients , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense , a Washington - based advocacy group that opposes special projects that lawmakers insert in spending bills without public debate .
Republican consultant Eddie Mahe responded , “ It ’s a bit hypocritical .
He profits from it .
I do n’t think Joe Sixpack is going to buy into that . ”
For Giuliani to run on anti-earmark platform after ( successfully ) fighting for clients ’ earmarks in private practice requires even more cognitive dissonance than most of the former mayor ’s contradictions .

TOM BACHTELL
Out in Iowa , with the bell at last ringing and the combatants charging out of their corners , the Republican card has come down to the Maulin ’ Mormon versus the Battlin ’ Baptist .
Would the Framers be pleased ?
Does n’t seem likely , somehow .
The deists , freethinkers , and assorted Protestants ( plus two Catholics ) who drafted the Constitution sternly forbade theological sucker punches —
“ No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States ” was how they put it — but today ’s Republicans make their own rules .
Marquess of Queensberry ?
Not for the new Grand Old Party .
( Meanwhile , those groovy Democrats are reprising “ The Mod Squad , ” with the white guy , the black guy , and the blonde scrambling to see who gets to make the collar . )
The tale of the tape suggests that Mike Huckabee has to be given the edge , religion - wise .
He trained at Ouachita Baptist University and turned pro early , pastoring his own church at twenty - four .
A mere nine years later , he was president of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention — half a million strong , a fifth of the state ’s population at the time .
He may not be a heavyweight these days ( he shed a hundred and ten pounds as governor ) , but if he no longer has the belly he certainly has the fire .
The fire , yes — but , affable fellow that he is , minus the brimstone .
Huckabee ’s sensational rise has been made possible by his success , so far , at speaking in tongues that evangelicals and non-evangelicals understand differently .
“ I always tell the story of a lady who asked me , was I a narrow - minded Baptist who thinks only Baptists go to Heaven ? ” he likes to say .
“ And I told her , ‘ No , ma’am , I ’m more narrow than that .
I do n’t think all the Baptists are going to make it , either . ’ ” Does he mean “ Let ’s not take this eternal damnation stuff so darn seriously ” ?
Or is it “ Everybody roasts in Hell except selected evangelicals ” ?
And then there was his instantly famous sound bite at the November 28th YouTube debate , when he was asked where history ’s most revered victim of the death penalty would stand on that issue .
“ Jesus , ” Huckabee replied with a rueful smile , “ was too smart to ever run for public office . ”
This was a clever sally , allowing moderates to infer that he , Huckabee , realizes that capital punishment is morally dubious but ( like his gubernatorial predecessor Bill Clinton ) supports it for prudential political reasons , while assuring his co-religionists that he , Huckabee , is a humble sinner , albeit one on easy terms with the Lord — who will forgive
His flock the minor sin of clamoring for the modern equivalent of crucifixion .
Lately , though , Huckabee has been getting his signals mixed , like a man putting letters to his wife and his mistress in the wrong envelopes .
A few weeks ago at Liberty University ( founder : the lateJ. Falwell ) , a student asked him what accounted for his rocketing poll numbers .
“ There ’s only one explanation for it , and it ’s not a human one , ” he said .
“ It ’s the same power that helped a little boy with two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of five thousand people — and that ’s the only way that our campaign could be doing what it ’s doing . ”
To an evangelical ear , that might sound like simple wonderment .
But to many other people it sounded like the ravings of someone who thinks God is his precinct captain .
In Mitt Romney ’s case , it ’s the religion itself that may have a glass jaw .
When Mitt ’s father , George Romney , a liberal Republican governor of Michigan , ran for President , in 1968 , his Mormonism was just another biographical detail .
That was before the Party ’s firm embrace of “ faith ” as a mandatory political talking point .
It ’s no longer clear that the dogmas of whatever sect a candidate happens to be affiliated with can be dismissed as irrelevant to the policies he or she might pursue in office .
And the dogmas of Mitt Romney ’s sect are breathtaking .
They include these : that in 1827 a young man named Joseph Smith dug up a set of golden plates covered with indecipherable writing ; that , with the help of a pair of magic spectacles , he “ translated ” the plates from an otherwise unknown language ( Reformed Egyptian ) into an Olde English that reads like an unfunny parody of the King James Bible ; that the Garden of Eden is in Missouri ; that American Indians descend from Hebrew immigrants ; that Jesus reappeared in pre-Columbian America and converted so many people that the result was a series of archeologically unconfirmable wars in which millions died ; that while polygamy had divine approval for most of the nineteenth century , God changed his mind in 1890 , just in time for Utah to be allowed into the Union ; and that God waited until 1978 to reveal that it was O.K. for blacks to be fully paid - up members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints .
One might ask , What of it ?
Plenty of religions have curious doctrines .
( Several , for example , hold that on Sundays millions of people drink blood and eat flesh . )
The Framers knew this was dangerous territory , which was one reason they tried to rule it out of political bounds .
And Romney himself warned , in a speech , titled “ Faith in America , ” that he delivered on December 6th , “ There are some who would have a Presidential candidate describe and explain his church ’s distinctive doctrines .
To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited . ”
The weasel word here is “ distinctive . ”
Romney had no problem describing his church ’s not - so - distinctive doctrines .
“ There is one fundamental question , ” he continued , as if he were speaking on tax cuts , “ about which I often am asked .
What do I believe about Jesus Christ ?
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Saviour of mankind . ”
( But please do n’t ask about Jesus ’ post - Resurrection travel schedule . )
The candidate went on to patronize rival religions , administering quick head pats to Catholicism ( “ I love the profound ceremony of the Catholic Mass ” ) , evangelicalism ( for the “ approachability ” of its version of God ) , Pentecostalism ( “ tenderness of spirit ” ) , Lutheranism ( “ confident independence ” ) , Judaism ( “ ancient traditions ” ) , and Islam ( “ frequent prayer ” — a bit feeble , that ) .
Missing from this litany , of course , was something to the effect of “ I appreciate the deep commitment to reason of the agnostics and atheists . ”
Indeed , the only “ religion ” that Romney had anything rude to say about was “ the religion of secularism . ”
He pointed scornfully at the “ empty ” cathedrals of Europe as evidence of “ societies just too busy or too ‘ enlightened ’ to venture inside and kneel in prayer , ” adding a little later that “ any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty ” has “ a friend and ally in me . ”
Take that , NATO .
On your knees .
Secularism is not a religion .
And it is not true that “ freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom , ” as Romney maintained .
What freedom , including religious freedom , requires is , precisely , secularism — which is to say , state neutrality in matters of religion .
( Nor does religion require freedom , as the European past and the Middle Eastern present demonstrate ; religions , plural , do , however . )
“ Americans do not respect believers of convenience , ” Romney thundered in his “ faith ” speech .
“ Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs , even to gain the world . ”
These were strange observations , coming as they did from a man whose campaign has consisted largely of jettisoning the beliefs he found convenient as a Massachusetts politician but finds highly inconvenient now that he stands to gain the Republican nomination for President .
But then those were merely political beliefs .
Touch gloves , Mitt and Mike .
And perhaps , if God interests Himself in the minutiae of earthly politics ,
He ’ll arrange a double knockout . ♦

It ’s an interesting time to be an American visiting Europe .
On September 11 , 2001 , thousands of Europeans came to the U.S. embassies in their countries to express solidarity with the Americans under attack .
Even Le Monde , the newspaper of the French elite , proclaimed “ we are all Americans . ”
By now , however , the goodwill is long gone , eradicated by bad feelings over the Iraq war , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , global warming and a host of other disagreements .
But long before George W. Bush became President , Europeans had very strong ( and often negative ) opinions about American culture and politics .

NEW YORK ( Money Magazine ) --
Already behind on your mortgage payments ?
No help there .
Able to make payments even after the rate on your adjustable mortgage moves higher ?
You can manage on your own .
In a speech Monday , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson began to address efforts to stave off a foreclosure epidemic by lenders , those who service loans , and investors who hold mortgage debt .
Despite much speculation that Paulson is close to helping coordinate a rescue plan that would broadly freeze levels on adjustable mortgages before they reset to higher rates , Paulson gave few details on how such a plan would work .
He did however say who the plan would help , and it would probably leave out a large number of homeowners stretched by their mortgage payments .
Paulson divided subprime borrowers into four groups .
The plan would be most geared toward those who can afford the mortgage now but wo n't be able to after the adjustment .
The other three groups are largely left out : Borrowers who can afford an adjustment ; those who are already behind on their payments ; and those who can refinance into a fixed - rate loan
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association , 5.12 % of outstanding loans were in default in the second quarter , a rate about 17 % higher than a year ago .
The plan would also seemingly exclude borrowers who hold option - ARMs that are n't subprime .
These are loans that start with extremely low " teaser " rates before rising dramatically a few years into the loan .
It has also been reported that homes that were bought as investments - as opposed to for the purpose of living in - would be excluded .
More than 50 % of the increase in delinquent mortgages are actually investor - related , said Wachovia senior economist Mark Vitner .
" It 's hard to conceive how many people are actually going to meet this criteria .
There 's nothing at all in there that addresses investors , " said Vitner , who added he does n't support an investor bailout .
The group that will be helped represents just a narrow slice of the subprime borrowers in trouble , said Michael Shea , housing director of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) .
" It helps .
Do n't get me wrong .
...
But it 's disappointing that we are nearly a year into the crisis and the Treasury Secretary is dealing with the easiest part of the problem . "
" It wo n't help the majority , " said Lisa Rice , vice president of the National Fair Housing Alliance , a national organization dedicated to ending housing discrimination .
" It 's only going to help that one bucket , and it's hard to say how large that bucket will be without knowing the details of how the Treasury Department will assess affordability . "
What tools would be available to the other groups ?
Paulson said that the Administration would recommend that state and local organizations extend their programs to help stretched owners refinance into fixed - rate mortgages .
He also pointed to proposed modifications to the Federal Housing Administration that would make FHA loans , which can be more affordable , easier to get .
The limited scope of the plan has caused some consumer advocates to ask if it goes far enough .
Convention in the lending industry is that a family can afford to spend 28 percent of its gross income on housing .
But an index put together by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo suggests that most homeowners spend more than that .
According to the NAHB - Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index , only 42 percent of homes sold in the third quarter were affordable to households earning the nation 's median income .
What 's considered affordable can also be lender specific , Rice said .
Joann Jorgensen bought her five - bedroom home in Alexandria , Va. in 2004 with two adjustable - rate mortgages .
When she recently tried to get her lenders to lower their payments , the lenders calculated of how much Jorgensen had left after paying for housing and utilities .
The lenders calculation was more than $ 1,000 per month higher than what Jorgensen figured she would have .
" I do n't know how they could have come back with that number , " said Jorgensen .
If the government relies on mortgage counseling programs and state - or city - backed bailouts to address the rest of threatened homeowners , the foreclosure problem might get worse , said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
" You can't counsel a loan down .
This is n't happening because those people do n't know how to pay their bills .
They need a loan modification , " he said .
To some music lovers , the fact that Josh Groban 's Noel was the highest - selling album of 2007 is all the proof they need that major - label music is dying .
To shareholders and label execs , though , the numbers are more important , and the numbers are grim : music sales are down 21 percent this Christmas season .
Variety has the latest music numbers from Nielsen Soundscan on music sales from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve .
In 2007 , 83.9 million albums were sold , down 21.4 million from last year .
A 20 percent drop in sales is more than a blip ; it 's serious trouble .
The industry has been under pressure for years , of course .
Back in August , we took a detailed look at trends in the movie , music , and video game businesses and noted that RIAA companies have seen sales drop by 11.6 percent between 2002 and 2006 , even as movies hold steady and games are showing sales increases .
Data sources : RIAA , MPAA , The NPD Group
The recent news suggests that people are turning away from the CD as a Christmas present , due in large part to the rise of online music services like iTunes , eMusic , and the Amazon MP3 shop .
Now that non-DRMed music is widely available from many popular artists , giving the gift of digital downloads can be an attractive option for holiday shoppers .
Certainly it 's becoming more mainstream ; even my local supermarket now stocks iTunes gift cards .
Music buying has certainly been migrating online , and the spectacular decline of CD sales is putting extra pressure on labels to move more online copies of the music they publish .
This is clearly one of the reasons that Warner , traditionally a staunch DRM defender , agreed to strip DRM from its tracks offered on Amazon ; it needed to do something ( anything ) to shore up flagging sales .
But as albums move online , the " album " is also losing its luster .
Download services let consumers pick and choose , and many buyers seem to do just that , snagging the hits and leaving the rest behind .
While digital distribution enables this , it 's hard to blame digital for the common perception that most top 40 albums contain their share of filler .
Padding out discs with mediocre tracks just wo n't work anymore , but it might also keep listeners from discovering the deeper cuts on quality discs .
It 's not just a sad day for music companies when customers decide to cherry - pick one Josh Ritter song , for instance ; it 's a sad day for the buyers as well , as they miss out on the complete album experience of a consummate artist .
Sadly , Ritter and his kind are the exception ; so long as they are , music fans will continue to grab the hits , and they 'll do so online .
At least now they can get them DRM - free .
One of the principal benefits of Mike Huckabee ’s campaign is that he ’s managed to reach the top tier of the Republican field with almost no scrutiny at all .
But there ’s a downside -- now that the race has reached crunch time , and Huckabee is a credible challenger for the nomination , all of the scrutiny comes at once .
The question , then , is how Huckabee responds to the pressure , and handles unpleasant questions .
So far , I think he ’s struggling pretty badly .
This week , for example , Huckabee was asked for his thoughts about the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , arguably the biggest foreign policy news in months , if not the year .
Huckabee said he ’d never heard of it .
This morning , on MSNBC , he tried to rationalize his ignorance .
“ Well , I do n’t blame my staff .
It is a situation where a report was released at 10:00 in the morning , the president had n’t seen it in four years and I ’m supposed to see it four hours later . ”
That ’s utter nonsense , and actually makes Huckabee look even dumber .
As Kevin Drum explained , “ The NIE was released Monday morning .
He was asked about it Tuesday evening .
That ’s two days .
Two days in which the NIE was on the front page of every newspaper ; it was blanketing cable TV , talk radio , and the blogosphere ; and the president of the United States addressed its conclusions in a press conference .
It was blockbuster news on one of the most important foreign policy issues of the campaign and Huckabee did n’t even know about it . ”
The phrase “ not ready for prime - time ” was practically custom made for a guy like this .
Tokelau may only have 1,500 inhabitants and be a two - day boat trip from its nearest neighbour but selling its .
TK domain is reaping benefits .
The Dutch entrepreneur who bought the address now offers a free domain name service in return for targeted ads .
The deal has allowed Tokelau to add 10 % to its GDP as well as gain PCs and net access for residents .
ICANN doubt
When Joost Zuurbier , the founder of Dot TK , decided to invest in a country level domain name in 2001 he had a choice of four unregistered addresses including ones for Palestine , East Timor and Pitcairn .
The South Pacific .tk address was the most appealing but it was a long process to convince the overseer of the net 's addressing system - the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) - that they had a valid case .
" It was a four year process .
They did n't believe the contract or even the island were real and it was only because a member of the board had been to Tokelau in 1978 that they finally agreed it was OK , " explained Mr Zuurbier .
Now there are more than 1.6 million Dot TK domain names registered and it is adding around 10,000 each day .
Registering a .
TK domain is free although users must agree to receive targeted banner and text advertising .
The .TK domain generates 10 % of Tokelau 's wealth
Making a .
TK website
For Tokelau the partnership with Dot TK has offered a new way of communication to a nation that had previously relied on expensive satellite telephony and , before 1994 , radios to speak to each other .
Now many of the inhabitants use free voice - over IP telephony services .
" Telephone revenue has gone down by 40 % because everyone is using Skype , " said Aukusitino Vitale , the general manager of Tokelau 's telecommunications company Teletok .
Teleconferencing
Tokelau used to have just 12 computers but now there are 200 , in internet cafes , classrooms and hospitals .
The broadband connection - which is received via satellite as the ocean is too deep to lay under - water cable - is not the best at just 384 kilobits per second but it has opened up a whole new world for the islanders .
The tiny nation is in a remote part of the South Pacific
Currently net access is free although the government is considering charging as more bandwidth is consumed .
The hospitals are able to receive much - needed medical expertise from overseas doctors via e-mail and still photographs .
There are plans to add video to this service .
The mayors of each island use teleconferencing to keep in touch .
There is also a project to connect islanders to the University of South Pacific which might mean inhabitants would not have to go overseas to study .
With an estimated 8,000 islanders now living in New Zealand , Australia and the US , the issue of emigration is a serious one .
The group of three islands now also has a dedicated website , which allows family members living abroad to keep in what is happening back home .
" The website means news can be translated into their own language as well as giving exposure to our culture , " said Mr Vitale .
Gwyneth Cravens argues for the environmental benefits of nuclear energy in her new book , Power to Save the World : The Truth About Nuclear Energy . *

The only way to rescue our plug - hungry planet from catastrophic global warming is to embrace nuclear power , and fast .
That 's the argument of Gwyneth Cravens , a novelist , journalist and former nuke protester .
Her new book , Power to Save the World : The Truth About Nuclear Energy , is a passionate plea to understand , instead of fear , atomic power .
In her book , Cravens is guided Dante - like through the entire life cycle of nuclear power – from mining to production to waste disposal – by one of the world 's foremost experts on risk assessment and nuclear waste .
Her conclusion ?
Every day spent burning coal for power translates into damaged lungs and ecosystem destruction .
If the world wants to keep plugging in big - screen TVs and iPods , it needs a steady source of power .
Wind and solar can't produce the " base - load " ( or everyday ) steady supply needed , and the only realistic – and safe – alternative is nuclear .
Wired News talked with Cravens on the phone from her home in New York .
Wired News :
You do n't argue that nuclear power is entirely safe , but that it 's vastly better than coal and fossil fuels .
Do we have to choose between them ?
Gwyneth Cravens : I used to think we surely could do better .
We could have more wind farms and solar .
But I then learned about base - load energy , and that there are three forms of it : fossil fuels , hydro and nuclear .
In the United States , we 're maxed out on hydro .
That leaves fossil fuels and nuclear power , and most of the fossil fuel burned is coal .
In the U.S. , 24,000 people a year die from coal pollution .
Hundreds of thousands more people suffer from lung and heart disease directly attributable to coal pollution .
WN : That 's opposed to a minuscule number of people who have been directly harmed by nuclear power ?
Cravens :
It 's zero in the United States .
Of course there is the occasional industrial accident amongst the workers .
But over the lifetime cycle of nuclear power , if you go cradle - to - grave with uranium , the total carbon emissions are about those of wind power .
WN : You have an interesting statistic comparing the waste levels produced by individuals over a lifetime .
Cravens :
A family in four in France , where they reprocess nuclear fuel , would produce only enough waste to fit in a coffee cup over a whole lifetime .
A lifetime of getting all your electricity from coal - fired plants would make a single person 's share of solid waste ( in the United States ) 68 tons , which would require six 12 - ton railroad cars to haul away .
Your share of CO2 would be 77 tons .
WN : What about clean coal plants , and carbon - sequestration technologies ?
Are n't they a practical alternative ?
Cravens :
At this point , no .
There 's one prototype in Colorado that the government is trying to sponsor .
From a practical point of view , I think nuclear plants could be up and running and replacing fossil - fuel plants sooner than we get clean coal .
WN : People still fear Chernobyl and Three Mile Island .
You say neither of these catastrophic events was as harmful as widely believed .
Cravens : Chernobyl 's reactor had no containment building .
If they had had that reactor in a containment dome , we would n't be talking about it the way we are .
But there was a radioactive release , and people were affected .
So far about 60 people have died , most of them – almost all of them – from immediate exposure when they were fighting the fire in the reactor , and the emergency workers .
Nine children , unfortunately , developed thyroid cancer that was not treated .
We had a Chernobyl in the United States , it was called Three Mile Island .
But you have to look at risk and benefit , and you have to do comparisons .
Three Mile Island really scared people , partly because it was so badly bungled by nuclear industry and regulatory commissions .
The psychological effects were real , but in a dozen independent studies , no health effects have been found as a result of the Three Mile Island event .
Radiation was never a risk at Three Mile Island .
People in New Mexico , every day of their lives , get from nature maybe 100 or 300 times more exposure than citizens around Three Mile Island got during that event .
WN : Along with engineering failures – the lack of a containment building is stunning – Chernobyl and Three Mile Island both stemmed from what in retrospect were very stupid operator decisions .
Can we ever avoid that kind of human error ?
Cravens :
The nuclear navy has operated more than 250 reactors since the 1950s , and they have never had an incident involving a release from a reactor .
This is because ( naval nuclear chief Adm. Hyman ) Rickover ensured that every individual was considered accountable .
When Three Mile Island happened , and there was a commission held to investigate why it happened , Rickover basically said you need to do things the way we do in the nuclear navy .
The nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took that advice to heart .
If you just leave a reactor alone , it will shut itself down .
If a reactor does n't have enough water , it will shut itself down .
Humans probably do make mistakes , but they have tried to make these reactors as human - proof as possible , and I think everyone has learned from Three Mile Island .
WN : Waste , both transporting it and storing it , remains extraordinarily controversial .
Some will remain radioactive for tens or hundreds of thousands of years .
You say you 're not worried .
Why not ?
Cravens :
First of all , it 's small in volume .
Uranium is dense , so the waste is dense .
The waste from one average reactor , the spent fuel , per year could fit in the back of a standard pickup truck .
This small volume of nuclear waste is always shielded , always isolated , transported in thick casks .
Radiation is stopped by a few inches of steel and concrete and water and so on .
WN : But people still worry about having it stored next to them .
Critics say Yucca Mountain ( the planned nuclear - waste facility in Nevada ) is n't safe enough .
Cravens : I 'm quite satisfied about Yucca Mountain .
They have worked not only on putting it deep inside the mountain , a thousand feet below the top of the mountain , and a thousand feet above the water table ; they are putting it inside steel casks .
It 's just really going to remain where it is .
They 've calculated out the risks .
It 's not perfect ; there are better geological places to put it .
It was a political decision to go to Yucca Mountain , because it was federally owned land , but the people I talk to think it will work .
WN : Is n't this ultimately politics ?
How do you get people to accept that there is going to be waste , if not in their backyard , somewhere near their water table ?
Cravens :
You have to show people in a credible way that what you 're doing is safe , and will be safe for many generations to come .
WN : Has that been done for Yucca Mountain yet ?
Cravens :
One of the things my guide , Rip Anderson , is doing right now is an internal peer review , as a consultant , looking at the geological and hydrological features of Yucca Mountain , to see how they 've done the science .
If it does n't pass , Rip has no problem flunking it .
He is a scientist .
He wants to see things done according to the scientific method and good , sound risk assessment .
But whether the people of Nevada will permit the repository to open is very much up in the air .
If they do n't want it , we can't shove it down their throats .
WN : Iran 's nuclear ambitions are in the news today .
Is there any way to keep power production separated from weapons projects ?
Cravens :
Of course .
You can't just take spent fuel and make bombs .
It 's very hard to do .
The plutonium generated in a reactor , as fuel becomes spent fuel , is plutonium 240 .
What you want for bomb - grade is plutonium 239 .
Two - forty is hot , hard to handle , thermally hot , so a bomb made from that would be unstable , with a short shelf life .
Iran is being very stubborn , insisting on enriching uranium .
I think that 's a mistake .
Uranium enrichment is expensive , it 's hard to do well and takes many years .
They 're clearly playing some game .

Profile : Cristina Fernández de Kirchner Published duration 21 May 2019
image copyright Reuters image caption Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was president from 2007 until 2015
Argentina 's first elected female leader Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is currently on trial on corruption charges dating back to her two terms in office .
Ms Fernández took over the presidency in 2007 , succeeding her late husband Nestor Kirchner .
She was then re-elected in October 2011 with a landslide victory , and continued to rule until 2015 .
Despite repeated allegations of corruption , she remains popular - particularly with low - income families who are bearing the brunt of current President Mauricio Macri 's austerity policies .
She has denied any wrongdoing .
On 18 May , Ms Fernández announced that she was running for office again in the national election on 27 October .
However , this time she is standing to be vice president .
' Wives ' duel '
Cristina , as the majority of Argentines call her , was born on 19 February 1953 in La Plata , the capital of the province of Buenos Aires , where she went on to study law .
She married Nestor Kirchner , whom she met at university , in 1975 .
A year later the couple went to live in his home region , the southern province of Santa Cruz .
At the end of the 1980s she embarked on her political career - first as a provincial then as a national deputy .
Meanwhile , her husband rose through the ranks of the Peronist political movement .
In 1991 , Mr Kirchner was elected governor of Santa Cruz .
He won two more terms , while Ms Fernandez supported him as a deputy .
When Mr Kirchner took office as president in 2003 - in the midst of one of the worst economic and social crises in the country - a similar pattern emerged .
By then Cristina Fernández was a senator with her own political weight in Congress , where she actively supported her husband 's policies that included boosting social spending .
Ms Fernández cemented her political position in the congressional elections of 2005 .

Taking 46 % of the votes , she won in the province of Buenos Aires by beating her main rival Hilda Gonzalez , the wife of former President Eduardo Duhalde ( 2002 -2003 ) .
During Mr Kirchner 's administration there was almost no decision taken in which she did not have a say , her influence exceeding that of an ordinary lawmaker .
She was also the first senator to have an office within the presidential palace , provoking criticism from the opposition .
The governing party insisted that the office was small and was hers by virtue of her position as first lady .
Continuity
Occupying the presidential palace , the Casa Rosada , in her own right , former president Fernández broadly continued her husband 's policies .
There were further moves to address human rights abuses of the past .
Argentina also became the first country in Latin America to legalise same - sex marriages .
Under her , Argentina renewed contacts with the International Monetary Fund after years of hostility and moved to renew negotiations over paying Argentina 's debts to the Paris Club of lender nations .
Cristina Fernández has in the past been compared to Eva Perón , Argentina 's legendary first lady who formed a formidable ruling partnership with her husband Juan Domingo Perón in the late 1940s and early 50s .
But Evita was never elected .
Cristina Fernández , by contrast , was the country 's first elected female president .
" I have the honour to be the first woman to be re-elected in the country .
What more could I want , " Ms Fernández told supporters after her victory on 23 October , 2011 .
In October 2013 - two years after her election and three years after the death of her husband - she was forced to take a month off work because of her own ill - health , after being diagnosed with bleeding in the brain .
However , she recovered from surgery and went on to serve another two years as president .
In 2015 she was defeated by Mauricio Macri , who was then the centre - right mayor of Buenos Aires .
Since his inauguration in December of that year , Ms Fernández has been a vocal critic of his austerity policies , while simultaneously fighting off repeated accusations of corruption related to her two terms in office .
Four years later , in April 2019 , she released her autobiography Sinceramente .
In that book , she addressed the allegations made against her .
Municipal officials drew the line at the Beaux Arts building because the city owns the half - acre of land where the building stands .
The Boy Scouts erected the ornate building and since 1928 have leased the land from the city for a token sum of $ 1 a year .
City officials said the market value for renting the building was about $ 200,000 a year , and they invited the Boy Scouts to remain as full - paying tenants .
Jeff Jubelirer , a spokesman for the local chapter , said it could not afford $ 200,000 a year in rent , and that such a price would require it to cut summer - camp funds for 800 needy children .
“ With an epidemic of gun violence taking the lives of children almost daily in this city , it ’s ironic that this administration chose to destroy programming that services thousands of children in the city , ” Mr. Jubelirer said .
He added that the organization serves more than 69,000 young people , mostly from the inner city , and that its programming focuses on mentoring and after - school programs instead of camping trips .
But Stacey Sobel , executive director of Equality Advocates Pennsylvania , a gay - rights advocacy group based in Philadelphia , said : “ Allowing the Boy Scouts to use this building rent free sends a message that the city approves of their policy .
We are not looking to kick the Boy Scouts out .
We just want them to play by the same rules as everyone else in the city . ”
Ms. Sobel said the city required that any organization that rented property from it agree to nondiscriminatory language in its lease .
The Boy Scouts skirted the requirement by never having had to sign a lease because they were given use of the building by city ordinance in the 1920s .
Local scout leaders said they tried hard to find a compromise between the city and their own national office , and in 2005 they seemed poised to agree on a policy statement adopted by the Boy Scouts in New York , which did not renounce the prohibition against gay members , but affirmed that “ prejudice , intolerance and unlawful discrimination in any form are unacceptable . ”
But last year , city officials wrote Cradle of Liberty Council officials to say that suggested policy statement could not be reconciled with Philadelphia ’s antidiscrimination ordinance .
ITALIAN SAYS 9-11 SOLVED
It ’s common knowledge , he reveals , CIA , Mossad behind terror attacks
By the Staff of American Free Press Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga , who revealed the existence of Operation Gladio , has told Italy ’s oldest and most widely read newspaper that the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks were run by the CIA and Mossad , and that this was common knowledge among global intelligence agencies .
In what translates awkwardly into English , Cossiga told the newspaper Corriere della Sera :
“ All the [ intelligence services ] of America and Europe … know well that the disastrous attack has been planned and realized from the Mossad , with the aid of the Zionist world in order to put under accusation the Arabic countries and in order to induce the western powers to take part … in Iraq [ and ] Afghanistan . ”
Cossiga was elected president of the Italian Senate in July 1983 before winning a landslide election to become president of the country in 1985 , and he remained until 1992 .
Cossiga ’s tendency to be outspoken upset the Italian political establishment , and he was forced to resign after revealing the existence of , and his part in setting up , Operation Gladio .
This was a rogue intelligence network under NATO auspices that carried out bombings across Europe in the 1960s , 1970s and ’ 80s .
Gladio ’s specialty was to carry out what they termed “ false flag ” operations — terror attacks that were blamed on their domestic and geopolitical opposition .
In March 2001 , Gladio agent Vincenzo Vinciguerra stated , in sworn testimony , “ You had to attack civilians , the people , women , children , innocent people , unknown people far removed from any political game .
The reason was quite simple : to force … the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security . ”
Cossiga first expressed his doubts about 9 - 11 in 2001 , and is quoted by 9 - 11 researcherWebster Tarpley saying “ The mastermind of the attack must have been a sophisticated mind , provided with ample means not only to recruit fanatic kamikazes , but also highly specialized personnel .
I add one thing : it could not be accomplished without infiltrations in the radar and
flight security personnel . ”
Coming from a widely respected former head of state , Cossiga ’s assertion that the 9 - 11 attacks were an inside job and that this is common knowledge among global intelligence agencies is illuminating .
It is one more eye - opening confirmation that has not been mentioned by America ’s propaganda machine in print or on TV .
Nevertheless , because of his experience and status in the world , Cossiga cannot be discounted as a crackpot .

Math uses made - up rules to create models and relationships .
When learning , I ask :
What relationship does this model represent ?
does this model represent ?
What real - world items share this relationship ?
?
Does that relationship make sense to me ?
They 're simple questions , but they help me understand new topics .
If you liked my math posts , this article covers my approach to this oft - maligned subject .
Many people have left insightful comments about their struggles with math and resources that helped them .
Math Education
Textbooks rarely focus on understanding ; it 's mostly solving problems with " plug and chug " formulas .
It saddens me that beautiful ideas get such a rote treatment :
The Pythagorean Theorem is not just about triangles .
It is about the relationship between similar shapes , the distance between any set of numbers , and much more .
.

e is not just a number .

It is about the fundamental relationships between all growth rates .
The natural log is not just an inverse function .
It is about the amount of time things need to grow .
Elegant , " a ha ! " insights should be our focus , but we leave that for students to randomly stumble upon themselves .
I hit an " a ha " moment after a hellish cram session in college ; since then , I 've wanted to find and share those epiphanies to spare others the same pain .
But it works both ways -- I want you to share insights with me , too .
There 's more understanding , less pain , and everyone wins .
Math Evolves Over Time
I consider math as a way of thinking , and it 's important to see how that thinking developed rather than only showing the result .
Let 's try an example .
Imagine you 're a caveman doing math .
One of the first problems will be how to count things .
Several systems have developed over time :
No system is right , and each has advantages :
Unary system : Draw lines in the sand -- as simple as it gets .
Great for keeping score in games ; you can add to a number without erasing and rewriting .

Roman Numerals :

Decimals :
Huge realization that numbers can use a " positional " system with place and zero .

Binary : Simplest positional system ( two digits , on vs off ) so it 's great for mechanical devices .
Simplest positional system ( two digits , on vs off ) so it 's great for mechanical devices .
Scientific Notation : Extremely compact , can easily gauge a number 's size and precision ( 1E3 vs 1.000E3 ) .
Think we 're done ?
No way .
In 1000 years we 'll have a system that makes decimal numbers look as quaint as Roman Numerals ( " By George , how did they manage with such clumsy tools ? " ) .
Negative Numbers Are n't That Real
Let 's think about numbers a bit more .
The example above shows our number system is one of many ways to solve the " counting " problem .
The Romans would consider zero and fractions strange , but it does n't mean " nothingness " and " part to whole " are n't useful concepts .
But see how each system incorporated new ideas .
Fractions ( 1/3 ) , decimals ( .234 ) , and complex numbers ( 3 + 4i ) are ways to express new relationships .
They may not make sense right now , just like zero did n't " make sense " to the Romans .
We need new real - world relationships ( like debt ) for them to click .
Even then , negative numbers may not exist in the way we think , as you convince me here :
You : Negative numbers are a great idea , but do n't inherently exist .
It 's a label we apply to a concept .
Me : Sure they do .
You :
Ok , show me - 3 cows .
Me : Well , um ... assume you 're a farmer , and you lost 3 cows .
You :
Ok , you have zero cows .
Me : No , I mean , you gave 3 cows to a friend .
You :
Ok , he has 3 cows and you have zero .
Me : No , I mean , he 's going to give them back someday .
He owes you .
You : Ah .
So the actual number I have ( - 3 or 0 ) depends on whether I think he 'll pay me back .
I did n't realize my opinion changed how counting worked .
In my world , I had zero the whole time .
Me : Sigh .
It 's not like that .
When he gives you the cows back , you go from - 3 to 3 .
You :
Ok , so he returns 3 cows and we jump 6 , from - 3 to 3 ?
Any other new arithmetic I should be aware of ?
What does sqrt ( - 17 ) cows look like ?
Me : Get out .
Negative numbers can express a relationship :
Positive numbers represent a surplus of cows
Zero represents no cows
Negative numbers represent a deficit of cows that are assumed to be paid back
But the negative number " is n't really there " -- there 's only the relationship they represent ( a surplus / deficit of cows ) .
We 've created a " negative number " model to help with bookkeeping , even though you can't hold - 3 cows in your hand .
( I purposefully used a different interpretation of what " negative " means : it 's a different counting system , just like Roman numerals and decimals are different counting systems . )
By the way , negative numbers were n't accepted by many people , including Western mathematicians , until the 1700s .
The idea of a negative was considered " absurd " .
Negative numbers do seem strange unless you can see how they represent complex real - world relationships , like debt .
Why All the Philosophy ?
I realized that my ** mindset is key to learning .
** It helped me arrive at deep insights , specifically :
Factual knowledge is not understanding .
Knowing " hammers drive nails " is not the same as the insight that any hard object ( a rock , a wrench ) can drive a nail .
Knowing " hammers drive nails " is not the same as the insight that any hard object ( a rock , a wrench ) can drive a nail .
Keep an open mind .
Develop your intuition by allowing yourself to be a beginner again .
A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master .
While the master quietly served tea , the professor talked about Zen .
The master poured the visitor 's cup to the brim , and then kept pouring .
The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself .
" It 's overfull !
No more will go in ! " the professor blurted .
" You are like this cup , " the master replied , " How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup . "
Be creative .
Look for strange relationships .
Use diagrams .
Use humor .
Use analogies .
Use mnemonics .
Use anything that makes the ideas more vivid .
Analogies are n't perfect but help when struggling with the general idea .

Analogies are n't perfect but help when struggling with the general idea .
Realize you can learn .
We expect kids to learn algebra , trigonometry and calculus that would astound the ancient Greeks .
And we should : we 're capable of learning so much , if explained correctly .
Do n't stop until it makes sense , or that mathematical gap will haunt you .
Mental toughness is critical -- we often give up too easily .
So What 's the Point ?
I want to share what I 've discovered , hoping it helps you learn math :
Math creates models that have certain relationships
that have certain
We try to find real - world phenomena that have the same relationship
that have the same relationship Our models are always improving .
A new model may come along that better explains that relationship ( roman numerals to decimal system ) .
Sure , some models appear to have no use : " What good are imaginary numbers ? " , many students ask .
It 's a valid question , with an intuitive answer .
The use of imaginary numbers is limited by our imagination and understanding -- just like negative numbers are " useless " unless you have the idea of debt , imaginary numbers can be confusing because we do n't truly understand the relationship they represent .
Math provides models ; understand their relationships and apply them to real - world objects .
Developing intuition makes learning fun -- even accounting is n't bad when you understand the problems it solves .
I want to cover complex numbers , calculus and other elusive topics by focusing on relationships , not proofs and mechanics .
But this is my experience -- how do you learn best ?

Office printers emit tiny particles of toner , the scientists say
An investigation of a range of printer models showed that almost a third emit potentially dangerous levels of toner into the air .
The Queensland University of Technology scientists have called on ministers to regulate these kinds of emissions .
They say some printers should come with a health warning .
The researchers carried out tests on more than 60 machines .
Almost one - third were found to emit ultra-tiny particles of toner - like material , so small that they can infiltrate the lungs and cause a range of health problems from respiratory irritation to more chronic illnesses .
Conducted in an open - plan office , the test revealed that particle levels increased five - fold during working hours , a rise blamed on printer use .
The problem was worse when new cartridges were used and when graphics and images required higher quantities of toner .
The researchers have called on governments to regulate air quality in offices .
They also want companies to ensure that printers are based in well - ventilated areas so that particles disperse .

7 ( un ) Luckiest People in the World
Published on 11/19/2007
Frane Selak
Escaped from a derailed train , a door - less plane , a bus crash , a car into flames , another 2 car accidents ... but then won $ 1,000,000 dollars on the lottery !
Frane Selak ( born 1929 ) is a Croatian music teacher famous for his numerous escapes from fatal accidents :
In January , 1962 , Selak was traveling via train from Sarajevo to Dubrovnik .
However , the train had suddenly derailed and plunged into an icy river , killing 17 passengers .
Selak managed to escape , and only suffered a broken arm and minor scrapes and bruises .
The following year , while traveling from Zagreb to Rijeka when the door blew away from the cockpit , forcing him out of the plane .
Although 19 others were killed , he suffered only minor injuries and had miraculously landed in a haystack .
In 1966 , he was riding on a bus that crashed and plunged into a river .
Four others were killed , but Selak managed to escape unharmed .
In 1970 , he managed to escape before a faulty fuel pump engulfed his car into flames .
In 1973 , another of Selak 's cars caught fire , forcing fire through the air vents .
He suffered no injuries save the loss of most of his hair .
In 1995 , he was hit by a city bus , but once again suffered minor injuries .
In 1996 he escaped when he drove off a cliff to escape an oncoming truck .
He managed to land in a tree , and watched as his car exploded 300 feet below him .
In 2003 he won $ 1,000,000 dollars in the Croatian lottery , and had stated that " I know God was watching me over all these years . "
He has reputedly refused to fly to Australia to air on a Doritos commercial , saying he " did n't want to test his luck . " [ 2 ]
He has said that he can either be looked as " the world 's unluckiest man , or the world 's luckiest man , " and prefers the latter .
John Lyne
Suffered 16 major accidents in his life .
As a teen , he felt from a tree ; on his way back from hospital , his bus crashed .
John Lyne could well be Britain 's unluckiest man .
' Calamity John ' has suffered 16 major accidents in his life , including lightning strikes , a rock - fall in a mine and three car crashes .
' I do n't think there is any reason or explanation .
Things could have been much worse and I could have died but it does n't worry me too much . '
Mr Lyne 's mishaps cover a lifetime and he has even been known to suffer two accidents at once .
As a child , he fell off a horse and cart – only to be run over by a delivery van .
When he was a teenager , he broke his arm falling from a tree .
On his way back from hospital , his bus crashed , breaking the same arm in another place .
The date , of course , was Friday the 13th .
William " Bud " Post
won the lottery , but got sued by everyone and finally went broke and died William " Bud " Post won $ 16.2 million in the Pennsylvania lottery in 1988 but now lives on his Social Security .
" I wish it never happened .
It was totally a nightmare , " says Post .
A former girlfriend successfully sued him for a share of his winnings .
It was n't his only lawsuit .
A brother was arrested for hiring a hit man to kill him , hoping to inherit a share of the winnings .
Other siblings pestered him until he agreed to invest in a car business and a restaurant in Sarasota , Fla. , - two ventures that brought no money back and further strained his relationship with his siblings .
Post even spent time in jail for firing a gun over the head of a bill collector .
Within a year , he was $ 1 million in debt .
Post admitted he was both careless and foolish , trying to please his family .
He eventually declared bankruptcy .
Now he lives quietly on $ 450 a month and food stamps .
" I 'm tired , I 'm over 65 years old , and I just had a serious operation for a heart aneurysm .
Lotteries do n't mean ( anything ) to me , " said Post .
He died on Jan 15 of respiratory failure .
Major Summerford
Struck by lightning ... 4 times !
A British officer , Major Summerford , while fighting in the fields of Flanders in February 1918 was knocked off his horse by a flash of lightning and paralyzed from the waist down .
Summerford retired and moved to Vancouver .
One day in 1924 , as he fished alongside a river , lightning hit the tree he was sitting under and paralyzed his right side .
Two years later Summerford was sufficiently recovered that he was able to take walks in a local park .
He was walking there one summer day in 1930 when a lightning bolt smashed into him , permanently paralyzing him .
He died two years later .
But lightning sought him out one last time .
Four years later , during a storm , lightning struck a cemetery and destroyed a tombstone .
The deceased buried here ?
Major Summerford .
Henry Ziegland
Killed by a very persistent bullet Henry Ziegland thought he had dodged fate .
In 1883 , he broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who , out of distress , committed suicide .
The girl 's brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him .
The brother , believing he had killed Ziegland , then turned his gun on himself and took his own life .
But Ziegland had not been killed .
The bullet , in fact , had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree .
Ziegland surely thought himself a lucky man .
Some years later , however , Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree , which still had the bullet in it .
The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite .
The explosion propelled the bullet into Ziegland 's head , killing him .
Ann Hodges
The only person ( on record ) to have been hit by a Meteorite Ann Elizabeth Hodges ( 1923 - 1972 ) of Sylacauga , Alabama is the only person of record to have been hit by a meteorite .
On November 30 , 1954 , she was napping on her living room couch when a grapefruit - sized meteoroid crashed through the roof of her house .
It bounced off her large wooden console radio , destroying it , and struck her on the arm and hip .
She was badly bruised but able to walk .
As it streaked through the atmosphere , the meteor made a fireball visible from three states , even though it fell early in the afternoon .
As the first documented case of an extraterrestrial object hitting a person , the event received worldwide publicity .
The United States Air Force sent a helicopter to take the meteorite .
Hodges ' husband , Eugene , hired a lawyer to get it back .
The Hodgeses ' landlord also claimed it , wanting to sell it to cover the damage to the house .
There were offers of up to 5,000 U.S. dollars for the meteorite .
By the time the meteorite was returned to the Hodgeses , over a year later , public attention had diminished and they were unable to find a buyer willing to pay much money .
Ms. Hodges was uncomfortable with the public attention and the stress of the dispute over ownership of the meteorite .
Against her husband 's wishes , she donated it to the Alabama Museum of Natural History .
It is an ordinary chondrite stone ( H4 ) , and weighs about 8.5 pounds ( 4 kg ) .
It is on display at the University of Alabama .
Evelyn Adams
Won the lottery twice , now lives on a trailer " Winning the lottery is n't always what it 's cracked up to be , " says Evelyn Adams , who won the New Jersey lottery not just once , but twice ( 1985 , 1986 ) , to the tune of $ 5.4 million .
Today the money is all gone and Adams lives in a trailer .
" I won the American dream but I lost it , too .
It was a very hard fall .
It 's called rock bottom , " says Adams .
" Everybody wanted my money .
Everybody had their hand out .
I never learned one simple word in the English language - ' No . '
I wish I had the chance to do it all over again .
I 'd be much smarter about it now , " says Adams , who also lost money at the slot machines in Atlantic City .
" I was a big - time gambler , " admits Adams .
" I did n't drop a million dollars , but it was a lot of money .
I made mistakes , some I regret , some I do n't .
I 'm human .
I can't go back now so I just go forward , one step at a time . "

Seeing these fascist pigs standing around reminds me of the film , Michael Collins ; where the IRA started walking up to British agents and shooting them where they slept and stood .
( See : The Cairo Gang Assassinations . )
Obviously , I ’m not suggesting that you should shoot these fascist pigs , because that would be a waste of your time and energy .
The state will just mint more fascist pigs after it tortures and kills you for your effort .
For Americans , taking your money off the table harms the people who are behind all of this madness much more than shooting their minions .
Via : Popular Mechanics :
No one sees them coming .
There are no flashing lights , no sirens .
The black Suburban simply glides out of Fifth Avenue traffic and pulls into a no-parking zone in front of the Empire State Building .
Moments later , four men spill out in combat helmets and heavy body armor :
Two carry submachine guns ; the others , snub - nosed shotguns .
Camera - toting tourists stop jabbering and stare at this intimidating new presence , their faces a mixture of curiosity and fear .
Even jaded New Yorkers , many of whom work inside the midtown Manhattan landmark , look impressed .
A stone ’s throw down the sidewalk , Abad Nieves watches the scene unfold .
Nieves is a detective with the Intelligence Division of the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) .
Casually clad in slacks and a black leather jacket , he monitors the response of people loitering in the area .
Is anyone making notes or videotaping ?
Does anyone seem especially startled by the out - of - the - blue appearance of a heavily armed NYPD squad ?
On this day , Nieves does n’t see anything overly suspicious , but he is pleased that the deployment created a strong impression .
Known as a Hercules team , it makes multiple appearances around the city each day .
The locations are chosen either in response to specific intelligence or simply to provide a show of force at high - profile sites .
“ The response we usually get is , ‘ Holy s — ! ' ”
Nieves says .
“ That ’s the reaction we want .
We are in the business of scaring people–we just want to scare the right people . ”
…
“ Clearly , New York is way in front on this , ” says Brian Michael Jenkins , a terrorism expert with the Rand Corp .
“ As the threat gets more diffused , we are going to have less of the kind of intelligence that can be picked up by the feds .
We are dealing now with threats that are deliberately operating under the radar .
Therefore , we have to aim the radar lower , to the local level . ”
With just over three weeks to go until the Iowa Caucuses , the Democratic race is starting to get very interesting .
One thing is clear : Hillary Clinton has lost momentum — and this is the worst possible time to lose it .
Today , Al Hunt at Bloomberg , and the latest update from Rasmussen Reports , provide a state of play on the Democratic side .
Both sources indicate trouble for the Clinton campaign .
And , let ’s be realistic .
Any candidate who has lost momentum now is unlikely to regain it before Christmas or New Years .
All the talk of inevitability about Clinton — which some would say was her greatest asset — is fading rapidly .
That does n’t mean that she ’s going to lose , it just means that a once - sure - thing is no longer certain .
Hillary Clinton has been the frontrunner — and is the closest thing to an incumbent in the race for President on either side .
It ’s hard for me to understand how anyone who does n’t support Clinton now will somehow learn something new about her that will garner their vote between now and early January .
On the other hand , it seems that since late October , voters have been learning things they do n’t like about Hillary Clinton — or are having doubts about her confirmed .
Al Hunt appears to think the Clinton campaign is in trouble .
According to his sources , the campaign may be in for a staff shake - up .
Not the kind of leaks that help a campaign three weeks out .
And , the word “ imploded ” is never helpful :
The Clinton organization had a clear plan A : It envisioned the candidate , as the choice of the party establishment and natural heir to the presidency , to so dominate 2007 that she would be able to corner , not have to capture , the nomination .
It worked perfectly for most of the year .
The strategy has imploded .
From Rasmussen
Reports comes a similar analysis with state - specific polling data to back it up :
Ultimately , however , it ’s not the numbers that make the race seem different .
What ’s changed is the Clinton campaign .
Up until the night of October 30 , the former First Lady ’s campaign had been a textbook model of a disciplined campaign following a clear game plan .
Then , famously , the candidate stumbled on a question about drivers ’ licenses for undocumented workers .
But , it was n’t the debate answer that caused problems as much as the campaign ’s response to it .
A week later , on CNN , Clinton still could n’t answer the question directly .
A story that should have been handled in a day with a clarification and a new story line became the new narrative of the race .
Since then , it seems that every news cycle has a bit of bad news for candidate Clinton .
Her strategy of going negative on Obama has raised more eyebrows than support .
From a polling perspective , the most damaging recent news may be found in the Rasmussen Reports South Carolina poll .
Earlier in the campaign , Clinton and Obama were evenly splitting the African - American vote .
But , now , Obama has opened a wide lead in that demographic .
If that same change is repeated throughout the South , Obama ’s prospects have brightened considerably .
What does it all mean ?
The voters of Iowa will begin to answer that question on January 3 .
Until then , just like last week , all that can be said with certainty is that the race is getting closer .
A lot of people are trying to figure out what it all means .
We ’ll know for sure in early January .
Clearly , there is concern over at the Clinton camp , because Hillary ’s guru , Mark Penn , felt it necessary to provide his spin on the polls over at the Clinton blog .
( He ’s more optimistic than Hunt or Rasmussen ) .
Now , if any campaign staff is capable of turning this one around , it ’s Team Hillary .
But , then again , Team Hillary got themselves into this mess .
So unless someone turns around Team Hillary first , we may be seeing an upset .

Deeply depressed rapper Eminem has become a virtual recluse , comfort eating his way towards obesity .
The once skinny Slim Shady , who spent four days in hospital over Christmas suffering from pneumonia and suspected heart problems , is just 5ft 7inches tall but has ballooned up to 14.5 stone
His family and friends fear his massive weight gain is causing him long - term health woes but the deeply depressed star refuses to stop binge eating .

Eminem , who once boasted of his love for Ecstasy and Vicodin pain - killers , survives on a diet of calorie busting Mexican takeaways and heart clogging fillet minion steak .
He thinks nothing of eating the same food day in day out , ordering from a nearby posh restaurant and paying for his army of hangers - on .
The chronic insomniac – an avid nightclubber at the height of his fame - is often in bed by 9 pm but rarely sleeps more than a few hours at a time .
He usually gets up at dawn but instead of working on new songs in his home studio he lolls around watching TV or playing mind - numbing computer games .
His mother Debbie Nelson , who has just written a book ' My Son Marshall , My Son Eminem ' about her son , says he is barely recognisable nowadays .
Scroll down for more ...
" He 's let his blond hair grow out , so everything but the ends are dark , his face has broken out in pimples and he 's put on so much weight that he 's causing all sorts of other health problems for himself .
" Since childhood he 's suffered bouts of pneumonia .
He 's always had acute throat infections , like tonsillitis and he 's asthmatic .
His diet can't help . "
Debbie , whose book was published last month , says : " I fear for him every waking moment .
" I worry about his health all the time .
He 's always had high blood pressure and his cholesterol levels must be sky high .
" He orders filet mignon takeout from an expensive restaurant almost every evening .
I dread to think what his bills are – he pays for everyone hanging around the house . "
She believes he is becoming more like Elvis Presley – the star he has constantly been compared to for taking the music of poor black singers and turning it main stream – every day .
The grossly obese Presley retreated behind the gates of his Graceland mansion , surrounded by a Memphis mafia of hangers on who catered to his every whim .
He died of a heart attack , aged just 42 , after years of drug abuse .

Eminem 's mother fears he is also heading for an early grave if he does n't totally change his life style .
The rapper first retreated behind the doors of his Michigan home 18 months ago after his best mate and fellow rapper Proof died in a hail of bullets outside a sleazy 8 Mile Road club .
Debbie says Proof was the only person Eminem truly trusted after he shot to fame in 1999 with ' The Slim Shady LP ' .
They 'd known each other since their teens and Proof pulled him up on his drug taking and problems with on - off wife Kim .
In the months after Proof 's death , Eminem was once again battling Kim .
Their second marriage had lasted just 82 days with Kim claiming he was back on drugs – after a brief stint in rehab - and refusing to get help .
Eminem has known Kim since he was 15 and she was just 11 .
He says she is the only woman he has ever loved but his mother believes Kim is another bad habit that he just can't give up .
They share custody of their 11 - year - old daughter Hailie and live on the same exclusive gated estate on the outskirts of Detroit .
And despite their often knock - down , drag - out fights , they still flit in and out of each other 's lives .
After their first divorce , he dated superstar Mariah Carey but ultimately went back to Kim .
Friends say she has recently wheedled her way back into his affections after discovering that he was seeing a new girl .
His inner circle , including protégé 50 Cent , say it is unlikely Eminem will ever tour again because he likes to be home every night for Hailie .
But at 12 she is becoming independent , throwing teenage - style temper tantrums and refusing to stay in with her doting daddy .
Even so , she is one of the few people who can actually persuade Eminem to leave home .
He drives her to private school most mornings , attends parent teacher association meetings and goes to all of her dance recitals .
But the chronically shy singer , who won an Oscar and critical acclaim for his movie 8 Mile , usually wears a hooded jacket , spectacles and a scarf over his face to hide his features .
He cannot walk anywhere , even the local shopping mall , without being stopped by fans so on rare outings he surrounds himself with bodyguards and travels in a convoy of cars .
Last year he was slated to star in ' Have Gun – Will Travel ' , a movie remake of an old American western TV series , was expected to bring out his autobiography and was said to have a new album in the works .
But none of the projects went ahead .
Three months ago he surprised 50 Cent by phoning in to a radio show he was on to wish him well .
When the disc jockey asked what he up to , Eminem said he was ' in limbo ' .
It is the only public statement he has made since he spoke at Proof 's funeral , although he has emailed Detroit radio stations in the past to offer his opinion on things .
He still has a stable of acts , including Akon and Stat Quo , attached to his own record label plus a radio programme to showcase new music but even his D12 crew – once headed by Proof – are all now working on solo projects .
Debbie says that her son used to be a workaholic , constantly scribbling lyrics down on odd scraps of paper , then working in his studio constantly revising songs .
But now he appears to be suffering from writer 's block , wasting entire surfing the internet and watching TV .
Eminem has also cut many relatives and friends out of his life , claiming they only want him for his money .
He fell out with his mother when they became embroiled in a nasty court case over interviews he'd given saying she was a pill popping alcoholic who lived off welfare benefits and boyfriends .
Single mum Debbie was devastated by the fall out , along with his hate filled lyrics towards her in hits like ' Cleanin ' Out My Closet ' .
She claims he invented a new life for himself to get street cred with the Detroit rap crowd and then started to believe the tales he'd told .
He also confided that he was so strung out on drink and drugs that he had no memory of 1999 , the year he made it big and married Kim for the first time .
Debbie says that was one of the reasons she wrote her book .
She wanted it to be an open letter to her son to remind him of the good times they once had .
Growing up Eminem , whose real name is Marshall Mathers the Third , was a mummy 's boy who was too shy to play with other children .
Debbie says they were so close that , even as a teenager , relatives commented that it was as though the umbilical cord had never been cut .
But once he reached adulthood he started lashing out at her , even beating her up on his 23rd birthday .
Debbie refuses to blame her son , saying Kim created many of the problems between them and then once he became famous he was surrounded by a crew of yes - men and women .
" No one prepares you for the downside of celebrity , " she says , in her book .
" Marshall says fame brought a slew of problems he never expected .
He no longer trusts anyone .
Everyone wants a piece of Eminem , the mega star , not Marshall Mathers the man .
I call these people the circling vultures , they spot dollar signs and swoop in for the kill . "
And after discovering her son had spent Christmas in hospital , Debbie is even more worried about him and his destructive lifestyle .
She has offered to do anything she can to help him .
" If he needs me , I 'll be there in a heartbeat , " she adds .

The following story dramatizes how photopigments determine what one can see .
During World War II , the United States Navy wanted its sailors to be able to see infrared signal lights that would be invisible to the enemy .
Normally , it is impossible to see infrared radiation because , as pointed out earlier , the wavelengths are too long for human photopigments .
In order for humans to see infrared , the spectral sensitivity of some human photopigment would have to be changed .
Vision scientists knew that retinal , the derivative of vitamin A , was part of every photopigment molecule and that various forms of vitamin A existed .
If the retina could be encouraged to use some alternative form of vitamin A in its manufacture of photopigments , the spectral sensitivity of those photopigments would be abnormal , perhaps extending into infrared radiation .
Human volunteers were fed diets rich in an alternative form of vitamin A but deficient in the usual form .
Over several months , the volunteers ’ vision changed , giving them greater sensitivity to light of longer wavelengths .
Though the experiment seemed to be working , it was aborted .
The development of the “ snooperscope , ” an electronic device for seeing infrared radiation , made continuation of the experiment unnecessary ( Rubin and Walls , 1969 ) .
Still , the experiment demonstrates that photopigments select what one can see ; changing those photopigments would change one ’s vision .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
Three suspected al Qaeda militants , including two sisters , beheaded their uncle and his wife , forcing the couple ’s children to watch , Iraqi police said on Friday .
The militants considered that school guard Youssef al - Hayali was an infidel because he did not pray and wore western - style trousers , they told police interrogators after being arrested in Diyala province northwest of Baghdad .
The three cousins executed Hayali and his wife Zeinab Kamel at the all - boys school in Jalawlah in Diyala province , village police chief Captain Ahmed Khalifa said .
No further details were available .
Sunni Arab communities across Iraq have been turning against al Qaeda because of its indiscriminate killings and strict interpretation of Islam , which includes a ban on smoking in public and forcing schoolgirls to wear veils .
Sunni Arab tribal sheikhs have been organizing their young men into neighborhood police units to drive out al Qaeda , a practice which U.S. and Iraqi officials say has helped bring down violence levels across Iraq .
Security operations by U.S. and Iraqi troops have also been targeting al Qaeda in ethnically and religiously mixed Diyala in recent months after the Sunni Islamist fighters were driven out of western Anbar province .
The U.S. military said earlier in November that it was sending 3,000 soldiers home from the province but added that the overall number of forces in the province would not decrease .
The United States poured an extra 30,000 troops into Iraq from mid-February in a bid to stop the country from sliding into sectarian civil war .
U.S. and Iraqi officials say the troop “ surge ” and more efficient Iraqi security forces have also helped bring about sharp falls in U.S. military and Iraqi civilian casualties in the past two months .

“ THE forecaster is like an entrepreneur , ” says Roman Frydman .
“ He uses quantitative methods , but he also studies history , and relies on intuition and judgment .
He is not a scientist . ”
According to the New York University economist , this fact has been lost on contemporary economists , who continue to pursue the perfect economic forecast despite abundant evidence that it does not , and cannot , exist .
They dismiss their repeated failures in much the same way that self - styled reformers in Mr Frydman 's native Poland once insisted that socialism was great , but just needed to be carried out better .
In the economics profession the leading inheritors of this communistic mindset , says Mr Frydman , are the proponents of rational - expectations theory , which assumes that the economy and the individuals within it act with perfect foresight .
Yet he is equally critical of the more fashionable school of behavioural economics , or at least those of its practitioners who claim that although people are irrational , their irrationality can be modelled so precisely that the future can be forecast with great precision .
In a new book , “ Imperfect Knowledge Economics ” , written with Michael Goldberg of the University of New Hampshire , Mr Frydman sets out an alternative approach to prediction , in which the forecaster recognises that his model will inevitably be less than perfect .
Their work has received glowing praise from Nobel - prize - winning economists such as Kenneth Arrow and Edmund Phelps , who wrote the introduction to the book — though it is unlikely to have gone down so well with Robert Lucas , who won the Nobel for his work on rational expectations .
There is nothing new in economics about the idea that people must make decisions based on imperfect knowledge .
Frank Knight gave his name to “ Knightian uncertainty ” thanks to his 1921 book , “ Risk , Uncertainty and Profit ” , which noted that most business decisions involve a step into an unknown that is to some degree unmeasurable .
And John Maynard Keynes observed that “ human decisions affecting the future , whether personal or political or economic , cannot depend on strict mathematical expectation , since the basis for making such calculations does not exist . ”
While reflecting these insights , imperfect - knowledge economics still sees a role for economic theory in forecasting .
Messrs Frydman and Goldberg argue that , to be useful , economic forecasting models should be based on qualitative regularities in the way that market participants respond to new information — that is , patterns of behaviour that are observable and somewhat predictable .
Though not perfect , these will often give a better clue to the future than no model at all , or models based on rational expectations or behavioural economics .
Take bulls and bears , for example .
Their analysis of the fundamentals leads them to opposite conclusions about where prices are going .
But there is evidence that the way they revise their forecasts in the light of price movements may share common features , such as a tendency to become more risk averse the further the price of an asset moves away from what is generally believed to be its long - term fundamental value .
This may work eventually to return the asset price to its fundamental value , though it may also cause it to deviate significantly from this value for long periods of time .
This approach will not generate the “ sharp predictions ” beloved of most contemporary economists — which are doomed by imperfect knowledge to be wrong .
But it will provide a broad sense of the state of play , which an enterprising forecaster can usefully combine with experience , intuition and so forth when making a decision .
To show how this works , Messrs Frydman and Goldberg examine the persistent failure of economists to predict movements in the currency markets .
According to Kenneth Rogoff , an economist at Harvard who has long attempted to find rational models for predicting currency fluctuations , “ it is stunning how hard it is to explain movements in exchange rates . ”
All the models based on rational expectations now say that , on fundamentals , the euro is overvalued against the dollar , he reckons .
But does that mean the dollar will soon rise ?
Mr Rogoff says he has no idea .
In rational - expectations theory , a range of variables including inflation , interest rates and growth should have a predictable impact on currency movements , but in practice this theory has proved less useful for forecasting than tossing a coin .
Among rational economists , the debate is over “ whether the glass is 5 % full or 95 % empty , ” he says .
Only over longer periods — say two to four years — is there any evidence of exchange - rate predictability , which is far too long to be useful to traders or policymakers .
By contrast , the model developed by Messrs Frydman and Goldman , which assumes imperfect knowledge and learning , does significantly better than tossing a coin , although it is by no means right all the time .
Mr Rogoff describes this work as innovative .
Now , however , it must demonstrate that it can consistently maintain explanatory power in the future and over a range of markets , he believes .
Maths lesson
Messrs Frydman and Goldberg are now turning their attention to the troubled subprime - mortgage markets , and the performance of the rating agencies .
The rating agencies , argues Mr Frydman , have generally been better at rating corporate bonds than rating asset - backed collateralised - debt obligations .
Why ?
One reason is that the rating agencies used both a mathematical model and the judgment of their in - house specialists when forecasting the default probabilities of corporate bonds ; on subprime - related securities , they could only use mathematical models , not least because the instruments were so new .
“ They had no experience , no intuition , no entrepreneur , ” he says .
That is “ empirical proof that relying on models alone is not wise . ”
A common misconception about regular expression performance is that lazy quantifiers ( also called non-greedy , reluctant , minimal , or ungreedy ) are faster than their greedy equivalents .
That 's generally not true , but with an important qualifier : in practice , lazy quantifiers often are faster .
This seeming contradiction is due to the fact that many people rely on backtracking to compensate for the impreciseness of their patterns , often without realizing this is what they 're doing .
Hence , the previously mentioned misconception stems from that fact that lazy quantifiers often result in much less backtracking when combined with long subject strings and the ( mis ) use of overly flexible regex tokens such as the dot .
Consider the following simple example :
When the regexes <.*?> and <[ ^ > ]*> are applied to the subject string " <0123456789 > " , they are functionally equivalent .
The only difference is how the regex engine goes about generating the match .
However , the latter regex ( which uses a greedy quantifier ) is more efficient , because it describes what the user really means : match the character " < " , followed by any number of characters which are not " > " , and finally , match the character " > " .
Defined this way , it requires no backtracking in the case of any successful match , and only one backtracking step in the case of any unsuccessful match .
Hand - optimization of regex patterns largely revolves around the ideas of reducing backtracking and the steps which are potentially required to match or fail at any given character position , and here we 've reduced both cases to the absolute minimum .
So what exactly is different about how a backtracking , leftmost - first regex engine ( your traditional NFA engine type , which describes most modern , Perl - derivative flavors ) goes about matching our subject text when working with these two regexes ?
Let 's first take a look at what happens with <.*?> .
I 'll use the RegexBuddy debugger style to illustrate each step .
Note :
If you 're reading this in a feed reader or aggregator which strips out inline styles , see the original post , which should make things much easier to follow .
Beginning match attempt at character 0 < < ok < backtrack < 0 < 0 backtrack < 0 1 < 0 1 backtrack < 01 2 < 01 2 backtrack < 012 3 < 012 3 backtrack < 0123 4 < 0123 4 backtrack < 01234 5 < 01234 5 backtrack < 012345 6 < 012345 6 backtrack < 0123456 7 < 0123456 7 backtrack < 01234567 8 < 01234567 8 backtrack < 012345678 9 < 012345678 9 >
Match found
The text ok means the engine completed a successful , zero - length match , and backtrack shows where the engine backtracks to the last choice point .
As you can see here , with lazy quantification the engine backtracks forward after each character which is not followed by " > " .
Here 's what happens with <[ ^ > ]*> :
Beginning match attempt at character 0 < < 012345678 9 < 012345678 9 >
Match found
As you can see , 20 fewer steps are required , and there is no backtracking .
This is faster , and can also increase the potential for internal optimization of the matching process .
As a simple example , when greedily quantifying an any - character token , the engine can simply move the read - head to the end of the string , rather than testing every character along the way ( this is an oversimplification of the process taken by modern regex engines , but you get the idea ) .
You can see this exact kind of internal optimization occurring in IE with the " trim8 " pattern in my Faster JavaScript
Trim post from a while back .
You might be wondering what happens if we use the regex <.*> .
Take a look :
Beginning match attempt at character 0 < < 0123456789 > < 0123456789 > backtrack < 012345678 9 < 012345678 9 >
Match found
Although the output did n't change much when used with our subject string of " <0123456789 > " , you can see that the .* caused the engine to trek all the way to the end of the string , then backtrack from the right .
If we 'd used a 10,000 - character string without newlines or other " > " characters , that would 've resulted in nearly 10,000 backtracks .
In short :
Anxious to avoid upsetting air travelers , NASA is withholding results from an unprecedented national survey of pilots that found safety problems like near collisions and runway interference occur far more frequently than the government previously recognized .
NASA gathered the information under an $ 8.5 million safety project , through telephone interviews with roughly 24,000 commercial and general aviation pilots over nearly four years .
Since ending the interviews at the beginning of 2005 and shutting down the project completely more than one year ago , the space agency has refused to divulge the results publicly .
Just last week , NASA ordered the contractor that conducted the survey to purge all related data from its computers .
The Associated Press learned about the NASA results from one person familiar with the survey who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss them .
A senior NASA official , associate administrator Thomas S. Luedtke , said revealing the findings could damage the public 's confidence in airlines and affect airline profits .
Luedtke acknowledged that the survey results " present a comprehensive picture of certain aspects of the U.S. commercial aviation industry .
" The AP sought to obtain the survey data over 14 months under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
" Release of the requested data , which are sensitive and safety - related , could materially affect the public confidence in , and the commercial welfare of , the air carriers and general aviation companies whose pilots participated in the survey , " Luedtke wrote in a final denial letter to the AP .
NASA also cited pilot confidentiality as a reason , although no airlines were identified in the survey , nor were the identities of pilots , all of whom were promised anonymity .
Among other results , the pilots reported at least twice as many bird strikes , near mid-air collisions and runway incursions as other government monitoring systems show , according to a person familiar with the results who was not authorized to discuss them publicly .
The survey also revealed higher - than - expected numbers of pilots who experienced " in-close approach changes " _ potentially dangerous , last - minute instructions to alter landing plans .
Officials at the NASA Ames Research Center in California have said they want to publish their own report on the project by year 's end .
"
If the airlines are n't safe I want to know about it , " said Rep. Brad Miller , R - N.C. , chairman of the House Science and Technology investigations and oversight subcommittee .
" I would rather not feel a false sense of security because they do n't tell us .
" Discussing NASA 's decision not to release the survey data , the congressman said : " There is a faint odor about it all .
" Miller asked NASA last week to provide his oversight committee with information on the survey and the decision to withhold data .
Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto is dead .
She was shot by her assassin , who then blew himself up .
Bhutto's archenemy , Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf , who has the most to gain from her death , tried to make it look as though he had n't wished for such a thing
Musharraf blamed Islamic extremists for Bhutto's death and said he would redouble his efforts to fight them .
" This is the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war , " he said in a nationally televised speech .
" I have been saying that the nation faces the greatest threats from these terrorists .
...
We will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists and root them out . "
Right , right , right .
" Terrorists . " Gotcha .
Anything bad happens , it 's dem damn dirty terr 'rists .
teh terr 'rists
Is n't it weird how the terrorists ' are so kean to assassinate a politician with no actual power who may or may not have had a shot at the presidency ?
Especially when the presidency is currently occupied by a secular militant Bush - crony who hated Bhutto ?
Hmmm ....
Meanwhile , our esteemed president was quick to blametoo :
In the U.S. , a tense looking President Bush strongly condemned the attack " by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan 's democracy . "
Undermine Pakistanti democracy ?
You mean , like by supporting a dictator instead of demonstrators agitating for liberty ?
I guess that makes Bush a " murderous extremist . "
Even more interesting is how he already knows that it was some lone gunman ( " extremist " is a great catch - all ) when there has n't been an investigation yet .
In fact , all of the neocon / fascist front have already condemned the attack , from Sarkozy to Karzai to Gordon Brown to the Pope .
They were so quick with statements you have to wonder if they knew it was coming .
And every single one of them has accepted Musharraf 's version of events without question .
Interesting ....
Of course , Americans are in the thrall of a malicious and corrupt media establishment .
There will be no questioning the official version of events .
The Pakistanis at least are not so stupid :
Many chanted slogans against Musharraf , accusing him of complicity in her killing .
" We repeatedly informed the government to provide her proper security and appropriate equipment ... but they paid no heed to our requests , " Malik said .
As news of her death spread , angry supporters took to the streets .
In Pakistan it 's obvious .
The president 's most esteemed foe is dead with a bullet in her neck .
Do the fucking math .
Bhutto had returned to Pakistan from an eight - year exile on Oct. 18 .
On the same day , she narrowly escaped injury when her homecoming parade in Karachi was targeted in a suicide attack that killed more than 140 people .
Islamic militants linked to al - Qaida and the Taliban hated Bhutto for her close ties to the Americans and support for the war on terrorism .
A local Taliban leader reportedly threatened to greet Bhutto's return to the country with suicide bombings .
UPDATE 12/28 :
Perhaps more shockingly , an attendee at the rally where Bhutto was killed says police charged with protecting her " abandoned their posts , " leaving just a handful of Bhutto's own bodyguards protecting her .
pk_analyst
While some intelligence officials , especially within the US , were quick to finger al Qaeda militants as responsible for Bhutto 's death , it remains unclear precisely who was responsible and some speculation has centered on Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , its military or even forces loyal to the current president Pervez Musharraf .
Rawalpindi , where Bhutto was killed , is the garrison city that houses the Pakistani military 's headquarters .
Musharraf is a military man .
The military is the most powerful institution in Pakistan and their intelligence service , the ISI , is a known collaborator with the CIA ( some say it 's just a CIA puppet ) .
The motive , means and opportunity are all right there .
But we Americans -- you know home of the brave , land of the free -- will swallow the Musharraf propaganda like manna because our Dear Leader and his corrupt , oligarchical establishment have their fingers in this wicked little pie .
Pakistan is necessary for the perpetuation of other frauds , including the al Qaeda myth .
That 's why control of Pakistan cannot be allowed to return to the hands of a democrat .
The secret could be revealed , and that is most certainly worth killing for .
This is not the first attempt on Bhutto 's life : That was Musharraf 's first " welcome back " message .
Now , he has said " goodbye .
" Now here comes the lie :
That 's a straight - up lie .
First of all the Taliban has no claim on Pakistan ; they are ( ostensibly ) Afghanis who are more concerned with fighting the Bush - puppet Hamad Karzai .
Second , if al Qaeda truly hated Bush and the Americans they would target Musharraf , since he is Bush 's closest and most powerful ally in Pakistan .
Bhutto's death does nothing but strengthen his hand .
The truth is that the CIA and the ISI worked together to train and create al Qaeda for bin Laden as a convenient scapegoat for anything and everything .
Now al Qaeda is getting the blame again .
How convenient for a dictator like Musharraf ( or Bush ) to have a shadowy , ultra -evil organization to blame for everything .
How convenient that al Qaeda apparently hates the same people that Bush and Musharraf do .
How convenient that al Qaeda never seems to manage to kill right - wing hardliners but has amazing success with leftist pro-liberty politicians .
How extremely fucking convenient .
The CIA / ISI / al - Qaeda axis is just a modern day Gestapo .
They are an all - purpose assassination squad under control of the evil proto - fascist oligarchs who rule this planet .
It 's time for people to wake up and see through the lies .
How many more people have to die before we finally learn we 're being played for fools ?
The police charged with providing security for Bhutto left their posts shortly before the assassination .
As commenterpoints out below Bhutto was shot with an AK - 47 rifle .
Now the spinning , changing storylines and Big Lies come into play .
In order to do a proper cover - up the authorities will have to eliminate the gun ( many are saying she hit her head on some sort of lever instead of taking a bullet ) and throw all the blame on mysertious al Qaeda members who may or may not even exist .
Just to be clear , " intelligence officials " almost certainly means " CIA officials . "
The CIA is busily spinning the press .
This is misinformation , folks .
You are being lied to indirectly by your government and somewhat unwittingly by the media .
Just so you know .

Roscoe Bartlett seems to always be 2 steps ahead .
For several years now he has been speaking , often to only a few Members , on the issues surrounding Peak Oil and our nations need to change our oil intensive way of life .
Now , as House leaders are lauding a new Energy Bill ( details of which Robert Rapier highlighted here ) that will create agricultural jobs and make us depend on the ' Midwest instead of the Middle East " , Congressman Bartlett is again ahead of the pack .
Knowing that all energy is not created equal , and that biofuels have large costs in terms of energy , water demands , pesticide and fertilizer use , as well as competition for food , the science - trained Congressman voted nay on the Energy bill which included a more than doubling of corn ethanol production over the next decade .
He references the National Academy of Science report on The Implications of Biofuel Production on US Water Supplies , and is looking ahead to where we really need to change - efficiency , conservation and new ways of structuring our society .
Below the fold is the press release from the Congressmans website .
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett ( R - 6 - MD ) supports a change in America ’s energy policies to encourage conservation of finite fossil fuels , increase efficiency and promote development of alternative domestic renewable resources .
However , today , he voted NO on amendments to H.R. 6 because of the Senate ’s addition to expand the biofuels ethanol mandate .
Congressman Bartlett was an original cosponsor of H.R. 6 when it was introduced in January 2007 and voted to support final passage of the previous comprehensive House energy bill , H.R. 3221 .
Both excluded expansions in the ethanol mandate .
The Economist magazine reported today that U.S. subsidies for ethanol are raising food prices worldwide reversing historical trends .
“ I welcome the Senate ’s addition to strengthen CAFÉ standards to increase gas mileage of new cars and trucks , ” said Congressman Bartlett said , “ However , the hype that using food crops for fuel , such as corn ethanol or soy biodiesel and the hope that cellulosic ethanol could achieve independence from imported oil is extremely harmful . ”
Congressman Bartlett explained , “ With mounting evidence of the harmful effects of the 2005 Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) mandate for 7.5 billion gallons of corn ethanol , I could not in good conscience vote to double that mandate .
Corn ethanol and soy biodiesel can never replace more than a drop in the bucket of our gas and diesel use .
However , corn prices doubled due to the 2005 mandate which harms Maryland ’s dairy and chicken farmers and raises the price of food which hurts low income people .
That is why livestock farmers and food manufacturers oppose expanding the corn ethanol and soy biodiesel mandate in this bill . ”
Congressman Bartlett noted , “ The U.S. has only 2 percent of known oil reserves .
We use 25 percent of the world 's oil and import two - thirds of what we are using .
We pump our reserves four times faster than the rest of the world .
There will be a day after tomorrow and we have to slow down the depletion of America ’s oil and natural gas to preserve some for future generations .
I hope the Senate will make changes in this bill that will allow me to support it . ”
Congressman Bartlett pointed out that in June 2006 the National Academies of Science ( NAS ) released a study that concluded there was a very limited potential from corn ethanol and soy biodiesel .
Discounting for fossil fuel inputs , Americans would replace only 2.4 % of gasoline consumption if the entire U.S. corn crop was devoted to corn ethanol .
Similarly , if the entire soybean crop was used to make soy biodiesel , that would replace only 2.9 % of Americans ’ diesel consumption .
( source ) .
Two of the NAS study co-authors wrote in the Washington Post on March 25 , 2007 that Americans could save more gasoline if we kept our tires inflated and our car engines tuned .
A March 26 , 2007 study prepared for the Dairy Farmers of America found 11 % of America ’s corn crop was used for corn ethanol in 2005 .
That grew to 18 % in 2006/07 and is projected to increase to @ 25 % of corn crop 2007 / 08 .
The National Cattlemen 's Beef Association projects the doubled mandate for 15 billion gallons of corn ethanol would require roughly 41 percent of U.S. corn production .
Congressman Bartlett said
“ there is a lot of hope but little evidence that cellulosic ethanol could replace gasoline .
If all of our corn and all of our soybeans grown on our best land replaces just a fraction of our gasoline and diesel , I seriously doubt what contributions can be provided by cellulosic ethanol which is still in development .
We might mine our soils of organic matter to make fuel for a little while , but I do n’t think that ’s sustainable . ”
The Chamber of Commerce recently reported , “ The bill supposedly calls for a renewable fuels mandate of 36 billion gallons by 2022 , with 21 billion of these gallons to be met with " advanced biofuels , " or non-corn - based biofuels .
The bill does not , however , adequately address such critical issues as : ( 1 ) where the U.S. intends to secure enough water ( from an already - scarce supply ) so that it may grow enough corn and other biomass to meet the mandate ; ( 2 ) how the nation will protect against formation of " dead zones " of oxygen - depleted water caused by increased farming and irrigation to meet the mandate ; ( 3 ) how the U.S. intends to transport 36 billion gallons of ethanol , given that current pipeline systems are not compatible ; and ( 4 ) the effect the increased burning of ethanol will have on background levels of ozone , a pollutant currently regulated by EPA under the Clean Air Act . ”
Congressman Bartlett said , “ I recommend everyone read a speech given fifty years ago on May 14 , 1957 by the father of America ’s nuclear navy , Admiral Hyman Rickover .
He was so prescient .
He pointed out that fossil fuels are n’t forever and that we have a moral obligation to leave younger generations some oil and natural gas . ”
The entire speech ( pdf ) is posted on Congressman Bartlett ’s website here .
Excerpts :
“ Our civilization rests upon a technological base which requires enormous quantities of fossil fuels .
What assurance do we then have that our energy needs will continue to be supplied by fossil fuels :
The answer is - in the long run - none .
… In the face of the basic fact that fossil fuel reserves are finite , the exact length of time these reserves will last is important in only one respect : the longer they last , the more time do we have , to invent ways of living off renewable or substitute energy sources and to adjust our economy to the vast changes which we can expect from such a shift .
Fossil fuels resemble capital in the bank .
A prudent and responsible parent will use his capital sparingly in order to pass on to his children as much as possible of his inheritance .
A selfish and irresponsible parent will squander it in riotous living and care not one whit how his offspring will fare . ”
Congressman Bartlett said , “ In that same speech , Rickover warned that using food for fuel was unrealistic and short - sighted :
“ Wood fuel and farm wastes are dubious as substitutes because of growing food requirements to be anticipated .
Land is more likely to be used for food production than for tree crops ; farm wastes may be more urgently needed to fertilize the soil than to fuel machines . ”

Roscoe Bartlett - a scientist , and my kind of politician - thinking smartly about the future and willing to discuss hard truths .
Kids who ride ATVs have an alarming number of potentially disabling injuries , a study reports .
All - terrain vehicles , or ATVs , weigh up to 600 pounds and can travel at speeds of 65 mph or more .
The study adds to other evidence suggesting dangers faced by children who ride ATVs : The Consumer Product Safety Commission says 40,400 children were treated in U.S. emergency rooms in 2005 after ATV accidents .
" The public should know that ATVs are not safe , " says researcher Chetan Shah of the Arkansas Children 's Hospital in Little Rock , who presented his team 's findings Monday at the annual meeting in Chicago of the Radiological Society of North America .
Shah and his colleagues studied 500 children and teens injured in ATV accidents and brought to the emergency room at Children 's Hospital over eight years .
They found that the number of ATV injuries more than doubled from 1998 to 2006 .
Bone fractures were the most common problem during that time frame : 208 children received such an injury .
Shah recalls one 2 - year - old who had a broken thighbone :
She 's 5 now , but she still walks with a limp , he says .
Head injuries also were common .
The team counted 85 skull fractures , 66 cases of bleeding in the brain and 59 children who had damage to the brain tissue .
In some cases , the head injury was mild and the patient recovered , but in other cases , the brain did n't heal completely .
" Some kids end up with learning problems , " he says .
In 12 cases , children were injured so severely in an ATV crash that doctors at the Arkansas hospital had to amputate an arm or a leg .
The study said six children died after ATV accidents .
Shah says his study included only children who made it to the hospital alive .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 16 be barred from ATV use , but the vehicles are largely unregulated and , some doctors say , they 're growing in popularity .
" Kids see ATVs on TV .
They see their friends riding them , and they 're very attractive , " says Donald Frush , a pediatric radiologist at Duke University in Durham , N.C. Doctors such as Frush say children do n't have the judgment or coordination to operate an ATV properly .
But Doug Morris , director of the All - Terrain Vehicle Association , a Pickerington , Ohio , group that lobbies for the rights of ATV riders , says , " Hundreds of thousands of kids ride ATVs safely . "
Parents should supervise children and make sure they 're wearing protective gear , says Tim Buche , president of the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America , an Irvine , Calif. , group representing the major makers of ATVs .
Buche says the vast majority of accidents occur when riders disregard safety precautions outlined by the industry .

BBC Radio 4's The Investigation
Herceptin is an expensive drug
Dr Peter Kirkbride , the chief spokesman on radiotherapy for the NHS , said the NHS spent £ 100 m on the breast cancer drug Herceptin in 2006 .
But he told Radio 4's
The Investigation only about 500 patients had benefited - at a cost of about £ 200,000 each .
If that was spent on radiotherapy , it could have a dramatic impact , he said .
There is a lot of publicity about the role of chemotherapy but the consensus is of all cancers that are cured , half are cured by surgeries , 40 % by radiotherapy and only 10 % by drugs
Dr Peter Kirkbride
National Clinical Lead for Radiotherapy
Cancer survival in the UK is still below the European average , despite recent improvements .
Herceptin was approved for use in women with early stage breast cancer in 2006 after a fast - track assessment by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence .
But now some cancer doctors are concerned this focus on new cancer drugs may not be a good thing .
Dr Kirkbride said : " There is a lot of publicity about the role of chemotherapy but the consensus is of all cancers that are cured , half are cured by surgeries , 40 % by radiotherapy and only 10 % by drugs .
" If I was to spend £ 100 m on radiotherapy , I could buy something like 90 machines , I could buy 30 simulators and I could probably benefit about 30,000 patients for the same amount of money . "
Radiotherapy problems
Earlier this year , the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group published a report which called for a 91 % increase in radiotherapy treatments in England in the next 10 years .
But the trade body for the manufacturers of radiotherapy machines has told the BBC that instead of seeing more business , it has all but dried up .
David Miles , the chairman of the radiotherapy specialist focus group of the Association of X - ray Equipment Manufacturers which formed to highlight the problem , says there has been a " collapse in critical investment " .
He said : " We noticed after the government initiatives to improve the established stock of radiotherapy equipment , it actually ended in April last year .
And the sales of machines then fell off drastically .
" One order has been placed in the last 20 months . "
Because it takes around three years from when an order is first placed until it treats its first patient , the radiotherapy focus group at AXrEM says the NHS should have bought 20 replacements machines by now instead of just one .
' Not sexy enough '
Dr Kirkbride thinks part of the problem is raising the discipline 's profile in the eyes of both the public and government .
He said : " We are not sexy enough .
We do n't have pharmaceutical companies backing us in the same way that some of the drugs companies support campaigns for the use of their drugs . "
Professor Mike Richards , the National Cancer Director , said there should be room in the cancer budget for both .
He said : " There is no doubt that Herceptin is a good drug .
There is no doubt that it has been looked at carefully by NICE and it has been deemed to be both effective and cost - effective .
" Radiotherapy is also effective and we need to make sure that it's not one or the other , but that we actually have a service that delivers both . "

White House rejects Dems ' compromise on war funding , domestic spending
Congressional Democrats are poised to hand President Bush upward of $ 50 billion in Iraq funding with no strings attached , and they 've already offered to cut $ 11 billion from their domestic spending bills .
But in an unusual Saturday afternoon statement , the White House said it would veto any omnibus spending bill that exceeds the president 's domestic spending request , a clear sign that the administration is unwilling to compromise on appropriations as the Christmas holidays approach .
The House is expected to vote Tuesday on a $ 520 billion bill that wraps all domestic spending into one package , along with billions for Iraq with no troop withdrawal conditions , and the Senate is likely to follow with a vote later in the week .
Still , White House Budget Director Jim Nussle said Saturday it 's too much money for domestic programs - and not enough for the war .
" If Congress insists on sending the president a budget - busting bill they know he will veto and that will not become law , they should also pass a continuing resolution that keeps the government running and provides the troops in the field the funds they need , " Nussle said .
It 's not clear if Democrats will further give in to White House demands and cut more from their domestic spending bills , or whether they 'll challenge him to veto an omnibus funding measure for virtually every agency of the federal government .
Democrats were hoping that Bush would embrace a compromise on domestic spending that met the White House halfway on its spending figures if Congress gave the administration war money with no conditions .
If Democrats cut their spending bills further , they risk alienating even more in their own party who are already disappointed with the proposal to drop demands for troop withdrawal from Iraq .
" This is the kind of reckless and irresponsible statement that the American people have come to expect from this White House , " said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
" While the president and his Republican allies continue to stubbornly cling to a failed war policy , [ the ]
Democrats will continue to push for a responsible way forward . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , who has been asking for Democrats to compromise on spending , will stick with the president , at least for now .
" While I appreciate the movement in the right direction on the part of congressional Democrats toward concluding this Congress , we must not overspend the taxpayers ' money and we must protect our troops , " McConnell said .
UPDATE : Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) have responded this afternoon with a strong statement , ripping the president for being unwilling to compromise .
" Although he admits he has not even seen the bipartisan legislation that would fund critical priorities such as border security , homeland security , and putting more police officers on the street , the president has recklessly threatened to veto it , " Reid and Pelosi said in a joint statement .
" For a president already lacking in credibility , it is dangerous to issue veto threats based on press reports alone . "

One new bill proposes tighter state control over Russian online news sites .
Another restricts foreign ownership of Internet service providers ( ISPs ) .
And a new government decree compels ISPs to allow the authorities to read their clients ’ e-mails .
As censorship of the traditional media increased under President Vladimir Putin , the Internet quickly carved out a niche as a rare bastion of dissent and free expression for Russians .
With its lively blogs and chat rooms , the Russian Internet has become the 21st - century equivalent of Soviet - era samizdat and hushed , kitchen - table political discussion .
Are the bureaucrats and government censors finally preparing to stifle this last oasis of media freedom ?
According to Oleg Panfilov , a free press advocate who heads the Moscow - based Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations , the Russian authorities have been wary of the Internet ’s growing importance for years .
“ They are afraid .
This fear of the Internet emerged about four years ago when the Kremlin saw how it became the main source of information during the Orange Revolution , ” Panfilov , who himself writes a popular blog on the website “ LiveJournal , ” says .
Buyer Beware
A decree from the Information Technologies and Communications Ministry , made public on February 26 , requires all telecommunication companies and ISPs to allow the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) unrestricted monitoring of all communications — phone calls , text messages , and e-mails .
Telecoms and ISPs are also required to install , at their own expense , equipment allowing the FSB to monitor communications at any time without the provider ’s — or the user ’s — knowledge .
The equipment costs as much as $ 100,000 .
The decree is related to a program called SORM - 2 , which was introduced in 1998 to allow the FSB to monitor the Internet .
Separately , a provision in a new bill on investment working its way through parliament would forbid foreigners from acquiring majority stakes in ISPs without express government permission .
Insiders say the legislation is likely to face strong opposition from within the industry .
“ I do n’t think it is very realistic to pass such a law , because there is a strong lobby against it .
There are already a lot of companies that have a high level of foreign shareholders , ” Aleksandr Militsky , who runs a website that monitors ISPs , tells RFE / RL ’s Russian Service .
While state - controlled television and most print media dutifully reported the government line with fawning coverage of Putin and his chosen successor , Dmitry Medvedev , blogs like “ LiveJournal ” and news sites like newsru.com were critical , animated , and irreverent .
Robert Amsterdam , an attorney on jailed former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky ’s international defense team and the author of an influential blog on Russian affairs , says the emerging trend toward greater state control reflects an entrenched Kremlin view that managing the media is an important aspect of defending national security .
“ This is all going in one direction , ” Amsterdam says of the emerging Kremlin strategy .
“ One of the things I do n’t think any of us understand well enough is the extent to which the Russians view this as part of their security — the securitization of media .
And this comes under this whole format of seeing free communications as somehow being a security threat .
My view is that they have been late jumping on the Internet bandwagon and they are going to continue this under [ President - elect ] Medvedev .
At least that is how it appears . ”
‘ Responsible ’ Journalism
In March , Putin established a new federal agency to regulate media and the Internet and oversee content .
A month later , authorities used loopholes in the law to shut down the Siberian online publication “ Novy Fokus ” for failing to register as a news organization despite the fact that Russian law does not explicitly require online news sites to register .
Vladimir Slutsker , a member of the Federation Council , the upper house of Russia ’s parliament , is now seeking to make registration mandatory .
Slutsker recently told the daily “ Kommersant ” that legislation was needed to stop “ irresponsible journalists from spreading rumors and hiding behind anonymous websites . ”
After a website published rumors linking Slutsker and his wife to criminal activity , he introduced legislation requiring all websites with more than 1,000 hits a day to register with the government as media outlets .
If Slutsker ’s bill becomes law , Russia ’s popular blogs and news sites would need to apply for licenses and be subject to the same regulations as print and broadcast media .
Analysts have labeled Slutsker ’s bill impractical given the sheer volume of websites and the difficultly tracking them , adding that the time when the authorities could realistically control the Internet is long gone .
“ This attempt to register websites like mass media is stupid , ” Panfilov says .
“ It is simply not possible .
It is just the desire of a couple of deputies , but it wo n’t happen .
Just imagine , how do you register blogs ?
Also , the meters monitoring web traffic in Russia all give different information . ”
Panfilov adds that a system similar to what exists in China , where the state controls the Internet and blocks websites it deems subversive , is not possible in Russia today .
He notes that unlike in China , most Russian ISPs are privately owned and more difficult to control .
“ They needed to do this 10 years ago , ” Panfilov says .
“ Then they could have controlled it .
Now it is practically impossible .
Now enough people know how to use satellite servers , they know how to access the Internet via mobile communications , they know a lot .
And to isolate Russia from the Internet is not possible . ”
‘ Great Firewalls ’ ?
Some Russia watchers say the Kremlin is n’t interested in Chinese - style controls .
Amsterdam points out that Russia ’s media control strategy — which allows for opposition newspapers like “ Novaya gazeta ” and radio stations like Ekho Moskvy — is more sophisticated than that .
“ You ’re missing the boat if you do n’t think they can control it , ” Amsterdam says .
“ What we need to understand is that they are not trying to , and do n’t have to control 100 percent of it .
One of the things that the survival of ‘ Novaya gazeta ’ and [ radio station ]
Ekho Moskvy shows is that they are very happy for liberals to talk to liberals .
They just do n’t want liberals talking to anybody else . ”
Amsterdam adds that a combination of intimidation , selective use of libel laws , cooptation , and other means has been very effective in controlling the print and broadcast media .
And there are indications that such time - proven mechanisms can be of use to the authorities in the modern media environment as well .
Recent charges against blogger Savva Terentyev for allegedly “ inciting hate ” against police officers through his “ LiveJournal ” posts serve as one example .
Terentyev faces a possible $ 4,000 fine or up to two years in prison .
“ The attack on the Internet can be this subtle incremental attack , ” Amsterdam says “ Let ’s be clear , it ’s multidimensional .
Look what they have done to the regular press .
Look what they have done to television .
They have been so successful with a mixture of cooptation , which is having rich friends buy assets , with the incremental intimidation of self - censorship which is done very well , that they probably do n’t feel that they have to [ control it entirely ] . ”

Accepting the bad times could make for a happy marriage
Therapists from California State University , Northridge and Virginia
Tech say accepting these problems is better than striving for perfection .
And they blame cultural fairytales and modern love stories for perpetuating the myth that enjoying a perfect relationship is possible .
The report was published in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy .
The pursuit of relationship nirvana can be potentially damaging
Jan Parker
The authors , Dr Diane Gehart and Dr Eric McCollum say it is a " myth that , with enough effort we can achieve a state without suffering . "
And they say healthcare professionals may not be helping the situation .
" The field of mental health perpetuates this myth with the very concept of " mental health , " which implies a state without suffering , " they say .
Potentially damaging
But this belief can eventually cause people to believe that with enough effort they can eliminate suffering .
And experts say this is an unrealistic aim in relationships , and striving to achieve it can lead people to feel they have failed .
Jan Parker of the Association of Family Therapy said : " The authors are right to point out that the pursuit of relationship nirvana can be potentially damaging . "
She said it was important to explore what people mean by a happy and healthy relationship , because nobody 's life or relationship can be in a permanent state of happiness - there will always be more difficult times .
She said couples need to build strengths , such as understanding , in their relationships to help them cope in these hard times and appreciate the good times .
Mrs Nadine Field , a consultant psychologist , said it was a " fantasy " that any relationship could be perfect and that striving for such an impossible state could lead to bitter disappointment .
She said this disappointment could then cause people to focus on the negative aspects of a relationship , and lead to more disappointment and resentment .
She said : " People need to try to understand their partners through communication , rather than demanding perfection of them . "
Meditation
The authors recommend using mindfulness , a Buddhist meditation technique , to help cope with family suffering .
The technique requires individuals to focus on their present thoughts and actions , and is already used by some psychiatrists in the UK .
The authors say family therapists can integrate the principles into their work to help patients change the way they relate to the forms of suffering that can occur in intimate relationships , such as abuse , divorce , rejection , and loss .
“ Is DCA worth trying ?
We absolutely think so , ” proclaimed a website promoting the laboratory chemical sodium dichloroacetate ( DCA ) as a treatment for cancer earlier this year .
The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) clearly did not agree .
Last week it visited the site ’s owners and told them to stop making and selling DCA from a sister website , or face criminal prosecution .
Jim Tassano of Sonora , California , claims to have sold DCA to more than 2000 people , with no reports of serious side effects , via his website www.buydca.com.
However , on the 17 July he posted the following message on the site .
“ Two agents from the FDA visited us today and ordered that we stop making and selling DCA .
Unfortunately , the site www.buydca.com will be shut down .
It is against US government law to sell substances with the suggestion that they are cancer treatments unless they are approved by the FDA .
DCA can still be obtained from pharmacies with a prescription and from chemical companies . ”

The FDA confirmed that agents from their Office of Criminal Investigations had visited Tassano , but declined to comment further .
‘ Improvements reported ’
In an interview with New Scientist , Tassano told us : “ We ’ve seen cancers where it does n’t seem to respond at all [ to DCA ] , but a lot of people have reported improvements in their symptoms . ”
“ I ’m disappointed [ that the FDA has shut the website down ] , but not surprised .
It is an unapproved cancer treatment and we have become very high profile .
I guess the pressure has got to be too much for the FDA , ” he said .
Tassano continues to host discussions on the supposed virtues of the chemical , which has not yet undergone human trials as a cancer therapy , on his original site www.thedcasite.com.
Researchers studying DCA as a potential cancer drug welcomed the FDA ’s action .
“ The FDA is doing the absolutely right thing to help protect vulnerable cancer patients from the unregulated use of a drug that should be studied in properly designed clinical studies , ” says Chi Van Dang at Johns Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore , Maryland , US .
Worrying reports
Kate Law , Cancer Research UK ’s clinical trial director , agrees : “ Reports of people buying personal supplies of DCA from sources such as the internet were very worrying . ”
“ It is important that all new treatments are carefully investigated to make sure they are effective and safe for use in patients .
DCA is no exception , so we are pleased that the FDA has taken the decisive action to limit the sale of DCA over the internet , ” she says .
Clinical trials of DCA are expected to take place in the near future .
Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in Edmonton has just resubmitted protocols to Health Canada , and hopes to gain approval to for a safety trial of DCA in human cancer patients in the coming weeks .
Meanwhile , Van Dang has just received notice of funding to carry out additional studies of DCA in animals with cancer , with the intention of conducting clinical trials in lymphoma patients within three years .
Environmental groups have urged the Federal Government to confirm reports it plans to send the commercial ship Oceanic Viking to monitor the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean .
But they have warned against arming the ice - class vessel , saying such a move could further inflame an already delicate diplomatic situation .
The Herald reported today that the Government was considering leasing the P&O ship , Oceanic Viking , to gather photographic and video evidence of illegal whaling that could be used in any international court action against Japanese whaling .
Mathematicians from the University of Exeter have solved the mystery of traffic jams by developing a model to show how major delays occur on our roads , with no apparent cause .
Many traffic jams leave drivers baffled as they finally reach the end of a tail - back to find no visible cause for their delay .
Now , a team of mathematicians from the Universities of Exeter , Bristol and Budapest , have found the answer and published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society .
The team developed a mathematical model to show the impact of unexpected events such as a lorry ( tractor trailer ) pulling out of its lane on a dual carriageway ( divided highway with median between traffic going in opposite directions ) .
Their model revealed that slowing down below a critical speed when reacting to such an event , a driver would force the car behind to slow down further and the next car back to reduce its speed further still .
The result of this is that several miles back , cars would finally grind to a halt , with drivers oblivious to the reason for their delay .
The model predicts that this is a very typical scenario on a busy highway ( above 15 vehicles per km ) .
The jam moves backwards through the traffic creating a so - called ' backward travelling wave ' , which drivers may encounter many miles upstream , several minutes after it was triggered .
Dr Gábor Orosz of the University of Exeter said : " As many of us prepare to travel long distances to see family and friends over Christmas , we 're likely to experience the frustration of getting stuck in a traffic jam that seems to have no cause .
Our model shows that overreaction of a single driver can have enormous impact on the rest of the traffic , leading to massive delays . "
Drivers and policy - makers have not previously known why jams like this occur , though many have put it down to the sheer volume of traffic .
While this clearly plays a part in this new theory , the main issue is around the smoothness of traffic flow .
According to the model , heavy traffic will not automatically lead to congestion but can be smooth - flowing .
This model takes into account the time - delay in drivers ' reactions , which lead to drivers braking more heavily than would have been necessary had they identified and reacted to a problem ahead a second earlier .
Dr Orosz continued : " When you tap your brake , the traffic may come to a full stand - still several miles behind you .
It really matters how hard you brake - a slight braking from a driver who has identified a problem early will allow the traffic flow to remain smooth .
Heavier braking , usually caused by a driver reacting late to a problem , can affect traffic flow for many miles . "
The research team now plans to develop a model for cars equipped with new electronic devices , which could cut down on over - braking as a result of slow reactions .
For my experiment , I took two slices of bacon and cut them in half .
Placing them on three paper towels on a dinner plate , I slipped it into a microwave oven .
I also placed three strips of bacon on a large frying pan .
Finally , I spread out four strips on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet ( for ease of clean up ) .
I ran the microwave on high for 3 minutes .
After three minutes , I checked to see if the bacon was done ( should be crispy ) .
In my case , it was .
If it 's not done , give it another 30 seconds and look again .
Repeat until crispy .
Nothing could be easier .
I placed the cold pan with bacon over a medium - low heat .
The heat should be high enough that it cooks the bacon , but low enough that you can cook the bacon for a long time without burning it .
If the bacon starts to look like it 's going to burn ( little bits of black start forming at the edges ) , turn down the heat .
Cooking the bacon over low heat will render the most amount of fat out of the bacon .
If the fat collects too much ( 1/4 in. depth ) , then spoon off the excess fat .
Since I was only cooking three strips , there was n't much danger of this .
Keep turning the bacon over to evenly cook both sides .
When the bacon reaches a deep brown color , it 's done .
Mine took about fifteen minutes .
After placing the baking sheet directly under the broiler , I turned it on .
Every couple minutes , I pulled out the rack and flipped the bacon over .
Unfortunately , it was very difficult to control the cooking of the bacon under the broiler .
As the bacon curled up , the fat started to scorch and burn .
After about eight minutes , I pulled it from the oven to prevent the rest of the pieces from burning .
Microwaved -
The bacon came out extremely crisp throughout both the fat and meat of the bacon .
It felt a bit thicker than I expected from a thin cut piece of bacon .
Examining the fat collected in the paper towels leads me to believe that very little fat was rendered out in comparison to the pan fry method .
The technique is simple and hands free , but a problem that I have is that the paper towel stuck to several of the pieces of bacon .
This may have been because I allowed the bacon to rest and drain on the same paper towel it was cooked on .
Another issue is the limited number of bacon strips you can cook in a microwave oven at one time ( but the time savings probably more than makes up for this ) .
Pan fried -
The bacon felt the thinnest and lightest of the three .
The bacon fat was crispy while the meat was slightly chewy .
I actually prefer my bacon this way ( not totally crunchy and crispy , but with some texture to it ) , but others may not .
All in all , a good method to cook bacon but time consuming .
Broiled -
The bacon was burnt in some spots and the meat felt undercooked .
The areas need the burns were bitter in taste and the texture was soft and soggy throughout ( except for the blackened parts ) .
Not much fat was rendered off either .
I would not recommend this technique .
So , microwaving is king if you 're looking for bacon that feels thicker than what you purchased and crunchy throughout .
Pan frying is great for a thin , light bacon with a little chew in the meat .
In the future I will test other methods of cooking bacon including baking on a rack ( a favorite for many ) .
For now I need to recover from eating nine slices of bacon in an evening .
( See Cooking Tests : Bacon ( Part II ) for more ways to cook bacon . )
An aside : Earlier in this article , I cooked the bacon directly on some paper towels .
There might be some possible health concerns when doing this .
There was once a popular internet chain mail scam / hoax claiming that microwaving Saran Wrap ( or other plastic wraps ) will release a chemical contaminant called dioxin into the food you are cooking .
This was not true if you are using plastic or plastic wrap products labelled microwave safe ( in the United States ) as these do not contain any dioxins .
A supporting e-mail later went on to encourage the use of paper towels instead for microwaving .
As part of the backlash against this e-mail hoax , it was put forth that using paper towels might contribute more dioxins into your diet because the bleach used to produce paper towels contains chlorine and chlorine and wood form dioxins .
There are plenty of websites that claim that dioxins are formed during the production of the paper towel or that microwaving creates dioxins , but I have n't found one that does n't make a scientific error in their claim or discussion of the process .
To my knowledge , dioxin is produced during combustion , which is not a part of the paper towel making process .
The conclusion ?
I do n't know .
The Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) just says to use products marked microwave - safe .
Let me start off by reminding everyone what G.W. Bush has told the American public .
Let me make very clear the position of my government and our country .
We do not condone torture .
I have never ordered torture .
I will never
order torture .
The values of this country are such that torture is not a
part of our soul and our being .
— President George W. Bush
June 22 , 20041
Will the knowledge that both Bush and Rumfeld were personally involved change the way Conservatives feel or will it just make them more proud of Bush ?
I suspect the later .
It 's important to understand this book is based on the facts , facts gathered from thousands of government documents .
These are not just the word of some fanatic trying to spin or get away with something .
Drawing almost exclusively from the documents , the authors say there is a stark contrast between the public statements of President Bush and then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the policies those and others in the administration were advocating behind the scenes .
President Bush gave " marching orders " to Gen.
Michael Dunlavey , who asked the Pentagon to approve harsher interrogation methods at Guantanamo , the general claims in documents reported in the book .
The only thing I find even more disgusting than the fact that torture and deaths has been carried out in our names is the Rumfeld personally may have watched it happen .
As sick as I think that man is , he probably enjoyed it as a voyeur .
The authors of the book go on to make a point I have been trying to push for a while now .
That point is if we do n't punish those responsible , that this will happen again .
The ACLU also found that an Army investigator reported Rumsfeld was " personally involved " in overseeing the interrogation of a Guantanamo prisoner Mohammed al Qahtani .
The prisoner was forced to parade naked in front of female interrogators wearing women 's underwear on his head and was led around on a leash while being forced to perform dog tricks .

Did you know that " Absence of Income Tax is Key to State Competitiveness " ?
Well , so it is according to the headline of Cato's Daniel Mitchell writing up a report from the anti-tax Tax Foundation 's report on which states are best for business .
Of course , according to this metric the best places to do business in the United States are . . .
Wyoming and South Dakota .
Bringing up the rear , by contrast , are prosperous states full of successful businesses -- California , New York , New Jersey , and Delaware .

Q From Rhona
Dunphy : I came across the expression
The elephant in the room in the Guardian and wondered if you could shed any more light on where the phrase comes from .
A The expression is American in origin , though it has become extremely common in the UK since 2004 .
In the article you mention , Marcel Berlins called it “ the phrase I most hate in the whole world ” , because it has become such a cliché .
Before 2004 it only turned up in text written in or referring to the US .
The American phrase is usually the elephant in the living room but British writers have shortened it slightly by leaving out the penultimate word .
It refers to some a problem or controversial issue that ’s obviously present but which everyone ignores or avoids mentioning , usually because it ’s politically or socially embarrassing .
Marcel Berlins commented that he had traced the expression to a 1989 BBC television film whose director had said he had taken it from the Belfast writer Bernard MacLaverty .
The latter had described the situation in Northern Ireland as like “ having an elephant in your living room ” , though with the sense of something difficult in your life that you got accustomed to and tried your best to ignore , as people in Northern Ireland did with the Troubles .
Marcel Berlins said that MacLaverty had used the idea in a children ’s story of 1978 , A Man in Search of a Pet .
The Oxford English Dictionary added an entry for the expression to its online service in June 2006 .
It does n’t mention MacLaverty and instead argues it ’s originally American .
The first example it has in our current sense is the title of a well - known American book of 1984 by Marion H Typpo and Jill M Hastings , An Elephant in the Living Room : a leader ’s guide for helping children of alcoholics .
There are earlier examples .
A piece in the Winnipeg Free Press in October 1976 said , “ What is big and unfamiliar is mistrusted .
Anyone would feel uncomfortable with an elephant in the living room , no matter how friendly it might be . ”
The OED ’s entry also notes an example from the New York Times of June 1959 : “ Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room .
It ’s so big you just ca n’t ignore it . ”
Neither of these are in our current sense but are obviously its precursors .
The idea seems to have been around for quite some time before it became common or took on its modern sense , most probably being reinvented from time to time by writers seeking a vigorous image .
Bernard MacLaverty ’s claim to priority is looking rather shaky , since the expression was known in the US before he wrote his book .
Comparing the vast , electrified skyline of a modern city with the stark simplicity suggested by an ancient ruin , it ’s easy to see that man has changed his environment a great deal over the past millennia .
But has man ’s nature changed along with his environment ?
Not really .
Take the institution of dice gambling , for instance .
We know that prehistoric man used dice much like ours , played dice games similar to our own , and to seal the argument , cheated his opponents with loaded dice .
The card catalogue of any large library will illustrate the age - old controversy over dice gambling .
Almost as soon as man had developed the printing press , he began to publish treatises for or against the innocuous little cubes , mostly against .
The flavor of those early works , is suggested by one 16th century treatise published in England and entitled “ A Manifest Detection of the Most Vyle and Detestable Use of Dice Play . ”
A bit heavy handed , perhaps , but you get the idea .
Dice are the oldest gaming implements known to man .
Before dice became gaming pieces , numbered cubes were used as magical devices for divining the future .
The next time you ’re searching for a word to stump a self proclaimed vocabulary know it all , try “ astragalomancy ” , that ’s the practice of divination by means of dice .
Primitive man probably used cubical knucklebones or the ankle bones of sheep for his gaming pieces .
The Arabic word for knucklebone , is in fact , the same for dice .
Even today , experienced elbow shakers often call dice “ bones ” or “ devil ’s bones ” .
Archaeologists have shown that dice predate the written word , and can be found in almost every culture in the world , including the American Indian , Eskimo , and African .
Excavations in Egypt have turned up stone dice dating from 2,000 BC that look remarkably similar to the modern thing .
For his dice ancient man used , among other things , plum and peach pits , stones , seeds , bones , horn , pottery , pebbles , shells , and beaver teeth .
The Greeks and Romans were heavy gamers , favoring dice of bone or ivory and occasionally of semi-precious stone .
Even Plato was not one to take the art lightly , writing that “ nobody can become a skilled dice player if he has not devoted himself to it from his childhood , but only plays for pleasure . ”
The Bible mentions that Roman soldiers cast lots for Christ ’s robe after crucifixion .
The Emperor Claudius went so far as to publish a book on dice games .
And Julius Caesar , at the Rubicon , uttered the famous words , “ Jacta alea est ” – “ the die is cast ” .
To mark the spots or “ pips ” of his dice , early man either bored holes in the cubes or carved circular marks on the faces .
He was also quite adept at loading dice .
The earliest records of man mention both dice and crooked dice .
Dice especially made for cheating have been found in the tombs of Egypt , of Asia , and of the Americas .
Modern man has improved both the manufacture of dice and the methods of loading them .
Today ’s galloping ivories are usually made of cellulose or plastic .
There are basically 2 varieties , “ casino ” dice and “ drugstore ” dice .
Casino dice are handmade , sawed from plastic rods , and perfectly cubical to within one five - thousandth of an inch .
Casino dice three - quarters of an inch on a side are most often used for casino games of craps .
The drugstore die is smaller , machine made , and seldom as perfectly cubical as the casino die .
“ Peewee ” dice are only a quarter - inch wide on a side .
At various times , dice have been fashioned in the shape of a pyramid , pentagon , and octagon .
In the manufacture of casino dice , each spot is drilled precisely 17 thousandth of an inch into the face , them filled with paint weighing exactly the same as the plastic removed for the hole .
Thus , the die remains balanced on all sides .
So much for honest dice .
Though the ages , man has devised a number of ways to improve his odds at “ indoor golf ” .
The most familiar way is “ loading ” the dice , a weight of some kind is placed inside the die against one face , thereby assuring that the opposite face will come up more often than one might mathematically expect .
There are some more subtle methods , however .
“ Shapes ” are dice with one slightly sawed - off edge .
The longer faces are more likely to come up than the shortened faces , imagine rolling a brick and trying to leave one of the narrow sides up .
“ Tops ” or “ bottoms ” are dice with incorrectly numbered faces .
Instead of the numbers one through six , a “ tops ” die might show the numbers 3 , 4 , and 5 , each repeated on two faces .
When used in conjunction with a die reading 1 , 5 , and 6 , the pair cannot produce a seven .
You ’re not likely to be fooled by such a crass trick , you say ?
Keep in mind only 3 faces of the die are visible to you at any one time .
A good dice cheat can slip his “ tops ” by sleight of hand and withdraw them from play before you can say “ Rip off ” .
A good dice cheat can bilk you even with honest dice .
There are ways to “ spin ” the dice to improve the chances of certain combinations .
Your best bet is to immediately suspect anyone who suggests a game of craps and just happens to have his own ivories on hand .
That brings us to the subject of craps .
The game is American in origin , a variant of an old European game known as “ hazard ” that was popular in London in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
In fact , the 1 - 1 and 1 - 2 combinations in hazard have been known as “ crabs ” since the sixteenth century .
According to some accounts , the origin of craps can be traced to Bernard de Mandeville , a Frenchman who brought the game of hazard to New Orleans in 1813 .
Since the nickname for Creoles was Johnny Crapauds , the game became known as the Crapaud ’s game , and later , simply craps .
Mandeville , himself , lost a fortune at the game , and was forced to sell his New Orleans property to pay his debts .
A Street cut though his land was called Craps Street .
It later changed to Burgundy Street .
Black Americans around New Orleans are often credited with developing the game of craps as it is played today .
They also left us with a wealth of dice slang .
There ’s hardly any need to tell you what “ Mississippi marbles ” or “ Memphis dominos ” are .
Or “ snake eyes ” , or “ boxcars ” .
How about “ Little Joe from Kokomo ” ?
Fours , my friend .
And let ’s not forget that worn out exhortation , “ Come on mama , baby needs a new pair of shoes ” !
A New York dicemaker by the name of John H. Winn , that ’s right , Winn , has been called the first craps banker in history , and is credited with the invention of open craps , that variety of elbow athletics you ’re most likely to find in an alley or pool hall .
Craps was spread by American soldiers during the 2 World Wars .
Today , a variant known as “ bank craps ” is played in casinos throughout the world .
Most experienced casino gamblers consider bank craps the casino game which offers the player the greatest chance to walk away a winner .
Some also nominate craps as the most exciting of all casino games .
It ’s certainly the most colorful to watch .
Early in the 19th century , many American drugstores and soda fountains offered counter dice games to their patrons .
Counter games are still legal in some parts of the country .
Some of the descriptively names games still enjoyed by the Americans include Drop Dead , Pig , Heaven and Nine , and Hooligan .
When you think of it , craps is n’t bad either !
Today , backgammon is rapidly becoming one of the most popular board games in America .
The fact is , backgammon is much older than craps , ranking as the oldest dice game still widely played .
The ancient Romans played a variety of backgammon .
And as far as the name , etymologists trace it either to the Saxon expression “ bac gamen ” , which means “ back game ” , or the Welsh back gamon , “ little battle ” .
There are literally thousands of other games that employ the timeless cubes , Despite the use of cards and spinners , dice remain , quite simply , the best way of introducing the element of chance into any game , no matter how complex .
As Mallarme suggested in the title of one of his most famous poems , “ A Throw of the Dice Never Will Abolish Chance ” .
In some things then , there is simply no room or need for improvement .
Long before we had perfected the way we would build or find a home , our food , our weapons , our clothes or our social power , we just about perfected the way we would gamble .
for suspicion of driving under the influence on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu -- driving 87 miles an hour .
As we reported , the deputy who arrested Gibson was ordered to sanitize his arrest report to make it appear that Gibson 's arrest was " without incident . "
In fact , The report states Gibson was abusive , violent and vulgar , and even attempted to escape .
As TMZ first reported , Gibson was arrested on Friday for suspicion of driving under the influence on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu -- driving 87 miles an hour .
As we reported , the deputy who arrested Gibson was ordered to sanitize his arrest report to make it appear that Gibson 's arrest was " without incident . "
In fact , The report states Gibson was abusive , violent and vulgar , and even attempted to escape .
TMZ has confirmed that approximately three years ago , Gibson was driving 74 miles per hour on Pacific Coast Highway , one mile from his house , when he was pulled over by a Los Angeles County Sheriff 's deputy .
Sources say Gibson avoided eye contact with the deputy during the stop and even though the deputy was suspicious of Gibson 's sobriety , he let him go .
TMZ has learned that Mel Gibson has been stopped for reckless driving two other times in Malibu but he was allowed to leave without a ticket or arrest .
Approximately one year ago Gibson was stopped again , after driving 64 miles an hour on Pacific Coast Highway -- where the speed limit is 45 .
Sources say that Gibson was so cocky that he was on his cell phone the entire time he was detained by the deputy .
Ultimately , the deputy decided to let him go without giving him a citation .
And there 's new information about Friday 's arrest .
As TMZ reported , the deputy who arrested Gibson was ordered by superiors to re-write his report and eliminate all references to Gibson 's bad conduct and anti-Semitic remarks .
Sources tell TMZ that Lt. Crystal Miranda told the arresting deputy that Captain Tom Martin talked to Sheriff Lee Baca who expressed concern that the explosive report might leak to the media and that it needed to be re-written in a sanitized form .
Sources say Gibson , who was pulled over early Friday morning for allegedly crossing lanes at a high speed , told the arresting deputy that he was leaving home just after 2 a.m. and heading to his brother 's house .
The arresting deputy found a bottle of tequila in the car , 3 / 4 full , in a brown paper bag .
We 're told that Gibson told the deputy that the bottle was n't his but , " I 've had a little bit . "
We 're also told that Gibson , who issued a statement over the weekend , suggesting he was not of sound mind when he uttered the anti-Semitic tirade and engaged in abusive behavior , was not in fact " out of it . "
Sources connected with the case tell TMZ that Gibson was drunk but was in control of his senses .
At one point at the Sheriff 's station , sources say Gibson was " jumping like a monkey " on a steel cage and told the arresting deputy , " I 'm not going to hurt you physically .
I 'm gonna hurt you .
I 'm gonna make you lose . "
We 're also told that deputies at the Sheriff 's station were star struck by Gibson and a number of them went to Gibson 's holding cell to get a look of the star .
The problem for the Sheriff 's department -- there 's a mounted camera in the station and the deputies can be seen fawning over the actor .
Sheriff 's officials have called some of the officers who were caught on tape in and warned them they might be subject to discipline .
As TMZ reported , the arresting deputy was ordered by officials to take out references to Gibson 's bad behavior .
We 're told the altered report makes no mention of the fact that Gibson attempted to flee the scene by running to his car to escape .
We 're also told that the officer checked a box on the report that Gibson was " belligerent . "
Ironically , even though officials did not order the deputy to remove that reference , they did order him to re-write the report to eliminate all references to the supporting evidence leading the officer to believe Gibson was indeed " belligerent . "
When it comes to their social behavior , people sometimes act like monkeys , or more specifically , like rhesus macaques , a type of monkey that shares with humans strong tendencies for nepotism and political maneuvering , according to research by Dario Maestripieri , an expert on primate behavior and an Associate Professor in Comparative Human Development and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago .
“ After humans , rhesus macaques are one of the most successful primate species on our planet ; our Machiavellian intelligence may be one of the reasons for our success ” wrote Maestripieri in his new book Macachiavellian Intelligence : How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World .
Maestripieri has been studying monkeys for more than 20 years and has written extensively on their behavior .
He has studied them in Europe , at a research center in Atlanta , and on an island in Puerto Rico , where researchers established a rhesus macaque colony for scientific and breeding purposes .
Rhesus macaques live in complex societies with strong dominance hierarchies and long - lasting social bonds between female relatives .
Individuals constantly compete for high social status and the power that comes with it using ruthless aggression , nepotism , and complex political alliances .
Sex , too , can be used for political purposes .
The tactics used by monkeys to increase or maintain their power are not much different from those Machiavelli suggested political leaders use during the Renaissance .
Alpha males , who rule the 50 or so macaques in the troop , use threats and violence to hold on to the safest sleeping places , the best food , and access to the females in the group with whom they want to have sex .
Like human dictators intent on holding power , dominant monkeys use frequent and unpredictable aggression as an effective form of intimidation .
Less powerful members of the rhesus macaque group are marginalized and forced to live on the edges of the group ’s area , where they are vulnerable to predator attacks .
They must wait for the others to eat first and then have the leftovers ; they have sex only when the dominant monkeys are not looking .
“ In rhesus society , dominants always travel in business class and subordinates in economy , and if the flight is overbooked , it ’s the subordinates who get bumped off the plane , ” Maestripieri said .
“ Social status can make the difference between life and death in human societies too , ” he pointed out .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , for instance , the poorer members of the community accounted for most of the hurricane ’s death toll .
Male macaques form alliances with more powerful individuals , and take part in scapegoating on the lower end of the hierarchy , a Machiavellian strategy that a mid-ranking monkey can use when under attack from a higher - ranking one .
Altruism is rare and , in most cases , only a form of nepotistic behavior .
Mothers help their daughters achieve a status similar to their own and to maintain it throughout their lives .
Females act in Machiavellian ways also when it comes to reproduction .
They make sure they have lots of sex with the alpha male to increase the chances he will protect their newborn infant from other monkeys 6 months later .
“ But while they have lots of sex with the alpha male and make him think he ’s going to be the father of their baby , the females also have sex with all the other males in the group behind the alpha male ’s back , ” Maestripieri said .
They do so just in case the alpha male is sterile or he dies or loses his power before the baby is born .
Struggles for power within a group sometimes culminate in a revolution , in which all members of the most dominant family are suddenly attacked by entire families of subordinates .
These revolutions result in drastic changes in the structure of power within rhesus societies , not unlike those occurring following human revolutions .
There is one situation , however , in which all of the well - established social structure evaporates : when a group of rhesus macaques confronts another one and monkey warfare begins .
Rhesus macaques dislike strangers and will viciously attack their own image in a mirror , thinking it ’s a stranger threatening them .
When warfare begins , “ Even a low - ranking rhesus loner becomes an instant patriot .
Every drop of xenophobia in rhesus blood is transformed into fuel for battle , ” Maestripieri wrote .
“ What rhesus macaques and humans may have in common is that many of their psychological and behavioral dispositions have been shaped by intense competition between individuals and groups during the evolutionary history of these species ” Maestripieri said .
Rhesus groups can function like armies , and this may explain why these monkeys have been so successful in the competition with other primates .
Pressure to find Machiavellian solutions to social problems may also have led to the evolution of larger human brains .
“ Our Machiavellian intelligence is not something we can be proud of , but it may be the secret of our success .
If it contributed to the evolution of our large brains and complex cognitive skills , it also contributed to the evolution of our ability to engage in noble spiritual and intellectual activities , including our love and compassion for other people ” , Maestripieri said .

So , the Vice President exempted himself from an executive order on the handling of classified materials .
To rationalize the decision , Dick Cheney and the White House want people to believe that the Vice President is not part of the executive branch of government .
No one , anywhere , is buying it .
Yesterday , Cheney ’s lawyers rolled out Absurd Rationalization # 2 .
Vice President Cheney ’s office offered its first public written explanation yesterday for its refusal to comply with an executive order regulating the handling of classified material , arguing that the order makes clear that the vice president is not subject to the oversight system it creates for federal agencies .
In a letter to Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , Cheney Chief of Staff David S. Addington wrote that the order treats the vice president the same as the president and distinguishes them both from “ agencies ” subject to the oversight provisions of the executive order .
Addington did not cite specific language in the executive order supporting this view , and a Cheney spokeswoman could not point to such language last night .
This need not be complicated .
Sec. 6.1 ( b ) of the executive order explicitly states that it applies to any “ ‘ Executive agency …any ‘ Military department ’ … and any other entity within the executive branch that comes into the possession of classified information . ”
To exempt Cheney , the White House to argue that he a ) does n’t have access to classified information ; or b ) is not an entity within the executive branch .
Those are the only two options .
Yesterday , Addington tried to create a new option , insisting that the E.O. had a provision that does n’t exist .
Maybe it was written in disappearing ink ?
Maybe you need special 3 - D glasses to read these hidden provisions ?
Please .

The whale 's back and fin were out of water and exposed to the sun
Whale with swimmers A 5.5 m long minke whale has been spotted more than 1600 km ( 994 miles ) from the Atlantic Ocean , deep inside the Amazon rain forest .
The whale ran aground earlier this week but after being freed with the help of vets and biologists it disappeared shortly afterwards .
It is the second time this week in Brazil that a lost animal has been spotted in an unexpected location .
The minke whale ran aground on a sandbar deep inside the Amazon .
Local people had been splashing water on the whale 's back and fin while it was exposed to the hot Amazon sun .
The whale is said to weigh about 12 tons .
Reports of a mysterious animal in the area had been causing alarm among locals near to the Tapajos river , a tributary of the Amazon .
Experts say the animal could have been in the area for a couple of months .
After the whale was freed , helicopters and boats were involved in a search of the area but nothing was found .
A biologist said it was thought the animal became separated from its group and swam upstream , until it ran aground near Santarem in Para state .
While it is not unprecedented , it is unusual for whales to venture so far into fresh water .
Beach alligator
The whale is not the only animal to get lost in Brazil this week .
On Thursday a young reptile - which was 1.5 m long - turned up at a popular beach in Rio de Janeiro and had to be rescued by firemen .
They had been searching for the alligator for some time and had closed Barra beach , but despite this some swimmers insisted on entering the water .
The caiman , or yellow stomach alligator as it is known in Brazil , was taken to a local zoo for treatment for a broken leg .
This endangered species is normally found in freshwater swamps and marshes , and the fire service in Rio said it was the first time they had rescued one from the sea .

What are these ?
1 Marcus :
What a fine day for a walk around the central administrative district of Rome .
1 Julius : Agreed !
2 Marcus : {spotting a poster stuck to a column}
What 's this ?
Some sort of public announcement ?
2 Julius :
What does it say ?
3 Marcus [ reading ] : " OMFG teh carthage r teh suxx0 r !!1!1 ! " 4 Marcus : Such immaturity !
4 Julius :
Well , what do you expect from a Forum poster ?
teh carthage was a city state based in Northern Africa and the greatest thorn in the side of the Roman Republic , fighting several wars against them .
The Romans eventually conquered Carthage and incoporated its territory into their own .
Of course , this implies this theme is set in Republican Rome , not Imperial Rome , contrary to indications in previous strips , but we 've already established that anachronism is the least of our worries .
The Roman Forum was the administrative , commercial , and religious centre of ancient Rome .
As the centre of the greatest empire of the day , it was a stronghold of collected wisdom , intelligent discussion , and skilled rhetoric by the greatest masters of language and thought .
An Internet forum has none of these features .
I visited the Roman Forum ( what is left of it ) in 2001 :
And again in 2012 ( almost exactly 11 years to the day later ) :
If you travel to Rome , I heartily recommend it .
It 's easy to get to , being - oddly enough - in the very centre of Rome .
Not only can you experience the amazing history of the ancient Roman civilisation , but you can see where this comic was filmed !

Presidential power is spiraling out of control , making George W. Bush the most powerful American leader since at least WWII , according to a new analysis .
But the current president , now entangled in a controversy over his recent decision to assert Executive Privilege , ca n’t take full credit for the power grab , the researchers argue .
A number of factors have converged over the past 60 years to turn the American presidency into a position of incredible influence that has a negative effect on American politics and which wo n't change just because someone else takes charge of the White House .
In their new book " Presidential Power : Unchecked and Unbalanced " ( W. W. Norton , 2007 ) , Johns Hopkins University political scientists Benjamin Ginsberg and Matthew Crenson trace the history of the presidency since the middle of last century , uncovering a series of murder mystery - like motives , means and opportunities that have shaped the executive branch into the most powerful institution on the globe .
Ginsberg and Crenson are not the only researchers to spot the radical change .
“ The presidency has grown in size and in power throughout the 20th century , ” agreed Christopher S. Kelley , a political scientist at Miami University in Ohio .
Power grab
In a telephone interview last week , Crenson explained how American politicians today are driven by different desires than they were in the past .
“ We have these people with enormously grandiose ambitions , who do n’t just want to be president — they want to change history , ” Crenson said .
Politicians used to be propelled into the presidency by their parties ; now they are self - propelled , he said .
This change was accompanied by a general decline in public political participation , said the authors .
People ’s dwindling interest in politics — and in congressional activities in particular — has allowed presidents to capitalize on unique opportunities .
“ When popular participation diminishes , congressional influence goes down , and one of the obstacles for presidential power is significantly reduced , ” Crenson said .
“ You can see over the course of the 20th century , presidents have either grabbed or invented one instrument of power after another . ”
For instance , when Warren G. Harding set up the Bureau of the Budget in 1921 , he essentially created a mechanism by which the executive branch could oversee the activities of federal agencies , Crenson explained .
And when the public looked to the president for help during the Great Depression , Congress gave Franklin D. Roosevelt the resources to establish the Executive Office of the President , an entity that houses the powerful National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget , said Kelley , the Miami University researcher .
Watergate effect
According to Kelley , however , by far the biggest instigator last century was Watergate .
After the scandal , Congress reacted by constraining presidential power , all the while still expecting the president to lead .
“ If any president wanted to be successful , and to bequeath an office stronger than he found it , he would need to develop unique arguments , theories , devices , etcetera , that would enable success , ” Kelley told LiveScience .
“ Hence presidential unilateralism [ and ] working through the executive branch agencies to accomplish what he could n't with the Congress . ”
Watergate also prompted the Supreme Court to first recognize the power of Executive Privilege , which allows the executive branch to resist certain legislative and judicial interventions .
President Bush asserted the privilege last week to keep the White House and several of his former aides from supplying subpoenaed documents to Congress in an investigation related to the replacement of federal prosecutors .
Some speculate that Bush will also evoke the privilege to keep his former aides from testifying and to prevent the White House , Vice President Cheney ’s office , and the Justice Department from complying with a separate set of subpoenas related to the administration ’s eavesdropping program .
Reigning it in
While many might think the relatively unchecked power in today 's White House is largely due to how President Bush operates , the authors , who support different political parties , see the shift as more of an institutional — and constitutional — issue .
“ People need to realize that this is not a problem that ’s going to be solved by electing somebody other than George W. Bush , ” Crenson said .
“ This is a serious constitutional problem — constitutional in both senses of the word — that is going to take some very careful thought to remedy . ”
The best way to for the public to change the balance of power is to support Congress in its efforts to make substantive policy , Crenson said .
Since the legislature has two parties , compared to the president ’s one , it is likely to make better decisions , he contends .
Kelley agrees .
The public needs “ to insist that Congress vigorously defends its own prerogatives and holds the executive branch accountable , ” he said .
“ This means that Congress holds oversight hearings , that Congress demands information , and that Congress does n't delegate . ”
In order for this to happen , however , congressional goals need bipartisan support , Kelley said .
This is quite difficult today , given that members are often condemned for “ reaching across the aisle . ”
“ The single - minded focus on the next election and to win for the Party at all cost will continue to give the executive branch the advantage , ” Kelley said .
NEW YORK ( December 5 , 2007 , 2007 ) -
In the wake of a study that documented for the first time the use of weaponry by Cross River gorillas to ward off threats by humans , the Wildlife Conservation Society announced today new field surveys to better protect this most endangered great ape .
The study , published earlier this year in the Journal of Primatology , found several instances of gorillas throwing sticks and clumps of grass when threatened by people .
Gorillas usually flee and rarely charge when encountered by humans .
Cross River gorillas are restricted to Nigeria and Cameroon .
They number only around 300 individuals , making them the most endangered of the four gorilla sub-species .
The Wildlife Conservation Society , which has studied Cross River gorillas since 1999 , will begin new field surveys next month in an attempt to catalogue all potential gorilla habitat .
The surveys are being funded in part by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
Earlier this year , the Wildlife Conservation Society released an action plan to safeguard Cross River gorillas that included creating additional protected areas and raising awareness of this little known great ape .
The observations of weapon - use took place in the proposed Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary in Cameroon - one of the new protected areas recommended in the report .
In 2005 the Wildlife Conservation Society documented the first case of tool use among gorillas when researchers discovered individuals using sticks to check the depth of streams before crossing them .

The Wildlife Conservation Society saves wildlife and wild lands through science , international conservation , education and management of the world 's largest system of urban parks , led by the flagship Bronx Zoo .
With hundreds of scientists at work in over 60 countries , it is a leader in the race to save the last of the wild .

Weakness in sub-prime loans have destabilised the financial sector
Up to $ 110 bn ( £ 54 bn ) in loans will be made available to world money markets by central banks including the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve .
There should be more focus on such co-operation , Mr Brown told a UK paper .
Analysts question if the unprecedented move will restore confidence and stave off recession .
Auctions
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England will team up with the European Central Bank and central banks from Canada and Switzerland to offer the cash loans , to be made available in auctions .
Such a co-operative act is a first , says BBC business editor Robert Peston .
The core problem is we still do n't know ... exactly how bad the problem is that kicked this whole thing off , the sub - prime crisis
Merryn Somerset Webb , editor , Money Week
Rock suitor threatens ultimatum
The actions are on a greater scale than the moves taken by the Fed to shore up the economy after the 9/11 attacks on the US , indicating the severity of the current situation and how seriously central banks are taking it , analysts say .
Mr Brown , due in Lisbon for the signing of the new European reform treaty , told the Times newspaper the moves were " the co-operative effort I 've wanted to see for some time " .
He added : " It signals an international desire to act in what has been a period of global financial turbulence . "
Scepticism
Analysts have welcomed the move , but question how far it will go to resolve the crisis in the financial sector , which has its roots in the US sub - prime loan market .
Banks who lent money to high - risk borrowers in the US have been hit hard in recent months as these borrowers , often with poor credit histories , struggled to meet their payments .
Given that much of this debt had been repackaged and re-sold to investors around the world , the impact of the US mortgage defaults has been global .
A string of banks have registered losses because of their exposure to investment products linked to sub - prime mortgages , with total declared losses linked to sub - prime debt about $ 60bn .
The declared losses and the suspicion of further losses lurking on banks ' balance sheets have made banks reluctant to lend to each other .
By acting together to pump extra funds into the system in the form of loans , the central banks hope to ease the crisis of liquidity .
Some banks are worried about the stigma attached to such auctions
Crucially , the central banks ' move has removed the stigma attached to asking them for loans , said BBC business editor Robert Peston .
" Having seen the run on Northern Rock , they were terrified of being tarnished in the same way , " he said on Radio 4 's Today programme .
But given that it is still not clear how badly banks ' balance sheets have been hit by the sub - prime crisis , it is not clear how much Wednesday 's announcement will help , some said .
" The core problem is we still do n't know ... exactly how bad the problem is that kicked this whole thing off , the sub - prime crisis , " Merryn Somerset Webb , editor of Money Week , said on the Today programme .
Lower rates
In the past week , the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have cut interest rates , but this has yet to feed into money market rates , our business editor says .
It is not yet clear whether the central banks ' new plan will result in lower money market rates .
But if the plan fails , the chances of restoring economic confidence are slim .
While share prices in the US rose sharply after the plan was announced , they have since weakened .
Fears remain that the crisis will result in a recession in the US and elsewhere .
" I think a serious recession is unlikely , a slower world economy is likely .... a recession , no , " Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research told the Today programme .
Having failed to win a response with an 18 - page letter to President George Bush or to a request to visit the site of the September 11 2001 attack on New York , Ahmadinejad has offered himself as an observer in next year 's presidential election .
The proposal came in a speech to volunteers with the Basij , a pro-regime militia .
He said he was prompted by a belief that Americans would vote against the current administration in a truly free poll .
However , the terms of Ahmadinejad 's offer appeared to betray some confusion about the potential candidates .
" If the White House officials allow us to be present as an observer in their presidential election we will see whether people in their country are going to vote for them again or not , " he said .
The US constitution prevents Bush from seeking a third consecutive term , while no member of his administration is expected to be in the running in next November 's poll .
Bush and international human rights groups voiced doubts about the legitimacy of Iran 's 2005 presidential election , which brought Ahmadinejad to power .
More than 1,000 potential candidates were disqualified by the guardian council , a powerful body of clerics and judges .
Some domestic critics pointed out yesterday that Ahmadinejad 's idea clashed with his government 's opposition to allowing independent observers at Iranian elections .
The interior ministry , controlled by one of the president 's most hard - line allies , has rejected pressure for party representatives to be allowed to oversee proceedings at polling stations for next March 's parliamentary poll .
The election is expected to provide a major test of Ahmadinejad 's popularity .
Leading regime figures , including two former presidents , Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , have warned against possible attempts to rig it through mass candidate disqualifications and other measures .
Colonies of tens of billions of microorganisms create their own artwork as they adapt to stresses in a petri dish .
Scientists add the colors and shading .
Professor Eshel Ben-Jacob of Tel - Aviv University and Professor Herbert Levine of UCSD 's National Science Foundation Frontier Center for Theoretical Biological Physics watched bacteria solve problems in the petri dish for years .
In doing so , they caught bacteria in the act of creating beautiful art .
" While the colors and shading are artistic additions , the image templates are actual colonies of tens of billions of these microorganisms , " according to the researchers .
" The colony structures form as adaptive responses to laboratory - imposed stresses that mimic hostile environments faced in nature .
They illustrate the coping strategies that bacteria have learned to employ , strategies that involve cooperation through communication .
These selfsame strategies are used by the bacteria in their struggle to defeat our best antibiotics ...
" In a sense , the strikingly beautiful organization of the pattern reflects the underlying social intelligence of the bacteria .
The once controversial idea that bacteria cooperate to solve challenges has become commonplace , with the discovery of specific channels of communication between the cells and specific mechanisms facilitating the exchange of genetic information .
Retrospectively , these capabilities should not have been seen as so surprising , as bacteria set the stage for all life on Earth and indeed invented most of the processes of biology . "
Although humans do create beautiful solutions to problems , its surprising how often imitating nature provides the best solution .
This approach is called biomimicry ; RoboSalmon , the soft - bodied Gummi-Bots , and the Squid - Type Underwater Inspector robot are all examples in which human beings imitated nature 's best solution .

Are you afraid that if you quit too many jobs or switch careers too often , your resume ( CV ) will make you look undesirable ?
And who ’s gonna hire you then ?
No one wants a loser who ca n’t stay put .
You ’re probably right to be concerned … assuming your primary career goal is to work for a company that wants to own you rather than simply pay you to do some work for them .
The funny thing is that many people who have extremely successful careers seem to completely ignore this advice , building the kind of resumes that would disgust any reasonable HR person .
For example , whose resume looks like this ?
cab driver
landscaper
vitamin distributor
glass - blowing lathe operator
travel agent
gas station manager
U - Haul dealer
moped salesman
restaurant cook
business consultant
Answer : David Allen , author of the ever - popular productivity classic Getting Things Done .
Last I heard he was expecting to do about $ 6 million in sales this year ( source : CNN ) .
That ’s a lot of mopeds !
Yes yes , I know he ’s the exception .
Everyone who gets away with this kind of thing is the exception of course .
Damned cheaters !
We would n’t want to dent anyone ’s comfy little excuse for sticking with a job they do n’t like .
From the looks of his resume , it would appear that David Allen is a lifelong quitter .
Does n’t he realize what an amazing career he could have had as a cab driver ?
He could have become one of the best cab drivers in California .
He might be on his 4th or 5th cab by now .
And why did he have to give up on landscaping ?
Think of all the hedge mazes that will never exist because he quit .
Now that ’s a shame .
OK , so maybe he just was n’t cut out for cab driving or landscaping , but surely he could have gone far as a vitamin distributor .
Look at all the fabulous supplements we have today .
He could have made millions pushing pills .
He ’s gotta be upset about losing that job .
It was pure colloidal silver .
But nooooo… this guy could n’t hold a job to save his life .
Yet somehow Mr. David Allen is able to convince businesses to pay him $ 20,000 a day to teach them productivity skills — the same businesses whose HR departments would likely throw him out if he tried to apply for a regular job .
Hmmmm … kinda makes you wonder , does n’t it ?
Is it possible that quitting could actually increase your productivity ?
Perhaps the truth is that you can switch careers as much as you ’d like — and that those who ’d judge you harshly for it are probably just pissed that you ’re reminding them of how stuck they are .
Do they really have your best interest at heart … or are they trying to enlist your support in assuaging their own self - doubt and insecurity ?
Maybe it ’s not such a great idea to go out of your way to impress the HR person who ’s only looking for the most submissive loser they can find to fill a position that no one in their right mind would want to do for more than a couple weeks anyway .
If you up and quit on them , they ’ll just have to find another glass - blowing lathe operator who is n’t as smart as you .
Is n’t it amazing how social conditioning can teach you to place a high value on something that a free - thinking sane person would perceive as dreadfully undesirable ?
Maybe we should make the people that fall for that scheme pay more taxes too ; they probably wo n’t even notice .
Oh wait … we already do that .
If you ca n’t seem to hold a job , perhaps you ’re cursed with genius .
One of the biggest quitters of all was Leonardo da Vinci .
I wonder if his parents ever told him to stop flitting about — painting , engineering , sculpture , botany , anatomy , architecture , music , poetry , etc. — and just stick with one thing .
Otherwise , no one would hire him .
Imagine Leonardo ’s
Mom saying to him , “ For Christ sakes , Leo !
Last week you told me you were going to be an engineer … and now I catch you painting !
You march yourself back outside , young man , and go finish that Yard - a - pult monstrosity you started last week . ”
So dark the con of man .
Last Wednesday , I went to a Bay Area Functional Programmers talk to see Philip Wadler give a talk on his paper Well - typed Programs Can't be Blamed Wadler was a good speaker .
He was very friendly and interactive .
He insisted on having people ask lots of questions .
He called himself an " absent minded professor " .
Two things I did n't know about him were that he worked at Bell Labs and he also worked at Sun on Generic Java .
Having tried to cram technical papers into my head way too late at night , I was pleased to find out that he 's pretty easy to understand in person .
However , his slides were n't always bug free .
There were a couple of errors in the equations .
Apparently , academic papers can have bugs too ;) The goal of the paper was to to mix typed and untyped modules in the same program .
He admitted that untyped code lets you do fun and flexible things .
His goal was to " coerce " a dynamic function to a typed function dynamically .
This was done with a " contract " , which is like a type declaration for a function that get applied dynamically .
I mentioned to him that Python 3000 had type annotations , and that Guido had envisioned that someone would come along and do type assertions in very much the same way contracts work .
He admitted that people were using these techniques in the real world .
In fact , the new version of JavaScript will have optional types .
I forgot to bring up that Visual Basic had optional types years ago .
It 's interesting to note that several people in the audience were interested in using Python and Haskell together in the same program .
By the way , rather than calling Python an " untyped " language ( which is clearly an insult to its dynamic nature ) , he called it a " unityped " language , because , basically , everything is an object .
A core theme of the paper was " the blame game " : is it the function 's fault , or the callers fault ?
Apparently , this is a normal part of talking about function semantics , but I had never heard it referred to as that before .
He extended his system to cover dynamic type systems ( like Lisp ) , strict type systems ( like Haskell ) , and super type systems ( aka dependent type systems ) all in the same program .
A dependent type system lets you have types such as " int n where n > 15 " .
Consider the ramifications of this .
If you have two such numbers , and you subtract one from the other , you might end up with an int that does n't match that constraint .
Often , type constraints such as these must be enforced at runtime .
What you end up with is n't so different from design by contract .
One interesting point he made is that the stronger your type system is , the braver you can be in relying on it .
In a dynamic system , you might stick with simpler code because there 's no compiler to catch your mistakes before running the code .
This is an interesting counter - point to Bruce Eckel 's argument that declaring your types in Java is a waste of time that prevents you from doing more useful work like writing unit tests .
After all , you need to write unit tests anyway , since a type system can only catch a certain class of bugs .
Wadler admitted that even Haskell 's type inferencer was n't smart enough to figure out some of the things he wanted to do .
He said that he felt himself sometimes wishing he could just tell the compiler to fall back to checking his types at runtime .
Someone in the audience was able to state that Wadler 's conclusions applied equally well to languages that have assignment .
His response was " Oh , that 's too bad " ;)
Apparently , that was a quote from some other computer scientist who was told that his research applied equally well to languages with a goto statement ;) There was a point thirty minutes into the talk where some people started to get lost .
However , there were a few people that understood everything he said and wanted more .
I understood about 60 % of what he wrote and 75 % of what he said .
I think that says a lot about how good a speaker he was .
His talk was very proof oriented .
He thinks of himself as a mathematician .
He brought up the fact that lambda calculus is isomorphic to proof reduction : " Programming is n't so arbitrary " .
This flew in the face of some of the things I 've written , including Everything Your Professor Failed to Tell You About Functional Programming and Computer Science : What 's Wrong with CS Research
In thinking about interpreter design , I like to focus on what is useful , without regard to any similarities in the math world .
( By the way , I am a mathematician too . )
I have a feeling that computer science academics get too caught up in the math .
Nonetheless , clearly , applying mathematical constraints can often be useful , and I found Wadler 's point of view interesting .
Scala is a functional language , similar to Erlang , built for the JVM .
Someone asked Wadler if he had looked at Scala yet .
Clearly , Wadler has a functional bias ( " It 's what I prefer to work on . " ) , and one big difference I discovered between Haskell and Scala is that Scala lets you interact with stateful Java libraries .
After all , Java is very stateful .
I could see how that would be a big turnoff for Wadler .
Wadler 's response was that clearly there 's a need for state .
A database of some kind is needed to hold long term state .
He seemed happy with what Erlang had done with Mnesia .
However , he felt that state was a " high level concept " and that it 's better to keep low - level programming and concurrent programming stateless .
Agree or disagree , I definitely think Wadler 's an interesting guy , and I 'm glad I was able to go to his talk .
Paramount is circulating a new Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull poster and I ’ve got to say it certainly has captured the look and feel of the classic Indiana Jones posters of the past sort of a trademark style for the Lucasfilm posters including Star Wars )
If nothing else , the new poster at least answers the question “ Will there at least be a Crystal Skull in the movie ? ” .
I like it a lot .
This may sound a bit silly , but the best part of the poster to me is that they did n’t “ young - ify ” Harrison Ford in it .
He looks his age and I really like that .
One of the big appeals to me about this new Indiana Jones movie is seeing an aging Jones , and at least the poster is trying to pull a fast one .
So what do you think of this new Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull poster ?
Despite its robust appearance , more than 10 percent of the internet flickers out like a candle every day , according to researchers who unveiled on Wednesday an experimental tool that probes the network 's dark places .
Ethan Katz - Bassett , a computer science Ph.D. candidate from the University of Washington introduced Hubble – a network of deep cyberspace probes scattered around the internet –- at the meeting of the North American Network Operator 's Group in Bellevue , Washington .
For two weeks Hubble queried a sample of 1,500 internet prefixes ( a small subsection of the net ) every 15 minutes .
In the end it found that 10 percent of those prefixes could n't be reached from certain corners of the internet .
Sometimes certain blocks of the internet were n't reachable at all , Katz - Bassett reported , while other times only traffic coming from particular portions of the net fell into what 's called a " routing black hole . "
When that happens , packets sent from one computer to another – whether a request for a web page , or an e-mail message – are somehow diverted to the wrong location , where they 're lost forever .
Harsha V. Madhyastha , Katz - Bassett 's partner in the project , said their tentative results surprised them .
" We 've found a lot more reachability problems than we expected to see , with some prefixes being unreachable from several vantage points across multiple days , " Madhyastha told Wired News .
The researchers hope to build a tool that will chart these black holes in real time , by monitoring the dialogue that takes place between routers about the best path for particular traffic , and by building a permanent system of remote sensors that can send pings from various spots around the internet .
" A single unresponsive ping is likely to mean there are widespread problems , Katz - Bassett said .
The larger system , which Katz - Bassett plans to build over the summer , would treat an unanswered ping as a canary in a coal mine , instantly triggering multiple probes from around the net .
Routing problems can be caused by a number of factors , ranging from problems with a particular router , often a new one , to ironic problems with a technique called " multi- homing " -– which supposed to make it easier for packets to reach their destination by allowing an internet site to simultaneously have a number of different addresses and network connections .
About 75 percent of the problems are fixed within an hour , and some last multiple days , according to their research .
Madhyastha and Katz - Bassett plan to make the Hubble data searchable by other researchers .
Located in South Africa , this zip line is claimed to be the world ’s fastest , tallest , and steepest .

UPDATE : Sadly , this technique does not seem to work anymore .
If there are other solutions , please update the comment thread because others may find the information useful .
A few days back I found myself perusing the iTunes Music Store looking for a few songs that I had heard via Sirius * .
After completing the painless process of purchasing the songs , I immediately synced the tracks to my iPhone and went on my merry way .
Because I had spent very little none of my time following the DRM vs. DRM - free music download option being offered by Apple , I simply downloaded the $ 0.99 version (s ) .
DRM - free tracks from EMI will be offered at higher quality 256 kbps AAC encoding , resulting in audio quality indistinguishable from the original recording , for just $ 1.29 per song .
In addition , iTunes customers will be able to easily upgrade their entire library of all previously purchased EMI content to the higher quality DRM - free versions for just 30 cents a song .
iTunes will continue to offer its entire catalog , currently over five million songs , in the same versions as todayâ € ” 128 kbps AAC encoding with DRMâ € ” at the same price of 99 cents per song , alongside DRM - free higher quality versions when available .
Great .
So Apple now offers DRM - free tracks from EMI as well as an option to upgrade existing DRM locked songs to their DRM - free variant for $ 1.29 or $ 0.30 respectively .
Want to find out which songs are offered as DRM - free purchases ?
Open the iTunes Music Store and navigate through iTunes Plus .
Here you may find some of the songs you are looking for .
You may also come to realize that songs you may want to download DRM - free are not available .
So what options do you have if the song you wish to purchase is not available ?
While you can always ask uncle Bittorrent , possible run-ins with your ISP and the law may not sound all too enticing .
The safest – and legal – route would be to purchase the songs through the iTunes Music Store .
Personally , the rule that would allow an individual to authorize a track for playback on up to 5 machines is something I find acceptable for a digital medium which I purchased .
Furthermore , I hate the fact that if I am signed out of the iTunes Music Store , I need to continue to keep a machine authorized or enter my Apple ID & password in order to listen to a song .
Remove DRM protection using iTunes + CD-R /
W
Probably the most widely accepted method for stripping purchased songs of DRM protection is burning tracks to a CD - R/ W then re-importing back into the iTunes library .
A method guaranteed to free you of DRM madness .
Create an iTunes playlist containing your purchased songs .
Insert a blank CD -R or a CD - RW .
Burn the playlist to disk .
Re-import the songs after a successful burn .
Deleting the original purchased tracks .
At one point , DRM Dumpster was a free solution which automated the process of locating purchased tracks burning them to disk and re-importing without any user intervention .
Currently the software is provided as - is for $ 25 .
No thank you .
I would much rather do the above steps myself or , make use of Apple ’s own iMovie HD to do the same .
Albeit at a slower rate BUT without the need for an actual CD -R or CD - RW .
Remove iTunes Music Store DRM with Apple software in Leopard
The current iteration of iMovie released with the iLife ’08 software bundle is iMovie 7.1 .
However , in order to remove DRM protection , you will need iMovie HD – previously bundled with iLife ’06 .
For those – like me – who received iLife ’08 bundled with Mac OS X Leopard , iMovie HD is a separate application download .
Once downloaded and installed , start iMovie HD and ‘ Create a New Project ’ titled “ DRM - free ” .
Save the project to your Desktop .
In the iMovie window , select the ‘ Media ’ tab located between ‘ Themes ’ and ‘ Editing ’ .
You will notice that the top right portion of the interface now offers a media browser .
Select the ‘ Audio ’ tab and locate the playlist which contains purchased music , or search by artist / title .
Select the DRM - laden song and drag the file from the media browser into the iMovie timeline where it says “ Drag audio here to build your project . ”
In order to export the song , iMovie requires that a visual image be associated with the audio track – iMovie thinks that it is going to be exporting a movie .
Simply drag a blank image ( or any other image ) to the track above the previously imported audio file .
Once iMovie has processed the image , select the ‘ Shareâ€¦ ’ sub menu item from found inside ‘ Share ’ in iMovie ’s menu bar .
Ensure that ‘ Expert Settings ’ is selected in the “ Compress movie for : ” drop - down menu .
Selecting ‘ Expert Settings ’ mode will provide the options to export the file as an audio file .
Select the ‘ Share ’ button .
In the Save asâ€¦ dialogue , select “ Sound to AIFF ” in the Export drop - down menu , Choose an appropriate directory for iMovie to export to , title the file , and select ‘ Save ’ .
Depending on your machine configuration , iMovie will compress and export the movie project as an audio file in 15 - 40 seconds .
Locate the exported AIFF audio file and drag to your iTunes Library .
Right - click on the file and select “ Convert Selection to AAC ” .
Once completed , ‘ Get Info ’ on the new file , edit meta data , add album art , and trash the originally purchased and AIFF audio files from your iTunes library .
DRM - free iTunes Music
Store purchases without wasting resources
The above steps may be far more tedious than simply burning to disk and re-importing .
However , the process can be further simplified by creating an Automator action to replay the steps above .
I think the upside of not having to waste actual media ( CD - R or CD - RW ) in order to burn and re-import songs is well worth the tedious process .
Side banter and miscellaneous notes
* If anyone is a paying subscriber , please feel free to comment with your thoughts on whether or not Sirius is a service worth paying for .
I am currently making use of a 3 month limited trial in my Volkswagen R32 which only offers a few genre presets .

Dozens of common household cleaning products contain hidden toxic chemicals linked to fertility disorders in lab animals , according to data gathered by a women 's research group .
A type of glycol ether is frequently found in popular cleaning products such as Windex Aerosol , Formula 409 , Lemon Fresh Pine - Sol and Simple Green All Purpose Cleaner , says the report released today by Women 's Voices for the Earth , a Montana - based nonprofit working to eliminate or reduce toxic chemicals in the home .
The chemical , called ethylene glycol butyl ether or EGBE , is on California 's list of toxic air contaminants .
Some animal studies indicate that it produces reproductive problems , such as testicular damage , reduced fertility , death of embryos and birth defects .
People exposed to high levels of EGBE for several hours have reported nose and eye irritation , headaches , vomiting and a metallic taste in their mouths , studies show .
It 's difficult for consumers to know whether their favorite cleaner contains the chemical because manufacturers are n't required to list it on the label .
Neither the state nor the federal government regulates indoor air pollution , for instance how the cleaners might degrade air inside a home .
" These are products that women are using in their households on a daily basis , and they use them around their children , " said Alexandra Gorman , the group 's director of science and research and an author of the report .
The group wants to help people become aware of chemicals they might want to avoid .
Scientists say most people spend about 90 percent of their time indoors .
Babies , elderly people and sick people spend almost all of their time inside .
The women 's research group pored through federally mandated Material Safety Data Sheets pertaining to household cleaning products .
The data sheets , which are prepared by the manufacturers and are widely available online , contain information on chemicals used in products .
The group found that EGBE , also known as 2 - butoxyethanol , was a common ingredient .
It 's a colorless , biodegradable chemical with a fruity odor that acts as a degreaser .
The researchers found about 50 products containing varied amounts of the chemical .
Some manufacturers , like Sunshine Makers Inc. , which makes the Simple Green brand , did n't report how much of the chemical is used in its products .
Sunshine Makers , based in Huntington Harbour ( Orange County ) , advertises its Simply Green brand as nontoxic and environmentally friendly .
In its response to the research group 's study , the company said it did n't detail all the chemicals in its products to " protect its formula from piracy . "
" At the same time , we back up all of our safety , health and environmental claims with independent laboratory test data , which is available to the public for the asking , " the statement said .
Brian Sansoni , a spokesman for the Soap and Detergent Association , an industry trade group , responded to criticisms of the use of EGBE in household cleaners .
" There is no need to play ' Fear Factor ' here .
This ingredient usage in cleaning products is not known to be of concern for consumers who use these products as directed , " Sansoni said .
Members of his group include Clorox Co. and S.C. Johnson , which manufacture Formula 409 , Pine - Sol and Windex Aerosol -- the only Windex formulation to contain EGBE , according to the data .
The federal government removed EGBE from its list of hazardous air pollutants a few years ago , Sansoni noted .
Andrew Jacques , a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council , which represents the manufacturers of the chemical , said his group believes the several recent EPA reviews of EGBE " indicate its low toxicity to humans and the environment . "
The EPA maintains a safety guideline for chronic inhalation exposure .
The guideline is just that , not a regulatory limit but a guide for health officials .
Jacques also said EGBE is a key ingredient in many cleaners and helps cut the amount of volatile organic compounds in a cleaning product .
Such organic compounds can cause other types of air pollution , including smog .
Some academicians and government scientists believe that there should be a reduction in toxic chemicals used in the home .
William Nazaroff , a professor of environmental engineering and chairman of the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley , said the EPA erred when it removed the chemical from the hazardous air pollutants list .
Nazaroff conducted a study for the California Air Resources Board in 2006 on the indoor air chemistry of cleaning agents and toxic air contaminants .
He found that people using some common products containing EGBE could be exposed to levels 12 times greater than California 's one - hour exposure guideline .
" None of these are ( legally enforceable ) standards for ordinary indoor environments .
We have a blind spot in our regulatory structure for toxic air pollutants , " Nazaroff said .
" It defies logic to think that it 's unsafe to be exposed outdoors but it would be safe to be exposed at that level indoors , " he said .
Generally , some of the people who have the most exposure to the chemicals are janitors and maids .
Some of those workers are represented by the Service Employees International Union .
Ahmad Abozayd , vice president of SEIU 's Local 87 in San Francisco , said there have been oral agreements with companies to use nontoxic products .
In the Bay Area , about 30 million square feet of office space is cleaned with products deemed " environmentally preferable , " said Angela Gustafson , senior vice president for OneSource Building Services Inc. , a national cleaning company .
The bulk of the chemicals have been certified by an independent group called Green Seal , she said .
" It 's absolutely a trend .
It 's not just for the cleaners of the buildings but for the people who work in the buildings . "
In the old days , " people thought it was a good thing to see blue water in the toilet and smell the bleach smell .
But if there 's so much chemical and caustic in the bathroom , that 's harmful . "
State officials are also looking at the chemicals .
The state Department of Toxic Substances Control has launched a Green Chemistry Initiative to get away from old - style toxic products .
The initiative 's purpose is to protect public health and the environment through the design of less - toxic products .

Clean with safer products
Check labels and pick cleaners that contain green alcohol instead of other solvents .
Choose fragrance - free items and do n't pick antibacterial soaps that unnecessarily rely on chemicals .
Pick detergents based on plant oils rather than petroleum , and plant - oil disinfectants such as eucalyptus , rosemary or sage .
Mix your own cleaners using items such as plain soap , water , baking soda , vinegar or lemon juice .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Californians idle in the nation ’s worst traffic jams on interstates surrounding major metropolitan areas but they are far from alone -- 52 percent of these urban stretches of highways are congested , according to a new study released on Thursday .

Californians idle in the nation 's worst traffic jams on interstates surrounding major metropolitan areas but they are far from alone -- 52 percent of these urban stretches of highways are congested , according to a new study released on Thursday .

Drivers in four lucky states enjoyed zero congestion : Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota and Wyoming .
But one Midwestern state , Minnesota , and two East Coast states nearly matched California ’s sorry showing .
Some 83.33 percent of California ’s urban interstates are overcrowded , followed by Minnesota at 77.78 percent and New Jersey at 73.35 percent , according to the 16th annual survey by The Reason Foundation , a Los Angeles - based nonpartisan group .
Manhattan popularized the term “ gridlock ” but traffic jams on New York ’s urban interstates were only mediocre , ranking 37th at 53.39 percent , according to the libertarian - idea promoting group that compared volume - to - capacity ratios .
Drivers in some states whose booming economies are magnets for new residents spent much more time car - sitting without moving than New Yorkers .
Florida ranked 40th at 59.44 percent .
And Texas , whose $ 50 billion road privatization dwarfs all of its peers , was 41st at 59.67 percent , the study said .
And for the eighth year in a row , New Jersey had the nation ’s worst overall road system , according to the group .
“ Gridlock is n’t going away , ” said David Hartgen , the lead author and a professor at the University of North Carolina .
To reverse this trend , the 50 states -- which spent almost $ 99 billion on roads in 2005 -- must prioritize their dollars on traffic - busting projects , added the Charlotte - based expert .
That might be a bit of a challenge for New Jersey , whose Democratic Gov. John Corzine might partly privatize its toll roads .
New Jersey ’s administrative costs were the nation ’s highest at $ 68,352 per state - controlled mile , the study said .
Massachusetts was 49th at $ 60,807 ; next was California , whose overhead ate up $ 50,614 .
New York ranked 43rd -- but its $ 18,687 tab was less than one - third of neighboring New Jersey .
Florida ranked 42nd at $ 16,109 ; Texas was much leaner , spending just $ 3,147 which put it in 9th place .
North Dakota had the least expensive bureaucrats , spending only $ 1,786 , followed closely by Arkansas , which ranked second at $ 1,805 , and Missouri which was third at $ 1,989 .
New Jersey ’s total road budget -- $ 2.36 million per state - controlled mile -- was also more than double that of the next biggest spender , which was Massachusetts at $ 893,236 .
Florida was 48th at $ 570,191 , just above New York , which ranked 47th with a budget of $ 552,807 .
California was 43rd in total spending at $ 336,954 .
Texas spent just less than third of that , ranking 26th at $ 106,221 .
South Carolina spent the least -- $ 31,262 .
West Virginia was second at $ 41,839 ; next came North Carolina at $ 44,654 .
Though states got 13 percent more federal transportation aid in 2005 than in 2004 , they may have focused on potholes .
“ They put the money right to work on the road surface , ” Hartgen said by telephone , noting the “ pavement condition ” of urban and rural roads improved .
But fatalities rose a bit and little headway was made in speeding urban interstate trips .
“ They put a lot more money into the system but have n’t really turned the corner on congestion , ” Hartgen said .
Though often driver - maddening , traffic jams can actually cut deaths by slowing speeds .
“ Most of the states with very low accident rates also have very high congestion , ” said Hartgen .
Massachusetts did best on the death scale , with only 0.797 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles .
Connecticut came second at 0.865 , followed by Vermont at 0.946 .
New Jersey was 5th with 1.013 , followed by New York at 1.039 .
California took 19th place with 1.315 fatalities .
Montana was the deadliest , with 2.256 fatalities .
South Dakota was 49th at 2.215 ; South Carolina was 48th at 2.211 .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- The Al Manzil Hotel in Dubai has been open for business all of 18 days on the Saturday night in January that I show up with Ram Charan .
The lobby is strangely quiet ; there does n't seem to be anybody else staying here .
The surrounding neighborhood is called Old Town , but in fact it 's a construction site from which are rising what will one day be the world 's tallest skyscraper and the world 's biggest mall .
Soulless and kind of creepy , I 'm thinking , but Charan 's thoughts are elsewhere .
Already he has claimed an overstuffed chair in the center of the lobby and is talking on the phone .
After 12 hours of isolation on the flight from J.F.K. , Charan is back in business , deep in private conversation with a client in New York City .
He looks tired , and no wonder .
He began his day with a 4 A.M. Friday wake - up call in Richmond ( he did a Squawk Box live remote on CNBC ) , and he has a head cold .
But he is in no hurry to go to bed .
Charan does n't care what time it is .
He does n't care what day of the week it is .
And the last thing he cares about is where he is .
As long as Charan is with a client - or can get one on the phone - he 's home .
Thirty years ago this month , Ram Charan ( pronounced " Rahm Scha - RON " ) quit a tenured professorship at Boston University to devote himself full - time to consulting .
Today he 's alone at the top of his profession - not a consultant so much as a guru , a corporate sage , with unparalleled access to boardrooms across the globe and intimate , enduring relationships with an array of powerful CEOs .
Among them : Jack Welch , formerly of GE ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , who says of Charan , " He has this rare ability to distill meaningful from meaningless and transfer it to others in a quiet , effective way without destroying confidences " ; Dick Harrington of Thomson Corp. ( Charts ) ( " He probably knows more about corporate America than anybody " ) ; and Verizon 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) Ivan Seidenberg ( " I love him .
He 's my secret weapon " ) .
" He 's like your conscience , " says former Citicorp CEO John Reed .
" Just when you sort of think you have everything done and you 're feeling pretty good about yourself , he calls you up and says , ' Hey , Reed , did you do this and that and the other ? ' "
There 's another aspect of Charan , not unrelated to his success , that sets him apart from his peers , if not the whole human race : what Jack Krol calls Charan 's " strange existence . "
" When I was chairman and CEO of DuPont , " says Krol , " he 'd show up at the house Sunday morning at nine , and we might spend three or four hours , and all of a sudden he 'd disappear .
He would go anywhere at any time that you asked him to meet with you .
Business is his whole life . "
That sounds like an exaggeration , but it 's not .
Having uploaded himself into the global economy , Charan circulates , continuously , with something like the speed and efficiency of capital .
Consider the itinerary he sketched at dinner one night a few months ago in New York .
He had just agreed - for the first time in his career - to let a journalist travel with him and watch him work .
" I should tell you where I 've been the last few weeks , " he began in heavily accented English .
" I go to India on the Friday of the week before Thanksgiving .
I am Sunday morning in Bombay .
Monday morning I am in Delhi .
Wednesday I 'm in Bombay .
Thursday I 'm in Bangalore .
Saturday I 'm in Trivandrum .
Wednesday I 'm in Johannesburg .
Friday morning , at seven , I am in New York .
I have a two - hour meeting with a CEO who has flown in to see me .
I have two more meetings and I fly out that night to Dubai .
I am in Dubai on Sunday and Monday , then I come back here .
On Thursday night I fly out to Jubail , Saudi Arabia .
Then I come back here .
Tuesday morning I have a whole - day schedule in New York .
Tuesday night I go to Milwaukee .
I came from Milwaukee last night .
They diverted my plane so I had to stay in Pittsburgh .
I had a meeting this morning in Philadelphia .
I had three meetings here in the afternoon .
And I 'm here tomorrow , with GE .
Then an hour - and - a - half phone call .
Then I 'm going out tomorrow night to West Palm Beach .
Monday morning I have a breakfast meeting in New York .
And then I 'm flying out to Perth , Australia . "
At least he flies first - class .
Now consider what comes next : more of the same .
Charan never stops .
He sleeps in a hotel every night ( " Professor Charan , welcome home , " is how the doorman greets him at the Waldorf on Park Avenue ) , except when he 's sleeping on a plane or , rarely , in someone 's house , which can happen when a client takes pity on him .
" I got in the habit of having him over for Christmas because he had no place to go , " says Reed .
" He was going to sit in a hotel room .
That 's hardly right . "
Before he was a consultant , Charan lived in dormitories .
Before he was a professor and a student , he lived in YMCAs .
Now he does n't live anywhere .
Charan's one nod to a conventional rooted life is the office he rents on North Central Expressway in Dallas ( that 's the address on his passport - he is a U.S. citizen ) , but he can't tell you anything about it because he 's never been there .
" I really thought the two ladies I interviewed with six years ago were just yanking my chain , " says Cynthia Burr , who manages Charan 's hideous schedule .
" I said , ' Where does he keep his stuff ?
Everybody has stuff . '
It 's really hard to wrap your arms around something like that , but it 's true . "
Three days a week - on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday - Burr and a colleague pack a cardboard box with shirts , underwear , and socks , perhaps a clean suit ( there is a tailor at Neiman Marcus who has Charan 's measurements on file ) , and maybe a V - neck sweater or a pair of khaki pants .
They toss in toothpaste , razors , shampoo , a shined pair of 9 � EEEE shoes , whatever he needs ( " He does n't buy anything himself , " says Burr ) , and send it by FedEx to Charan 's hotel , wherever that may be .
The box comes back two days later filled with dirty laundry .
Charan does n't own a car because he never learned how to drive , and besides , where would he keep it ?
A plane , perhaps ?
With a day rate that clients say can top $ 20,000 , he could afford one .
" If I was Ram , the one thing I 'd have is one hell of a nice plane , " says his friend Bill Conaty , senior VP for human resources at GE .
But Charan is not Conaty .
" I use the time sitting in the terminal , " he says .
" I have never missed an appointment in my life .
I do n't want to get lost in this private - plane business . "
( He does regret , however , not accepting an offer from American Airlines in the 1970s to buy a lifetime first - class upgrade for $ 100,000 . )
He trundles through airports pulling a mismatched pair of black canvas rollers , one held together with maroon duct tape .
His watch is a Timex .
Given all the hours he spends in transit and his lifelong passion for the Indian vocalist Lata Mangeshkar , I suggested once that he might enjoy an iPod .
The idea seemed to upset him : " No , I do n't do that , I could n't do it .
Would just distract me .
Music can make you very sentimental .
Could n't do it . "
Have I mentioned that Charan has never married ?
That he has no children ?
And still I have n't come to possibly the most peculiar aspect of his personality .
I mean that which sets him apart from virtually every person he comes in contact with , none more so than his overachieving CEO clients : Charan has no goals .
He never set out to become a globetrotting consultant , any more than he dreamed of attending Harvard Business School , or becoming a professor , or even so much as one day earning a living beyond the small city in India where he was born .
Remarks on Violent Radicalization & Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , HR 1955
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Before the House of Representatives , December 5 , 2007
Mr. Speaker , I regret that I was unavoidably out of town on October 23 , 2007 , when a vote was taken on HR 1955 , the Violent Radicalization & Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act .
Had I been able to vote , I would have voted against this misguided and dangerous piece of legislation .
This legislation focuses the weight of the US government inward toward its own citizens under the guise of protecting us against " violent radicalization . "
I would like to note that this legislation was brought to the floor for a vote under suspension of regular order .
These so - called " suspension " bills are meant to be non-controversial , thereby negating the need for the more complete and open debate allowed under regular order .
It is difficult for me to believe that none of my colleagues in Congress view HR 1955 , with its troubling civil liberties implications , as " non-controversial . "
There are many causes for concern in HR 1955 .
The legislation specifically singles out the Internet for " facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process " in the United States .
Such language may well be the first step toward US government regulation of what we are allowed to access on the Internet .
Are we , for our own good , to be subjected to the kind of governmental control of the Internet that we see in unfree societies ?
This bill certainly sets us on that course .
This seems to be an unwise and dangerous solution in search of a real problem .
Previous acts of ideologically motivated violence , though rare , have been resolved successfully using law enforcement techniques , existing laws against violence , and our court system .
Even if there were a surge of " violent radicalization " — a claim for which there is no evidence — there is no reason to believe that our criminal justice system is so flawed and weak as to be incapable of trying and punishing those who perpetrate violent acts .
This legislation will set up a new government bureaucracy to monitor and further study the as - yet undemonstrated pressing problem of homegrown terrorism and radicalization .
It will no doubt prove to be another bureaucracy that artificially inflates problems so as to guarantee its future existence and funding .
But it may do so at great further expense to our civil liberties .
What disturbs me most about this legislation is that it leaves the door wide open for the broadest definition of what constitutes " radicalization . "
Could otherwise nonviolent anti-tax , anti-war , or anti-abortion groups fall under the watchful eye of this new government commission ?
Assurances otherwise in this legislation are unconvincing .
In addition , this legislation will create a Department of Homeland Security - established university - based body to further study radicalization and to " contribute to the establishment of training , written materials , information , analytical assistance and professional resources to aid in combating violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism . "
I wonder whether this is really a legitimate role for institutes of higher learning in a free society .
Legislation such as this demands heavy - handed governmental action against American citizens where no crime has been committed .
It is yet another attack on our Constitutionally protected civil liberties .
It is my sincere hope that we will reject such approaches to security , which will fail at their stated goal at a great cost to our way of life .

DOJ Shuns Hearing on Halliburton / KBR Rape Cases Former Halliburton / KBR
Employee tells Congress how she was gang - raped in Iraq .
Dec. 19 , 2007  --
The Department of Justice refused to send a representative to answer questions from Congress today on the investigations into allegations of rape and sexual assault on female American contractors .
" I 'm embarrassed that the Department of Justice can't even come forward , " said the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee John Conyers , D - Mich .
" This is an absolute disgrace , " said Conyers .
" The least we could do is have people from the Department of Justice and the Defense over here talking about how we 're going to straighten out the system right away . "
Among the witnesses who testified today was Jamie Leigh Jones , who appeared on " 20/20 " last week .
Click Here for Full Blotter Coverage .
Jones , now 23 , says that after she 'd been raped by multiple assailants in her room at a KBR camp in the Green Zone , she was warned by company officials that if she left Iraq for medical treatment , she'd be out of a job .
To date there has been no prosecution of the men who Jones says gang - raped her .
Jones ' congressman , Ted Poe , R - Texas , also testified at the hearing and told the committee how he has not been given any answers as to the status of the investigation by DOJ or the State Department .
" The Department of Justice has not informed Jamie or me of the status of a criminal investigation against her rapist if any investigation exists , " Poe said today .
" It is interesting to note that the Department of Justice has thousands of lawyers but not one from the barrage of lawyers is here to tell us what if anything they are doing .
Their absence and silence speaks volumes about the hidden crimes in Iraq .
Their attitude seems to be one of blissful indifference to American workers in Iraq , " said Poe .
Jones told Congress that it was n't until after she was interviewed by " 20/20 , " that an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida questioned her about her case .
" I asked the AUSA , ' Where should I refer victims to contact me ? ' and she responded , ' Do n't refer them to my office , but you may want to refer them to the office of victims of crime , ' " Jones recounted for Congress today .
But the Department of Justice Crime Victims office , in a letter to Jamie 's lawyer , had already said it had closed out her complaint claiming it did not have jurisdiction .
The Department of Justice , following the hearing , said today that the department is " investigating this matter " but would not elaborate .
Jones has now filed a lawsuit against Halliburton and KBR .
KBR says that in the case of Jones they were quick to offer her support and assistance .
Halliburton says it is improperly named the lawsuit .
The ACLU filed a motion Tuesday in federal court to stop immigration authorities from forcibly drugging deportees in order to send them back to their home countries on commercial airlines .
The motion comes after an official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before the Senate last month that 50 immigrants had been given psychotropic drugs against their will over a seven - month period .
Thirty - three of them had no previous psychiatric diagnosis .
One deportee , a Christian pastor in Riverside , was pinned down in a holding cell in Los Angeles the day before he was scheduled to be flown to his native Indonesia , the ACLU contended in court papers .
Another , a Senegalese man , was wrestled down in the aisle of a plane parked at LAX and injected with medication .
Those two deportees were in addition to the 50 cited during the Senate hearing .
“ The new information shows the government ’s forcible drugging policy is more widespread than previously suggested , ” said ACLU attorney Ahilan T. Arulanantham .

“ It ’s both medically inappropriate and shocking that the government believes it can treat immigrants like animals and shoot them up with powerful anti-psychotic drugs that can be fatal -- without a doctor ’s examination or court oversight . ”
The motion comes as part of a lawsuit the American Civil Liberties Union filed in June on behalf of the Riverside pastor and the Senegalese man , who were detained at Terminal Island and then forcibly drugged during the deportation process .
The civil rights group contends that practice violates both the Bill of Rights and federal law regarding the medical treatment of detainees , and may constitute torture .
Both men are appealing their asylum claims .
They ultimately were not deported and have been released , pending their appeals .
ICE spokeswoman Lauri Haley would not comment about the pending litigation , but said the forced medications were exceedingly rare .
When they are necessary , they are both legal and overseen by “ medical professionals , ” she said .

“ Medical sedation is an act of last resort and is rarely used , ” she said .
According to a brief filed by the government , ICE policy allows for forcibly medicating detainees only if “ a medical professional from the U.S. Public Health Service .
. . determined that they present a danger to themselves or to others . ”
The government has not disclosed the circumstances of the forced medications .
Only one of the two ACLU plaintiffs even knows what drugs he was given , according to documents recently filed in the case .
The day before he was to be sent back to his native Indonesia , Raymond Soeoth said , two officers pinned him down on a bench in a holding cell and injected him in the buttocks .
His medical records show that they gave him two powerful anti-psychotic medications -- Haldol ( haloperidol ) and Cogentin -- even though he had no history of psychosis .

No doctor had examined Soeoth , an ethnic Chinese and Christian who fled his predominantly Muslim country in 1999 to escape religious persecution , he said .
An unsigned note in his medical record , which was attached to the motion , said “ psyche meds requested .
. . for patient ’s threats to kill self if deported . ”
Another note said Soeoth was given the medication for “ telling officers he would not board airplane . ”
Dr. Mark Mills , a Columbia University professor of psychiatry retained by the ACLU to review the case , called the involuntary medication “ profoundly disturbing . ”
If Soeoth was suicidal , the appropriate medication would not be Haldol , which can cause serious side effects , but “ an anti-depressant or mood - stabilizing drug , ” Mills wrote in a sworn declaration .
Haldol “ is never clinically appropriate for patients who are not suffering from some form of psychosis , ” Mills wrote .
Mills also said that the dose of Cogentin was twice the standard dose of 2 milligrams .
“ In more than 30 years of psychiatric practice , I have never seen or heard of a case where 4 milligrams was delivered at once , particularly as an initial matter . ”

The case of the second plaintiff , Amadou Laime Diouf , was equally troubling to Mills , particularly because authorities made no note of the medication they used and because they injected him through clothing , which “ greatly increases the likelihood of site infection . ”
In a sworn statement , Diouf said the incident occurred while on the tarmac at LAX waiting to be flown to his native Senegal .
When Diouf asked a flight attendant to talk to the captain because he felt he was being deported in violation of an appeals court order , his immigration escorts grew angry , wrestling him to the floor and injecting him through his pants , he said .
Hearing the commotion , the captain ordered Diouf and the escorts off the plane .
But the drug made Diouf ’s legs numb .
He fell going down the stairs , and was disoriented and sleepy for days , he said .
Arulanantham of the ACLU said the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had ordered a stay on Diouf ’s deportation at the time immigration authorities were trying to remove him .
Advertisement
He said that the Soeoth and Diouf cases showed that the practice has not been limited to plaintiffs posing a danger .
The men and their lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. to issue an order halting the practice while the lawsuit is being settled .
Hatter declined to immediately rule on an earlier request to do the same .
Government attorneys , in turn , asked Hatter to dismiss the injunction motion because the plaintiffs could not “ demonstrate they face an immediate threat of irreparable injury as they allege occurred in the past . ”
They also said the policy has changed so that ICE now must get an order from a judge to medicate a detainee .

ACLU attorneys said it was not clear what type of hearing the detainees would get and whether they could appeal .
In Tuesday ’s filing , they argued that testimony provided by Julie Myers during her Senate confirmation hearing to become chief of ICE contradicted “ government officials ’ repeated assertions that the practice is rare and reserved only for emergencies . ”
“ Based on the numbers Ms. Myers provided , it appears that every month the government forcibly drugs about five noncitizens who are not mentally ill . ”

Cupertino , CA – Steve Jobs announced the creation of The Apple Channel ( TAC ) , a new basic cable channel that will cater exclusively to the tastes of Apple customers .
“ A new era of television entertainment dawns today , ” said Jobs .
“ With shows like The Core and Byting the Apple , viewers will get insider information on upcoming technologies , and personal stories about employee achievements . ”
Jobs also announced several other original series that will be featured including a teen drama centered on iPods called The 99 - cent Crew , and an animated show produced in partnership with Pixar called Meet the Steves .
The announcement continues Apple 's move toward becoming a media company rather than a technology company , a move that many critics think is a mistake .
“ It 's one thing to make entertaining products , another to make entertaining programming , ” said NBC President Jeff Zucker in an interview conducted on his iPhone .
Instead of infomercials that other fledgling networks broadcast to fill open air time , TAC will be displaying images of sleek , shiny objects designed to keep Apple customers enthralled for hours ; small children and animals should also be drawn to this programming .
A special feature will be interactivity with Apple TV which will allow the viewer to instantly download programs for $ 1.99 with the press of the remote control 's one button .
Jobs also said that iPhone owners wo n't be left out .
“ You 'll be able to stream programs to your iPhone very slowly , ” he said .
Apple is n't the first technology company to enter the cable television market .
Microsoft 's MSNBC , a 24 - hour news channel debuted in 1996 , and Dell 's short - lived Dude TV debuted and folded in 2001 .
The network will begin broadcasts on basic cable and satellite systems in the United States and Canada in December of 2007 .
A Tutorial on Clustering Algorithms Introduction | K-means | Fuzzy C-means | Hierarchical | Mixture of Gaussians | Links Clustering : An Introduction
What is Clustering ?
Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem ; so , as every other problem of this kind , it deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data .
A loose definition of clustering could be “ the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way ” .
A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are “ similar ” between them and are “ dissimilar ” to the objects belonging to other clusters .
We can show this with a simple graphical example :
In this case we easily identify the 4 clusters into which the data can be divided ; the similarity criterion is distance : two or more objects belong to the same cluster if they are “ close ” according to a given distance ( in this case geometrical distance ) .
This is called distance - based clustering .
Another kind of clustering is conceptual clustering : two or more objects belong to the same cluster if this one defines a concept common to all that objects .
In other words , objects are grouped according to their fit to descriptive concepts , not according to simple similarity measures .
The Goals of Clustering
So , the goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabeled data .
But how to decide what constitutes a good clustering ?
It can be shown that there is no absolute “ best ” criterion which would be independent of the final aim of the clustering .
Consequently , it is the user which must supply this criterion , in such a way that the result of the clustering will suit their needs .
For instance , we could be interested in finding representatives for homogeneous groups ( data reduction ) , in finding “ natural clusters ” and describe their unknown properties ( “ natural ” data types ) , in finding useful and suitable groupings ( “ useful ” data classes ) or in finding unusual data objects ( outlier detection ) .
Possible Applications
Clustering algorithms can be applied in many fields , for instance :
Marketing : finding groups of customers with similar behavior given a large database of customer data containing their properties and past buying records ;
Biology : classification of plants and animals given their features ;
Libraries : book ordering ;
Insurance : identifying groups of motor insurance policy holders with a high average claim cost ; identifying frauds ;
City - planning : identifying groups of houses according to their house type , value and geographical location ;
Earthquake studies : clustering observed earthquake epicenters to identify dangerous zones ;
WWW : document classification ; clustering weblog data to discover groups of similar access patterns .
Requirements
The main requirements that a clustering algorithm should satisfy are :
scalability ;
dealing with different types of attributes ;
discovering clusters with arbitrary shape ;
minimal requirements for domain knowledge to determine input parameters ;
ability to deal with noise and outliers ;
insensitivity to order of input records ;
high dimensionality ;
interpretability and usability .
Problems
There are a number of problems with clustering .
Among them :
current clustering techniques do not address all the requirements adequately ( and concurrently ) ;
dealing with large number of dimensions and large number of data items can be problematic because of time complexity ;
the effectiveness of the method depends on the definition of “ distance ” ( for distance - based clustering ) ;
if an obvious distance measure does n’t exist we must “ define ” it , which is not always easy , especially in multi-dimensional spaces ;
the result of the clustering algorithm ( that in many cases can be arbitrary itself ) can be interpreted in different ways .
Clustering Algorithms
Classification
Clustering algorithms may be classified as listed below :
Exclusive Clustering
Overlapping Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Probabilistic Clustering
In the first case data are grouped in an exclusive way , so that if a certain datum belongs to a definite cluster then it could not be included in another cluster .
A simple example of that is shown in the figure below , where the separation of points is achieved by a straight line on a bi-dimensional plane .
On the contrary the second type , the overlapping clustering , uses fuzzy sets to cluster data , so that each point may belong to two or more clusters with different degrees of membership .
In this case , data will be associated to an appropriate membership value .
Instead , a hierarchical clustering algorithm is based on the union between the two nearest clusters .
The beginning condition is realized by setting every datum as a cluster .
After a few iterations it reaches the final clusters wanted .
Finally , the last kind of clustering use a completely probabilistic approach .
In this tutorial we propose four of the most used clustering algorithms :
K-means
Fuzzy C-means
Hierarchical clustering
Mixture of Gaussians
Each of these algorithms belongs to one of the clustering types listed above .
So that , K - means is an exclusive clustering algorithm , Fuzzy C-means is an overlapping clustering algorithm , Hierarchical clustering is obvious and lastly Mixture of Gaussian is a probabilistic clustering algorithm .
We will discuss about each clustering method in the following paragraphs .
Distance Measure
An important component of a clustering algorithm is the distance measure between data points .
If the components of the data instance vectors are all in the same physical units then it is possible that the simple Euclidean distance metric is sufficient to successfully group similar data instances .
However , even in this case the Euclidean distance can sometimes be misleading .
Figure shown below illustrates this with an example of the width and height measurements of an object .
Despite both measurements being taken in the same physical units , an informed decision has to be made as to the relative scaling .
As the figure shows , different scalings can lead to different clusterings .
Notice however that this is not only a graphic issue : the problem arises from the mathematical formula used to combine the distances between the single components of the data feature vectors into a unique distance measure that can be used for clustering purposes : different formulas leads to different clusterings .
Again , domain knowledge must be used to guide the formulation of a suitable distance measure for each particular application .
Minkowski Metric
For higher dimensional data , a popular measure is the Minkowski metric ,
where d is the dimensionality of the data .
The Euclidean distance is a special case where p=2 , while Manhattan metric has p=1 .
However , there are no general theoretical guidelines for selecting a measure for any given application .
It is often the case that the components of the data feature vectors are not immediately comparable .
It can be that the components are not continuous variables , like length , but nominal categories , such as the days of the week .
In these cases again , domain knowledge must be used to formulate an appropriate measure .

Clinton says Cheney misrepresented her in interview Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) accused Vice President Dick Cheney of misrepresenting her and spreading " inaccuracies " during a televised interview he gave Tuesday night .
Clinton was responding to Cheney 's decision to publicly side with his former aide who cited fears of ' reinforc[ ing ] enemy propaganda ' in rejecting Clinton 's request for a briefing on troop - withdrawal contingency plans .
" I believe it is not only important , but imperative that Congress actively oversee the administration 's Iraq policy , " Clinton wrote Wednesday in a letter to the vice president , copied to RAW STORY .
" That is why I feel it is necessary to respond to several comments and inaccuracies you put forward in your most recent interview with CNN . "
Cheney also impugned Clinton 's position when he accused her of trying to reveal operational military plans in requesting information about troop - withdrawal planning , the Democratic presidential candidate said .
" Your contention that I asked to reveal operational plans is a misrepresentation , " Clinton wrote .
" In fact , as a result of my inquiry , the Pentagon will be briefing the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow on this topic , without fear that operational security be imperiled . "
In an interview with CNN's Larry King , Cheney endorsed the implications of a letter to Clinton from Defense Undersecretary Eric Edelman .
Cheney said contingency plans " might " be shared with Congress when they are ready to be executed , but should remain unseen by lawmakers until then .
" We always have got a lot of contingencies , where we 're going to start shedding those to respond to political charges , such as those Senator Clinton made , I think that would be unwise , " Cheney said Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in a follow - up letter to Clinton , backed off Edelman 's assertions that briefing Congress on withdrawal plans would be unwise .
" Your comments , agreeing with Under Secretary Edelman , not Secretary Gates , have left me wondering about the true position of the Administration , " Clinton wrote , adding she would ask President Bush to " set the record straight about the Administration 's position regarding the role of Congress in oversight of the war . "
He also declined to give a date for stepping down as military leader , a move that the United States and other Western countries have requested as a sign of his seriousness about a transition back to democracy .
In Washington , American officials said that General Musharraf should be given more time .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice praised the announcement of an election date , but called for an end to the state of emergency .
“ The key is to take this in steps , ” she said in an interview on “ This Week ” on ABC .
“ And the first step is to make certain that the state of emergency ends , to make sure that people can compete for free and fair elections for the parliament . ”
Ms. Bhutto , who is supported by Washington in her return to politics here , echoed Ms. Rice ’s tone .
She called General Musharraf ’s announcement a “ first , positive step ” at a news conference in Lahore , the eastern city where she has threatened to lead a protest march on Tuesday .
Whether she will carry out that threat remained unclear as of late Sunday .
Ms. Bhutto also said that holding fair elections under the state of emergency “ seems to be difficult . ”
But she said she had “ not shut the door ” to talks with the Pakistani leader , perpetuating speculation that she and General Musharraf may be privately negotiating a power - sharing agreement .
The events on Sunday appeared to again place in jeopardy a troubled effort by American officials to create a “ moderate center ” in Pakistan by helping unite General Musharraf and Ms. Bhutto in an alliance to combat the Islamic militants , including Al Qaeda and Taliban extremists , that operate out of the country ’s rugged northwest area adjoining Afghanistan .
Pakistani political analysts say that General Musharraf ’s popularity is plummeting at such a fast rate that a review of that idea is urgently needed .
“ The U.S. administration is not willing to accept that Musharraf has messed up , ” said Hasan - Askari Rizvi , a leading political and defense analyst based in Lahore .
“ They do n’t want to do any new thinking on Pakistan .
At the highest level , they stick to their own framework . ”
Last month , I wrote about US financial institutions , their failure to implement two - factor authentication , and the absurdity that has become Wish - It - Was Two Factor authentication .
I thought that 'd be the last I 'd write about the topic , but when Steven King pointed me towards his bank , Synergy One .
I could n't resist a follow - up .
First and foremost , Synergy
One seems to be a great , local institution .
They invest in their community .
They offer college scholarships .
Heck , they even have student - run branches to encourage saving money while in high school .
And this is exactly why it 's such a shame that they 've fallen prey to the Wish - It - Was Two - Factor placebo .
Being such a small institution , Synergy
One does not develop their own banking software .
They rely on Harland Financial Solutions , who provides " strength and industry leadership within each product " and boasts " over 7,000 clients " to make them " the number one choice for many financial institutions . "
With a reputation like that , it 's no wonder so many banks look to Harland for their technology solutions .
Unfortunately , Harland 's online banking product - Cavion® Internet Banking - is woefully inadequate .
It does , however , sport several impressive - looking " multi- factor " authentication and security methods .
The first of these - that Synergy One and other unfortunate Harland end -users face - is the almighty CAPTCHA .
A technology barely able to curb comment spam on blogs , Cavion® utilizes CAPTCHA as a " Security Code , " claiming that it's an " extra security measure used to eliminate fraudsters from randomly selecting account numbers " .
I suppose that makes sense .
Surely , any fraudster bent on electronic bank fraud would be thwarted by a barely scrambled image that required off - the - shelf optical character recognition software to decode .
On the bright side , the system did provide an audio CAPTCHA for accessibility .
Granted , the text - to - speech engine sounds like it came from the early - 90's , but hey , it 's a start !
On the off chance someone might defeat that first bastion of security , Cavion® employs another fool - proof barrier : JavaScript .
For those of you who missed their Code SOD today , following is the code that is used to fend off a SQL Injection ( as seen on the Enrollment Page ) :
function isValidValue ( stg , name ) { var error= " " ; var rtn= " " ; stg = stg.toUpperCase ( ) ; if ( stg.indexOf ( " DROP " ) >- 1 || stg.indexOf ( " .. " ) >- 1 || stg.indexOf ( " NULL " ) >- 1 || stg.indexOf ( " - - " ) >
- 1 ) { error = true ; } if ( stg.indexOf ( " SELECT " ) >- 1 || stg.indexOf ( " DELETE " ) >- 1 ) { if ( stg.indexOf ( " FROM " ) >
- 1 ) { error = true ; } } if ( stg.indexOf ( " UPDATE " ) >- 1 ) { if ( stg.indexOf ( " SET " ) >
- 1 ) { error = true ; } } if ( stg.indexOf ( " INSERT " ) > - 1 ) { if ( stg.indexOf ( " INTO " ) >
- 1 ) { error = true ; } } if ( error == true ) { rtn=" You have entered invalid data in your " + name + "
Please do not use any of the following characters or words : ' SELECT FROM ' ' DELETE FROM ' ' UPDATE SET ' 'INSERT INTO ' DROP NULL .. --
" ; } return rtn ; }
If those two security " factors " were n't enough , Cavion ® even mandates that you use an onscreen keyboard to type in certain fields :
That 's right !
You fraudsters have no chance of getting in -- Oh , wait ...
... gee , I can't imagine how any would find that difficult to use !
Unfortunately , things go a bit downhill from there .
When you sign up as a customer and enroll in their online banking ( something which I think I 'll have to pass on ) , you 're required to select and answer a few of those ridiculous " security " questions .
Curiously , one of the questions had a rather odd disclaimer :
Steven , who shared these screenshots with me , thought nothing of it .
Green was more to his taste , anyway .
But when it came time to selecting another question , it became pretty clear why RED was not a valid option .
I guess you 're just out of luck if you grew up on 9th , love pie , and just can't get enough CSI ( or , god forbid , ER ) .
Your money will be so secure that you wo n't even be able to figure out what answers you need to type in to access it .
Sadly , Synergy
One is one of many that subscribed to this preposterous online banking system .
Several others -- San Antonio City Employees FCU , Hudson Valley FCU , Missoula FCU , SRP FCU , and so many more -- have been suckered into Cavion® and its related products .
And it just keeps spreading .
So what can we , as security conscious IT professionals , do about this growing Wish - It - Was - Two - Factor Authentication dilemma ?
Complain .
Loudly .
A sincere letter sent to a bank Vice President that uses Harland ’s - or any other embarrassingly deficient banking software - will certainly plant the seeds of doubt that their system is n't as advanced as they were told .
And maybe , just maybe , it will make them wonder , how exactly is preventing " RED " more secure ?!
Nyamuragira Volcano ( also known as Nyamulagira ) , in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo , ranks among Africa ’s most active volcanoes .
After a month of unrest , Nyamuragira erupted on November 27 , 2006 , and scientists at the nearby Goma Volcano Observatory were concerned that the local population could be in danger .
Nyamuragira Volcano rises up from the Western Rift Valley near the border of Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda .
The 3,053 - meter volcano erupted most recently in November 2006 .
( Photograph ©2006 Tom Pfeiffer , Volcano Discovery . )
They had good reason to worry ; in January 2002 , neighboring Nyiragongo Volcano had erupted , sending a river of molten rock through the town of Goma and into nearby Lake Kivu .
According to some estimates , that disaster had killed more than a hundred people and displaced a quarter million .
At the onset of the November 2006 eruption , volcanologists watching the distant glow in the nighttime sky knew that Nyamuragira produced fast - flowing lava .
If it flowed very far , it might reach the nearby town of Sake , perhaps mimicking the 2002 nightmare .
Years of civil war , however , had left the country with lingering strife and few disaster - response resources .
To reach the volcano , scientists would have had to risk not just lava but sniper fire .
On December 1 , 2006 , the international science community received an appeal for assistance from the scientists at the Goma Observatory asking for any satellite imagery that could help them safely monitor the situation .
One of the scientists who fielded this appeal was Ashley Davies , a research scientist at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) .
Davies is part of NASA ’s Volcano Sensor Web , an experimental artificial intelligence ( AI ) project that links orbiting and ground - based volcanic sensors with NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 satellite .
When the satellite receives an alert of a volcanic trouble spot , it can change its data collection and transmission plans accordingly , without waiting for a human command .
The Sensor Web is an offshoot of the lab ’s Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment , a broader effort to test advanced software and AI technology that could network space exploration assets — satellites , orbiters , and rovers — and make them more self - directed .
In 2004 , the Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite had first demonstrated its abilities by detecting and self - directing observations of an eruption of remote Erebus Volcano in Antarctica and delivering data to scientists within hours .
“ It worked perfectly , ” Davies recalls , “ although human lives were n’t at stake in that situation . ”
When a big rig carrying explosive chemicals in Mexico blew up several weeks ago and killed more than two dozen , it set off alarms among critics of the Bush administration ’s program to allow trucks from south of the border to move goods anywhere in the U.S .
Was an accident of this magnitude a sign of a dangerous , under - regulated Mexican safety system ?
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration , the U.S. agency that regulates big rigs , has been pushing for more than a year to open up U.S. highways to Mexican trucks delivering goods originating in Mexico .
The U.S. promised this action under the North American Free Trade Agreement , which went into effect in 1993 .
But it has evoked images of 18 - wheel jalopies from Mexico blasting through American cities and making already dangerous highways even worse .

Because of its ports , its vast warehousing industry and its giant consumer market , Southern California is ground zero for such fears .
So far , three Mexican trucking firms have been authorized to use U.S. highways , two of the firms from Baja California and the third across from the Texas border , in Nuevo León .
The fear that poorly trained Mexican truckers would jeopardize American lives may have some public appeal , but under the surface there are some problems with the argument .
The coalition that has fought the administration ’s move is made up of groups that have different agendas : unions protecting jobs , the anti-immigration crowd protecting borders and highway safety groups .
On Sept. 6 , a large group of Teamsters from Local 542 in San Diego held a rally to oppose the program , which the union has been doing ever since the inception of NAFTA , said Ken Lundgren , secretary treasurer of the local .

“ We do n’t believe they can comply with our standards , ” Lundgren said .
“ A lot of people are trying to whitewash this issue .
These trucks are in dilapidated condition . ”
Lundgren asserts Mexican authorities do n’t do enough criminal - background checks and drug testing of drivers .
“ There ’s no way of checking how many hours they have been driving before reaching our border , ” he adds .
And Lundgren said that ultimately an influx of Mexican trucks could jeopardize thousands of jobs currently held by Teamsters , even though the program specifically forbids Mexican trucking firms from hauling goods that originate and terminate within the U.S .
“ Everybody is at risk , ” declares Robert Shull , Public Citizen ’s deputy director for auto safety .
“ There are all these promises and memorandums declaring that Mexican safety standards are equivalent , but they are not .
Advertisement
“ They say they are going to inspect every truck every time it crosses the border .
What that means is that they are going to be looking for a valid 90 - day inspection sticker and a valid driver ’s license , ” he said .
The high - powered lobbying by such groups as the Teamsters and Public Citizen helped turn both California senators , Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer , against the program .
Last month , the two Democrats joined a majority in Congress to vote in favor of blocking funds for the program , though whether that will ultimately keep Mexico ’s trucks from U.S. highways is hardly certain .
The pilot program was supposed to carefully select the very best Mexican trucking company to have open access across the U.S .
Eduardo Martinez , an economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. , said the opponents have badly mischaracterized the Mexican trucking industry and tried to link this issue to immigration problems , national security risks and the drug trade .
Instead , it is a simple economic trade issue .
Advertisement
As the Mexican economy grows , the U.S. is going to have to accept the ability of Mexican corporations to conduct their operations at international standards , Martinez said .
Martinez points to Orowheat , the premium bread sold in U.S. grocery stores .
It is part of Mexico - based Grupo Bimbo , which has bakeries in both countries .
If Americans can accept the safety of food delivered by a Mexican - based operation , why not trucks ?
No doubt , Mexico has some trucks in lousy condition and some drivers who need to go back to driving school .
But you can be sure that Mexico does not have a monopoly on bad truck drivers or unsafe trucks .

I ’d like to see Boxer and Feinstein take the same level of interest in the Long Beach Freeway , which is clogged with rundown rigs that service the massive ports in our harbor .

Via The Washington Post :
A top adviser to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney appears to be behind today 's launch of a new Web site attacking GOP presidential rival Fred Thompson .
The site , www.phoneyfred.org, paints an unflattering picture of Thompson , dubbing him : Fancy Fred , Five O'clock Fred , Flip - Flop Fred , McCain Fred , Moron Fred , Playboy Fred , Pro-Choice Fred , Son - of - a- Fred and Trial Lawyer Fred .
[ View an image of the Web site ]
Shortly after a Washington
Post reporter made inquiries about the site to the Romney campaign , the site was taken down .
Before it vanished , the front page of the website featured a picture of a regal Thompson dressed in a frilly outfit more befitting a Gilbert and Sullivan production than a presidential campaign .
Under the heading , " Playboy Fred , " the site asks the question : " Once a Pro-Choice Skirt Chaser , Now Standard Bearer of the Religious Right ? "
Nowhere on the site does it indicate who is responsible for it .
But a series of inquiries leads directly to the website of Under the Power Lines , the political consulting firm of Warren Tompkins , Romney 's lead consultant in South Carolina .

When Pete Conrad became the third person to set foot on the moon , his wife , Jane , was glued to the TV back in Houston , awaiting news .
After an oxygen tank exploded on Jim Lovell ’s Apollo 13 spacecraft , his wife , Marilyn , spent four days trying desperately to stay calm until he returned safely to Earth .
Connie Schultz sat down with these two longtime friends , among the brave women included in author Lily Koppel ’s new book , The Astronaut Wives Club , to ask them what that period of their lives was really like .
NASA was very involved in the personal lives of its original astronauts .
How did you handle that ?
Jane : NASA implied that we could n’t do anything that might negatively affect our husbands ’ careers .
Marilyn :
When I was pregnant [ in 1965 ] , I hid it for as long as I could because I was afraid NASA would n’t let Jim go up .
Jane : I remember that .
You had tears in your eyes when you told me .
…
But NASA also took care of us .
Jane Conrad ( now Dreyfus ) at age 38 .
( Courtesy Jane Dreyfus )
Marilyn :
We always had security with us .
They made sure no one bothered us during flights .
But we could never go to the doctor for anything emotional .
During Apollo 13 , I held myself together because I had to .
I had four children ; Jim ’s mother was in a nursing home .
I called the staff and said , “ Take her television out of the room .
That ’s her only son . ”
You put yourself in a shell .
You worry about putting everyone else at rest .
You light one cigarette and then another .
LIFE magazine had exclusive magazine rights to cover the astronauts and their families .
Was that good or bad ?
Marilyn :
It was great .
They protected us from other reporters .
Jane :
My neighbor told me she heard one of the reporters in the yard say , “ Put the microphone close to the window so you can hear her scream when it happens . ”
I imagine the reporter meant when the craft took off from the moon , or splashed down .
NASA termed these “ high - activity ” events , the ones that were most nerve - racking .
With the book out , what do you want the public to know about you ?
Marilyn :
We are n’t shallow .
We are independent women .
Jane : I ’m an artist , and I ’m writing flash fiction .
I ’m not trying to brag .
There ’s just more to us than comes across in the book .
Marilyn :
And we never called ourselves “ astrowives . ”
Why did so many of the original astronauts ’ marriages not last ?
Jane :
It was a big ego trip for the men — women hanging around .
Pete and I divorced after 37 years of marriage .
Pete told our son he had cheated for 20 years .
I was devastated .
But it turned out to be the best thing .
I ’ve been married [ to Seymour Dreyfus ] for 22 years .
When Pete died in that motorcycle accident [ in 1999 ] , I attended his funeral .
His second wife got a flag , and I did , too .
That mattered to me .
I was Pete ’s wife when he was an astronaut .
Marilyn , Kathleen Quinlan and Tom Hanks played you and Jim in the movie Apollo 13 .
What did you think of the film ?
Marilyn : I loved it .
Tom stayed with us for a few days .
Then Kathleen came .
They studied how we interacted with each other .
I still get choked up when I watch the movie .
My only release back then was going to the bedroom and listening to the crew on the squawk box .
Jane ( left ) and Marilyn in 2007 .

Jane : I was with her during that time .
You know how wrong it can go .
How have you two stayed friends all these years ?
Marilyn :
Whenever we see each other , it ’s like we were never apart .
Maybe it ’s our generation .
Jane : Maybe women today do n’t need friends like we did .
Marilyn :
They have colleagues now .
Children were our focus .
It ’s what we did .
My granddaughter is working and raising a child .
I do n’t know how I could have done that .
Jane :
And she can’t imagine doing what you did .
The multi-billion - euro plan calls for more energy efficiency , a greater use of renewable energy and new insulation standards for buildings .
The program is designed to limit additional financial burdens on consumers , who are ultimately supposed to benefit from a reduction in energy use .
Another goal of the plan is to rely on renewable energy sources or highly efficient heat and power plants to generate half of the country 's total power needs by 2020 .
The generation of heat from renewable sources is also to increase from 6 percent to 14 percent .
More power is to come from renewable sources
" I think this is the biggest and most ambitious set of laws and guidelines you 'll find anywhere in the world , " German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters after the cabinet meeting .
Start for climate protection
The plan is also intended to send a signal to the UN climate change conference currently taking place on the Indonesian island of Bali to discuss a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
The 14 - point package is the first phase of an overall 29 - point program that the government outlined in August .
The remaining 15 measures , including stricter controls on vehicle emissions , are up for approval in May 2008 and may also include a CO2 tax on trucks .
Germany is the world 's sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and Europe 's biggest polluter .
The country accounts for 3.19 percent of the world 's total output of carbon dioxide emissions , according to the DPA news agency .
The government 's new plan aims to cut back CO2 emissions by 220 million tons by 2020 .
German reductions in CO2 emissions have stagnated since the mid-1990s , according to Reuters news service .
The 18 - percent reduction achieved since 1990 is primarily due to the end of heavily polluting industry in the former East Germany , which was largely cleaned up after German reunification .
Criticism continues
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the climate a priority
The environmental organization Greenpeace has said the German government is not doing enough and criticized the endorsement of over 20 new coal - burning power plants , Reuters reported .
Supporters say the new plants are cleaner than older coal - fired power stations and are needed to fill the power void as nuclear plants are phased out .
The environmental group said that if all the planned power plants were actually built -- six are currently under construction -- the country would not be able to meet its target of cutting CO2 by 40 percent .
Opposition Green party leader Reinhard Bütikofer called the government 's proposals " tepid " and " bogus , " according to DPA .
Transport and Construction Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee has cautioned that implementing the new measures will not be easy , but he stressed that Germany must take a leading role in climate protection in the European Union .
The total cost of the new measures is estimated to be around 31 billion euros ( $ 45.5 billion ) , while energy savings are supposed to amount to around 36 billion euros by 2020 .
It is eloquent in many parts , stirring in its defense of religious liberty , with only a couple of notes off - key :
Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs , even to gain the world .
Ahem .
But it has two deep flaws .
The first is the absence of any notion that religious freedom includes the freedom to have no religion whatever .
A president of the United States does not just represent people of all faiths , he also represents those who have none .
There is a lacuna in Romney 's vision of religious tolerance , and it is a deliberate lacuna .
In order to appeal to evangelicals , he places himself on their side against the other : the secularists .
But that is simply another form of the religious test .
By insisting on faith - any faith - as the proper criterion for public office , Romney draws the line , oh - so - conveniently , so as to include Mormonism but exclude atheism and agnosticism .
And so he side - steps the critical issue in the debates over religion in public life : what if there is no unifying faith for a nation ?
What if faith itself cannot unify a nation - and , in fact , can divide it more deeply than any other subject ?
That is our reality .
An intelligent and wise conservative would try to find a path to a common discourse that does not rest on religious foundations .
The second flaw is that he simply cannot elide the profound theological differences between the LDS church and mainstream Christianity .
Since I 'm a secularist - a Christian secularist - this does n't make a difference to me .
But if you are appealing to religious people , especially fundamentalists , on the basis of faith , you cannot logically then ask them to ignore the content of the faith .
The religious right have tried to do this with the absurd neologism , the " Judeo - Christian tradition , " as if the truth - claims of Christianity and Judaism are not , at bottom , contradictory .
But the " Mormon - Judeo - Christian tradition " is a step too far even for those who have almost no principles in using religion for political purposes .
I think it 's a tragedy that a man of Romney 's obvious gifts should be reduced to this .
But he asked for it ; and the petard he has been hoist on is his own .
If you want a religious politics , you 'll end up with one .
That 's why Huckabee is the natural heir to the Rove project .
And why Romney is falling behind .

Jack 's back , and the Bush White House is again obfuscating and stonewalling about his true relationship with the President and members of the senior White House Staff .
Hiding the Evidence on a Friday night .
The Bush spin machine is at it again .
-- Bury the headline with a Friday night announcement .
Check .
-- Make somebody else do your dirty work .

But back to the story .
Bush Never Met Abramoff ?
Wrong !
Nearly two years ago , just after Abramoff had pleaded guilty in the influence peddling scandal , Bush told reporters , " I ca n't say I did n't ever meet " Abramoff , " but I meet a lot of people . "
" I do n't know him , " Bush said at the presidential news conference in January 2006 .
" I 've never sat down with him and had a discussion with the guy . "
Um , George , the good folks at CREW would like to jog your memory :
photo credit : Citizens For Ethics in Washington
Not coincedentally , then Bush - Cheney '04 Campaign Manager Ken Mehlman was also at the same event as Abramoff pictured above with his father ( Art ) and mother ( Judy ) . .
It 's even still on Reflections website !
You 'll recall that prior to becoming campaign manager , Mehlman was Political Director of the White House - Rove 's left hand .
Mehlman was also Abramoff 's friend and a friend in Judaism .
Despite attending a Passover Seder at Abramoff 's home , Mehlman felt compelled to be lie and say in January 2006 " [ Abramoff is ] someone we know a lot about ... except for what is read in the press . "
It 's a Fake Photo !
No one would ever hide evidence !
What , you claim it 's a fake ?
Not so fast , guy .
I believe your GOP - favored photo company , Reflections , attempted to obliterate any and all traces of the photo ( or one like it ) .
Josh Marshall from TPM was on the story in early 2006 :
Earlier this month , we were alerted to the existence of a series Abramoff photos at the website of Reflections Photography , a studio that does photo shoots for many Republican political events and sells copies to the individuals who attended the events and other members of the public through an online photo database .
Reflections was an official photographer for Bush - Cheney 2004 campaign events and for the 2005 inauguration .
...
When we went to the page for the photograph of President Bush and Abramoff , the page in question had disappeared from the site .
Indeed , in the sequence of photographs from the event in question , each had a unique identification number in perfect consecutive order .
All were there on the site , in sequence , with the exception of the one that was apparently that of President Bush and Abramoff .
...
Amos very straightforwardly told me that the photographs had been removed and that they had been removed because they showed Abramoff and the president in the same picture .
The photos were , she told me , " not relevant . "
When I asked her who had instructed her to remove the photos , she told me she was the president of the company .
She did it .
It was " her business decision " to remove the photographs .
She told me she had done so within the last month .
So , here we have it that the president of Reflections admits that she removed photos of Abramoff and the president from their online database .
If what her employee told me on the 11th is accurate the photos were also deleted from the CDs they keep on file in their own archives .
So the scrub seems to have been pretty thorough .
Did the White House send out the word to deep - six those Bush - Abramoff pics ?
TalkingPointsMemo by Joshua Micah Marshall , 01-26-06
The New Claims .
The Justice Department , citing a Cold War -era court ruling , declared that the contents of the " Sensitive Security Records " cannot be publicly revealed even though they could show whether Abramoff made more visits to the White House than those already acknowledged .
" The simple act of doing so ... would reveal sensitive information about the methods used by the Secret Service to carry out its protective function , " the Justice Department argued .
Associated Press
So the Secret Service believes their " protective function " ( assumedly of the First or Second families ) could somehow become compromised by telling about other as of yet undiscovered visits of Abramoff .
And the Department of Justice decided to " support " the Secret Service in this belief .
Knowing the little that I know about how the system works , if a visitor / appointment to the White House has flags " raised " during screening , he 's given a closer look - and the staff who request the appointment be admitted be warned .
That 's part of the USSS ' mission , to protect all assigned protectees from potential harm .
Abramoff certainly would / should have raised red flags during his White House .
The guy had ties to the South African apartheid government ( they paid for him to make a film ) .
The guy was buying night vision and sniper rifles for Israeli right wing extremists .
Now if the Secret Service failed to see Abramoff's " red flags " or their system failed , then I could certainly understand the security threat to their protectees and their desire to cover it up .
But since Abramoff ( at least according to the White House ) was not a regular visitor but somehow managed to get into events anyway , that 's another serious securty problem that could endanger protectees .
Or , thirdly , Karl Rove 's ( or other ' friendly ' White House staff ) could have been clearing Abramoff in over the objections of the Secret Service - and let him roam free in the complex .
EOP staffer Catharine Ryun ( daughter of defeated Kansas Congressman Jim Ryun , the guy that bought a house on discount from Tom DeLay Inc ) once cleared Abramoff into the Old Executive Office Building ( OEOB ) , despite her office being in an entirely building .
For the uninitiated , most of the important White House people are in the OEOB - Catherine was not .
If Catherine was n't clearing Abramoff in for her office in the " Faith Based Initiatives " section , then who was she clearing him in to see ?
And was her decision to give Abramoff unfettered access to the OEOB a good one when he was n't coming to mee with her ?
( Here 's some earlier speculation about what he could have done during a revealed visit with VP Cheney 's domestic policy staffer Caesar Conda ) .
But It 's Probably Dick Cheney Dictating
This .
In an attempt to bolster its case , the Justice Department is citing a lawsuit on a secret operation of the Cold War , the attempted raising of a sunken Soviet submarine .
In a 1976 ruling , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit allowed the CIA to refuse to confirm or deny its ties to Howard Hughes ' submarine retrieval ship , the Glomar Explorer .
" A refusal to either confirm or deny the existence of responsive records is a well - recognized and accepted response in circumstances such as these , " the Bush administration 's court filing states .
Associated Press
The Soviet sub affair ( the debacle that it was ) was called " Project Jennifer . "
It was a CIA operation authorized by President Richard Nixon .
Dick Cheney was a part of that Administration .
The court case was resolved in 1976 , when Cheney was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerry Ford .
And today , the government is using the 1976 ruling .
Who might have dredged a 32 year old court case from the Ford Administration for use as precedent ?
My money is on Dick Cheney .
Stay tuned .
It 's not over .
Des Moines , Iowa ( AP ) _ Chris Dodd and the other Democrats seeking their party ’s presidential nomination struggled with an ice storm and each other as they spent the day courting constituencies key to winning the nomination and the White House .

For the interactive preview , the border and title color , title string , and lower white text string can be updated independently .
My initial design used a transparent colored PNG for the title in the preview :
Each time the color was updated , I sent an Ajax request to the server for a new colored title , waited for the response , then replaced the old title with the new one when it arrived .
It was pretty fast , but there 's an even faster , easier way .
Instead of defining the interior of the title with a colored PNG , it 's possible to define the exterior of the title with a black PNG that acts as a stencil .

Peacocks
Peafowl is a common name for three species of birds in the genera Pavo and Afropavo of the Phasianidae family , the pheasants and their allies .
Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks , and female peafowl as peahens , though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as " peacocks . "
The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent , and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia ; the one African species is the Congo peafowl , native only to the Congo Basin .
Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage .
The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species , which have an eye - spotted " tail " or " train " of covert feathers , which they display as part of a courtship ritual .

Peacocks Represent Rebirth Much Like the Phoenix
Brooklyn , NY April 2020
I 've been watching the birds building nests in the trees across the street in the park - oblivious to humans below as they sit and walk while social distancing during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
I visualize baby birds hatching through their shells then compare it to humans doing much the same thing on the other side of the current quarantine .
There is an innocence and wonder about what they are observing just as there is an innocence and vulnerability to the human experiment .
As with baby hatchlings - one cannot simply fly free .
It takes time and experience about what works and what does n't .
Slowly and cautiously humans will enter the revised world of 2020 to an uncertain future created by surrounding factors .
Do n't jump out of the nest too quickly .
Take your time to fly free .
A new norm will slowly show itself but be braced for the unexpected for it too is part of the equation .
Remember the end comes out of the blue .

While I have heard some individuals speak of not having them in the home but I can say that nothing has never come about for me .
I found the feathers and consider them to be a gift from The Creator .
Peacock for Harmony
The peacock brings harmony and joy to our mind .
This bird is majestic , proud with much expression and as the male bird walks and dances to the female in courting .
This reminds us of the celebration in life .

Peacocks in Cultural
The crown of peacock 's feathers leads to a further revelation : that it is the music of the heart which can be expressed through the head ; it is the knowledge of the head and the love of the heart that together fully express the divine message .
The peacock 's feather in all ages has been considered as a sign of beauty and knowledge ; beauty because it is beautiful , knowledge because it is in the form of an eye .
It is by keen observation that man acquires knowledge .
Knowledge without love is lifeless .
So , with the flute , the crown of peacock 's feathers makes the symbol complete .
In Hinduism , the Peacock is associated with Saraswati , a deity representing benevolence , patience , kindness , compassion and knowledge .
Peacocks have a special relation with Lord Krishna .
he wears peacock feathers on his head , and ties them with his flute .
These feathers are given to him by the peacocks themselves .
Peacock is also the mount of Hindu God of war Murugan , also called Kartikeya , the brother of Ganesha .
Similar to Saraswati , the Peacock is associated with Kwan - yin in Asian spirituality .
Kwan - yin ( or Quan Yin , Guanyin ) is also an emblem of love , compassionate watchfulness , good - will , nurturing , and kind - heartedness .
Legend tells us she chose to remain a mortal even though she could be immortal because she wished to stay behind and aid humanity in their spiritual evolution .
In Greco -Roman mythology the Peacock is identified with the goddess Hera ( Juno ) .
The eyes upon the peacock 's tail comes from Argus whose hundred eyes were placed upon the peacock 's feathers by the goddess in memory of his role as the guard of Io , a lover of Zeus that Hera had punished .
The eyes are said to symbolize the vault of heaven and the " eyes " of the stars .
In Babylonia and Persia the Peacock is seen as a guardian to royalty , and is often seen in engravings upon the thrones of royalty .

The Peacock symbolism represents the " all - seeing " church , along with the holiness and sanctity associated with it .
Additionally , the Peacock represents resurrection , renewal and immortality within the spiritual teachings of Christianity .
Themes of renewal are also linked to alchemical traditions too , as many schools of thought compare the resurrecting phoenix to the modern - day Peacock .
Melek Taus , the Peacock Angel , is the Yazidi name for the central figure of their faith .
The Yazidi consider TawuseMelek an emanation of God and a benevolent angel who has redeemed himself from his fall and has become a demiurge who created the cosmos from the Cosmic egg .
After he repented , he wept for 7,000 years , his tears filling seven jars , which then quenched the fires of hell .
In art and sculpture , Tawuse Melek is depicted as a peacock .
However , peacocks are not native to the lands where Tawuse Melek is worshipped .
In 1956 , John J. Graham created an abstraction of an eleven - feathered peacock logo for American broadcaster NBC .
This brightly hued peacock was adopted due to the increase in color programming .
NBC 's first color broadcasts showed only a still frame of the colorful peacock .
The emblem made its first on - air appearance on May 22 , 1956 .
The current version of the logo debuted in 1986 and has six feathers ( yellow , orange , red , purple , blue , green ) .
A stylized peacock in full display is the logo for the Pakistan Television Corporation .
In some cultures the peacock is also a symbol of pride or vanity , due to the way the bird struts and shows off its plumage .

A group working to promote pro-Israel sentiment at American colleges is hiring students to act as campus emissaries of the Jewish state .
Jewish student leaders from Columbia University , New York University , and Queens College will receive up to $ 1,000 a year from the advocacy group StandWithUs to bring speakers and films to campus that portray Israel in a positive light .
" There 's an atmosphere that everything has to be intellectually valid , " a sophomore history major at Columbia University , Ariel Pollock , said of her campus .
" It 's a great framework , but for some reason Israel has fallen outside of that paradigm . "
Ms. Pollock , 20 , is one of 38 " Emerson Fellows " selected for the new initiative , funded by California - based philanthropists Rita and Steven Emerson .
She said she plans to use her stipend to bring to campus a film about Moroccan and Indian immigrants to Israel , " Turn Left at the End of the World , " and to organize academic debates between Columbia faculty in the department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures and pro-Israel professors she plans to invite .
A sophomore at NYU , David Avraham , who is on the board of the Middle East Dialogue Group , and a junior at Queens College , Alisa Bodner , have also been chosen as fellows from a pool of more than 100 applicants .
Mr. Avraham plans to organize social gatherings for Muslim and Jewish students .
" There 's a lot of effort at NYU to build bridges between the Jewish and Muslim communities , " Mr. Avraham , 20 , said .
" The right - wing Jewish side , and the right - wing Muslim side , neither of those groups have their information correct . "
In hiring its Emerson Fellows , StandWithUs gave special weight to finding student advocates at " problem campuses , " where discourse on the Middle East is skewed by anti-Israel rhetoric , officials said .
The North American campus director of StandWithUs , Daniel Klein , identified Columbia , MIT , and the University of Michigan as hot spots of anti-Israel sentiment .
" The story of democracy in Israel , of a vibrant diverse country , is not being told on campuses , " Mr. Klein said .
StandWithUs is an international education organization founded in 2001 .

Gun-rights advocates stage protest at Norfolk council meeting Chet Szymecki , who was arrested in June at Harborfest , was joined Tuesday by his daughter Kiersten , 13 , and his wife , Deborah .

NORFOLK
More than 100 gun-rights advocates , most carrying handguns on their hips and wearing buttons saying " Guns Save Lives , " came to the City Council on Tuesday night to protest what they called harassment of law - abiding gun owners by city officials .
The protest was called by the Virginia Citizens Defense League , a gun-rights group , after Chet Szymecki of Yorktown was arrested in June at Harborfest for carrying a gun .
Szymecki was arrested for violating a city ordinance banning guns at Harborfest - an ordinance that officials now acknowledge violates state law .
City Attorney Bernard A. Pishko said city officials were unaware of a state law prohibiting localities from banning guns .
Carrying a weapon openly is legal in Virginia , even at a large gathering such as Harborfest .
Once city officials realized their error , the charges against Szymecki were dropped .
" We made a mistake , " Councilman Barclay C. Winn said .
" It was unintentional . "
Most who came to protest did n't appear to believe it was an innocent mistake .
" You know it was illegal , " said Dave Vann , who drove from Falls Church to speak .
" You arrested someone , and now it 's going to cost you dearly . "
Szymecki , a Navy veteran , said he was manhandled and hurt and that his wife , Deborah , his three children and two other children who accompanied them were traumatized .
He said he has hired Norfolk attorney Stephen Merrill .
An emotional Deborah Szymecki told the council that after several police officers were done handcuffing her husband , she was left without money or the keys to the family car .
Others rose to describe incidents in which they said they were questioned and often handcuffed by police for simply carrying a firearm openly .
" Apparently you have some officers who do n't understand the law , " said the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League , Philip Van Cleave of Midlothian .
The meeting drew more rowdy as it continued , with speakers receiving thunderous applause and some expressing disgust for the council .
Some used unsavory terms to describe the police .
Councilman Paul R. Riddick left the meeting as gun-rights advocates began speaking , he said , in protest of their protest .
Kim Barton , who would not say where she lives , tried to speak but was told by Mayor Paul Fraim that she could n't because she had not signed up to speak .
" I want to hear what she has to say , " Vann said .
Fraim replied , " I 'm running this meeting " and informed Vann his time to speak had expired .

Part of a Much Bigger Picture ( hide comment )
Unfortunately I havn't seen an additional article in the Pilot that lets folks now that there were several other Norfolk residents at the meeting who spoke of similar incidents with Norfolk Police when a lawfully carried gun was not part of the picture .
Norfolk Police seem to be harassing just about everyone regardless of age , sex , or race .
It was very disheartening to hear some of the stories from the local residents about how the police are treating their citizens .
The City Council must take action immediately .
I 'm sure some are shocked that Councilman Riddick walked out of the meeting but I 'm not .
There is a good reason why he is no longer Norfolk 's Vice Mayor .

Over the summer I did quite a bit of work on lxml.html .
I ’m pretty excited about it , because with just a little work HTML starts to be very usefully manipulatable .
This is n’t how I ’ve felt about HTML in the past , with all HTML emerging from templates and consumed only by browsers .
The ElementTree representation ( which lxml copies ) is a bit of a nuisance when representing HTML .
A few methods improve it , but it is still awkward for content with mixed tags and text ( common in HTML , uncommon in most other XML ) .
Looking at Genshi Transforms there are some things I wish we could do , like simply “ unwrap ” text and then wrap it again .
But once you remove a tag the text is thoroughly merged into its neighbors .
Another little nuisance is that el.text and el.tail can be None , which means you have to guard a lot of code .
That said , here ’s the Genshi example :
>>> html = HTML ( '' ' < html > ... < head >< title > Some Title </ title ></head > ... < body > ... Some < em> body < / em > text .
... </ body > ... < /html >''' ) >>> print html | Transformer (' body/em').map(unicode.upper , TEXT ) \ ... .unwrap ( ).wrap(tag.u).end ( ) \ ... . select ( ' body / u ' ) \ ... . prepend ( ' underlined ')
Here ’s how you ’d do it with lxml.html :
>>> html = fromstring (''' ... same thing ...''') >>> def transform ( doc ) : ... for el in doc.xpath ( ' body / em ' ) : ... el.text = ( el.text or '' ) .upper ( ) ... el.tag = ' u ' ... for el in doc.xpath ( ' body / u ' ) : ... el.text = ' underlined ' + ( el.text or '')
I ’m not sure if Genshi works in - place here , or makes a copy ; otherwise these are pretty much equivalent .
Which is better ?
Personally I prefer mine , and actually prefer it quite strongly , because it ’s quite simple — it ’s a function with loops and assignments .
It ’s practically pedestrian in comparison to the Genshi example , which uses methods to declaratively create a transformer .
Some of the things now in lxml .html include :
Young Voter Pac
Young Voter PAC is dedicated to helping candidates learn how to reach out and engage young voters in the political dialogue , to earn their support and their vote .
What We Want
What we want , quite simply , is to engage young voters in the American political dialogue as much as possible .
For decades , politicians have considered young voters to be disinterested , uninvolved , and apathetic about politics .
Consequently , politicians have ignored this demographic group .
We want to see young voters become more involved in the political discussion in your country .
We believe that getting young voters more involved in the political process can change the face of American elections , influencing the issues that are discussed and the candidates who win .
Who We Support
The goal of the Young Voter PAC is to support political candidates who reach out to young voters .
We want to encourage more political candidates to include young voters in their campaign strategy , to be understanding of young voter 's issues are responsive to the interests .
To candidates and parties who are responsive to young voter 's problems and needs , we will provide financial resources and strategic consultation on how to build a coalition of young voter support .
We will help publicize these candidates and their position on the key issues to young Americans .
We will encourage young people to register to vote , and to get to the booths on Election Day

Did you ever try Paint Shop Pro ?
It is the most splendid of programs , a faithful collie dog of a program .
Whistle for it and it bounces up off your hard disk , and licks your face , and gambols around all eager and excited and ready to play .
Design industry pros may swear by Photoshop , but that costs way too much for me .
And I never could get my head around The Gimp ’s deeply - nested popup menus .
( Apparently they are optimised for viewing through the zippered eyes - holes of a leather mask . )
Nope , it ’s got to be Paint Shop Pro .
Let ’s round up a flock of company ID card photos and wittily pimple the cheeks and black out the teeth of our less popular colleagues !
Let ’s pilfer that neat bit of GIF marquetary from the Beeb ’s website : change the colour , scale and rotate it , slap it in a PNG of our own - they ’ll never know it ’s gone .
Let ’s take the shot of the Christmas party , and clone - brush the FD ’s hand an inch or so further north .
Whether it ’s bullying , theft or just good old - fashioned blackmail , Paint Shop Pro will do it for you !
Except it wo n’t .
I say ' Paint Shop Pro ’ , but I mean Paint Shop Pro Version 7 .
Paint Shop Pro Version 8 was a spectacular leap over an individual of superorder Selachimorpha .
To switch abruptly back to my canine metaphor , the eager obedient collie of Version 7 was gone , replaced by a fat , balding , blind old labrador that made bad smells and monopolised the hearthrug .
Whodunit ?
I say that Paint Shop Pro was murdered by the enthusiasm of its coders .
Their bloody fingerprints are to be found all over the body , but the most striking clue was the addition in version 8 of support for Python scripting .
No marketer would ever demand this .
Python is a programming language of supposedly amazing powers that enables geeks to have fierce , religious arguments about nothing at all , which they call ' significant whitespace ’ .
Embedding Python in Paint Shop Pro is like embedding Kate Adie in the Scouts : over the top and unlikely to impress the shade of Baden - Powell .
I am absolutely not mocking the programmers of Paint Shop Pro - ' there but for the grace of Pooh ’ and all that - but it struck me as a particularly interesting example of softicide .
The original ' Jump the Shark ’ TV show site provides a number of categories for identifying the point of no return : things like ' Same Character , Different Actor ’ , ' Special Guest Star ’ , ' K9 ’ , and so on .
A similar list can be constructed for software , starting by categorising Paint Shop Pro ’s fate as ' Too clever by half ' .
Here are some other categories .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - North Korea missed a year - end deadline to give a full account of its nuclear weapons under a disarmament - for - aid deal struck with regional powers and the United States .
“ I think we had all hoped that North Korea would meet the December 31 deadline , ” said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel , just hours after midnight North Korean time ( 10 a.m. EST ) had passed .
“ We think it ’s possible for the North Koreans to provide a full and complete declaration and we hope they will do that as soon as possible , ” he said in Crawford , Texas , where President George W. Bush was vacationing on his ranch .
North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in October 2006 , gave no explanation for missing the deadline , which had been agreed in February in talks between United States , China , Japan , Russia and South Korea .
The United States and allies South Korea and Japan issued coordinated statements on Sunday lamenting Pyongyang ’s failure to deliver the expected declaration of its atomic activities in exchange for aid .
But the United States seemed to temper its disappointment .
“ The important thing is not whether we have the declaration by today , ” said State Department spokesman Tom Casey .
“ The important thing is we get a declaration that meets the requirement of the agreement , which means it needs to be full and complete . ”
In Tokyo , a Japanese Foreign Ministry official urged Pyongyang “ to provide a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear programs as quickly as possible . ”
“ It is unfortunate that this declaration has not been provided yet , ” the official said .
In early November , North Korea began disabling its aging Yongbyon nuclear complex , which is also required under the nuclear deal .
The process is the first tangible action the secretive state has made to take apart its nuclear arms program since it began its quest for atomic weapons in earnest in the 1980s .
“ Good progress has been made at Yongbyon , ” said Stanzel .
“ But there does have to be a complete and full declaration and this cannot be a situation where the North Koreans pretend to give a complete declaration . ”
Shortly before the deadline passed , North Korea blamed the United States for hurting prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula by continuing to harbor an intention to attack it -- something Washington has repeatedly denied .
“ The reality testifies once again that there is no change in the U.S. intention to invade us with force and occupy the whole of Korea , although the U.S. is uttering ‘ peace ’ and ‘ dialogue , ’ ” the North ’s communist party newspaper said in a commentary .
“ Dialogue and war attempts ca n’t stand together . ”
DEAL NOT JEOPARDIZED
U.S. officials estimate North Korea has produced about 110 pounds ( 50 kgs ) of plutonium , enough for about eight nuclear weapons , and launched a clandestine program to enrich uranium for weapons .

However , analysts said the nuclear deal would not be jeopardized for now .
Earlier this year .
North Korea missed a separate deadline without retribution to freeze its Yongbyon reactor because of a dispute over its international finances .
It had lived up to its obligations after that dispute was settled .
If the destitute North meets the conditions of the six - nation deal , it will receive 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid and Washington would take it off its terrorism blacklist , which could help it tap into international finance .
A leading Chinese academic said it was important for all parties to the nuclear disarmament talks to keep influencing North Korea , and that was why China had taken a sanguine stance over the deadline .
“ There has been no strong evidence between February 13 and October 1 that North Korea has truly made up its mind to denuclearize , ” said Zhu Feng , director of Peking University ’s International Security Program .
“ None of the parties involved are convinced yet that North Korea is really ready to denuclearize .
Everyone was a bit disappointed but agreed the situation was not too bad , ” Zhu said .

It 's that time of year again .
Last year 's response to our Game of the Year post was so enthusiastic that I thought it would be worthwhile to give it another go .
So , once again , some of the Slashdot folks have come together to offer up our ' games of the year ' .
Scuttlemonkey , Scott Collins , Chris Brown , CmdrTaco , and myself have all put together quick blurbs about the games we could n't get enough of this year .
When you 're through reading those , it 's your turn to speak up .
What was the game you could n't put down ?
The next - gen consoles really came into their own this year ; was it one of those games , or something for the PC ?
In your opinion , what was the best game of the year ?
Slashdot Engineer Chris Brown :
If you read game sites at all , by now you 've probably had more than your fill of cake and Weighted Companion Cube jokes .
But Portal remains one of the best games to come out this year , well worth the price of the entire Orange Box just by itself .
It 's a darkly funny genre - bender of a game , and every minute of it is enjoyable .
The only thing a reasonable person could still wish for is more of it - it's a short game by anyone 's standards .
And Ellen McLain 's brilliant voice acting as GLaDOS makes me giggle like a schoolgirl .
My only regret is not experiencing the game on my PC .
The Xbox 360's controls are awkward and the general ambiance of the environments seemed pretty drab and washed out .
Slashdot Engineer Scott Collins :
My favorite game this year ( outside of WoW , I 'm required to admit ) was something of a surprise .
It started at a chili - dinner party when a friend pulled a deck of cards out and said " Let 's play Fluxx . "
Everyone else seemed to know what was going on , so I did n't require any convincing .
It turns out to be a pretty fast - paced card game where you play : ' Action ' cards , such as ' Pick a card at random from another player 's hand ' ; ' Keeper ' cards which are assets you collect to win , like ' The Brain ' , ' The Toaster ' , ' Dreams ' , ' The Rocket ' , et al ; ' New Rule ' cards that change play , like ' Draw 4 ' which changes the initial game of " draw 1 , play 1 " to " draw 4 , play 1 " ; and ' Goals ' , like ' Milk and Cookies ' meaning that while that is the current goal , the player who has played both the Milk and Cookies Keepers immediately wins .
It ends up being a very strange and fun mix , something like Nomic combined with Uno .
But that 's not the end of the story .
The game was so much fun that when I got home I looked up the maker , Looney Labs , to buy a Fluxx deck for myself .
There I discovered Zombie Fluxx .
Zombie Fluxx adds a new kind of anti-Keeper : the Creeper ; while the Keepers are things like ' The Chainsaw ' , ' The Can of Gasoline ' , ' The Shotgun ' ; the Goals are things like ' I alone survived ' , where if you have a Friend ( Keeper ) , and the Car , and no zombies --- and everyone else has at least one zombie , you win .
I managed to play Zombie Fluxx with all of my kids at once .
At Thanksgiving , we had a game with three generations playing ( just regular Fluxx though ; I do n't think Grandma and Grampa are ready for Zombies ) .
The decks are designed so you can easily combine regular Fluxx and Zombie Fluxx for an even bigger game ( and easily separate them again ) .
Patrick " Scuttlemonkey " McGarry :
This year saw a rather violent shift in my gaming appetites , as I decided it was time to kick the World of Warcraft habit .
Any game that required too much of my time was avoided like the plague .
That being said , the Wii's Mario Galaxy turned out to be my perfect game this year .
So long have I been engrossed in the massive " pretty factor " of games ( Quake , Doom , F.E.A.R. , Warcraft , EVE , Empire at War , etc ) that try to impress users with graphics , huge storylines , or tons of options that I forgot how great it could be just to find a simple game that offers a little bit of distraction and fun .
Mario Galaxy really is the ultimate realization of the Mario franchise so far .
It offers all of the glory of a platformer while offering several new twists .
The first major expansion beyond the normal Mario world was their use of 3D and gravity .
Many surfaces in the game acted as their own planet , complete with gravity well and the ability to traverse all sides of the object .
There are also many fun manipulations of gravity throughout the game .
Mario Galaxy also takes advantage of many unique controls available on the Wii to really make the gameplay interesting , without being overly hard .
Many games I have played recently really required a great deal of time to hone your skills to that " expert " level , and while that may be fine for a game with the scope of World of Warcraft , I should n't need that level of dedication for a simple platformer and Mario Galaxy delivers spectacularly .
There were just enough challenges in the game to make it interesting but it was easy enough I could just pick it up and put it down whenever I felt like it without getting frustrated .
The other major advancement Mario Galaxy has made was in cooperative gameplay .
The new " co- star " mode makes it possible for you to include even the most staunch non-gamers in the Mario Galaxy experience .
The co-star is given a cursor on the screen with which they can pick up power - ups , halt incoming enemies or enemy attacks , assist with stronger jumps , and even stun enemies for easy dispatch .
Keep in mind that while all of these things are helpful if you happen to have a co-star , the game does n't require you to have one , so that helpful individual can come and go as they please .
This makes it ideal for friends who drop by or loved ones that do n't want to really jump in with both feet .
All in all Mario Galaxy is a great casual game that can provide entertainment for just about any gaming appetite , definitely worth a look .
Rob " CmdrTaco " Malda :
My entry for game of the year is almost more about multiplayer gameplay .
From fighters to first person shooters , there are just so many games out where I can invite a friend to join me , and then one of us crushes the other .
Do n't get me wrong , this is fun , but in many of those games , the person with the superior skill is bored while the less experienced player is defeated over and over again .
It can get old .
Enter Rock Band .
It might be the perfect party game .
Someone drums , another plays bass , another lead guitar .
And the most daring of any you takes up the USB microphone and goes nuts karaoke style .
Instead of competing , you are a team .
When one person fails out , another can bring them back by pulling off an overdrive move .
And with the multiple difficulty settings , I can play on hard , while a friend plays on easy , and we can both be challenged and entertained .
It 's hours of fun .
It has problems : too many cords , not enough songs that everyone agrees on , and finding a spare guitar right now seems to be impossible .
But each of those problems is addressable and does n't take away from the fact that everyone can rock out for a few minutes .
Everyone can be equals with a common goal and be challenged ( well , maybe not people who have mastered expert mode , but I have no sympathy for you ;)
It 's got a steep price tag , but if you have 3 friends , it 's worth it .
Michael " Zonk " Zenke :
My game of the year 2007 was decided during the 2006 E3 event .
Mass Effect , at that point , was nothing more than a trailer about some space marine talking to an alien bartender .
Years of patient waiting culminated for me in a 45 minute drive to the K - Mart in Portage , WI .
Being able to buy a game a full week and a half before it releases generally is a special treat - moreso for me because of the chance to review the game before it came out .
With a review in mind , I spent a full week leisurely exploring the world of Commander Shepherd , trying to stop Saren from carrying out his mad plot .
Over the course of that week , I was deeply , fully in love with the game .
Yes , it 's got some major flaws .
The game 's UI ranges from barely passable to amateur hour , and there are some honest frustrations to be voiced about character AI .
Just the same , I was hooked , happily using the conversation wheel and Paragoning my way through the game 's endless content .
In some ways it reminded me a lot of Oblivion , my pick for last year 's GOTY , in that the story fully drew me in .
I 've played Mass Effect quite a bit less than Oblivion ; the exploration elements are just not as engaging .
But quality easily makes up for quantity , and my time with Mass Effect has been amazing .
The moment that cemented this title in my personal hall of fame was actually the climax .
Oblivion 's ending is something of a ' whatever ' - the joy there is in the journey .
With Mass Effect , Shepherd 's final confrontation with Saren is easily one of the most memorable gaming moments I 've ever experienced .
It 's an incredibly fitting cap to the game 's epic story and ( somehow ) actually makes me want to play through the whole thing over again .
Blemishes and all , Mass Effect is my game of the year for 2007 .
It reaffirmed for me the storytelling potential of western - style RPGs , and let me put to rest a burning anticipation I 've had for quite some time .
And , of course , now I can get ready for the next chapter in the series .
When do you think Mass Effect 2 will be out ?
Will there be more queues outside Northern Rock on Monday ?
And the firm is bracing itself for more withdrawals in the coming days .
It is also understood that Northern Rock nearly sold itself to rival bank Lloyds TSB , before seeking emergency funding from the Bank of England .
However , the deal fell through because of the difficulty of borrowing money in the current financial climate .
Northern Rock chief executive Adam Applegarth told the BBC the bank faced a " hard slog " but was sure the brand would recover .
However , he would not confirm how much had been withdrawn .
He said he was " absolutely confident " that his customers ' money was safe , but that they were welcome to withdraw it if they wished - and that branches would open early on Monday to deal with expected demand .
' Still confidence '
The BBC 's business editor said the £ 2bn withdrawn - which represents about 8 % of the £ 24bn deposits it held on Thursday - was actually less than the mortgage lender and officials at the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority had feared .
However it cannot be certain whether much more will be withdrawn in the coming days , especially from holders of Northern Rock 's postal accounts - which contain about £ 10bn .
Mortgage banks and building societies such as Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley , as well as the bigger banks , have seen much of the money withdrawn from Northern Rock , Mr Peston said .
This suggested there did " not appear to have been a loss of confidence " in other firms .
" Although the risk of contagion has not been eliminated , so far there is no great sign of it , " he added .
The City watchdog , the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , has backed comments from the Treasury , saying it is confident that the Northern Rock is solvent and that savers could continue to deposit and withdraw funds .
" To be absolutely clear , if we believed that Northern Rock was not solvent , we would not have allowed it to remain open for business , " FSA chairman Callum McCarthy said .
Nervous bidders
The BBC has also learned that two banks were very interested in acquiring the beleaguered firm .
However , they were concerned about doing such a big deal amid turmoil in money markets and when it was difficult and expensive to raise money from other banks and financial institutions .
Mr Peston said that Lloyds TSB came closest to buying Northern Rock , but that the bank says it is not interested in a deal - for now .
The Bank of England has told our business editor that the emergency lending facility offer to Northern Rock would be transferred to any new owner .
However once the facility expires - and the Bank will not make the expiry date public - there is no guarantee it would be extended for the new owner .
" Most bidding banks will remain nervous about taking on a balance sheet of Northern Rock 's size with the risk hanging over it of needing to refinance a large chunk of loans from the Bank of England at short notice in markets which may remain frozen , " Mr Peston said .
You have got to be more vulnerable ( to a sale ) if your share price has come down
Adam Applegarth
Chief executive
Northern Rock
Northern Rock 's share price
Northern Rock 's realisation that selling the bank had become impossible in current market conditions , persuaded the board to approach the Bank of England and ask for access to emergency loans , Mr Peston said .
" Plainly , a takeover would have been a less humiliating option .
But it just could n't be done . "
Tarnished reputation
Northern Rock 's chief executive Mr Applegarth admitted that the firm may become a takeover target , after its shares fell by 32 % on Friday .
" You have got to be more vulnerable ( to a sale ) if your share price has come down , " he said .
" It 's up to bidders to make a bid . "
Observers say that besides market conditions , other leading UK banks were unlikely to be falling over themselves to buy the troubled lender .
Besides the costs and difficulty of borrowing money , there is a feeling from some that its name has been tarnished by its need to call on the Bank of England for a bail - out .
Many of its mortgage customers are paying low rates of fixed rate loans and so are likely to move elsewhere - meaning rivals will instead focus on attracting that business , analysts say .
I expect that in a year 's time , Northern Rock it will not exist .
As a brand it is shot
Justin Urquhart Stewart
Analyst
The fact that there is little room seen for cost - cutting at the firm , and that it does not have a vast network of branches also work against it , according to observers .
Justin Urquhart Stewart , of Seven Investment Management , said that Northern Rock now had a limited future .
" I expect that in a year 's time , Northern Rock will not exist , " he said .
" As a brand it is shot .
The question will be who will own it .
It is a great shame .
A perfectly good business will be strangled by circumstances . "
The bank has struggled to raise money to finance its lending ever since money markets seized up over the summer .
Unlike most banks , which get their money from customers making deposits into savings accounts , Northern Rock is built around its mortgage business .
It raises most of the money which it provides for mortgages by borrowing from banks and other financial institutions .
The skin- lightening industry is worth at least £ 100 m in India
By Naresh Puri
BBC News
The 40 - second advertisement from India starts like so many others promoting razors or hair dye - but it's an ad with a very big difference .
There 's a man who has no luck with the girls .
He has markedly darker skin than his friends and the girl he is after .
In a real song - and - dance Bollywood extravaganza , one of the biggest heart throbs of Indian cinema , Shahrukh Khan , hands over a cream to the hapless chap , along with some mild admonishment .
The skin - lightening cream for men , along with its more feminine counterparts , has found its way into Asian supermarkets and stores in the UK .
While Khan 's advert has not been shown yet in the UK , it too has made its way to British consumers via YouTube .
And the product 's success or failure in the British market place may say something about the nature of beauty and the politics of race .
Kiran Kaur - a
Sikh human rights activist in west London , one of the epicentres of Asian cultural life in the UK - says the arrival of Fair and Handsome , with a Bollywood name in tow , is a step back in time .
' Age - old prejudices '
" The ad simply reinforces the idea that you 've got to be fair to be anything in life , " says Kiran .
" It says that if you 're fair and good looking , you 'll be a wonderful daughter - in - law or husband , your skin colour determines how successful you 'll be in life .
The ad reinforces age - old prejudices . "
The skin- lightening industry is worth at least £ 100 m in India and the Fair - and - Handsome - for - Men range is the latest product from one of the market 's big players .
Manufacturers say they are responding to a demand , but in recent years protests in India have seen at least one advert taken off air .
Other lightening products targeted at black women have been on sale for years , some of them containing chemicals banned for years from British goods .
Actress Rani Moorthy knows first hand about the prejudice suffered by Asians with darker skin .
She is currently touring the UK with her play that focuses on skin colour , Shades of Brown .
" When I was a child my grandmother took me to one side and said make sure you 're good at something , no man will ever marry you for your looks , " she says .
" I knew this was because I was dark skinned .
It was treated as a disease and every Friday I had to have oil baths in an attempt to lighten my skin " .
' A huge star '
She feels a major Bollywood star backing a skin- lightening cream will intensify the prejudice that already exists within the South Asian community , in which the darker skinned can find themselves looked down upon - just as it still happens in parts of India today .
" Deep within this 5,000 - year - old culture is the thought that high ideals , nobility and high caste are associated with fair skin , " she says .
" Dark skin is regarded as low status and low caste . "
Dil Se , released in 1998 , was the first Bollywood movie to make it into the British box office Top 10 .
The film 's key clips , including an exhilarating dance upon a moving train , have totted up more than one million hits on YouTube .
Khan , a big enough brand to be known just as SRK , is the equivalent of Tom Cruise - and then some .
His Fair - and - Handsome advert wo n't be missed by British Asians as they follow every Bollywood move , says Sunny Hundal , the editor of Asians in Media , a website that charts the rise of British Asian culture .
' Immoral '
" Shahrukh Khan is a huge star in India and his endorsement will no doubt raise the profile of this product , " he says .
" Impressionable young men will get the idea that if they want to be attractive like him , they should also use it . "
" The cult of media personality , especially cricket or Bollywood stars , is a much bigger phenomena in India and so brands are much more partial to celebrity endorsements .
Khan is Bollywood 's ' Tom Cruise '
Neither the manufacturers nor a spokesman for Khan would comment on his involvement in the campaign .
But Manish Shah , a distributor for Fair and Handsome says skin lightening creams are very important because " everybody wants to look really good " .
" They 're not bad for the skin , " he says .
" If people have an inferiority complex because of their skin colour , then this product will really help .
It does what it says .
It makes you fair and handsome .
There 's a lot of interest in this product and quite simply it makes people look really good . "

serious offers only , i would like to exchange paper money for paper money printed before 1965 ( for OBVIOUS reasons ! ) .
i will pay 5 % of the total currency exchanged , unfortunately i cannot offer transfers of coinage as i am already pushing the weight limit as it is !
please no solicitations on changing the future as any changing would only happen in an alternate future reality and be a waste of yours and my time .
back to the workshop !
When Microsoft announced victory in its battle with open source for the hearts , minds and wallets of Newham council last month , the press naturally asked to see the report Newham 's decision was allegedly based on .
Er , yes , the report would be forthcoming , we were told .
So we gave it a few days , and asked again .
And again .
And again .
But mysteriously , although Microsoft executives are prepared to shout from the rafters about what 's in the report , the report itself never seems to arrive .
Fortunately , there are ways to get hold of documents that have been presented , as the report was , to public bodies , so if Microsoft is still unable to find it , then The Register is now in a position to help them out .
And an enlightening read it is , too .
But we 'll parse the spun versions first , and remind you of The Facts as we go along .
According to Microsoft 's press release of last month , " Newham 's decision to partner with Microsoft follows an extensive platform evaluation at the Borough , in which the merits of , and overall value offered by Microsoft 's software were rigorously assessed by Capgemini .
Capgemini were selected to conduct the evaluation by Newham , and ran the evaluations as an independent third party . "
Fact One : None of this is untrue , as such , but a study by Capgemini , funded by Microsoft , was Microsoft 's offer during pricing negotiations with Newham last autumn .
Note that Cap Gemini's brief was to assess value offered by Microsoft software , and that it ran its evaluation as an independent third party .
The Beast chooses its words carefully here .
It continues : " The Capgemini report predicts the solution could allow the council 's ICT team to maintain its current level of service while reducing support costs by 13.5 per cent , a saving of £ 3.2 m over five years . "
Fact Two :
Note that we 're still on Microsoft software here , so the claimed £ 3.2 m saving is derived from a migration from the current Windows infrastructure to Windows XP , Office XP and Windows Server 2003 .
The numbers themselves , the Cap Gemini report reveals , are produced by running Newham 's stats through a " cost model based on the Gartner Total Cost of Ownership ( TCO ) Analyst 5.0 tool and the Gartner TCO Chart of Accounts . "
One wonders why they did n't just hire Gartner .
But next , we get to the tricky bit : " In addition , the Capgemini study found that the Microsoft solution could double the cost savings associated with improvements in productivity compared to an Open Source solution .
It offers lower administration costs , improved security and increased productivity for users .
What 's more , the commercial solution will also provide a predictable , sustainable and long term IT funding model for transformation , which will protect the Borough 's investment . "
This one 's intriguing , because it appears to contradict the known facts about what was being studied , by whom , at Newham last autumn .
Cap Gemini was doing a study of Newham 's current Windows setup , while consultants netproject were engaged in a more long term exercise concerning the borough 's future IT strategy .
The open source one was netproject ( which incidentally did not recommend an immediate rip and replace in favour of open source ) , and the Windows one was the Cap Gemini one .
There was no study involving a direct face - off of Windows and open source , far less a level playing field one .
So where the blazes did the savings over an open source system come from ?
Fact Three : Er , Microsoft .
According to the Cap Gemini report Microsoft seems unable to find , " Microsoft have also offered figures for a ( current configuration ) to Linux migration that they have generated from the same Gartner model using input data validated with the ICT group .
We have not independently validated these figures .
However , we feel it is right to include them in this report so that Newham is aware of them and can choose whether or not o [ sic ] consider them in any judgement they may make about their future strategy .
" By using Gartner 's methodology in this way , Microsoft believe that a desktop migration to an open source solution based on a Linux Platform could potentially generate lower operating costs for Newham in the region of £ 350,000 per annum .
This shows potential cost savings to the council over five years of £ 1.6 m , or roughly half that available from the deployment of a Microsoft based solution . " ( our italics throughout )
Here as you can see it 's Cap Gemini 's turn to be careful about the wording ; it has its good name to consider after all , and can't be seen to just shove in a bunch of data handed to it by Microsoft without pointing out that it 's nothing to do with Cap Gemini .
But the bottom line is that the headline ' finding ' of the study is based on data submitted by Microsoft but not verified by Cap Gemini and is specifically qualified by Cap Gemini as Microsoft 's ' belief . '
Cap Gemini itself simply concluded that Newham could save a heap of money by switching from Microsoft to Microsoft , and said it was up to the council whether it gave any credence to Microsoft 's figures or not .
Paul : ' We 're getting ready to bomb Iran ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday December 27 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Despite a recent National Intelligence Estimate finding that Iran has halted its nuclear weapons program , libertarian - leaning GOP presidential contender Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) says there is still " a great possibility " of US military action against the country .
Appearing on MSBNC's Morning Joe , Paul described what he characterized as a deteriorating situation on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan , and said the US was preparing to kickstart yet another conflict -- this time in Iran .
" It is getting worse over there , " he said .
" Afghanistan is getting worse .
Turkey is bombing Iraq .
And Pakistan is blowing up and we 're getting ready to bomb Iran .
A bunch of those neocons want to bomb Iran . "
Asked how the US could justify military action against Iran in the wake of the National Intelligence Estimate -- which determined that the country had n't actively pursued a nuclear weapon since 2003 -- Paul said he did n't think the report would do much to deter a strike .
" I think it 's a great possibility .
Read Seymour Hersh .
He is the expert over there , " said Paul of the Pulitzer Prize - winning investigative journalist , who has previously reported that the US is preparing a preemptive strike against Iran .
" And the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been declared a terrorist organization for the purpose of them being the targets rather than had the nuclear power plants , " Paul said .
" So , wait and see ... there are still quite a few neoconservatives that want to go after Iran under these unbelievable conditions . "
Concluded Paul , " That is the absurdity of the whole mess we have in there ... stay out of entangling alliances , stay out of nation building .
We ought to just get out of that place . "

LIFE for Agnes Kanyema is looking up .
The retired teacher and her husband are caring for four of their grandchildren , whose parents have all died of AIDS .
Their meagre pension is not enough , so they rely on farming to eat and make ends meet .
Now , with the help of WorldFish Centre , a non-profit outfit based in Malaysia , Mrs Kanyema also runs a fish pond , which not only provides extra cash and protein but also helps her grow maize and vegetables on her small plot of less than a hectare ( 2.47 acres ) .
Her pond provides water for crops during droughts and she uses the sediment as fertiliser .
The fish and vegetables help feed her family , and she sells the surplus at the local market .
The WorldFish Centre has helped 1,200 families who have lost breadwinners to AIDS to dig and run fish ponds in southern Malawi's Zomba district .
The small landlocked southern African country relies heavily on subsistence farming .
But HIV / AIDS , erratic rains , overpopulation and soil erosion are taking a big toll , making it hard for farmers on tiny plots to survive .
With Malawi's main lake overfished , people are losing a big source of protein .
In the 1970s they ate 14 kilos of fish per person a year ; now they consume just four kilos .
The ponds , which are easy to maintain , cost only $ 200 to make and $ 10 to stock with fish .
They are filled from the water table or by nearby streams ; rain keeps them going .
The fish are fed from farm waste and by - products , such as chicken manure and maize bran .
According to WorldFish , families with fish ponds have doubled their income and now eat 150 % more fresh fish .
Malnutrition among children under five has apparently dropped from 45 % to 15 % in three years .
Mrs Kanyema passes on the training she has received on fish - breeding and on how to use her pond for agriculture to her neighbours .
Pond owners sell most of their fish and vegetables locally , where there is enough demand to keep everything fresh .
But they are also being taught to smoke fish , which keeps it for two weeks .
Daniel Jamu , World Fish 's regional director , says that the next step is to help farmers club together to market their produce in the towns , where prices are higher .
Many poor farmers are starting to view aquaculture as easier and cheaper than raising cattle .
World Fish is expanding the project to reach another 26,000 families in neighbouring Mozambique and Zambia , as well as Malawi .
As happy as I am to defend the right to abortion to all women everywhere at any time , this is not the right moment to start tub - thumping about Catholics with regard to western women and their choices .
This debate , conducted in the UK , where we have free access to abortion under law , usually turns into a statement of intent , or type - that is , I am the type of person who will think this type of thing .
While I would fight to the death to defend our abortion laws and to attack any attempt made to shame or inconvenience the women who use them , I know it wo n't come to that .
I admit this , I can afford to get aerated about it , about time limit debates and Ann sodding Widdecombe , because I do n't believe the right seriously to be in jeopardy , so it 's almost like a fire drill - all the thrill of a battle without actually getting shot in the leg .
Even in Ireland , where the situation is of course a hundred times worse and there are terrible injustices perpetrated against women , those injustices are not what Amnesty International is really talking about .
The charity , to its discredit in my view - but this is a miniature criticism against a mountain of admiration - is rather softly - softly about this controversy .
It certainly would not seek out points of disagreement with the Catholic church , especially given the two organisations ' history of delicate cooperation punctuated by abortion - related flashpoints .
But Amnesty has not gone looking for a fight .
It says explicitly that its abortion policy is really aimed at the victims of rape and incest , and was developed with reference to the mass violations in war zones such as Darfur and Congo .
The figures on this are almost too outrageous to set down on paper .
Where abortion is legal , the maternal mortality rate is 0.2 per 100,000 .
In countries where it is illegal , the rate is 330 per 100,000 .
With an estimated 20 million abortions induced , worldwide , every year , that number of women dying - for stupid , pointless reasons , for reasons which boil down to unregulated , unsanitary conditions as often as not - is just suffocatingly unjust .
As is the way with these things , young women suffer most : 4.4 million women having abortions each year are between 15 and 19 ; the World Health Organisation says " it is believed that the majority of abortions for adolescents are carried out by unskilled staff in unsafe conditions " .
And these are global estimates , including developed countries where abortions are legal and gang rapes are not commonplace .
Broken down into region : in sub-Saharan Africa 70 % of women who end up in hospital after an unsafe abortion are under 20 ; a study in Uganda showed that teenagers made up 60 % of deaths from backstreet terminations .
In short , while we are worrying about whether 15 - year - olds should be allowed on catwalks , their peers in the developing world are trying to survive what amounts to a cull .
This is what Amnesty International is talking about , with a pro-abortion position - not bishop - baiting for the hell of it , but the unnecessary deaths of thousands upon thousands of vulnerable and usually very young women .
This is what Northern Irish Catholics are saying , when they decide to wash their hands of involvement with the group .
They 're not turning their noses up at the whims and mores of the metropolitan faithless , they are saying : " Not only do we agree with this holocaust of teenage girls , we think these women are dying for a good reason .
And furthermore , we think they 're dying for such a good reason that we 're prepared to halt this charity 's activities even on behalf of vulnerable men , just to make a point . "
What do you say to an institution like that ?
It 's worthwhile to stop for a minute , here , and consider all this in the context of faith schooling .
We all - all we feminists , I mean - have the odd qualm here and there about Islamic schools , and whether they invest proper rigour in the propagation of gender equality , but Christians , we think ... now they 're different .
They provide a sound education , they do n't discriminate on the basis of class , they 're not exclusive , they 've been doing this for years .
They can have as much taxpayer money as they want .
It 's balderdash .
For a start , they are cherrypicking middle - class children ( the Institute of Education at London University just produced this finding , after the most extensive research yet undertaken ) and , much more important , in many cases they are prosecuting an agenda that is repugnant .
Are we really happy to sit back and pay for this ?

Now that it seems nearly every human activity has a computer - or Internet - based equivalent ( e.g. , cybersex , e-mail , online chats ) , it should probably come as no surprise that even a concept such as “ Black Friday ” also has a digital counterpart , one dubbed “ Cyber Monday . ”
Just as Black Friday ( the day after Thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest “ brick and mortar ” shopping day of the year in the U.S. , so Cyber Monday ( the Monday after Thanksgiving ) is supposedly the busiest online shopping day of the year .
But even though Black Friday may be the day that the largest number of consumers traipse through malls and shopping centers to look at goods , it is n’t really the highest - volume sales day ( in terms of dollars spent ) of the year .
Likewise , although Cyber Monday might be a day when a lot of computer users pile onto the Internet to check out wares offered by online vendors , it is n’t the day most of them are buying stuff online .
In terms of overall online sales , Cyber Monday historically ranks as one of the busiest e-commerce days of the year .
Certainly many , many consumers ( including those who braved the Black Friday sales crush but did n’t come away with the purchases they wanted , and those who did n’t even try ) hit the Internet that day to browse e-commerce sites , as the Thanksgiving holiday has ended , thoughts have turned towards Christmas , and people have returned to work ( where many of them have more solitude and better Internet access than they do at home ) .
But although e-shoppers may do a lot of looking and browsing and comparing and even a good deal of buying on Cyber Monday , they are n’t placing nearly enough orders to make that day the year ’s # 1 online sales day .
So where did the concept of Cyber Monday as the “ busiest online shopping day ” originate ?
As BusinessWeek noted in 2005 , the term was something created by a retailers association as a promotional scheme :
So what ’s up with this Cyber Monday idea ?
A little bit of reality and a whole lot of savvy marketing .
It turns out that Shop.org , an association for retailers that sell online , dreamed up the term just days before putting out a Nov. 21 press release touting Cyber Monday as “ one of the biggest online shopping days of the year .
” The idea was born when a few people at the organization were brainstorming about how to promote online shopping , says Shop.org Executive Director Scott Silverman .
They quickly discarded suggestions such as Black Monday ( too much like Black Friday ) , Blue Monday ( not very cheery ) , and Green Monday ( too environmentalist ) , and settled on Cyber Monday .
“ It ’s not the biggest day , ” Silverman concedes .
“ But it was an opportunity to create some consumer excitement . ”
The genesis of the concept goes back even further .
Shop.org member Shmuel Gniwisch , chief executive of the online jewelry site Ice.com , recalls getting an e-mail from Shop.org [ in 2004 ] , suggesting that online retailers come up with their own marketing hook to match Black Friday .
“ The online guys got together and said , ‘ Let ’s give people something different , ' ” he says .
“ The reality is , we did n’t notice anything special ” on the Monday after Thanksgiving .
Typically , the busiest “ real ” shopping day of the year occurs on the Saturday before Christmas , and the busiest e-shopping day takes place on a Monday or Tuesday a week ( or two ) before the week in which Christmas falls .
( According to PayPal , the most popular cybershopping day in 2008 was not the Monday after Thanksgiving , but the second Monday in December . )
Also , because more consumers now have high - speed Internet access at home , many of them no longer wait until they return to work on the Monday following the four - day Thanksgiving break to look for deals ; instead , the day that generates the most web traffic to online retail sites is Thanksgiving Day itself , as avid shoppers use the Internet to plan their strategies for Black Friday weekend sales at “ brick and mortar ” stores :
Matt Tatham , a spokesman for Hitwise , a company that tracks 100 of the largest online retailers , says there ’s another trend that ’s emerged over the last few holiday seasons : the greatest amount of online traffic ( searching and visiting , though not necessarily buying ) happening on turkey day itself .
” After the tryptophan wears off , we ’ve seen that people are going online and planning their strategies for the brick - and - mortar stores , ” Tatham said .
“ Then they go out and shop the deals Friday and the weekend . ”
Tatham cited a Hitwise study that found savvy consumers — and retailers — have started leveraging the term Black Friday , with searches on “ Black Friday ads ” up 91 % compared with [ 2006 ] .
But the tide seems to be changing as Americans spend more time online .
In 2016 , American customers spent more than $ 3 billion on Cyber Monday , according to marketing blog Adobe Digital Insights , making it the biggest single day in online commerce ( so far ) .
Black Friday is still a contender , though — the day after Thanksgiving generated more than $ 650 billion in spending in the United States in 2016 , up about 3.6 percent from the year before , including online sales .
“ Super Saturday “ , for its part , was so successful that it was rolled into several days of sales and promotional events leading up to Christmas .
In late November 2017 , reports appeared that Cyber Monday had , as promised , become the single largest online shopping day of the year , with Americans spending a record $ 6.59 billion , up nearly 17 percent from the year before .

WASHINGTON – New institutions now emerging in American life – " fusion centers " – are raising many questions about privacy and government openness and must be carefully bounded and monitored to ensure that they remain a legitimate and effective law enforcement tool , according to a new report released today by the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Fusion centers are springing up all over the country , but without oversight , boundary - setting , and checks and balances – which are crucial , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" In a democracy , any collection and sharing of intelligence information about citizens by their government needs to be carried out with the utmost care . "
Fusion centers vary widely , but generally are centers intended to improve the sharing of anti-terrorism intelligence among state , local and federal government agencies and the private sector .
To date , over 40 of these centers have been established around the nation .
" We all want our government agencies to talk to each other and share appropriate law enforcement information , " said Mike German , ACLU Policy Counsel .
" What we do n’t want to see is the emergence of secretive , out - of - control units that collect and sift through masses of personal information on innocent people . "
The ACLU ’s report , entitled " What ’s Wrong With Fusion Centers ? " was written by the ACLU ’s Mike German and Jay Stanley .
It identifies five specific problems with fusion centers as they are shaping up :
Ambiguous Lines of Authority .
Overlapping jurisdictions create the potential for manipulation of differing laws to evade accountability .
Private Sector Participation .
Fusion centers are incorporating private corporations into the intelligence process , further threatening privacy .
Military Participation .
Fusion centers are involving military personnel in law enforcement activities in troubling ways .
Data Mining .
Federal fusion center guidelines encourage wholesale data collection and manipulation processes that threaten privacy .
Excessive Secrecy .
Public oversight , individual redress and the very effectiveness of fusion centers are threatened by excessive secrecy .
" Some fusion center activities do not to raise any significant concerns , " said German .
" But these are brand - new institutions that are still rapidly evolving , and the federal government is pushing for fusion centers to expand their efforts to collect personal information from a multitude of non-law enforcement sources – including private - sector databases . "
German also cited the recent controversy over a Department of Homeland Security program of recruiting firefighters to serve as the eyes and ears of security officials when they enter private homes , which he said was an example of the dangers of extending police intelligence collection into everyday life .
The ACLU concludes its report with recommendations that Congress and state legislatures lift the cloak of secrecy that threatens to envelop fusion centers ; impose checks and balances on them ; define their mission , concentrating them on focused , effective law enforcement techniques rather than dragnets ; and evaluate the ultimate effectiveness of these institutions .
" Our nation has done fine without fusion centers for over 200 years , " said German .
" We need to take a close look at whether the benefits of these centers will really justify their costs and the risks they impose to our civil liberties . "

When I was a kid , we used to drive on the Beltway past the big Mormon temple outside Washington .
The spires rose up like a white Oz , and some wag had spray - painted the message on a bridge beneath : “ Surrender Dorothy ! ”
It did seem like an alien world , an impression that was enhanced when we took a tour of the temple and saw all the women wearing white outfits and light pink lipstick .
Of course , it was no more scary than scowling nuns with long rulers preaching about the virgin birth , the Holy Ghost and the hideous fates that would befall girls who wore too much makeup or French - kissed .
You ’d think Catholics , who watched with trepidation as J.F.K. battled prejudice , would be sympathetic to Mitt Romney .

I recently bought Beautiful Code .
In chapter 7 Alberto Savoia writes the essay “ Beautiful Tests ” about the use of randomized tests to easily create a wide range of inputs for a system under test .
I really like and use his idea of randomized tests .
But there is one very important hint missing in the chapter :
Initialize the random number generator for every test to a fixed seed !
Why ?
Tests should be repeatable !
Otherwise you can never be sure if you have fixed a bug from the previous test run , because you do n’t know if the same test data was created .
Why for every test ?
Again : tests should be repeatable !
If you want to run a single test and the random number generator was initialized for the whole test suite , you behavior will change for all but the very first test case .
A sad reality of the current state of affairs here in the Bay Area is that nearly every foggy morning brings news of another violent incident , whether it be a shooting in a popular movie theater or the death of a delivery man .
But do n't worry folks , city officials have the answer to all the city 's problems : a pizza ban .
Yes , a pizza ... ban :
Drunks next year may leave the Broadway strip on empty stomachs if city officials move ahead with a suggested ban on early - morning pizza sales in the neighborhood , which some say could curb violence , rowdiness , public drunkenness and littering .
If the ban actually passes , a pair of local pizza establishments — and — could face closure , as they basically rely on the local late - night sales boom .
While eliminating the pizza threat may hasten the exit of the drunks , it would seem to eliminate a cash cow for local eateries while simultaneously not solving the actual problem of drunken violence in the Broadway clubs .
On the other hand , one police officer is quoted in the article as saying the area simply needs another late - night destination so crowds do n't congregate at Cable Car and Broadway Express .
Maybe Horizon knew what it was doing with that odd location after all ?

Kelly responds to Dinesh D'Souza and his " What atheists Kant refute " drivel .
Digg Kelly's Response - Reddit Article
The question of the nature of reality is one that likely will never go away .
There will always be those who support the belief that this mysterious “ something ” exists , and there will be those on the opposing side .
We must work with the tools available to us , and those just happen to be limited to our five innate senses and the knowledge that we have gained through science and reason .
In Dinesh D’Souza ’s recent piece for Christian Science Monitor , “ What Atheists Kan’t Refute ” , he asks why we should believe that “ reality ” is all there is , but the question should be , “ Why should we believe otherwise ? ”
Empirical evidence is the basis and foundation for all human advancements .
All technological , scientific , and medical discoveries have been made using these faculties .
Nobody would dare to base a monumental decision on anything other than evidence in their daily lives , yet they are expected to do so with regards to this one matter — one that , according to D’Souza ’s religion , would be the most important decision anybody could ever make .
One of the most frequently held misconceptions that continues to be used in defense of Christianity is that atheism is a new concept .
They argue that the lax moral ethos of society has created a brand - new generation of god- bashers .
While it may seem that atheism is having a resurgence of sorts , it is in no way a new phenomenon .
Ironically , he not only uses this argument , but then gives demonstrable proof of its falsity .
Convincing the general public that atheism is a new wave of immorality spawned by a materialistic culture is a powerful piece of propaganda .
The use of Enlightenment era Kantian argumentation as the backbone of his piece shows that the battle between believers and rationalists has been raging for centuries at least and makes his previous statement seem strangely out of place .
( Obviously , he would n’t want to mention that this has been happening since the inception of Christianity . )
His self - contradictory statements here are but the beginning of a disturbingly convoluted argument .
He states , “ The Fallacy of the Enlightenment is the glib assumption that there is only one limit to what human beings can know : reality itself . ”
What definition of “ reality ” is he using here ?
How exactly does one go about attaining knowledge of something that is n’t real ?
The debate between the “ Rationalists ” and the “ Idealists ” was much more complex than D’Souza ’s practically dishonest representation of it .
He presents conclusions from Kant ’s “ Critique of Pure Reason ” as if they were definitive .
Any amateur student of philosophy surely understands that one person ’s ideas , even if that one person is Immanuel Kant , are not necessarily axiomatic .
Kant argued in support of his belief that the five senses were insufficient tools with which to ascertain truth in regards to metaphysical claims .
While this is a philosophically valid concept , it is not scientifically valid .
Kant ’s philosophical ideology separates the world into the phenomenal and the noumenal .
The noumenal world is essentially an agnostic one , but D’Souza would lead the reader to believe otherwise .
He ca n’t even contemplate the notion that just as we atheists cannot perceive the noumenal realm , neither can he .
We do n’t have knowledge of every possibility in the universe ; nevertheless , all major religions claim to have the corner on special knowledge of this supposedly unknowable world .
It gets even more oxymoronic when D’Souza claims that one cannot equate experience and reality , but belongs to a religion that is based on having a “ personal relationship ” with Jesus .
He even goes as far as admitting that it will be easier for religious people to understand this because they know that “ [t ] he spiritual reality constitutes the only permanent reality there is . ”
I wonder how he knows this since he cannot trust his senses to accurately reflect the nature of reality and has no access to this “ spiritual reality ” .
D’Souza ’s entire piece is a collection of conundrums designed to confuse the reader and shift the burden of proof onto the non-believers .
Kant says there is no reason to not believe in that which you cannot know ; D’Souza wants you to believe that lack of knowledge provides sufficient reason to believe .
He accuses atheists of “ foolishly [ presuming ] ” that reason is the proper method for ascertaining knowledge , and then claims to have knowledge of a “ reality ” about which it is impossible to know anything .
I have two words for this kind of absurdity : utter drivel .
“ Reality is n’t all that there is , but the spiritual reality is the real reality . ”
“ Experience and sensory input is n’t valid as a method to acquire knowledge of reality , but Jesus is real because I feel him in my heart and you ca n’t prove he ’s not there . ”
The title should have been “ What I Ca n’t Prove but You Should Believe . ”

Improvement is always possible .
This conviction is the heart of the transformation system developed by family therapist Virginia Satir .
Her system helps people improve their lives by transforming the way they see and express themselves .
An element of the Satir System is a five - stage change model ( see Figure 1 ) that describes the effects each stage has on feelings , thinking , performance , and physiology .
Using the principles embodied in this model , you can improve how you process change and how you help others process change .
Firgure 1 .
The impact on group performance of a well assimilated change during the five stages of the Satir Change Model .
Stage 1 : Late Status Quo
The group is at a familiar place .
The performance pattern is consistent .
Stable relationships give members a sense of belonging and identity .
Members know what to expect , how to react , and how to behave .
Implicit and explicit rules underlie behavior .
Members attach survival value to the rules , even if they are harmful .
For instance , the chief of an engineering group has an explicit rule — all projects must be completed on schedule .
When the flu halts the work of several engineers , the chief requires the group to compensate by working ten hours a day , seven days a week .
After experiencing too many crises at both work and home , the engineers begin to bicker and the project falls apart .
For this group , the chief ’s explicit rule about deadlines is their Late Status Quo .
They do n’t necessarily enjoy the amount of work they had to do , but they know and understand what is expected of them .
The team feels the pressure from the chief ’s rule about deadlines and compensates accordingly .
The pressure works for small problems .
With a major problem , like the flu , the group cannot cope with the chief ’s expectations and a pattern of dysfunctional behavior starts .
Poor communication is a symptom of a dysfunctional group .
Members use blaming , placating , and other incongruent communication styles to cope with feelings like anger and guilt .
Stress may lead to physical symptoms such as headaches and gastrointestinal pain that create an unexplainable increase in absenteeism .
Caught in a web of dysfunctional concepts , the members whose opinions count the most are unaware of the imbalance between the group and its environment .
New information and concepts from outside the group can open members up to the possibility of improvement .
Stage 2 : Resistance
The group confronts a foreign element that requires a response .
Often imported by a small minority seeking change , this element brings the members whose opinions count the most face to face with a crucial issue .
A foreign element threatens the stability of familiar power structures .
Most members resist by denying its validity , avoiding the issue , or blaming someone for causing the problem .
These blocking tactics are accompanied by unconscious physical responses , such as shallow breathing and closed posture .
Resistance clogs awareness and conceals the desires highlighted by the foreign element .
For example , a powerful minority within the marketing department of a tool manufacturer engages a consultant to do a market survey .
She finds a disturbing trend : A growing number of clients believe that a competitor is producing superior quality products at a lower price .
Middle and upper management vehemently deny the findings and dispute the validity of the survey methods .
But after a series of frank discussions with key clients , upper management accepts the findings .
They develop a vision for propelling the company into a position as the industry leader in product quality and support .
Members in this stage need help opening up , becoming aware , and overcoming the reaction to deny , avoid or blame .
Stage 3 : Chaos
The group enters the unknown .
Relationships shatter :
Old expectations may no longer be valid ; old reactions may cease to be effective ; and old behaviors may not be possible .
The loss of belonging and identity triggers anxiousness and vulnerability .
On occasion , these feelings may set off nervous disorders such as shaking , dizziness , tics , and rashes .
Members may behave uncharacteristically as they revert to childhood survival rules .
For instance , a manufacturing company cancels the development of a major new product , reduces the number of employees , and reorganizes .
Many of the surviving employees lose their ability to concentrate for much of the day .
Desperately seeking new relationships that offer hope , the employees search for different jobs .
Both manufacturing yield and product quality takes a nosedive .
Managers of groups experiencing chaos should plan for group performance to plummet during this stage .
Until the members accept the foreign element , members form only halfhearted relationships with each other .
Chaos is the period of erratic performance that mirrors the search for a beneficial relationship to the foreign element .
All members in this stage need help focusing on their feelings , acknowledging their fear , and using their support systems .
Management needs special help avoiding any attempt to short circuit this stage with magical solutions .
The chaos stage is vital to the transformation process .
Stage 4 : Integration
The members discover a transforming idea that shows how the foreign element can benefit them .
The group becomes excited .
New relationships emerge that offer the opportunity for identity and belonging .
With practice , performance improves rapidly .
For instance , an experienced accounting group must convert to a new computer system .
The group resists the new system fearing it will turn them into novices .
But the members eventually discover that skill with this widely used system increases their value in the marketplace .
Believing that the change may lead to salary increases or better jobs , the members begin a vigorous conversion to the new system .
Awareness of new possibilities enables authorship of new rules that build functional reactions , expectations , and behaviors .
Members may feel euphoric and invincible , as the transforming idea may be so powerful that it becomes a panacea .
Members in this stage need more support than might be first thought .
They can become frustrated when things fail to work perfectly the first time .
Although members feel good , they are also afraid that any transformation might mysteriously evaporate disconnecting them from their new relationships and plunging them back into chaos .
The members need reassurance and help finding new methods for coping with difficulties .
Stage 5 : New Status Quo
If the change is well conceived and assimilated , the group and its environment are in better accord and performance stabilizes at a higher level than in the Late Status Quo .
A healthy group is calm and alert .
Members are centered with more erect posture and deeper breathing .
They feel free to observe and communicate what is really happening .
A sense of accomplishment and possibility permeates the atmosphere .
In this stage , the members continue to need to feel safe so they can practice .
Everyone , manager and members , needs to encourage each other to continue exploring the imbalances between the group and its environment so that there is less resistance to change .
I ’ve observed groups , after many change cycles , become learning organizations ?
they learn how to cope with change .
The members of these organizations are not threatened or anxious about the types of situations that they used to experience as foreign element .
Instead , these situations excite and motivate them .
For example , the customer services group of a computer manufacturer learns to adapt their repair policies and techniques to any new product .
Supporting a new computer system used to scare the group but not anymore .
Management communicates and reinforces the vision of seamless new product support .
Some members influence the design of support features for the new products .
Other members plan and teach training courses .
All members provide feedback to improve the process .
Postscript : Coping With Change
Virginia Satir ’s Change Model describes the change patterns she saw during therapy with families .
In my experience , the patterns she describes occur with any group of people when confronted by change .
I use this model to select how to help a group make a successful transformation from an Old Status Quo to a New Status Quo .
Table 1 summarizes my suggestions on how to help during each stage of the change model :
Stage Description How to Help 1 Late Status Quo Encourage people to seek improvement information and concepts from outside the group .
2 Resistance Help people to open up , become aware , and overcome the reaction to deny , avoid or blame .
3 Chaos Help build a safe environment that enables people to focus on their feelings , acknowledge their fear , and use their support systems .
Help management avoid any attempt to short circuit this stage with magical solutions .
4 Integration Offer reassurance and help finding new methods for coping with difficulties .
5 New Status Quo
Help people feel safe so they can practice .
Table 1 .
Actions for each stage that will help a group change more quickly and effectively .
The actions in Table 1 will help people cope .
Actions that inhibit coping retards an organization ’s ability to make core changes .
These organization are resisting the fundamental foreign element of change .
But organizations that create a safe environment where people are encouraged to cope increase their capacity for change and are much more able to respond effectively to whatever challenges are thrown their way .

The future of war began with an act of faith .
In 1991 , Navy captain Arthur Cebrowski met John Garstka , a captain in the Air Force , at a McLean , Virginia , Bible - study class .
The two quickly discovered they shared more than just their conservative Catholic beliefs .
They both had an interest in military strategy .
And they were both geeks : Cebrowski — who'd been a math major in college , a fighter pilot in Vietnam , and an aircraft carrier commander during Desert Storm — was fascinated with how information technologies could make fighter jocks more lethal .
Garstka — a Stanford - trained engineer — worked on improving algorithms used to track missiles .
Over the next several years , the two men traded ideas and compared experiences .
They visited businesses embracing the information revolution , ultimately becoming convinced that the changes sweeping the corporate world had applications for the military as well .
The Defense Department was n't blind to the power of networks , of course — the Internet began as a military project , after all , and each branch of the armed services had ongoing " digitization " programs .
But no one had ever crystallized what the information age might offer the Pentagon quite like Cebrowski and Garstka did .
In an article for the January 1998 issue of the naval journal Proceedings , " Network - Centric Warfare : Its Origin and Future , " they not only named the philosophy but laid out a new direction for how the US would think about war .
Their model was Wal - Mart .
Here was a sprawling , bureaucratic monster of an organization — sound familiar ? — that still managed to automatically order a new lightbulb every time it sold one .
Warehouses were networked , but so were individual cash registers .
So were the guys who sold Wal - Mart the bulbs .
If that company could wire everyone together and become more efficient , then US forces could , too .
" Nations make war the same way they make wealth , " Cebrowski and Garstka wrote .
Computer networks and the efficient flow of information would turn America 's chain saw of a war machine into a scalpel .
The US military could use battlefield sensors to swiftly identify targets and bomb them .
Tens of thousands of warfighters would act as a single , self - aware , coordinated organism .
Better communications would let troops act swiftly and with accurate intelligence , skirting creaky hierarchies .
It 'd be " a revolution in military affairs unlike any seen since the Napoleonic Age , " they wrote .
And it would n't take hundreds of thousands of troops to get a job done — that kind of " massing of forces " would be replaced by information management .
" For nearly 200 years , the tools and tactics of how we fight have evolved , " the pair wrote .
" Now , fundamental changes are affecting the very character of war . "
Network - centric wars would be more moral , too .
Cebrowski later argued that network - enabled armies kill more of the right people quicker .
With fewer civilian casualties , warfare would be more ethical .
And as a result , the US could use military might to create free societies without being accused of imperialist arrogance .
It had a certain geek appeal , to which Wired was not immune .
Futurist Alvin Toffler talked up similar ideas — before they even had a name — in the magazine 's fifth issue , in 1993 .
And during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , my colleague Joshua Davis welcomed in a " new age of fighting that combined precision weapons , unprecedented surveillance of the enemy , agile ground forces , and — above all — a real - time communications network that kept the far - flung operation connected minute by minute . "
As a presidential candidate in 1999 , George W. Bush embraced the philosophy , as did his eventual choice for defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
At the Pentagon , Rumsfeld instituted a massive program to " transform " the armed services .
Cebrowski was installed as the head of the newly created Office of Force Transformation .
When the US went to war in Afghanistan , and then in Iraq , its forces achieved apparent victory with lightning speed .
Analysts inside and outside the Pentagon credited the network - centric approach for that success .
" The successful campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq took far fewer troops and were executed quicker , " Rumsfeld proclaimed , because of " advanced technology and skills . "
The Army committed more than $ 230 billion to a network - centric makeover , on top of the billions the military had already spent on surveillance , drone aircraft , spy satellites , and thousands of GPS transceivers .
General Tommy Franks , leader of both invasions , was even more effusive than Rumsfeld .
All the new tech , he wrote in his 2004 memoir , American Soldier , promised " today 's commanders the kind of Olympian perspective that Homer had given his gods . "
And yet , here we are .
The American military is still mired in Iraq .
It 's still stuck in Afghanistan , battling a resurgent Taliban .
Rumsfeld has been forced out of the Pentagon .
Dan Halutz , the Israeli Defense Forces chief of general staff and net - centric advocate who led the largely unsuccessful war in Lebanon in 2006 , has been fired , too .
In the past six years , the world 's most technologically sophisticated militaries have gone up against three seemingly primitive foes — and have n't won once .
How could this be ?
The network - centric approach had worked pretty much as advertised .
Even the theory 's many critics admit net - centric combat helped make an already imposing American military even more effective at locating and killing its foes .
The regimes of Saddam Hussein and Mullah Omar were broken almost instantly .
But network - centric warfare , with its emphasis on fewer , faster - moving troops , turned out to be just about the last thing the US military needed when it came time to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan .
A small , wired force leaves generals with too few nodes on the military network to secure the peace .
There are n't enough troops to go out and find informants , build barricades , rebuild a sewage treatment plant , and patrol a marketplace .
For the first three years of the Iraq insurgency , American troops largely retreated to their fortified bases , pushed out woefully undertrained local units to do the fighting , and watched the results on feeds from spy drones flying overhead .
Retired major general Robert Scales summed up the problem to Congress by way of a complaint from one division commander : " If I know where the enemy is , I can kill it .
My problem is I can't connect with the local population . "
How could he ?
For far too many units , the war had been turned into a telecommute .
Afghanistan , Iraq , and Lebanon were the first conflicts planned , launched , and executed with networked technologies and a networked ideology .
They were supposed to be the wars of the future .
And the future lost .
Inside the Pentagon , the term network - centric warfare is out of fashion , yet countless generals and admirals still adhere to its core principles .
On the streets of Iraq , though , troops are learning to grapple with the guerrilla threat .
And that means fighting in a way that could n't be more different from the one Donald Rumsfeld embraced .
The failures of wired combat are forcing troops to improvise a new , socially networked kind of war .
Tarmiyah , located about 20 miles north of Baghdad , is an ugly town — traced with rivulets of sewage , patrolled by stray dogs , and strewn with rubble and garbage .
Insurgents fleeing US military crackdowns in Baghdad and , farther north , in Baqubah , have flooded the city .
The local police quit en masse almost a year ago , leaving the security of Tarmiyah 's 50,000 residents to 150 men from the US Army 's Fourth Battalion , Ninth Infantry Regiment — known since an early - 1900s tour of duty in China as the Manchus .
Typically , soldiers spend hours of every day at war just trying to figure out where their comrades are , and how to maneuver together .
But hand out GPS receivers and put everyone 's signals on a map , and those tasks become a whole lot simpler .
Luckily for the Manchus , the 4/9 is arguably the most wired unit in the Army .
Select troops wear an experimental electronics package , including a helmet - mounted monocle that displays a digital map of Tarmiyah with icons for each of their vehicles and troops .
The unit 's commander , William Prior , rides an upgraded Stryker armored vehicle that shows the same info on one of many screens .
It 's packed with battle command stations , advanced radios , remote - controlled weapons turrets , and satellite network terminals .
No commander at his level has ever been able to see so many of his men so easily .
" It increases the unit 's combat power , no question , " Prior says .
Trim and dark - eyed , the lieutenant colonel knows his tech .
He has a master 's in physics and taught science at West Point in the late 1990s .
During the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , only a fraction of the Humvees , tanks , and helicopters invading the country were equipped with these kind of readouts on the position of other US vehicles .
Still , enough had them to allow the troops pushing to Baghdad to execute perilous maneuvers , like sending one unit through another 's kill zone — a move made even more hair - raising by dust storms that turned the air opaque .
Today , every three - man team in the Manchus is an icon on every other team 's monocles .
Network - centric doctrine says that these plugged - in soldiers should be able to cover a bigger swath of the battlefield and take on more enemies .
And , yes , the gear does let them clear neighborhoods more efficiently and respond to enemy attacks more quickly .
But a handful of soldiers still can't secure a town of more than 50,000 .
Half a dozen Manchus have been killed or wounded by snipers during their five months in Tarmiyah .
Prior has handed out 25 Purple Hearts to the 150 - man Comanche Company guarding Tarmiyah .
It 's even worse outside town , where the equally small Blowtorch Company was trying to keep the peace in an area three times the size of Manhattan , until the higher - ups ordered the company onto other missions .
" A well - informed but geographically dispersed force , " Garstka and Cebrowski wrote in 1998 , should be able to triumph over any foe , regardless of " mission , force size and composition , and geography . "
But neither Cebrowski nor Garstka was thinking about the kind of combat where foes blend into the populace and seed any stretch of road with bombs .
Lawless towns like this can be pacified only by flooding them with troops — collecting tips and knocking heads .
That 's what Prior needs , not more gadgets .
" They 're just tools , " he says in his flat Iowa accent .
But Prior has just caught a break : Another several hundred soldiers , Special Forces operators , and Iraqi troops have descended on the city to kick in doors , drop bombs on extremist hideouts , and drive out the insurgents .
Those men will leave eventually , though , and to sustain the gains they make , Prior is supposed to recruit civilians into a kind of neighborhood watch .
The idea is to have as many eyes and ears on the streets , around the shops , and in the mosques as possible .
In counterinsurgency , it 's better to have a lot of nodes in your network , connecting to the population , than just a few .
In fact , that 's a key tenet of the new US strategy in Iraq — hiring watchmen who 've come to be known in other towns as " alligators " for their light - blue Izod shirts .
Prior has n't had much luck in getting folks in Tarmiyah to sign up ; even his own soldiers are reluctant to go out in the daytime .
But the extra boots on the ground have given Prior some space .
If he can recruit a few alligators in a hurry , the extremists will be less likely to come back .
So he has started spending quality time drinking chai with local leaders instead of fighting a shooting war .
We walk into the home of Tarmiyah 's former mayor , sheikh Sayeed Jassem .
Everyone in town agrees he'd be the guy to help sign up alligators .
One problem : Jassem is in jail on charges of embezzlement and funneling money to the insurgency .
The Iraqi government is in no mood to let him out .
That makes the several dozen tribal leaders sitting in Jassem 's 40 - foot - long , lavishly carpeted living room extremely grouchy .
" Sayeed , he knows every sheikh , he knows all the children .
The first step is releasing him .
Then we can arrange security , " says burly , balding , gravel - voiced Abu Ibrahim .
Next to him , in a white headdress and wearing a pencil - thin mustache , Jassem 's cousin Abu Abbas nods .
" I could n't make a decision until he 's free . "
Prior blinks .
Abbas went to Jassem 's jail cell the day before yesterday and got the sheikh 's blessing to proceed .
" But you saw him yesterday , with your own eyes , did you not ? " he asks .
Abbas starts saying something about his uncles .
Prior turns to Ibrahim .
" Yesterday , you said you 'd have 100 men .
All I 'm asking for is 30 .
Five men , in eight - hour shifts , to guard the sheikh 's home , and to guard the Tarmiyah gate " — the main entrance to the town .
The meeting has been going on for two hours .
That 's typical .
But after a few of these , Prior has finally learned that such gatherings are as much about performance as ticking off agenda items .
He booms out in a Broadway - loud voice : " Are there 30 strong men in Tarmiyah who can do this ? "
OK , OK , everyone answers , of course there are , do n't get so excited .
They spend the next few hours drinking cup after cup of chai , hammering out exactly what the recruiting announcement will say , whether these guardians will have badges , how they 'll be vetted .
Finally , they agree that 30 men will meet back at the house tomorrow morning .
Prior 's soldiers print up 50 makeshift applications — better to have a few extra , just in case .
The next day , we go back to Jassem 's house .
More than 500 men are braving the heat , waiting in front to sign up as alligators .
A week later , that number swells to more than 1,400 .
In the month since , Prior has downed a lot more chai .
But he has n't had to award a single Purple Heart .
Outside of Fallujah , on a sprawling US military base , there 's an old barracks supposedly built for Uday Hussein 's personal shock troops .
Down at the dimly lit end of one hallway is a tiled bathroom that 's been converted into a tiny office .
Inside , three screens sit on a desk , displaying a set of digital maps showing a God 's - eye view of the entire country .
Every American tank and truck is marked with blue icons .
Every recent insurgent attack is marked in red .
There are more than 1,100 units like this one across the country , and the site of every major US military center in Iraq is connected to the same system .
The brass calls these futuristic command posts ... well , it calls them command posts of the future , or CPOF .
( Grunts call them the command posts of the right now — C - PORN . )
This is network - centric warfare , translated from journal theory to war - zone reality .
Fallujah is n't more than 10 miles away , but staring at those three screens feels like observing Iraq from another continent — maybe another planet .
Outside , it 's ant - under - a- magnifying - glass hot .
In here I have to pull my arms inside my T - shirt , the thermostat is turned so low .
Across the city , marines do their best to predict the insurgents ' next moves .
But in front of the command post , we have so much information at our fingertips it makes Prior 's tech look like a beta - test version of Missile Command .
" There 's a sea of information here .
All you have to learn to do is fish in it , " says Jim Kanzenbach , a tan , goateed Army contractor and trainer with a southern - accented baritone .
Kanzenbach taps the mouse a few times .
Red diamonds representing all of the insurgent sigacts ( military - speak for " significant activities " ) array themselves into a timeline .
He sorts it by day of the week , then by hour of the day .
White space appears during a particular hour ; there do n't seem to be any sigacts then .
" If I was going to run a convoy , that would be the better time . "
He clicks again , and the middle screen switches to a 3 - D map of an Iraqi town from a driver 's point of view .
Kanzenbach smiles , and his mile - a- minute Texas patter goes hypersonic .
" Now let 's plan the route .
You 've got a mosque here .
An IED happened over there two weeks ago .
Here 's the one that happened yesterday .
Hey , that 's too close .
Let 's change my route .
Change the whole damn thing . "
He guides me through capability after capability of the command post — all kinds of charts , overlays , and animations .
" But wait — there 's more , " he says .
" You wanna see where all the Internet cafés are in Baghdad ? "
It 's hard not to get caught up in Kanzenbach 's enthusiasm .
But back in the US , John Nagl , one of the authors of the Army 's new counterinsurgency manual , is n't impressed .
He 's a lieutenant colonel and an Iraq vet , an Army batallion commander at Fort Riley in Kansas .
He 's also the author of several influential articles and books about counterinsurgency , including Learning to Eat Soup With a Knife , an analysis of Vietnam and Malaya .
When I ask him about CPOF , he 's more interested in what the screens do n't show .
Historical sigacts do n't actually tell you where the next one 's going to be .
Or who 's going to do it .
Or who 's joining them .
Or why .
" The police captain playing both sides , the sheikh skimming money from a construction project , " Nagl asks , " what color are they ? "
CPOF was designed for planning short , decisive battles against another regular army — the Soviets , the Chinese , Saddam 's Republican Guard , whoever — as long as they had tanks to destroy , territory to seize , and leaders to kill .
The counterinsurgency game has completely different rules .
The goal here is to stabilize a government , not bring it down ; to persuade people to cooperate , not bludgeon them into submission .
In fact , many of these kinetic bombs - and - bullets activities can actually undermine a counterinsurgency , creating more enemies than they kill .
" Some of the best weapons for counterinsurgency do not shoot , " Nagl 's counterinsurgency manual says .
Instead , it advises troops to get to know the locals — both individually and as groups — and gain their trust .
The locals generally know which of their neighbors are insurgents and which are n't ; they 're already plugged into the communal network .
" Arguably , " the manual says , " the decisive battle is for the people 's minds . "
Cebrowski and Garstka wrote about a different kind of power , one that came when connected troops started to share information in ways that circumvented , and bypassed , the Industrial Age military chain of command .
But that helps only if troops can connect in the first place .
It can take up to a week for them to wrangle their laptops into updating the biometric databases that track who gets in and out of Fallujah .
Intelligence reports can take even longer .
The people best equipped to win the battle for people 's minds — US troops on the ground , local policemen , Iraqi Army officers , tribal leaders — are left out of CPOF 's network .
It 's a bandwidth hog , and the soldiers and marines fighting these counterinsurgencies are n't exactly carrying around T3 lines .
Only recently did infantrymen like the ones in Fallujah even get their own radios .
The Pentagon 's sluggish structure for buying new gear means it can take up to a decade to get soldiers equipped .
( Though to be fair , CPOF was purchased and deployed years ahead of schedule . )
In Fallujah , the marines of Fox Company , based in an abandoned train station , mostly use their CPOF terminal to generate local maps , which they export to PowerPoint .
Their buddies in Fox Company 's first platoon , working out of a police precinct , have it even worse .
When they want to get online , they have to drive to the station .
As for Iraqi access , while CPOF technically is n't classified , all of the data on it is .
Locals can't see the information or update any of those databases with their own intelligence .
A key tenet of network theory is that a network 's power grows with every new node .
But that 's only if every node gets as good as it gives .
In Iraq , the most important nodes in this fight are all but cut off .
Meanwhile , insurgent forces cherry - pick the best US tech : disposable email addresses , anonymous Internet accounts , the latest radios .
They do everything online : recruiting , fundraising , trading bomb - building tips , spreading propaganda , even selling T - shirts .
And every American - financed move to reinforce Iraq 's civilian infrastructure only makes it easier for the insurgents to operate .
Every new Internet café is a center for insurgent operations .
Every new cell tower means a hundred new nodes on the insurgent network .
And , of course , the insurgents know the language and understand the local culture .
Which means they plug into Iraq 's larger social web more easily than an American ever could .
As John Abizaid , Franks ' successor at Central Command , told a conference earlier this year , " This enemy is better networked than we are . "
The insurgent groups are also exploiting something that US network - centric gurus seem to have missed :
All of us are already connected to a global media grid .
Satellite television , radio , and the Internet mean that many of the most spectacular attacks in Iraq are deliberately staged for the cameras , uploaded to YouTube , picked up by CNN , and broadcast around the world .
American forces have been trying to solve the insurgent puzzle in Fallujah since 2003 .
Massive battles devastated the town , damaging more than half the homes there and driving out 90 percent of the populace .
The insurgents kept coming back .
But in the past year , things have shifted .
Today , Fallujah is calm :
Shops are open , kids are in school , men are smoking their cigarettes and holding hands in outdoor cafs .
" The people just decided they could n't take al Qaeda anymore , " says George Benson , executive officer of the marines ' Second Battalion , Sixth Marine Regiment , Regimental Combat Team Six , which is responsible for the town .
Benson believes that a beefy , blue - eyed kid raised in the Cleveland suburbs is a big part of the reason Fallujah has gone so quiet .
His name is Joe Colabuno , and he's a sergeant who works in psychological operations — psyops , in military - speak .
His job is to win the hearts - and - minds battle , and his tools are almost comically simple : posters drawn in Photoshop , loudspeaker and radio broadcasts pasted together with SonicStage and saved to MiniDiscs , the occasional newspaper article , and , above all , his own big mouth .
Arab culture lives by its oral traditions ; talk is often the most important weapon .
" I find the right people to shape , and they shape the rest , " Colabuno says .
Just as in Tarmiyah , troops in Fallujah are looking to recruit locals to keep tabs on their neighborhoods .
Yesterday , on the west side of town , an alligator helped catch one of the Americans ' top insurgent targets in Fallujah .
After seeing a photograph , the watchman ID'd the guy as a neighbor , living just a few houses down the street .
But an alligator - recruiting drive yesterday in the Askeri district , in the northeastern corner of town , did n't go so well .
The marines got less than half of the 125 they were looking for .
So Colabuno hops into a Humvee to find out why .
We pull up to a narrow , unpaved street alongside the Askeri recruiting station .
A group of seven men sit on the gravel , beneath a set of drying sheets .
In the middle of the crowd , leaning on a cane , fingering prayer beads and dressed in white , is a rotund , bearded man .
He 's clearly the ringleader .
Colabuno and his wire - thin interpreter , Leo , approach him .
In every other district , they 've recruited plenty of alligators .
" Why not in Askeri ? " Colabuno asks the ringleader .
The money 's not good enough , he answers .
An alligator makes only $ 50 a month ; day laborers get $ 8 a day — when there 's work , that is .
" That 's the weakest argument ever , " Colabuno says .
The men looked stunned ; Americans do n't normally speak this directly — they 're usually deferential to the point of looking weak , or just condescending .
" Do you remember Sheikh Hamsa ? " Colabuno asks .
Sure , sure , the men nod .
The popular imam was killed more than a year ago by insurgents , but they 're a bit surprised that Colabuno knows who he is .
Most of the US troops here have been in town for just a few months .
" Well , Sheikh Hamsa told me that weak faith protects only so much . ' "
The ringleader stares down at the ground and fingers his beads .
Colabuno has hit a nerve .
" You know , I looked in the Koran .
I did n't see anything about Mohammed demanding a better salary before he'd do God 's work , " Colabuno says , jamming his forefinger into his palm .
A skinny man at the back of the pack speaks up , telling Colabuno that the Americans are just here to take Iraq 's oil .
" Yeah , you 're right .
We want your oil , " Colabuno answers .
Again eyes grow big with surprise .
" We want to buy it .
So you can pay for jobs , for water , for electricity .
Make you rich . "
The men chuckle .
Everyone shakes hands .
Askeri's alligator quota is filled by the next morning .
Colabuno joined the Army because , frankly , it sounded better than his other option : managing a local steakhouse .
When his recruiter told him about psyops , Colabuno loved the idea .
It sounded like something out of The X - Files .
" Does the job involve LSD ? " he jokingly asked .
It did not .
Instead , Colabuno has spent the better part of four years , and all of the past 17 months , getting comfortable with the residents of Fallujah .
And now that he has cracked Fallujah 's cultural code , the brass is reluctant to let him leave .
We head back to the base .
Colabuno 's office looks like a dorm room , with mountain bikes hanging on the wall next to posters of Kristin Chenoweth , Vida Guerra , the Denver Broncos cheerleaders , and Corona beer .
" Theme of the week , " reads a white board , " terrorism causes CANCER ... and impotence . "
Colabuno 's early efforts to persuade the population were just as subtle .
He shows me a collection of his early posters , tabloid - sized pages laid on a table .
Against a flaming background , a terrorist holds a child .
The text asks why the parents of Fallujah would let insurgents harm their kids .
Wrong move .
This is a culture based on shame and honor ; now you 've just called the parents inadequate .
Plus , the piece is just too on the nose , too blatant .
The best propaganda is sneaky .
So Colabuno started spoofing the insurgents ' posters instead .
He put a logo similar to that of the terrorist Islamic Army at the top of a simple black - and - white sheet .
" A young boy died while wearing a suicide vest given to him by criminals , " one flyer read .
" You should remember that whoever makes lies about Allah should reserve his seat in hell . "
The extremists went nuts — screaming at shopkeepers and locals who posted the flyers , blaming other insurgents for defaming their good names .
All the while , Americans watched the action through high - powered surveillance cameras .
Consequently the marines knew who to question , and who to capture or kill .
" We know where you are and what you are doing , " another poster proclaimed .
" Who will you trust now ? "
American forces here set up a tip line so the locals could report on any insurgents ( and get a little reward for their efforts ) .
The extremists responded by blowing up the local cell towers , which Colabuno then turned into another psyops poster criticizing their self - destructive behavior .
" Now we 've got them making really stupid decisions , " he says , grinning .
" They communicate by cell phone , too .
They can't argue that they 're just attacking the foreigners . "
General David Petraeus knows all about these mind games .
The man in charge of the American military effort in Iraq helped turn soldiers ' training from tank - on - tank battles to taking on insurgents .
He oversaw the writing of the new counterinsurgency manual that John Nagl worked on .
The book counsels officers to reinforce the local economy and politics and build knowledge of the native culture , " an operational code ' that is valid for an entire group of people . "
And the manual blasts the old , network - centric American approach in Iraq .
" If military forces remain in their compounds , they lose touch with the people , appear to be running scared , and cede the initiative to the insurgents , " it says .
So I get escorted across Baghdad 's concrete - ringed International Zone , around the manicured lawns of the Republican Palace , up its marbled stairs , past ambassadors and generals , through a seemingly endless series of gates and checkpoints , and into Petraeus ' office .
But even this far inside the US war machine , I 'm expecting a frontal assault on network - centric warfare .
Instead , he sings me a love song .
" It 's definitely here to stay .
It 's just going to keep getting greater and greater and greater , " Petraeus says .
I settle on a couch , and he shuts off the air conditioner .
" I was a skeptic of network - centric warfare for years , " he confesses .
But thanks to years of wartime funding , he says , the military now has the ability " to transmit data , full - motion video , still photos , images , information .
So you can more effectively determine who the enemy is , find them and kill or capture , and have a sense of what 's going on in the area as you do it — where the friendlies are , and which platform you want to bring to bear . "
Of course , he adds , he does n't believe the Rumsfeld - era idea that you can get away with fewer , better - networked troops .
Petraeus is the man behind the " surge , " after all .
Anyone who thinks you do n't need massing of troops is living in an " academic world , " he says .
And Petraeus believes " the most important network is still the one that is between the ears of commanders and staff officers . "
Yet he 's a believer , just like a whole lot of other Army generals .
He supports the $ 230 billion plan to wire the Army , a gargantuan commitment to network - centric war .
" We realized very quickly you could do incredible stuff with this , " he says .
" It was revolutionary .
It was . "
I press my hands to my forehead .
What about all the cultural understanding , I ask him .
What about nation - building ?
What about your counterinsurgency manual ?
" Well , " Petraeus says , " it does n't say that the best weapons do n't shoot .
It says sometimes the best weapons do n't shoot .
Sometimes the best weapons do shoot . "
A war like Iraq is a mix , he adds :
In one part of the country , the military is reinforcing the society , building things ; in another , it 's breaking them — waging " major combat operations " that are n't all that different from what might have gone down in 2003 .
And this technology , he says , it 's pretty good at 2003 - style war .
When Cebrowski and Garstka wrote about adding information technology to the military 's way of finding and wiping out enemies — the kill chain — to a certain extent , they were right .
In 1991 , Operation Desert Storm began with a long bombing campaign , then a ground assault .
But in Afghanistan and the 2003 Iraq war , soldiers on the ground handed off coordinates to bombers and fighter planes , who attacked with laser - and satellite - guided munitions .
The effect was devastating , shrinking the so - called sensor - to - shooter cycle to mere instants .
During the first Gulf War , it typically took three days of paper pushing to assign a plane a target to hit .
This time around , in parts of Anbar province , it took under 10 minutes .
A relatively small number of Special Forces , sent to neuter Scud missile sites , took control of an area about the size of South Carolina — despite being outnumbered on the ground at least 10 to 1 , and in some spots 500 to 1 .
The Iraqis never got off a single Scud .
But for all that , Cebrowski and Garstka were n't really writing about network - centric warfare at all .
They were writing about a single , network - enabled process : killing .
In 1998 , to a former fighter jock and missile defender , the two things must have seemed the same .
A decade later , it 's pretty clear they are n't — not with American troops nation - building in Afghanistan , peacekeeping in Kosovo , chasing pirates off Djibouti , delivering disaster relief to Indonesia , and fighting insurgents in Iraq .
The fact is , today we rely on our troops to perform all sort of missions that are only loosely connected with traditional combat but are vital to maintaining world security .
And it's all happening while the military is becoming less and less likely to exercise its traditional duties of fighting an old - fashioned war .
When is that going to happen again ?
What potential enemy of the US is going to bother amassing , Saddam - style , army tanks and tens of thousands of troops when the insurgent approach obviously works so well ?
" The real problem with network - centric warfare is that it helps us only destroy .
But in the 21st century , that 's just a sliver of what we 're trying to do , " Nagl says .
" It solves a problem I do n't have — fighting some conventional enemy — and helps only a little with a problem I do have : how to build a society in the face of technology - enabled , super - empowered individuals . "
Admiral Arthur Cebrowski died of cancer in 2005 .
The Office of Force Transformation he headed has been disbanded .
John Garstka is still at the Defense Department , working in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Forces Transformation and Resources .
It reports to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities , which in turn reports to the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense ( Policy ) .
I ask Garstka if he 'd like to meet up .
" Sure , " he answers .
" The Ritz - Carlton does a nice lunch . "
In the Ritz 's oak - paneled dining room a few minutes ' walk from the Pentagon , Garstka sits with his arms folded across his white button - down shirt and his Defense Department badge .
He 's not exactly pleased with his new position — the length of his office 's name is perhaps inversely proportional to its influence .
" I have to be a good soldier , " he sighs .
But he takes comfort in knowing that network - centric warfare is " past the point of no return . "
It 's been " demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt " — not just in traditional battles , like the invasion of Iraq , but also during so - called stability operations , like the four - plus years since " mission accomplished . "
( He says he'd like to go to Iraq one day to see it all for himself . )
If network - centric warfare has flaws , he adds , do n't blame the concept .
The slow - moving Defense Department bureaucracy has n't worked quickly enough to roll out wired gear for the troops .
Insurgents seized on commercial technology quicker than anticipated .
And anyway , Garstka says , people have hijacked the term network - centric warfare to mean all sorts of things , from investing in fiber optics to rejiggering an organizational chart , without really understanding what it means .
But by the time Garstka finishes his 8 - ounce Angus cheeseburger , he 's willing to acknowledge some of the potential gaps in the strategy .
" I 'm not an expert in stability operations , " he admits .
Maybe network - centric combat is n't perfectly suited to the wars we 're fighting now .
And it certainly requires a different skill set than counterinsurgency or nation - building .
" Stability operations is like soccer .
Major combat operations is like football .
So it 's almost impossible [ for one team ] to win both the World Cup and the Super Bowl in the same year , " he tells me .
" Not when you 're playing two different games . "
Finally , at the end of our meal , Garstka suggests that the model he helped create will have to change again .
" You have to think differently about people , " he says .
" You have your social networks and technological networks .
You need to have both . "
So the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are updating the playbook .
Technological networks like Wal - Mart 's are out .
The social network warfare of Nagl , Prior , and Colabuno is in .
The Army has set aside $ 41 million to build what it calls Human Terrain Teams : 150 social scientists , software geeks , and experts on local culture , split up and embedded with 26 different military units in Iraq and Afghanistan over the next year .
The first six HTTs are already on the ground .
The idea , basically , is to give each commander a set of cultural counselors , the way he has soldiers giving him combat advice .
In western Afghanistan , for instance , a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division was being targeted by rockets , over and over , from the vicinity of a nearby village .
But no one from the unit had bothered to ask the townspeople why .
When the Human Terrain Team finally paid a visit , villagers complained that the Taliban was around only because the Americans did n't provide security .
And oh , by the way , they really wanted a volleyball net , too .
So a net was acquired .
Patrols were started .
There has n't been an attack in two months .
At the HTT 's suggestions , the brigade also invited the province 's head mullah to bless a newly restored mosque on the base .
He " was so delighted that he recorded an announcement in Pashto and Dari for radio broadcast denouncing the Taliban , " an after - action report noted .
In his initial evaluation , the brigade commander credits the HTT with an astonishing 60 to 70 percent drop in the number of bombs - and - bullets strikes he has had to make .
It 's a number that even some HTT members have a hard time believing .
But the commander insists that 53 of 83 districts in his area now support the local government .
Before the HTT arrived , it was only 19 .
" We got trapped into thinking that killing / destruction mechanisms of the highest technical quality could replace true human understanding .
The vote is in , and we were wrong , " says Steve Fondacaro , a cleft - chinned , chipped - toothed former Special Forces operator who now heads the HTT program .
" We had been trying to take the test without doing the course work .
That never works in school , and it has n't worked any better in war . "
The program is still new , and many questions remain about how it 'll actually operate .
Will the social scientists — many of them civilian academics — carry guns ?
Wear uniforms ?
Will they be conducting fieldwork or just doing research at their desks ?
How will these people be trained ?
What kind of credentials do they need ?
Will commanders listen to what they have to say ?
And is it even ethical to use their skills in wartime ?
One thing is clear : The Human Terrain Teams will eventually do more than just advise .
Soon each team will get a server , a half - dozen laptops , a satellite dish , and software for social - network analysis — to diagram how all of the important players in an area are connected .
Digital timelines will mark key cultural and political events .
Mapmaking programs will plot out the economic , ethnic , and tribal landscape , just like the command post of the future maps the physical terrain .
But those HTT diagrams can never be more than approximations , converting messy analog narratives to binary facts .
Warfare will continue to center around networks .
But some networks will be social , linking not computers and drones and Humvees but tribes , sects , political parties , even entire cultures .
In the end , everything else is just data .

日々色々考えることがあったのでちょっとまとめることにしました.
この記事に対する返事はこちらにあります。合わせてご覧いただければ幸いです。
はじめに ここで言 う 「 理系の女の子」は理系を専攻している高校生・大学生をさします。特に国立大学の理系に通う女子大生を指します。
「 普通の女の子」は短大および四年制大学の文系の女の子を指します。髪をくるくる巻いて、化粧もばっちり☆ディズニーランド大好きな一般的な女の子を指します。女性誌でいうなればJJ・CanCamおよびWith・Moreと言ったところでしょうか。世間一般にもてはやされる女の子のタイプです。
以下のことについてはすべての人に当てはまるものではないし、正しいとは思いません。
私は議論が大好きなので、大いに叩いてください。全然しらないひとだからといって臆する必要はないです。
現在理系の女の子・理系の女の子だったはもちろん、男の子視点からの意見も大歓迎。 といいますか。
これを読んだ理系の男の子どう思うんだろう。と純粋に興味があるよん。
今かなり眠いので適当な文でしょう。後で推敲します。
経緯 Twitterの知り合いの何人かが以下のブログについて話題にしていた。
恋焦がれる理想の男性・ギークに近づくため、PHPをお勉強してギークな女を目指すブログ
http://lovecall.14.dtiblog.com/
Twitterで反応する男性の方々、このブログに丁寧にコメントをつける人、興味津々な雰囲気をみてゆくなかで「でもなんでこんなに人気なんだろ」と思ったのがきっかけ。
私は中２ぐらいからHTMLを初め、そのうちPHPをさわり初め、それらしいことを日記で書いたりしていますがこんなに丁寧にかかれたコメントをもらったことがない。これをみて「自分魅力ないからコメントこないよな」としょげた一方、「ていうかこんな風にレスされたら寒気がする」などと考えたりもしました。
理系の女の子はプライドが高い 何で寒気がするんでしょうか。 それは初歩的なことをわざわざ他人に教えられるのが嫌だから。嫌というか単純になれていない。もっと端的に言えばプライドが高いのです。
四年制旧帝大国立大学にいくレベルの学力があれば小学校・中学校と進む中でクラス・学年の成績の1番・2番キープは当たり前のはず。ものごころもついて、自分の見た目にもこだわりはじめる、もっとも女の子らしく生きるべき小学校・中学校の時期、まわりの男の子よりも出来がよいと何が悪いか。
「 男の子に頼れなくなる」のです 。
理科の実験でもぽよよんと見ているだけの女の子、「○○くんすごーい」と言って男の子を立てる女の子、数学がとけなくて隣の男の子に教えてもらうかわいい女の子、かなり理想的です。でも、自分のほうができるじゃんと思ってしまうと「自分でやったほうが早い」とおもいはじめます。
経年するごとにそれはだんだん「自分で全部やらなきゃ」に変わります。
しまいに大学生になるころには「自分で何でもやってきたから何でもできるはず」に立場が変わってきます。
理系の女の子は議論も好き いろいろな知識・話を知っていると何が本当で何が間違いなのかが分かったりします。そんな時気になることがあると、他の人とあーでもない、こーでもないといった議論をするのが好きです。
とどのつまり 女の社会で生きることは諦めた。でも男ではない。
どこにいても何となく 「宙ぶらりんの私」を抱えながら生きてる。理系の女の子は。
でも好きなんだよねえ。理系の学問が。そうでもなきゃこんなに辛くて「普通じゃない」とかいわれたり散々嫌な思いしなくてすむようにするさ！
あなたの回りにちょっと空回りしてる理系の女の子がいても、大目に見てください。

Thanks for visiting !
For three years I 've had a single goal directing my actions : I wanted to get out of debt .
Now that my consumer debt is nearly gone , I 've spent a lot of time wondering what to do next .
I was worried that I 'd lose focus , lose direction .
That 's not going to be the case .
I 've set three major financial goals for 2008 .
After I pay off the last of my final loan next Tuesday , I intend to :
Max out my retirement plan for 2007 and 2008 .
Pay taxes .
Bolster my savings .
These goals are ambitious , but I think I can achieve them .
In fact , I hope to do even more .
Retirement
I got a late start on my retirement savings .
The box company has been setting aside a pension for me , but I only began my self - directed retirement savings last year .
I managed to make the full contribution to my 2006 Roth IRA .
I 've contributed $ 2,000 so far this year , and intend to max out my plan by the middle of December .
In 2008 , the contribution limits on Roth IRAs increase to $ 5,000 / year — I hope to invest this amount .
It was n't until I started writing Get Rich Slowly that I understood the value of saving for retirement .
I 'm now convinced that it 's the most important financial move a person can make .
Even if you screw up every thing else , if you make regular retirement contributions , you 'll have a safety net at the end of your life .
Taxes
Last spring , my accountant asked me how much I expected to make from Get Rich Slowly in 2007 .
“ I do n't know , ” I said .
“ Maybe $ 2000 a month . ”
It was a pipe dream , and I knew it .
The site was only generating $ 1000 a month .
“ Fine , ” he said .
“ We 'll set up estimated tax payments .
Every quarter you 'll mail $ 1790 to the IRS , and $ 320 to the Oregon Department of Revenue . ”
I figured that I 'd be overpaying , which would mean I 'd get a nice tax refund .
To my surprise , however , I 've earned twice as much as I had hoped .
This is a nice problem to have , but it also means that I 've badly underestimated my tax obligation .
I need to come up with about $ 8,000 by April 15th !
Saving
I 'm a natural worrier .
My upcoming transition to “ professional blogger ” gives me plenty of things to worry about .
I 'm making enough to support myself now , but what if my readership declines ?
What if I lose the muse ?
To cope with possible problems , I want to build an emergency fund — an enormous emergency fund .
In my dream world , I 'd save $ 20,000 by next winter .
Unless my readership doubles overnight , that 's not going to happen .
I 'll keep that figure as an eventual target , but I 'll be happy to have saved $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 by the end of 2008 .
Other goals
These are n't my only financial goals , of course .
I still dream of buying a MINI Cooper — but I 'm going to save for it .
I also want to do some work on the house — paint the exterior , upgrade the electrical system — and to buy a Stickley chair .
I 'll regularly set aside small sums of money for each of these things .
Goals are crucial .
They facilitate smart choices .
When you know that you 're saving for a down payment on a house , it becomes easier to forego a new pair of shoes or the Justin Timberlake concert .
It 's amazing the creative ways you can find to save money when you want to buy a new car .
And when you finally make the decision to get out of debt , it no longer seems a hardship to shop at thrift stores or to cook at home .
You come to recognize these things as a means to an end .
As we approach the new year , set some financial goals .
Set a short - term goal , a medium - term goal , and a long - term goal .
Make your goals specific , measurable , attainable , realistic , and timed .
If you do this , and if you keep these objectives in mind whenever you face a financial decision , I think you 'll meet with a level of success that will surprise you .

Thanks to Angie for the photos
Angie writes , “ These pics were taken from a cam called “ haunted farm cam ” .
It was Sunday morning , Nov. 20th 2005 , about 11 am .
I had just come online to watch the cams when I saw this child hiding next to the chair .
I watched him / her move around .
first pic is the child hiding there , second is the child still there but had moved its face back behind the chair back .
in the third , well , the woman ’s boy had come running in the room , looked at the ghost and then ran off , the ghost was gone .
I asked the woman , whose house this is , and she told me she was there , the cam is on her computer , and that is n’t one of her kids .
she asked her son what he had been doing that morning and he said he was in fact playing hide and seek ….. with the ghost .

Bazaar vs Git
This page is obsolete !
See Ten reasons to switch to Bazaar instead .
This is not intended to be an unbiased comparison , but a list of some of the reasons for selecting Bazaar over Git , as seen through the eyes of Bazaar developers and users .
YMMV .
Git is a great tool , but different in design in many ways to Bazaar .
Overview
Distributed version control systems have compelling advantages , but selecting the best one for you can be far from easy .
Many communities and teams have Bazaar and Git on their shortlist , and are investigating both in detail .
This document aims to provide information to assist those groups in evaluating the tools and making an informed decision .
Git is an innovation in its category , and is steadily gaining in popularity .
It was designed for the needs of the Linux kernel community , to match the processes applicable there and the brilliance of the people executing them .
Bazaar , on the other hand , was designed to be suitable for a wide range of people , workflows and environments .
In Git the features were the primary focus , whereas in Bazaar the clean user interface and command set were given careful attention .
For this reason Bazaar will work out of the box for a much wider audience than Git , and may well be the right choice for your community or team .
In addition , in contrast to Git , Bazaar is platform independent and will work without problems in mixed development environments --- anywhere where Python is available .
This document compares Bazaar with Git 1.5.x .
Be aware that generalizations ( like Bazaar is too slow and Git is unusable ) simply are n't true these days as both tools are evolving rapidly .
That said , here are some common reasons for selecting Bazaar over Git :
Windows Support - reaches 85 % of computer users
Less attitude - direct support for more work flows
It Just Works - the UI is much simpler
Better storage model - shared repositories
Robust renaming - collaborate without fear
Better asynchronous sharing - intelligent bundles instead of patch sets
Plug - in architecture - solutions matter , not products
Launchpad integration - free code hosting , branch registries and more
Integration with related tools
Commercial training and support
Git had some early advantages including :
Speed
Storage efficiency
Cryptographic validation of content is also sometimes cited as a feature of Git over Bazaar when that 's not really accurate .
Each of these topics is discussed in further detail below .
Reasons for selecting Bazaar over Git
Windows Support
Windows occupies 85 % of the operating system market .
While it is possible to run Git on top of Windows using the Cygwin layer , that would bring a mixed operating system environment into the picture for regular Windows users .
Cygwin is a POSIX environment where handling of case insensitivity and filename globbing are different from what Windows users expect — not to mention the commands .
Git currently has beta - level native Windows support , code - named MSysGit .
However the complete command set is not yet supported , many open problems remain , and the installer package is available only as a third - party project .
Bazaar , on the other hand , includes a native Windows port and installer .
The port feels like a regular Windows program , and the installer includes the graphical front end for Windows , TortoiseBzr .
Olive is available as a graphical front end for Linux .
Both Bazaar and Git are slower on Windows than on Linux , due to underlying file system differences .
Less attitude — direct support for more workflows
There 's more than one way to collaborate together .
The best way depends on a whole range of factors .
Your team or community will have one primary workflow model — and the one encouraged by Git is a very good one — but different groups within your community will undoubtedly mix and match as circumstances dictate .
Bazaar 's UI directly supports a larger range of work flows than Git .
Take for example a centralized SVN - style workflow , which is well supported in Bazaar 's command set .
In Bazaar , it is possible to commit directly to the central server .
In Git it would need two actions : a local commit , followed by a push to remote host .
Similarly Bazaar supports SVN - style checkout , whereas in Git you may have to download whole — possibly big — repository ( see restrictions of the - - depth option in git- clone ) .
In principle any work flow is possible in Git , but the actions are usually more demanding and less intuitive than in Bazaar .
It Just Works
What 's the primary reason given by ex-Git users who now use Bazaar instead ?
Bazaar Just Works and makes it much harder than Git to shoot yourself in the foot .
As Karl Fogel explains in Subversion , distributed version control and the future , users want tools that stay out of their way .
Bazaar generally achieves this better than Git .
Git 's strength is a simple core data storage model , but it has weaknesses on the UI level .
Git quickly gets complicated with concepts like staging area , dangling objects , detached heads , plumbing vs porcelain , and reflogs — concepts that you do n’t need to know at all in Bazaar .
The key differences between Bazaar 's and Git's UI are :
Directories are branches .
In Git they are branch containers where you switch to different views .
Empty directories cannot be versioned in Git .
Within a branch , changes directly made are emphasized over changes from a merge .
Revision objects are simple : r1 , r2 etc .
In git they are SHA1s which are represented by 40 character long hexadecimal encoding .
Git ’s automatic merge and commit may create problems .
Git has over 150 different commands .
The UI between these commands is not consistent , and there is no unified GNU -- long option convention support .
Bazaar uses familiar commands known to Subversion and CVS users .
Git contains a whole new vocabulary : for example , commit into repository is very different in Git .
Taken individually , each of these may not be a big deal , particularly if your team is full of really smart people who enjoy squeezing every bit of power out of their tool set .
Just remember though that 95 % of programmers are still using central VCS tools and get by with 5 - 10 SCM commands / actions : checkout , update , commit , status , diff , log , add , delete .
People usually do n't care about the tool - they care about getting their code written and integrated .
( In fact , with modern IDEs , they rarely ever see the VCS beyond the configuration setting used to configure the branch associated with a “ project ” . )
Bazaar has a clean UI model resulting in a lower learning curve and more potential contributors to your community .
As the open source world continues to grow in its appeal to non-programmers , usability is not something to dismiss lightly .
From a
Git perspective , DVCS looks much more complex than it needs to be .
Better storage model
Bazaar can efficiently share revisions between branches through shared repositories .
These are completely optional — a standalone tree has its own repository by default .
But if a parent directory has been configured as a shared repository , the revisions are stored and shared there .
For efficiency , this is actually far more flexible and powerful than Git 's default model .
For example , the one repository can be used on a developer workstation for storing revisions from :
release branches
a tracking branch of the main development trunk
topic branches for each fix or feature currently being worked on
temporary QA or integration branches for reviewing other changes .
Some topic branches might be pushed to a publicly accessible location ( like ~/ public_html ) , while others might be experimental only .
With Bazaar , it does n't matter — they can all efficiently use the one repository without worrying about others accidentally pulling junk they do n't need .
For users on laptops in particular , this can be a big deal .
Bazaar ’s approach has value well beyond the single user case .
In commercial environments , different teams might have their access controlled to various branches ( e.g. development vs QA vs maintenance ) on a server but , once again , these branches can be using a shared repository for efficient storage .
It 's also clearly beneficial for hosting sites like Launchpad .
Git can achieve the same functionality by a semi- official git - new - workdir extension , but this tool is not part of the standard command set and has many usability and portability problems .
Similar efficiency gains can be achieved using the " alternates " mechanism native to Git , but it has no workflow impact ( branches still stay local to a repository , only the object database is shared in one direction ) .
Easier administration
In a central VCS deployment , it 's not uncommon to have staff dedicated to administrating the SCM servers and repositories .
Bazaar and Git make creating repositories trivial , but the ongoing cost of ownership should n't be ignored .
Here are some examples .
As well as the UI advantages , Bazaar 's directory - is - a - branch model has administration advantages .
Security can be applied to different branches by using existing operating system access control facilities .
Bazaar 's plug - in architecture is also a good thing w.r.t. cost of ownership .
Plugins are typically easier to upgrade and share than enhancements made outside such a framework .
In a commercial environment , one of the arguments against adopting DVCS tools is that central VCS tools encourage daily check - ins which fits in well with the daily backup cycle .
That 's the wrong trade - off — it leads to fragile code being checked in , trunk quality dropping , other developers grabbing those changes before they are ready , and lost time all around .
That 's bad enough for a centrally located in - house team .
For distributed teams and open source communities , it ’s even worse .
The right solution for backing up the work of developers using a DVCS is a central backup server that developers can push changes to daily .
Bazaar ’s shared repositories can be useful on that backup server .
In particular , while Bazaar users with laptops are in the office , they can alternatively bind branches to ones on that server if they want backups to happen implicitly .
Both Bazaar and Git have tools for detecting junk and inconsistencies in repositories .
Bazaar also has an upgrade tool for switching between file formats and a reconfigure tool for changing how a branch is configured , e.g. lightweight vs heavyweight , standalone vs shared repository .
Robust renaming
Git prides itself on being a “ content manager ” and deriving what got renamed using heuristics .
This mostly works , but breaks under certain merge conditions .
If you want your team or community to collaborate without fear of breaking merges , Bazaar 's robust renaming is essential as explained by Mark Shuttleworth ’s article on this topic .
See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/94861
for an example of renames breaking in git .
Better asynchronous sharing
When changes in a branch are ready for sharing and you wish to share asynchronously ( e.g. via email instead of advertising a public branch ) , Bazaar handles this better than Git .
The recommended way to do this in Git is via the format - patch command which generates a set of normal patches which can be applied with its am command .
Bazaar implements this via the send command , which generates an intelligent patch known as a " merge directive " .
In addition to a preview of the overall change , a merge directive includes metadata like renames , the base revision ( common ancestor ) of a submit branch , and digital signatures .
Consistent with the way branches are used , Bazaar 's merge and pull commands are used to apply a merge directive to another branch .
If the changes need to be applied to code managed outside Bazaar , simply feed the merge directive to GNU patch ( and the merge preview will be processed ) .
Plugin architecture
A VCS tool is only part of the broader Collaborative Development Environment required by communities and teams .
It needs to be integrated with heaps of other tools and the overall solution needs to be manageable over time .
A plugin architecture has many advantages including reduced Total Cost of Ownership .
Bazaar has a good architecture internally and a rich public API available for integrating other tools .
In contrast , Git takes the " toolkit " approach - great for prototyping but not so good over time .
Git is currently working towards a public API so this advantage of Bazaar 's may diminish over time .
Launchpad integration
Launchpad is a free service provided by Canonical , designed to make it easier for open source communities to collaborate both internally and with other open source communities .
Features include free hosting of Bazaar branches , a registry of branches for projects , and linkage of branches to the bugs and blueprints they address .
A huge amount of open source software is available as Bazaar branches within Launchpad .
For a detailed look at how Bazaar and Launchpad can be used together and why good integration matters , see our tutorial on Using Bazaar with Launchpad .
Hosting is also available for git , including gitorious and github .
Bazaar has been integrated with some useful related tools in ways that might help your team .
These tools include Patch Queue Manager ( PQM ) , Bundle Buggy ( BB ) and various bug trackers .
Continuous Integration ( CI ) is a best practice adopted by many open source projects and commercial teams using Agile / Lean development methodologies like XP and SCRUM .
The objective is always having a shippable code base by early detection and correction of when things break .
Here are the core CI practices as given by chapter 2 of Paul Duvall 's book :
commit code frequently - commit centrally at least once per day
do n't commit broken code
fix broken builds immediately
write automated developer tests
all tests and inspections must pass
run private builds
avoid getting broken code .
A better workflow for achieving this is called Decentralized with automated gatekeeper as explained in http://bazaar-vcs.org/Workflows.
PQM is a software gatekeeper which ensures that the mainline of the development branch never breaks .
It is maintained by a member of the Bazaar team and well integrated with Bazaar .
Bundle Buggy ( BB ) is a tool for tracking peer reviews .
It is maintained by a member of the Bazaar team and well integrated with Bazaar .
See http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/help.
Version control repositories become an important source of history over time .
To maximize the data mining potential of this " code data warehouse " , linking changes to external data sources like bug trackers is very important .
Bazaar has out of the box integration with Bugzilla , Trac and Launchpad 's bug tracker .
Integrating other bug trackers is easy to do via either configuration settings and / or plug-ins .
Commercial training and support
In addition to support from an active open source community , Bazaar professional services for commercial organizations are available from Canonical .
If you require conversion , training , support or custom engineering for Bazaar , please contact Canonical to discuss your needs .
Git 's Advantages
Speed
We want Bazaar to be the most usable tool around and performance is an important part , but certainly not the only part , of achieving that .
It 's true that Git is really fast at many operations and that Bazaar was once quite slow .
We made some big progress , and our comprehensive performance benchmarks show that bzr is fast enough for a large spectrum of projects when working on the working tree .
It is still a bit slow for big histories (> 10 000 changesets ) , but we are currently working on it ( and already made good progress for commands like log , blame and diff for a given set of revisions since bzr 1.3 ) .
Git is also likely to be faster than Bazaar for network operations but we expect that difference to disappear soon .
Storage efficiency
Git has a strong reputation for efficiently storing data and claims on its home page that it tops every other open source VCS in this area .
Since Bazaar changed its default format to packs in 1.0 , our benchmarks indicate that Bazaar is around 15 % better on average for the initial commit .
Across 33 open source projects , Bazaar was more efficient on every one .
However , more thorough testing on repositories with long history is needed to confirm storage efficiency .
There are some indications that Git is more efficient in repositories with long history ( see example ) .
Git repositories can be packed very efficiently with clever tweaking .
Subsequent revisions added to Git repository will cause the repository to grow , but recent Git releases will repack the repository regularly and automatically .
Cryptographic content validation
Linus made cryptographic strength integrity checking a core part of Git ’s design .
As revisions are named using their SHA , it 's next to impossible to attack a Git repository .
Bazaar explicitly chose to make its revision identifiers UUIDs instead of SHAs .
This does n't mean that Bazaar is less secure — the integrity of each revision is still validated using SHAs in Bazaar .
If that is n’t enough security , Bazaar can be configured to digitally sign every commit .
A detailed look at the UI of Bazaar vs Git
Directories are branches , not branch containers
A key difference between Bazaar and Git is that branches are directories in Bazaar while they are internal names within a repository in Git .
In general , this simplifies the UI a fair bit .
This design choice is not unique to Bazaar as illustrated in Perforce 's Software Life - cycle Modeling paper :
An important feature of the Perforce model is that the relevance of a file is encoded in its name : //depot/release/3.5/01/db/dbhdr.h is a file that is part of a release , and clearly not the place for miscellaneous enhancements .
Similarly , //depot / main/db/dbhdr.h is clearly not where shippable products are built .
Further , the whole of release 3.5/01 can be found under // depot / release / 3.5/01 and not anywhere else in the depot .
This plain - as - the - nose - on - your - face approach is the hallmark of Perforce 's branching model .
On the other hand , it 's true than many Git users like its approach and it does have benefits worth noting :
the one working tree can be used for multiple branches saving disk space
certain tasks like pulling and pushing a set of branches at the one time are easier .
Bazaar has solutions to both of these issues although they are n't necessarily well advertised .
To use the one working tree for multiple branches , set up a shared repository with the -- no - trees option together with a lightweight checkout ( See GitStyleBranches ) .
The switch command ( within the bzrtools plugin before bzr v1.0 , part of bzr itself thereafter ) can be used to change which branch the working tree is tied to .
To pull a set of branches at once , use the multi-pull command within bzrtools .
There is currently no easy way to push a set of related branches in Bazaar - use the repo-push plug - in instead .
Within a branch , changes directly made are emphasized over changes from a merge
Technically , a branch is a directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) in Bazaar just like it is in Git .
Practically though , a particular series of revisions is most important from the perspective of the owner of each branch .
Here are some examples :
If a developer is working on a topic branch , makes some changes , does a merge and commit and asks for a log of the last 5 changes , then the merge is logically ( only ) one and the 4 changes before it ought to be listed as well
If a team is running a Continuous Integration server that triggers a full build + test after each commit , then the CI server should only be triggered after each commit to the main development line , not commits to merged branches .
Treating the left - hand side of the DAG ( mainline ) as special does n't make Bazaar less distributed as some people have suggested .
Instead , it recognizes that each branch has it's own viewpoint onto the DAG .
Bazaar 's UI has been designed to reflect this .
Revision IDs are not SHAs
The most obvious reflection of Bazaar 's it 's my branch philosophy is revision numbering .
Revisions on the mainline are numbered using simple numbers starting at 1 .
Revisions within merged branches are given dotted revision numbers , e.g. 1.2 , 63.3.5.9 .
Like all DVCS tools , Bazaar has globally unique revision identifiers as well but these are very rarely required in daily UI usage .
Note that , like Git , Bazaar could use the content SHA for the internal revision identifier .
It explicitly does n't do this because that approach makes it difficult to use external revision stores ( as bzr - svn does ) and to evolve storage formats over time .
Consistency
In Bazaar , push and pull both enforce that the target is an ancestor of the source making the operations symmetric ( as expected given their command names ) .
In Git , this is enforced for push but not for pull .
Pull is more magical and may :
work as it does in Bazaar
do a merge and implicitly commit if there are no conflicts
do a merge and make the user resolve conflicts and do the commit .
There are 3 design problems with this :
it 's inconsistent with how push works
it ought to fail ( by default ) when using pull for updating a tracking branch ( a.k.a. mirror branch )
implicitly committing a merge is the wrong thing to do ( see below ) .
Another common example is the user experience of using bzr - svn : users just use the normal bzr commands and things pretty much work as expected .
In contrast , git - svn introduces a different set of commands because Git 's architecture does n't permit transparent support of foreign repositories .
Automatic merge & commit may be harmful
Bazaar will never implicitly commit a merge just because it merges cleanly .
No VCS can guarantee that a successful textual merge does n't introduce bugs .
For example , one branch may delete a function while another branch adds a client for that function .
Developers and teams that are serious about making sure trunk quality is sacred ought to be running tests before every commit using a tool like PQM .
Familiar commands for Subversion and CVS users
While some differences exist at the option level , the core Subversion and CVS commands generally work the same way in Bazaar .
Git is different in ways svn / cvs users would n't intuitively expect .
Some examples :
commit ( without - a ) does n't take the latest copy of a file but the copy as of the last add
no update command
revision numbers are SHA strings , not numbers .

A study has found , duh , that most young women in college find pornography acceptable and view it themselves .
As if you could n’t tell that from the way they dress and comport themselves .
Do n’t get me wrong , porn ’s fine .
In fact , it ’s a girl ’s best friend .
Quite the little time saver .
Whenever the man - of - the - moment started giving me the horny eyeball when I had a good book to finish or laundry to do , POP went the VCR .
Most porn is so silly , with those pneumatic , ridiculo - boobs , and toothache moaning , five or so minutes in , a sister was bored and wandering off for a snack .
The hard part , you ’ll excuse the expression , was snaking out of that feverish clawing with a fako - bacon , husky “ I ’ll be right back ” in a 1-900 voice he interpreted to mean that I ’d be donning something uncomfortable and sleazy but which really meant , “ I think there ’s some Chunky Monkey left ” .
There ’ no helping it ; a bug-eyed , sweaty man watching stupid porn , pounding the pillows blindly for you while unable to tear his eyes from the screen is truly the most deliciously pitiful sight in nature .
It ’s fun to hide in the kitchen listening to them bleat “ where are you ? ” whilst you search for the whipped cream .
Here ’s a tip college girls : do n’t put the whipped cream on your ice cream .
Or not all of it .
Timing is everything with the porn - gambit - for - avoiding - protracted - sex .
Take the whipped cream back with you and show it to him .
Just show it .
You wo n’t have to actually use it because the stupid porn has done all your work for you .
Well , all but the last five minutes .
He wo n’t even notice your rolling eyeballs .
Leave the last of your ice cream nearby ; it wo n’t be melted when you ’re free to finish it off and you ’ll have some whipped cream to boot .
No , my problem with porn is the way it ’s saturated the culture and tells young girls that pole dancing and lap dances are feminist and empowering .
That showing the world your thong and posting drunk photos of yourself on Facebook is hilarious .
There is such a thing as lady like behavior and it is not incompatible with either feminism or individual freedom .
That was my problem with the Janet Jackson boob incident ; not that she bared her bizarre breast but that she did it during prime time at the SuperBowl .
That is , or should be , a porn free zone .
If you watch HBO , or even broadcast TV after 9 , you go in knowing it ’s a free for all .
Even before Jackson ’s strip tease , I ’d been appalled by the back up dancers ’ X rated moves .
Not , not appalled .
Exhausted .
Numb .
Now , Beyonce is shilling for some cable company or the other with hip rolls and pelvic thrusts that should , but do n’t , make her mother blush .
She ’s a truly beautiful young woman with an amazing voice but her hips , and ultra short skirts , seem to be the instrument she most relies on .
There should be times , and places , where life can reliably remain PG .
We all need the rest and sex could use a little return to mystery .
Europeans who have no religion are growing in number but are becoming increasingly disadvantaged in the political process .
This was the claim by the National Secular Society at a meeting in the European Parliament on “ Religion and Politics in the New Europe ” sponsored by politicians wanting a firmer separation of religion and state and the dissenting group Catholics for Choice .
Keith Porteous Wood , Executive Director of the National Secular Society in the UK , declared : “ The majority of the EU population are either non-religious or do not actively practise any religion and they are being betrayed because increasingly strident religious influence on moral matters in EU institutions . "
He continued : “ Despite the continuing reduction in church attendance , religious influence in European institutions is increasing .
The new EU treaty requires transparent dialogue with religious institutions and the Pope will soon address , or in reality , lecture , elected EU Parliamentarians and probably also those of the Council of Europe .
The influence of the Roman Catholic Church on EU institutions is huge but largely hidden , and its objective is clearly to impose its views on all EU citizens , not just Catholics .
The Catholic Bishops ’ conference is represented as well as the Holy See as a sovereign state .
At the meeting the huge disparity became apparent between the demands of these representatives and the views of Catholics in the pews .
Mr Porteous - Wood said : “ There are sixty religious missions to the EU , but only one non-religious one , the European Humanist Association .
It has little power and is rarely consulted .
This model of representation entirely disenfranchises the majority of the population who are either non-religious , non-practising or whose views differ substantially from their religious representatives – who are almost always male .
Civil society and the non-religious and have minimal influence but can be adversely affected by the behind doors decisions made as a result of religious representation .
“ The growing number of non-religious and non-practising citizens are being left out of this process , as indeed are many practising Christians who are becoming alarmed at their leaders becoming more and more reactionary .
“ Typical areas where this undue religious influence will be directed are start and end of life issues and sexual matters .
The religious climate is becoming progressively less tolerant on such matters , partly by the deepening conservatism in the Catholic and Anglican churches .
But even more important is the growing influence of Poland and other former Eastern Bloc countries , and the rise in influence of Islam . ”
However officials working with the European institutions say that they do regularly consult with non-religious interests , but that some of those groups claiming to speak on behalf of non-adherents have only a few thousand members .
In recent months Christian , Muslim and secular spokespersons in Europe have all claimed that their constituencies are being disadvantaged or discriminated against by each other .
Writing in The Guardian newspaper this week , leading European commentator Timothy Garton - Ash called for bridges rather than bombast in the debate about how to build a free society open to all .
Diversity involving religious and non-religious together cannot work without reasserting the liberal essentials for common existence , he argued , but it also important not to confuse secularism with programmatic atheism .
So far we have 135,029 articles .

On risk
Consider the following game :
You bet one dollar on the throw of a die .
If the die comes up 6 , you get your dollar back plus 25 more dollars .
Otherwise , you lose your dollar .
You can play as much as you want to .
This is a great moneymaking proposition , because your expected winnings are four dollars on each game .
Play a hundred times , you can expect to be about four hundred dollars ahead .
Even if you 're only allowed to play once , you would probably choose to play this game .
I pulled some sleight - of - hand in the previous paragraph .
I said the game was a good deal " because " the expected winnings were positive .
But that 's not sufficient .
If it were , the following game would also be a good deal :
You bet one million dollars on the throw of a die .
If the die comes up 6 , you get your million back plus 25 million more .
Otherwise , you lose your million .
For some people , the second game is a good deal .
For most people , including me , it 's obviously a very bad idea .
To get a million dollars , I 'd at least have to mortgage everything I owned .
Then I 'd be under a crushing debt for the rest of my life , with 83 % likelihood .
But the expected return of the two games is the same ; this shows that a good expected return is not a sufficient condition for a good investment .
The difference , of course , is that the second game is much riskier than the first .
I think most people understand this , but nevertheless you still hear them say a lot of dumb stuff about risk .
For example , many people like to say that the lottery is a stupidity tax on people who do n't understand basic arithmetic , and that nobody would play the lottery unless they were very stupid , because it 's trivial to see that the expected return is very poor .
I used to meet people at parties who said this .
I would point out that by this reasoning , fire insurance is also a stupidity tax on people who do n't understand basic arithmetic , because it 's clear that the expected return on fire insurance is negative .
I did get argument from folks from time to time , but it 's really not arguable .
If fire insurance did n't have an expected negative return for the customer , the insurance company would go out of business .
In fact , the insurance company employs a whole department full of mathematicians whose job it is to make sure that the value of the premium you pay exceeds the expected cost of the benefits that the company will pay .
So there are only three choices here :
You 're better at simple arithmetic than the insurance company 's actuarial department , or You should avoid buying insurance , since it 's just a sucker bet , or The issue of insurance and lotteries is a little more complex than that .
I believe that the answer , as usual , is # 3 .
( Advice to people wishing to become smarter :
Get in the habit of assuming that everything is more complex than you imagine . )
Once again the issue is not so much the expected return as it is risk .
You pay the insurance premiums in order to mitigate the risk of a fire .
One big fire could wipe you out completely .
So you insure your house against fire so that you can't be completely wiped out .
In return , you pay small , predictable sums of money regularly .
Another way to look at this is to consider the idea of a utility function .
This is just a fancy term for the observation that the usefulness of money is not a linear function of the face value of the money .
Once you have a million dollars , the utility of another hundred is much lower than it is to someone who only has ten thousand .
When you calculate expected returns , you need to calculate the expected increase of the utility , not the expected return of the nominal face value of the money .
Consider this thought experiment : you may bet one cent on a game that will pay you ten thousand dollars if you win , which it will do one time in two million .
Do you play ?
Well , maybe you do , because if you lose , so what ?
It 's only one cent , and you will never miss it .
The utility of one cent is essentially zero .
The utility of ten thousand dollars , on the other hand , is very high , much higher than two million times zero .
But if you like this game , you 're open to the same charge of not understanding simple arithmetic as the lottery people are , because the expected return is very low , about the same as the lottery .
The game is the same as the lottery , only the cost and the payoff are each a hundred times smaller .
In the fire insurance scenario , I am betting a small amount of money , with comparatively low utility , against a very large amount with much higher utility .
One can view the lottery as analogous .
If I buy a lottery ticket for $ 1 , it 's not because I misunderstand arithmetic .
It 's because the utility of $ 1 is low for me .
I could blow $ .85 on a candy bar tomorrow at lunch without thinking about it much .
But the utility of winning millions is very high .
With ten million dollars , I could pay off my mortgage , quit my job , and spend the rest of my life travelling around and writing articles .
The value of even a hundred - millionth chance of this happening might well be higher than the value of gobbling one more candy bar that my body did n't need anyway .
Here 's an exercise I 've been doing lately , trying to estimate the value I ascribe to my own life .
I am afraid that this is a trite subject , If so , I apologize .
But if not , try it yourself , and you might discover something interesting .
Suppose you have the option to play Russian Roulette , in return for which you will receive a fee of x .
The gun has one million chambers , one of which holds a bullet .
If you get the bullet , you die .
Otherwise you collect the fee .
What is the minimum value for x that will induce you to play ?
Would you play if x were one million dollars ?
I would .
It 's an almost sure million , and a million is a huge amount of money to me .
And I probably take bigger than million - to - one risks every time I cross the street , so why not ?
So one might say that this demonstrates that my own estimate of the value of my own life is less than 1012 dollars .
Would I play for a thousand dollars ?
No , probably not .
But where 's the cutoff ?
Ten thousand is a maybe , a hundred thousand is a probably .
( I rather suspect that the cutoff is on the same order of magnitude as the mortgage on my house .
This thought threatens to open a whole can of disturbing philosophical worms . )
Now let 's up the risk .
I 've already agreed to bet my life on a million - to - one chance in return for a million dollars .
The expected - value theory says that I should also be willing to bet it on a thousand - to - one chance for a billion dollars .
Am I ? No way .
The utility of a billion dollars is much less than a thousand times the utility of a million , for me .
For Donald Trump , it might be different .
As a final exercise in thinking about risk , consider this : Folks at NASA estimate that your chance of being killed by a meteorite are on the order of 1 in 25,000 .
It 's not because you 're likely to be hit in the head .
Nobody in recorded history has been killed by a meteor .
It 's because really big meteors do come by every so often , and when ( not if , but when ) one hits the earth , it 'll kill just about everyone .

10月30日に行われたIPAフォーラム2007の『「学生から見たＩＴ産業」と「 ＩＴ産業から見た学生」〜ＩＴ産業は学生からの人気を回復できるか〜』と題された討論会でしゃべってきた。IPAとは情報処理推進機構の略で、情報処理技術者試験とか、未踏ソフトウェア創造事業をやっているところ。
大学の先生から、討論会に出る学生を求めいているという話を聞いたのが討論会に参加したきっかけ。僕はてっきり、IT産業の未来について語り合うのかと思っていたのだが、「IT産業は3Kのイメージが強く、就職において人気がなくなってきているが、どうすればその人気を回復できるか」というタイトルを聞いて、ちょっとがっかりした。
＠ IT に この討論会について の 「 IT業界不人気の理由は？ 現役学生が語るそのネガティブイメージ − ＠IT 」という記事が上がっていた。ちなみに、記事の最初の写真に討論会に参加した学生が写っているが、前列の一番右に座っているのが僕。
この＠ITの記事がはてなブックマークで大いに盛り上がっている。この記事では、討論会の内容を正確に伝え切れていないと思うので、ちょっと補足してみたい。僕はIT業界の実態を分かっていない学生なので、コメントなどでいろいろとご指摘いただけるとうれしい。
まず、会場は満員で、270人くらいの聴衆がいて、立ち見まで出ていた。主催者の方に聞いてみたところ、「多くはIT企業で人事とかをやっている人ですよ」とのこと。
ちなみに学生の構成としては、僕（東大で技術経営を専攻している大学院生、学部のときには情報技術を専攻していた）、東大の学部生1人（環境エネルギーを専攻）、筑波大の学生5人（4人は情報技術を専攻）、日本電子専門学校の学生3人（3人とも情報技術を専攻）だった。特にパネリスト・学生間で討論の内容に関する打ち合わせなどもなく、ぶっつけ本番という感じだった。
内容であるが、IT産業、IT企業、IT技術者というくくりが広すぎて、何を話せばいいのかよく分からなかった。結局、討論会の内容もぶれてしまっていたと思う。パネリスト3人は、NTTデータの元社長、TISの社長、IPAの理事長という、IT産業というよりSIerの人気がないことについて語りたいだけなんじゃないかという顔ぶれだったし、もっと明確にテーマ設定をすべきだったと思う。
主催側から、学生には忌憚のない意見を言ってほしいということが伝えられていて、みんなそれなりに突っ込んだ質問をしていたと思うのだけど、パネリストが論点をずらしたような回答ばかりするので、ちょっと気持ち悪かった。本当はもっと突っ込みたかったけど、時間が70分と短かったので、中途半端な感じで終わってしまった。
以下、＠ITの記事の内容に補足しながら、流れを追ってみる。
まずは、IT企業へのイメージについて、
「 IT産業へのイメージ」との質問に対して学生の1人は「IT産業は自分たちの生活に欠かせないもの、生活を支えてくれる基盤である」と優等生な回答。
優等生的な回答をしたのは僕ですよ。最初に持ち上げてから、後で落とすつもりだったのに、「東大生的な優等生発言で、すばらしいですね」とか言われてしまい、ちょっと失敗。
別の学生から は 「 トヨタ自動車やソニーのようなユーザー企業と違い、IT（の導入）しか行っていないNTTデータのような会社が一番謎」といった疑問が出た。イメージを聞かれても、そのイメージ自体が何もないという皮肉な答えだ。別の学生からは「（情報を発信するテクノロジなのに）IT業界が何をしているのか分からないのは問題」といった、そもそも論も聞かれた。
それに対して 、
BtoBのビジネスをしている企業の業務が学生から見えにくいのは当然で、見えにくいなりに工夫をしないといけないと思う。でも、パネリストの口ぶりからは見えにくいのは当然のことで問題と感じていないというような雰囲気が伝わってきた。興味を持たなければ、インターンにも来ないだろうに。
キッザニアにNTTデータの仕事を体験できるブースを作る計画があるみたいで、若い世代に対してイメージを伝えていきたいと言っていたが、そんなに小さい子に対してではなくて、大学生に対して何かやらないと就職については意味ないと思うんだけど。
いくつか挙げられたIT業界のイメージは実にネガティブな内容だった。いわく「きつい、帰れない、給料が安いの3K」に加えて、「規則が厳しい、休暇がとれない、化粧がのらない、結婚できない」の“7K”というイメージだ。学生は、ほかの業界と比べて「IT業界は特に帰れない」というネガティブな印象を強く持っているようだ。
他の学生 が 「 最近は7Kというらしいですよ」とか言ったのは正直うけた。討論会のホームページにもわざわざ書いてある通り、3Kについては問題と認識しているみたい。本当に3K的な職場なのか、話してほしかったのだけど、
ネガティブイメージを突きつけられた浜口氏は、「必ずしも全員が3Kではない」と反論。岡本氏も「3Kの“ 帰れない”は、帰りたくない人が帰れないだけ。スケジュール管理の問題だ。私は40年間近くIT業界で仕事しているが、何が一番幸せかというと退屈している暇がないことだ。技術が進歩するにつれわれわれの仕事も複雑化してくるが、一生懸命追いかけていくだけでも退屈しない。いい仕事を選んだと思う」と自らの仕事を振り返りつつ、学生に反論した。
論点を挿げ替えているだけで、全然反論になっていない。僕には本当に3Kなのかどうかよく分からないのだけど、はてなブックマークのコメントを見ている限りでは、パネリストの方々は相当現実の見えていない発言をしているようだ。
IT業界はどのような学生を求めているのか。重鎮たちは「コミュニケーション能力に長けている人」（浜口氏）、「チャレンジングで好奇心旺盛な人」（岡本氏）の2点を挙げた。
コミュニケーション力の定義としては、相手の言いたいこと・伝えたいことを引き出す質問ができる、ドキュメントを作成できる、自分のことを表現できるといった、聞く・書く・話すに関係する内容が上げられていた。
学生からは 、 「コミュニケーション力が必要というのは他の業界も一緒であって、IT業界に固有のものとして、例えば、プログラミングの知識を求めていないのか」という質問も出た。それに対しては、浜口氏、岡本氏ともに、「プログラミングの技術はあった方がいいと思うが、なくても構わない」という回答。もう少し書くと、「プログラミングは入社後にトレーニングすれば問題ない。SIerの業務の中では、いろいろな役割の人が連携して仕事をしている。みんながプログラムを書いている訳ではないので、入社後のトレーニングで適正がないと分かれば、プログラミングをあまり必要としない仕事をやってもらうこともできる」というような回答だった。
僕は、この話を 「 とりあえず会話ができそうな人をたくさん採用するので、そいつらを鍛えてみて、使えるやつだけ残していくよ」というような意味合いに取ったのだけど、本当のところはどうなのだろう。
ITを専攻している学生達からは、「 就職時 にITスキルが問われないのだとしたら、大学でやっていることには何の意味があるのか」という質問が出ていたのだけど、明確な回答はなかったと思う。その人たちは、ちょっとショックを受けていたような気がする。
一昔前は 「 体が丈夫で、従順に働いてくれれば大丈夫だよ」というスタンスで企業は採用を行っていたのかもしれないけど、今の大学生は結構将来のことについて考えていて、社会の構造は分からないなりにも自分のキャリアパスとか思い描いている。採用時にも自分の希望とその会社で描けるキャリアパスを考えて入社すると思うのだけど、学生はとりあえずコミュニケーション能力があればいいというのでは、学生は寄り付かなくなると思う。
その流れで、 「 入社時にITのスキルを問わないというのは、Googleのような企業の方針とは反対であるが、それですばらしいサービスを作ることができるのか」という質問が出たのだけど、「Googleの開発と日本のカスタムメイドなシステムを作るSIerの開発は違うもの。Googleはスモールチームで仕上げるが、日本は製造業的にラインを組んで仕上げるため、いろんな人材が必要になる。」とのこと。単に効率の悪いシステム開発をしているということではないかと思ったのだが、どうなのでしょう。使っている言語も違うだろうし、一概には比べられないかな。
他の話題としては 、IPA の理事長によると、「 Google本社には数千人の社員がいるが、その中で日本人は10人くらいで未踏ソフトウェア出身の人が3人いる」とのこと。「せっかく手塩にかけて育てたスーパークリエーターがGoogleに取られてしまっていることについてどう思うか」と聞いたが、「世界で活躍してくれるのはいいこと。スーパークリエーターはたくさんいて、中には起業して頑張っている人もいるし、いろいろな人がいてよいと思う」という回答だった。
そして、討論会の最後に、こんな質問が。
セッションの最後は学生に対しての「 将来ITの仕事に就いてみたいか？」という質問。学生10人のうち8人が「働きたい」、残り2人は「絶対に嫌」という回答だった。
とあるけど、10人中、現在情報技術を専攻している人が7人もいたんだから、もともとそういう希望を持っていた人が多いのは当然。僕ももともと情報技術を専攻していて、将来的にはIT関係の仕事をしたいと思っているし。なので、純粋にこの討論会の中で10人中8人が「働きたい」になった訳ではない。
あと、討論の方法については、id:next49さんが書かれているけど（この方は聴衆として討論会に来ていた人みたい）、
僕も同意見。素人が討論をする場合には、具体的な質問を決めておいて、それに事前に答えさせておいた方が、スムーズだろう。id:next49さんは「恋のからさわぎ」「踊るさんま御殿」を例に取っているが、分かりやすい。
今回の討論会は、主催者の方々的には成功だったようで今後もやるかもしれないというようなことを言っていたので、ちょっと提案してみようかな。
長くなってしまったけど、不明点、突っ込みなどあれば、コメントください。
Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid need to put impeachment back on the table now .
In fact , forget the table ; it needs to be put forth in articles on the House floor right now .
Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClelland has revealed through his upcoming book that Bush , Cheney , Rove , Scooter Libby and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card , conspired to leak Valerie Plame ’s identity and status as a covert CIA agent to the press and then further conspired to cover up that leak .
All this was punishment for her husband ’s article in the New York Times exposing the lie of the Bush administration ’s Iraq war justifications .
Through it all , President Bush , Vice President Cheney and the other top White House personnel lied to the public about it .
In a famous press conference , Bush said that he would fire anyone involved in the leak .
Congress now needs to help him do it .
According to this article in the Associated Press :
In an excerpt from his forthcoming book , McClellan recounts the 2003 news conference in which he told reporters that aides Karl Rove and I.
Lewis " Scooter " Libby were " not involved " in the leak involving operative Valerie Plame .
" There was one problem .
It was not true , " McClellan writes , according to a brief excerpt released Tuesday .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest - ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice president , the president 's chief of staff and the president himself . "
-------------------------------------------
I wrote in July in this article , that the commutation of Libby by Bush demanded impeachment because it signaled to me that Bush was involved and needed to prevent Libby from breaking and implicating others in the White House in order to save his skin .
I urge everyone reading this to go back to my previous article and read it in its entirety .
I said at the time :
When Richard Nixon fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox as part of the October 23 , 1973 “ Saturday Night Massacre ” , he did it to prevent information being released that could directly implicate him in wrongdoing .
Cox had issued Nixon a subpoena requesting the now infamous Nixon tapes and Nixon acted to protect himself and in doing so obstructed justice in the ongoing Watergate investigations .
This is not entirely different from what we have with Bush and his commutation of Libby ’s sentence .
Patrick Fitzgerald filed obstruction of justice charges against Libby because he believed that Libby had information relevant to the investigation and lied or refused to divulge that information .
A jury agreed , found him guilty and Libby received 30 months in prison .
One of the things prosecutors hope happens in situations like this is when the person obstructing justice is faced with a lengthy prison term , in exchange for avoiding prison they start providing the information they were withholding .
Bush ’s commutation takes the threat of prison away from Libby and is thus an act of obstruction of justice .
Nixon ’s actions in the Saturday Night Massacre led directly to several articles of impeachment being filed against him in congress in the ensuing days .
A President cannot be allowed to take such a brazen act to impede an investigation in which he is one of the potential suspects .
Congress should ALWAYS respond to acts like these with impeachment hearings otherwise Presidents will feel that they can live above the law and avoid the consequences .
. . .
Now , Bush has purchased Libby ’s everlasting silence on a matter that could very well have implicated Bush himself or other members of his administration in a crime .
For that , and for many other things before it , both Bush and Cheney should be investigated , impeached and removed from office .
-------------------------------------------------
I knew all this , but I had no idea at the time that someone so close to the inner circle in the White House would come out four months later and reveal how correct I had been .
Wow .
It was good to be Rudy and Judy — having an affair paid for by the taxpayers of NYC .
Rudy ’s then - mistress was receiving NYPD protection way earlier than Rudy ’s people ever admitted — and way before the affair was public :
Judith Nathan got taxpayer - funded chauffeur services from the NYPD earlier than previously disclosed – even before her affair with then - Mayor Rudy Giuliani was revealed , witnesses and sources tell the Daily News .
“ It went on for months before the affair was public , ” said Lee Degenstein , 52 , a retired Smith Barney vice president who formerly lived at 200 E. 94th St. , Nathan ’s old building .
“ It was going on longer than anybody thought , ” added Degenstein , who , along with others in the neighborhood , said they often saw Nathan hopping into unmarked NYPD cars in early 2000 , before the affair was revealed that May .
When pressed by The News Thursday , aides to the Republican presidential hopeful conceded that Nathan got police protection “ sporadically ” before December 2000 – the previously acknowledged beginning of her taxpayer - funded detail .

The holidays can be a time of stress and high spending and for many families , getting through the season without spending too much is essential .
Unfortunately , many families spend far too much during the holiday season and will enter the next year with increased credit card debt and bills that are too high to pay .
With a little planning , it ’s easy to bring costs down and save money during a season when everyone is expected to spend .
You can save money on TV essentials by going to http://www.tvbydirect.com.
Buying Early
The “ Black Friday ” and “ Cyber Monday ” events that are heavily promoted each year encourage families to make purchases on very specific days of the year to obtain sales , but there ’s no reason someone can’t do their shopping particularly early to pick up some terrific deals .
Some stores go so far as to start dropping their prices in the summer when kids are going back to school and this is the perfect time to find some inexpensive gift options for the upcoming holiday season .
Choosing to make purchases particularly early not only means that the spending required of the holiday season is spread out over several months , but it also offers the potential for just as many deals as can be found on Black Friday .
Sharing Gifts and Family
With large families or significant extended families , it can be terrifying to think about getting a gift for absolutely everyone .
For this reason , many families have begun sharing the responsibility of getting gifts for family members by assigning everyone a single person for whom to shop .
This means someone might only need to buy their cousin a gift instead of making purchases for an aunt , uncle , other children and even grandparents .
The benefit of arranging gifts in this manner also means that everyone might get a nicer gift than might have been possible if every family member needed a gift with the old gift - giving style .
Changing Spending Habits
Buying for the holidays requires an increase in spending and not everyone can accommodate the additional space in their budget with ease .
This means that some extra planning may be necessary to fit the extra gift spending in the budget .
For example , a family might forgo eating out once or twice during the week in favor of eating at home so as to have more money to spend on gifts at the end of the year .
The Phenomena of Light in Contemporary Hollywood Cinema : ‘ Close Encounters of the Third Kind ’
All film directors employ light — natural , artificial , and reflected — not simply to illuminate but to add to the desired mood of the scene or to provide another supernatural dimension .
For example , use of light in Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( directed by Steven Spielberg in 1977 ) , provides a means of communication among characters , audience , and the dubious presence , good or evil .
It also acted as a way of heightening the cinematic experience by disguising where the source of the light was actually coming from , that it was acting on behalf of the being (s ) .
I have always loved what I call “ God Lightâ€  shafts coming out of the sky , or out of a spaceship or out of a doorway .
It ’s just been very romantic and extremely wondrous to me , light .
— Steven Spielberg
In combination with its positive emphasis on the “ surface of thingsâ€ science - fiction ’s de-emphasis of narrative process and closure allows corresponding weight to the sense of awe and wonder evoked by many science fiction films .
This is particularly apparent in films like ‘ Close Encounters of the Third Kind , ’ in which a child character , responding with amazement at some miraculous apparition , function as a stand in for the film ’s spectator .
— Annette Kuhn
In the closing scenes of Close Encounters , the alien mothership has opened up her womb to the human beings , who stand in a paralyzed state , unable to move out of sheer adoration .
Like gods from heaven , the aliens appear from within the light , surrounded by an emanating , iconic glow , they reach out to share their love and warmth with human kind .
It is at this moment that we see lead protagonist Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) regaining control of his life , and by entering the womb of the mothership he is going to be reborn , heading toward the light that is hope and eternal life .
We are presented with one of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history , the awe and wonder of the mothership , the outward structure of which resembles that of a city .
When we see the alien beings for the very first time it is like a religious experience in itself .
The use of overexposure and backlighting gives the aliens that mysterious presence , where we try so hard to see what they look like but as always , Spielberg only allows us to see so much , making us return again and again to relive the experience .

使い方
道具箱パレット に " G- Pen " が追加されます。( アイコンはインクと一緒。ショートカットは " G " )
インクツールと同じように使います。
線を引くときに手ブレが補正されます。 ( 2007-08-18より)カーソルを動かす速度によって補正率が変わります。ゆっくりマウスを動かすと強く補正され、素早くマウスを動かすと補正率は弱くなります。
ツールオプション に" Pointer Adjustment " という項目が追加されます。各オプションの意味は次のとおり。
" Quality " 補正するために使用する過去のサンプル数を指定します(1-20)。数が大いほど滑らかな曲線の補正になります。
1の場合は普通のインクツールと同じです。(20をお奨め)
" Rate " ( 2007-08 - 18より ) 補正に関する適用割合を指定します(0-1000)。数値が大きいほど補正の適用割合が大きくなります。ただし、適用される効果は割合と比例関係にはないので注意が必要です。デフォルト値=25 ( 20-50 程度がお奨 め ) " Draw pen line to finished point " 補正が強くなると抜きの部分が途中で止まるような感覚になる。このチェックを入れると最後のカーソル位置まで線を引くようになる。( これはこれで使いづらい ) ( オフにすることをお奨め )
既知のバ グ
線 の「入り」の部分の補正が弱い。→アルゴリズム上しかたない。多分気にならないレベル。
ツールオプションにブラシの選択メニューが出る。なぜ？
ときどき、undo tileがないと言われる。undo関係はサボりまくっているので詳細未調査。
移動平均なので、最後の抜きが変 。" Draw pen line to finished pointer " のチェックオン・オフでちょっと挙動が変わることで回避中。

なんでGimpInk関係のファイルをGimpInk2にリネームしているの？
ここだけモジュール化できたらいいなぁっていう部分を抜き出しました。モジュールでgimpオブジェクトを参照できれば、本体に手を加えなくても良くなるはず...
なん でGimpInk2 はGimpInkを継承してないの？
継承するようにしたら動かなくなったから。push_undo関係が継承関係に依存したコードになってるような... 謎です。
なんで移動平均なの？ 線分補完をする方法だと、いくつかのサンプル点が集まったときにようやくある区間の線分がかけるようになります。こういった方法だと、補間曲線をかくときに一気に数点で指定される曲線をかくことになります。一方、gimpはmotionイベントがあるたびに、直前の位置から新しい位置までの直線を引く処理になっています。つまり、毎回一本の直線を引く処理になっています。これを最初に言った方法に変えるのは面倒だったので（ぉぃ）、最小限の変更で済む、しかも簡単な方法として移動平均を使ってます。結果的には結構良い特性を持っていたようです。(補完点が必ず内挿されるのでブレが小さくなる→手ブレ補正にピッタリ )

In a sign of how fragile the Iraq security situation remains despite recent gains , a key US ally – the police chief of Babil Province , south of the capital – was killed in an attack Sunday .
Brig .
Gen .
Qais al - Mamouri was killed and two of his companions severely wounded when five successive roadside bombs exploded , hitting his armored SUV , provided by the US military .
The attack occurred at the northern entrance of the provincial capital , Hilla , says police spokesman Capt .
Muthana Khalid .
" It was a very precise attack ; he died on the way to the hospital , he was a hero , " says Captain Khalid .
The attack occurred at about 1:45 p.m. local time , 45 minutes after Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch commander of Task Force Marne , a combined US - Iraqi force responsible for Babil and several other areas south of Baghdad , finished a press conference in Baghdad praising General Mamouri .
" I see amazing momentum on the local level .
Let 's focus in on General Qais [ al - Mamouri ] of the Babil police , " General Lynch told a group of reporters gathered for a luncheon at the Green Zone .
" He 's Iraqi , and if you are anti-Iraqi he 's anti-you . "
" He 's indeed truly Iraqi and he 's focused on what 's good for the people of Babil and that has permeated through out the Babil police , and I am very encouraged by that . "
The point Lynch was making was that although Mamouri was a Shiite , he has been operating in a nonsectarian way during his tenure as police chief for more than three years in what has been traditionally one of the most volatile and dangerous parts of the country .
Lynch said that the police chief struck against both the Sunni Al - Qaeda - linked fighters and the Shiite militias that continue to plague the province despite some impressive gains that followed a series of operations in Babil this year .
Total attacks in the area of operation – including Babil , parts of southern Baghdad , Wasit , Karbala and Najaf – which is roughly the size of West Virginia , were 226 in November compared with 615 in July , Lynch said , adding that this translated into an average of six attacks a day now compared with 25 in July .
The commander cautioned though that he was unwilling to declare victory yet because the enemy , particularly Al Qaeda , was still present , citing as an example an attack Saturday on an Iraqi Army checkpoint in Arab Jubbour , south of Baghdad , that killed three soldiers and wounded 14 , and damaged a US helicopter that had responded to the attack .
" You wo n't find me dancing in the end zones in terms of a victory celebration because the enemy is still out there , " Lynch said , promising an operation later this month against a hamlet on the Euphrates in the northern section of Babil where the military believes 30 or so senior Al - Qaeda - linked operatives have sought shelter .
Babil provincial council member Hassan Watwet told the Associated Press that Al Qaeda is the primary suspect behind the attack on Mamouri but it could have also been Shiite militias .
A member of a major Shiite party told the Monitor that it may have been a result of rivalry between the governor , Saleh al - Muslimawi , a Shiite who belongs to the Islamic Supreme Council in Iraq party , and the police chief , who was more of an independent .
" The police chief had a very strong relationship with the Americans and he often clashed with the governor ; they hated each other , " he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record to media .
The governor was trying to squeeze out Mamouri , he added .
New rules outlaw melting pennies , nickels for profit WASHINGTON 
People who melt pennies or nickels to profit from the jump in metals prices could face jail time and pay thousands of dollars in fines , according to new rules out Thursday .
Soaring metals prices mean that the value of the metal in pennies and nickels exceeds the face value of the coins .
Based on current metals prices , the value of the metal in a nickel is now 6.99 cents , while the penny 's metal is worth 1.12 cents , according to the U.S. Mint .
That has piqued concern among government officials that people will melt the coins to sell the metal , leading to potential shortages of pennies and nickels .
" The nation needs its coinage for commerce , " U.S. Mint director Ed Moy said in a statement .
" We do n't want to see our pennies and nickels melted down so a few individuals can take advantage of the American taxpayer .
Replacing these coins would be an enormous cost to taxpayers . "
STORY : Government appeals currency redesign
There have been no specific reports of people melting coins for the metal , Mint spokeswoman Becky Bailey says .
But the agency has received a number of questions in recent months from the public about the legality of melting the coins , and officials have heard some anecdotal reports of companies considering selling the metal from pennies and nickels , she says .
Under the new rules , it is illegal to melt pennies and nickels .
It is also illegal to export the coins for melting .
Travelers may legally carry up to $ 5 in 1 - and 5 - cent coins out of the USA or ship $ 100 of the coins abroad " for legitimate coinage and numismatic purposes . "
Violators could spend up to five years in prison and pay as much as $ 10,000 in fines .
Plus , the government will confiscate any coins or metal used in melting schemes .
The rules are similar to those enacted in the 1960s and 1970s , when metals prices also rose , the Mint said .
Ongoing regulations make it illegal to alter coins with an intent to commit fraud .
Before today 's new regulations , it was not illegal to melt coins .
Metals prices have skyrocketed worldwide in recent years in response to rising demand , particularly in rapidly growing China and India .
Prices for zinc , which accounts for nearly all of the metal in the penny , have risen 134 % this year , according to the London Metal Exchange .
Even accounting for a recent decline , the price of copper is up 50 % since the start of 2006 .
Nickels are produced from 75 % copper and 25 % nickel .
Although the Mint 's new rules are immediately going into effect , the Mint will take comments from the public for a month .
The government has changed the composition of coins in response to rising metal prices .
The penny , which was pure copper when it was introduced in 1793 , was last changed in 1982 .

In 1996 , the Internet Archive began archiving the web for a service called the Wayback Machine .
They 've now archived 55 billion web pages .
That 's enough web pages that if you were to print them all out using your roommate 's printer while he was at class and tape them end - to - end , you could reach the moon and back 28 trillion times .
I decided to peruse the Wayback Machine 's earliest archives to see what the internet looked like in 1996 , when I was 14 and evidently had much less free time than I do now .
Much to my chagrin , few websites from these early years have been successfully archived , and many of the best preserved ones were created by fast food and soft drink corporations because they were some of the earliest adapters of the internet .
They viewed the medium as a chance for inexpensive advertising and invested dozens upon dozens of dollars into it .
The results are tremendously humiliating .
In their defense , the technology was different in 1996 .
Although Internet Explorer 3.0 could run Java applets and inline media , Netscape Navigator could not , and in any case nobody felt comfortable doing anything more complicated than making a few animated GIFs .
Additionally , very few web designers had even the most rudimentary of aesthetic sensibilities , and nearly half of them were clinically retarded .
The internet in 1996 looks like it had been created in its entirety by a panel of 13 - year - olds with Geocities accounts who had about half an hour to spare each night before bedtime .
To prove my case , I took some screenshots after cordially adjusting my monitor resolution to 1024 *768 .
I tried 1996's recommended 800*600 , but at that resolution a single word took up my entire field of vision .
If you would like to visit these archived websites yourself , please click on the screenshots .
In some cases you can then navigate parts of the website exactly as one would have in 1996 , but do not do this .
There is nothing interesting to find and you would do well to avoid prolonged exposure to this heinous baby of an internet .
In fact , I can't in good conscience even recommend you read this article .
McDonalds.com
This is the front page of McDonald's , or as the company is more commonly known , " Your Dalmatian Location . "
There 's not much of a point to this page other than to ask one very salient question :
Did you know ... more than 11 miles of thread holds the giant Arch Deluxe burger in place .
( The web designer was unable to locate the question mark key . )
No indication is given as to what a " giant Arch Deluxe burger " is , but it sounds pretty appetizing as long as you pick around all the thread .
I am sort of disappointed they did n't reveal exactly how many miles of ground - up Dalmatians were used to make this delicious treat , or ask a question I knew the answer to , such as one about how many inches of pubic hair are used to make a Big Mac sandwich ( two inches ) .
This is page 2 of McDonald's .
Here we have the rare opportunity to read McDonald 's fine print , but if for some reason that does n't fascinate you there are a few other options .
You may 1 ) Look at the ( extremely shitty ) drawing featuring seven retarded children pressing their face up against the window in an apparent attempt to escape McDonald's , or 2 ) Decide whether you want to " enter the website " as a Grown - up or a Child .
You mean to tell me we still have n't actually entered the website ?
You realize that in 1996 each of these pages would have taken twenty minutes to load ?
Where is the actual website ?
Is there an actual website ?
I clicked on both the Adult and Kids entrances , but they inexplicably led me to the exact same place , which is to another shitty drawing .
By this time it was pretty obvious that I was being dicked around .
NyTimes.com
Web design in 1996 is very easy -- you just format a page however you want and say , " Please open your window to the width of this line of text . "
No , do n't worry what type of monitor your visitors have .
They wo n't be seeing any awkward white space so long as they manually line up their windows to a specified line of text like the little jackasses they are .
If they 're so intent on preening around with their own specialty window size they can go make their own goddamned website .
Accounting for disparate visitors is far too big a headache when you 're working with such complex variables as JPEGs , fonts , and hyperlinks .
That 's why most websites from this time will also recommend which browser , operating system , and monitor resolution you use .
Unless your settings are exactly the same as the web designer 's , you might as well go fuck yourself .
BestBuy.com
You 'll notice a few things about Bestbuy.com .
The first thing is that although Best Buy has cornered the market on computers , their website looks like complete ass .
The second is that they , too , are obsessed with Dalmatians , going so far as to include an " 101 Dalmatians Holiday Savings Coupon Book . "
Sounds pretty good , but not good enough to reward Best Buy with the annual " Your Dalmatian Location " trophy .
The last thing you will notice about this website is that there is a pig on the left who is giving us a gift .
When I actually visited the website , he was animated : he pulled out the gift from behind his back and then presented it to me , as if I was supposed to know who the fuck he was and why I had made his gift list .
Next time I 'm in 1996 remind me to never visit Bestbuy.com .
WhiteCastle.com
The highlight of this website is their " delicious time saving turkey stuffing recipe featuring .... you guessed it !
Slyders !!!!!!! "
Wow , I did n't guess that at all .
What the hell is a Slyder ?
What I can guess is that if you would ever consider making your Thanksgiving stuffing out of White Castle food , you probably did n't have access to the internet in 1996 .
In fact , chances are pretty good that you do n't have internet access now and that you are in fact a hobo .
Pepsi.com Oh God .
Oh dear God in heaven no .
Your first instinct will be to repeatedly jab a pinecone in your eyes , but please try to understand Pepsi 's mindset .
First , they were almost definitely drunk .
Secondly , they knew that the internet was in some way related to computers , so the idea was to make their website very evocative of a computer .
I 'm not convinced they understood what a computer was , but when they closed their eyes and thought about computers , this monstrosity is what popped into their drunken heads .
First you have a background which looks like a piece of graph paper after it has been used to smash up a family of frogs .
On top of this is a sort of three - dimensional computer terminal , as if the fact that you 're using an actual computer to view the website is n't quite " computery " enough .
In the center of this is something called " Pepsi World , " which has just exploded .
All of these elements combine to give me a kind of headache that is very small but will never go away .
The only part of this website that I liked is the what 's new page .
You can tell Pepsi knows what is new just by looking at their cutting - edge " what 's new " logo : Clorox.com
You might be confused why I checked out Clorox.com , since such a website has no reason existing now let alone in 1996 .
It 's because there was a jug of Clorox in the corner of my eye while I was finding websites for this article .
But it turns out that Clorox.com is a great website .
If you were ever curious as to what the internet would have looked like had it been around in 1953 , this is it .
You'd have a funny little mascot whose body is whatever cockamamie product you 're selling , you 'd have a few innocuous links for investors , and then you 'd pretty much be done .
And that concludes the only review of Clorox 's 1996 website that will ever be written in the history of time by any person in the world .
CocaCola.com
What font is this ?
Who are we kidding here , Coke ?
You 're not cool , you 're a big joke and everybody hates your website .
I read the text and was amazed that Coke has the audacity to mock its old 19th - century slogans .
The irony here is that " Drink Coca - Cola " is a compelling , understated motto , yet this very website advertisement is an affected , pandering display of inanity .
They should really delete the entire thing and just include the sentence " Drink Coca - Cola ! " in 12 - point font because there is no value to CocaCola.com in 1996 or 2006 , and to me their soft drink is the same shit Pepsi sells but in a different can and the only way to drink either is to mix them with rum so that you can forget for a moment that all you 're drinking is high - fructose corn syrup and water , and that every can of Coke you purchase merely encourages Coca - Cola 's shit - eating advertising agency .
Nick.com
As best as I can gather , the premise for Nickelodeon 's website is that Natalie is moving across the country and is feeling mighty gloomy , so she decides to set up the world 's first video podcast .
Right , Natalie .
Just tell me one thing :
How in the hell are you going to put on a web show , from the back of a car , in 1997 ?
And why exactly is it going to take three months for your family to move across the country ?
And is n't it probably true that Natalie was conceived in the same backseat 13 years ago ?
Where 's that show , Nickelodeon ?
Why wo n't you talk about that show ?
Lego.com
There is very little I can say to rebuke this website .
This is the best website I 've ever seen .
I navigated further into the world of Lego.com ' 96 and on every single page I was greeted by pirates waving swords , knights riding horses , and overarchingly wizards on bicycles .
This page alone has three wizards on bicycles lined up in a very majestic fashion , with an additional bonus wizard on a bicycle in the upper - right corner .
In 1996 , while most companies were still figuring out how to properly scan their company logo so that it did n't look like a joke , Lego had discovered the key to web design , which is that randomly strewing little Lego men around one 's website is hilarious and engaging .
If you feel like you need to cleanse your palette after seeing all the other websites featured in this article , please enjoy the following line of Lego men : From Left to Right : Wizard on Bicycle , Wizard on Bicycle ,

REYKJAVIK ( Reuters ) - A teen - ager says he convinced the White House he was Iceland ’s president and managed to schedule a call with George W. Bush but was found out before he got to talk to the U.S. president .

“ My call was transferred around a few times until I got hold of Bush ’s secretary and managed to book a call meeting with Bush the following Monday evening , ” Vifill Atlason , 16 , told Reuters .
The teen - ager posed as Icelandic President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson when he made the call on Dec 1 .
Icelandic police turned up at his door two days later -- the day of the planned call -- and took him in for questioning .
“ They told me the CIA had called the National Commissioner of the Icelandic police and asked if the police could try and find out where I received that phone number from , ” said Atlason .
The teen - ager said he was unable to recall where he discovered the telephone number for the White House .
“ I know I ’ve had it on my phone card for at least 4 years now and that an Icelandic friend gave it to me , but I do n’t remember who , ” he said .
At a White House news conference Monday , Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino said her understanding was that Atlason had called a public line “ that anybody can call , ” according to a transcript .
Local police confirmed the National Security Unit at the national police headquarters had asked them to bring Atlason in .
Jon Bjartmarz , Chief Superintendent at Iceland ’s national police headquarters , said Icelandic police had not spoken to their U.S. counterparts about the matter .
He declined to say how police were tipped off about Atlason ’s call .
“ As far as we ’re concerned , there will not be any further investigation , and I do n’t know if the American government is taking any action because of this , ” he said .
I have read every story from these various self possessed opinion makers in political news and blog sites and the pundits are so clueless it is pitiful .
They ask Ron Paul and even Paul gave them an answer that hinted at the truth but he was just too courteous or perhaps too wise to come out and say it .
What do I know right .
I know what I feel and what I have read from supporters and it seems pretty clear to me .
The secret for success in Congressman Ron Paul ’s Campaign is his call to roll back the police state .
That is the one thing that brings a wide coalition of voters together from many parties .
I mean come on they are spying on every American indiscriminately , tasering children and breaking their arms , escalating every situation they can to reinforce the need for this police state .
This situation is getting pretty serious and everyone knows it .
The most clear and present dangers to the US population is the rise of the police state , and the directly associated power grab by the military industrial complex .
The obvious thing that is coming and that we all are concerned about it a complete take over by an incremental application of Martial Law by the central state and the suppression of all personal liberty and basic enslavement of the population to require them to show their papers and submit to a search or stop at any time just like in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany .
The candidate most likely to effect this kind of roll back , of the police state to secure the liberty and freedom of the Citizens of the United States of America is certainly the Honorable Ron Paul .
That simple and profound realization of that fact will soon enter into the mass mind of the US voting population then Ron Paul will break out .
He has in fact already started that break out and the explanation to me is pretty clear .
Realization of his success can be found in the population having a realization about the Candidate .
It does not require a belief in some conspiracy theory to watch all of this happening on the news and online .
They took away Habeas Corpus , they torture people until they sign a confession .
Ron Paul would never allow this behavior if he were POTUS .
Well that is my opinion .
What do you think ?
DIGG STORY
New York State ’s notorious resistance to efficient governance owes a lot to geography .
The state is vast , by Eastern standards , and its cities are far - flung .
Seen one way , it is a rural state , with a right - angled corridor of denser settlement and industry which more or less follows the course of the Hudson River and the Erie Canal , from Manhattan to Lake Erie .
Imagine a backward , rotated L , or a mirror image of a long - division tableau .
In recent decades , Buffalo , at one end , has suffered a steep decline , while New York City , at the other , has flourished , as though good fortune had flowed down along the L , draining Rochester , Syracuse , and Utica along the way .
The capital , Albany , is at the joint of the L , and seems to benefit — thrive would be too strong a word — whichever way the fortune flows , but it is still remote , in the way of capitals , like Brasília or Canberra , that were designed not to favor one constituency over another , except perhaps the one in residence .
As such , Albany is the arbiter in New York ’s ceaseless upstate - downstate tug - of - war , which simultaneously pits rural Republicans against big-city liberals , and Rust Belt Democrats against supply - side suburbanites .
The proliferation of cross-purposes and strange bedfellows makes for pernicious and complicated arbitrating .
This is one ( but far from the only ) reason that Albany is home to what may be the most dysfunctional state government in the nation .
“ I feel sometimes like I ’m sinking into quicksand , ” Spitzer says of life as governor .
Photograph by Mary Ellen Mark .
A year ago , Eliot Spitzer , the real - estate scion and crusading attorney general , won a lightly contested race for governor , against a Republican named John Faso , by promising to put an end to that dysfunction .
Since then , Albany has in many ways become more dysfunctional than ever .
The addition of an aggressive personality with an ambitious agenda has , perversely , gummed up the works .
The acrimony between Spitzer and his enemies , born of scandal , policy disagreement , political desperation , tactical blundering , and personal animus , has all but stalled the workings of the government , or at least those which require the collaboration of the executive chamber and the Legislature .
The Governor ’s aides like to refer to “ the Spitzer brand . ”
Before his first year in office , Eliot Spitzer was a populist avenger , a media darling , a rising Democratic star , a progressive ’s Rudy Giuliani , a panacea - in - waiting , a front - runner in the first - Jewish - President race .
Somehow , he ’s become an unpopular governor careering from mess to mess .
Allegations that his office used the state police to smear Joseph Bruno for misusing state aircraft ( an affair known as Troopergate ) , and a doomed proposal to issue driver ’s licenses to illegal immigrants , have compromised the brand .
His head shot has appeared repeatedly in the Post over the words “ DIRTY TRICKS . ” Lou Dobbs spent a month ridiculing him on CNN .
The throngs of Wall Streeters who despised him for his unyielding prosecutions when he was attorney general have been joined by scores of affronted political professionals , whose egos , customs , or survival instincts demand that they indulge their negative reactions to his way of doing things .
Against Faso , he got sixty - nine per cent of the vote ; a few weeks ago , a poll found that only twenty - five per cent would vote for him if an election were held today .
The common perception — the dominant story line — is that Spitzer does n’t have the collaborative temperament or the tactical elasticity to be a governor .
To his critics , who complained that he exploited the attorney general ’s office to gain the governor ’s mansion , he was too political to be a prosecutor and yet is now too prosecutorial to be a politician .
But amid all the rancor , the bad press , and the souring of his prospects , the Governor has kept at it , admitting little in the way of doubt or regret , and seeing the “ pushback , ” as he and his circle describe it , as evidence of headway .
He has continued to conduct whatever business he can , drawing on the ample power granted him by the office , while travelling around the state , announcing initiatives and presiding at groundbreakings , as though taking refuge in the expanse of his obligations and the far reaches of his domain .
He has not spent a great deal of time in Albany , the epicenter of his troubles , availing himself of the state - owned air fleet — a source and symbol of geographic freedom and power ( and of its occasional abuses ) .
As the early astronauts observed , altitude and distance bring a certain cohesion into view .
“ The enormity of this state , it ’s awesome , ” Spitzer said one afternoon in October , while passing over it in an airplane , on his way from Buffalo to LaGuardia Airport — an Albany - less trip along the L’s hypotenuse .
The plane , a twin - turboprop Beechcraft King Air , can seat eight passengers comfortably .
Gray cloud cover around Lake Erie had given way to clear skies and sprawling inland vistas in high - autumn orange .
“ I think we ’re seeing the Finger Lakes right up here , ” Spitzer said , looking out his window .
“ Sometimes you can see the windmills . ”
He unfolded a tattered highway map .
“ I ’ve had this in my briefcase going on nine years now .
It ’s from back when I was driving myself around , campaigning for attorney general , in ’ 97 , ’ 98 . ”
He pointed out where he thought we were ( near Geneva ) , as well as where he ’d been the day before ( Albany , Potsdam , Camden ) , where he ’d started in the morning ( Syracuse , to speak at a conference of entrepreneurs ) , where he ’d flown next ( Buffalo , to make the first in a blitz of announcements of “ City - by - City ” upstate development projects ) , and where his family ’s farm was ( on a crease in the map , in Columbia County ) .
The map was dense with gubernatorial significance and opportunities for Spitzer to demonstrate a prodigious grasp of policy detail .
Spitzer , who is forty - eight , has a prominent nose , chin , and forehead , a hard jawline , and deep - set eyes whose intensity can give the extremely mistaken impression that he wears eyeliner .
When he smiles or gets angry , his jaw juts out , underbitishly .
The vigor in his features and in his manner , and his lean frame , tend to inspire descriptions of a man tilting into the wind .
On the flight , he was fidgety , in keeping with his reputation for impatience and hyperactivity , but he displayed an acuity for brisk small talk : sports , kids , Bruce Springsteen .
From the first time I ’d met him , however , a month before , and in the course of a half - dozen interviews this fall , he strove to devote our conversations to the substance of governing , to assess his first and next year in terms of his accomplishments and goals .
He had , it is true , got a lot done ( especially by Albany standards ) before the acrimony took hold .
He had recently looked at his State of the State speech from last January and concluded that he ’d accomplished three - quarters of what he ’d hoped to do .
He had reformed the budget process , the workers ’- compensation system , and the financing of health care and education .
Like politicians everywhere , he seemed frustrated that the media was so focussed on the tumult — that his message was n’t getting out .
For months , the papers had been full of intricate accounts of political or legal maneuverings , many involving his deepening feud with Bruno .
On the day of the Governor ’s flight from Buffalo , the Post ran a picture of Bruno and Spitzer at a memorial service for firefighters , in which Bruno is standing with his back to Spitzer , with the headline “ BACK ‘ BURNER ’ : JOE GIVES SPITZ THE TAIL END . ”
“ The stuff with Bruno ?
That has n’t distracted me , ” Spitzer said .
“ Look , I know what this is .
It ’s about nothing .
This is an effort to distract us from governing .
I ’m not going to let that happen . ”
An anxious supporter of the Governor ’s had told me , when he heard I was going to see Spitzer , “ Ask him , how does he learn . ”
Spitzer is known to be a fast and thorough absorber of information .
He remains the capable and diligent student he was in school .
( His sister remembers him doing his homework with his tongue sticking out of the side of his mouth . )
On television , he speaks in long , complex sentences and hews to a rigorous line of logic , and when you tell him things he remembers them .
Learning would not seem to be an issue .
But the supporter ’s question seemed to contain a note of “ Will he ever learn ? ” — as in , learn when to let an opponent take a round , when not to antagonize people , when not to act as though he needed to prove that he ’s the smartest man in the room .
“ How do I learn ?
I call people , ” Spitzer told me .
Recently , he had been soliciting counsel from an array of eminences ( Bill Clinton , Robert Rubin , Jerry Speyer ) and old Albany hands .
But when I asked him what was the best advice he ’d received so far , he said , “ ‘ Ignore most of the advice we ’re giving you . ’ ” He went on , “ What I have found is that the toughest decisions and the right answers to those tough decisions are still the ones that you come to when you just sit down and you say , ‘ O.K. , what are we trying to do ?
What are the right moral values to guide it ? ’
Ignore all the politics .
Ignore the screaming and shouting . ”
He certainly put that principle to work on his driver ’s - license initiative .
On September 21st , Spitzer decreed that any immigrant here illegally be given the right to get a New York State driver ’s license .
An applicant would have to produce a foreign passport ( in lieu of a Social Security card ) , the legitimacy of which would be verified by state - of - the - art technology .
Eight other states had similar policies .
In Spitzer ’s view , since the federal government had failed to deal with the influx of immigrants , the responsibility fell to the states .
With an estimated million undocumented aliens in New York , he reasoned , it would be best to get them licensed .
The roads would be safer , and immigrants ’ vital information would be added to the Department of Motor Vehicles database , an essential investigative tool for law enforcement .
During his campaign , Spitzer had promised to make this change , but it seemed to take everyone by surprise .
He had not briefed the Legislature , arguing , technically correctly , that the D.M.V. is the executive chamber ’s responsibility .
In the early days , it hardly seemed controversial .
“ Even Joe Bruno , of all people ” — as Spitzer put it on NY1 — said that he could see the merits of it at first , as did the editorial boards of most of the newspapers in the state .
A week later , Mayor Bloomberg raised questions about the plan , citing worries that it would diminish a license ’s value .
In a characteristic display of excessive rhetorical aggression , Spitzer responded , “ He is wrong at every level — dead wrong , factually wrong , legally wrong , morally wrong , ethically wrong , ” at which point the story moved to the fore .
In Buffalo , where I ’d watched him make the City - by - City announcement , the driver ’s - license issue dominated the media scrums .
Spitzer seemed to be relishing the opportunity to re-state the virtues of his proposal ( bringing undocumented aliens “ out of the shadows ” ) , resolute in the idea that sound logic — or his logic , at least — would prevail .
Already , though , the plan was gathering third - rail heat .
Spitzer ’s opponents had begun to frame it as a terrorism issue .
James Tedisco , the minority leader in the Republican Assembly — to whom Spitzer had said , earlier in the year , “ I ’m a fucking steamroller , and I ’ll roll over you ” — declared , “ Osama bin Laden is somewhere in a cave with his den of thieves and terrorists , and he ’s probably sabering the cork on some champagne right now , saying , ‘ Hey , that governor ’s really assisting us . ’ ”
Click to viewJohn Davis spent eight years and
15,000 building a Boeing 747 flight simulator in a room in his house .
And now the 47 - year - old 's hobby has turned into such a full - time occupation that he has jacked in his job as a graphic designer to run a full - time flight simulation business from his home in Coventry , UK .
We interviewed John about his setup , including how much it costs to fly his sim :
Addy Dugdale : Hi John .
We 've seen the pictures of your simulator , but can you tell us a bit more about the gear you use , please ?
John Davis :
Well , the software I use is a Microsoft Flight Simulator for the visuals , as well as the Aerowinx PS1 , which has about 30 different programs .

AD : And what about the hardware ?
JD : The main screen measures 12 ft x 9 ft , and I made it myself , and there is a 19 - inch flat screen on each side .
Other stuff ( like the autopilot system , throttles and weather radar ) was sourced from the internet .
The cockpit I made myself from wood .
AD : How 's the flight simulation business going ?
JD : I 've been running it since June , but it 's a bit quiet at the moment — although hopefully that will change , as I 've done four radio interviews today as well as speaking to the newspapers .

AD : Are you expensive ?
JD : It costs between
65 ( $ 130 ) for one hour and
420 ( $ 850 ) for six hours .
AD : And finally , what else do you keep in your spare bedroom ?
JD : " There 's no room for anything else — that 's why my wife had to go ! "
AD : Thanks John — and good luck !
Although he holds a glider pilot 's license , John , who has clocked up around 2,500 hours on the simulator , claims he was n't good enough at math to fly proper planes .
" This is the next best thing , " he says of the 747-400 he has assembled in his spare bedroom , which has a pair of car seats for the captain and first officer to park their butts on .

The Qi language has the ability to create functions that return different results depending on the inputs .
In most languages besides Haskell , ML , and Prolog , you must simply specify inputs and then test each input to determine what you want the function to return .
This ends up cluttering the function definition with many “ if ” or “ case ” statements .
This in turn lowers the readability and writeability of the language in question .
Advanced functional languages take advantage of a special syntax that allows the definition of the return value based on the inputs to the function .
A second , and more important , use for pattern matching is for binding the formal parameters of the function .
In many languages , if you wish to extract different parts of the parameters in a function , you have to define local variables to hold the parts that you are interested in .
In Qi , you use the pattern matching operator to do the special assignment for your cases up front .
This simplifies the programming and makes the program more readable ( and hence maintainable ) .
Qi provides 2 special operators for the purposes of parameter pattern matching .
The -> operator is equivalent to the = operator in Haskell .
It specifies that a pattern matched to the left of the arrow will produce the results specified on the right of the arrow , after rewriting the function on the right to use the values matched on the left .
The other operator is _ and it basically tells the rewriter to “ throw away ” the input .
Thus the Qi pattern matching system corresponds to what computer scientists call a priority rewrite system .
Now that we have dispensed with some dense technical verbiage , let us look at what all of this actually means to a Qi programmer .
We will start with the first meaning of pattern matching , namely matching basic elements with no bound formal parameters ( i.e. none of what you would call “ variables ” ) .
We will take 3 animals , jane , chuck , and rex and make a function called likes_to_eat that lets us know that jane likes pizza , chuck like cereal , and rex likes dog_food . ( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food ( 11-) ( likes_to_eat jane ) pizza( 12 -) ( likes_to_eat rex ) dog_foodSeems simple enough , no ?
So now lets see what our function has to say about what bob likes to eat .
( 13 -) ( likes_to_eat bob ) error : partial function likes_to_eat ;
It produces an error as expected as we have not defined what bob likes in the above function .
The error message could perhaps be more useful , but it does point us to the problem .
Qi will also then ask if we want to “ track ” the function .
This is Qi’s way of helping us find where we went wrong in our function call .
If you say yes , Qi will display a lot of diagnostic messages when it encounters the likes_to_eat function so you can determine what went wrong .
So let us modify our function to return the symbol “ unknown ” whenever we do n’t know the animal that the function was called with .
We use the _ operator to tell the system that we do n’t care about the input , we just want to return unknown if we reach the pattern . ( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food_ -> unknownRunning this version gives us the following output .
( 21-) ( likes_to_eat bob)unknownNote the difference between this version and the following ( define likes_to_eat_ -> unknownjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food ( 23 -) ( likes_to_eat jane ) unknown
The pattern matches from top to bottom .
Thus the _ operator matches anything input and returns unknown as a result , even though we have specified jane later on in the function .
This is only the beginning of how tricky these sorts of rewrite rules can be , but as long as you remain aware of the order of evaluation , you should have relatively few problems with them .
While returning “ unknown ” is OK , we may want a more useful error message .
We now want to modify our function likes_to_eat to display a helpful error message that tells us WHAT caused the function to fail .
We also want to stop the computation at this point .
Qi provides a helpful function called “ error ” that stops the program and returns a string .
We will make the string say “ likes_to_eat has not heard of bob ” if we input bob .
To make the program work as we described , we want to return the following function ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " bob ) .
Of course , you can immediately see that bob is a variable that we will need to input into the error function .
This allows us to introduce the concept of formal parameters .
In Qi , formal parameters start with an upper case letter .
For simplicities sake , let us call the variable which will bind to bob X .
Now our result becomes ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " X ) where X is bound to bob .
The Qi syntax makes this rule easy to write , just put X on the left of the arrow .
We thus create a new definition of likes_to_eat .( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_foodX -> ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " X ) ( 26 -) ( likes_to_eat bob ) error : likes_to_eat has not heard of bobNow let us take a look at a more complicate pattern matching question .
In Qi , we can use any of the special constructor forms on the left hand side of the arrow operator .
These forms are “ list ” , “ cons ” , and “ @p ” .
We can also use the “ | ” operator inside a list to extract the cons form .
I recommend reading the Qi Language book to better understand these forms , but a simple exercise should suffice to show any programmer versed in list processing how they operate . ( 43 -) ( list a b c ) [ a b c ] ( 44 - ) [ a b c ] [ a b c ] ( 45 -) ( cons a ( cons b ( cons c [ ] ) ) ) [ a b c ] ( 46 -) ( @p 1 2 ) ( @p 1 2 ) ( 47 - ) [ a b | c ] [ a b . c ] ( 48 - ) [ a | b c]error : Improper use of | ( 48 - ) [ a | [ b c ] ] [ a b c ]
Let us create an analog of the Haskell take function that takes N arguments from a list and returns the elements extracted .
Defining it recursively , we find that if N is 0 , then return [ ] or if the list is [ ] for any N , return [ ] .
Finally , return the application of take to itself by making a list of the head elements and the tail elements being the results of take N – 1.( define take - alpha0 _ -> [ ] _ [ ] -> [ ] N [ X | XS ] -> [ X | ( take - alpha (- N 1 ) XS ) ]
) For the first 2 patterns , we can easily see what the patterns match to .
For the final pattern , we find that we get a number N and something called [ X | XS ] .
This form means that X is the single element head of the list and XS is the remainder of the list .
Each call to take - alpha reduces the number of elements in the list by one and reduces the N by one .
( 50 -) ( take - alpha 2 [ a b c ] ) [ a b]
The first 2 patterns work slightly differently than Haskell programmers may be used to .
To show this , let us define a function take - beta that reverses the first 2 rules . ( define take - beta_ [ ] -> [ ] 0 _ -> [ ] N [ X | XS ] -> [ X | ( take - beta (- N 1 ) XS ) ] ) ( 51 - ) ( take - alpha 0 bad_thing ) [ ] ( 52 -) ( take - beta 0 bad_thing ) [ ] ( 53 -) ( take - alpha bad_thing [ ] ) [ ] ( 54 -) ( take - beta bad_thing [ ] ) [ ]
This differs from Haskell in that Haskell would return the bottom operator for the middle 2 elements because it could not match bad_thing to the list or the number respectively .
The typesafe version of Qi would throw an error at compile time if we attempted such a call .
In that case , Qi provides a default symbol called # \Escape that works along the lines of the Haskell bottom operator ( with significant differences not described here ) .
Regardless , we can see that the notion of “ more defined ” that we find in Haskell does not apply to the general version of Qi .
You can make the left hand side of the equation as complicated as you wish .
We will create a list that has alternating types , the first being a number and the second being a tuple created by the @p operator .
For example , we would like the function to make [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) 5 ( @p 8 5 ) ] add up to 26 .
We want it to be able to do it for any valid list length .
The definition follows .( define complicated - list - add [ ] ->
0 [ X | [ ( @p Y Z ) | XS ] ] -> (+ (+ X (+ Y Z ) ) ( complicated - list - add XS ) ) Testing this function gives ( 58 -) ( complicated - list- add [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) ] ) ( 59 -) ( complicated - list - add [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) 5 ( @p 8 5 ) ] )
26
If we try to simply input 3 numbers we get the following error .
( 60 -) ( complicated - list - add [ 1 2 3 ] ) error : partial function complicated - list - add ; The pattern matcher could not match 2 to ( @p X Y ) so it returns the same error we saw when we tried to call likes_to_eat with bob .
It does n’t know how to apply it and it gives us an error .
If we wished , we could add error handling in the same manner as likes_to_eat .
One final point remains on the basics of pattern matching in Qi .
What happens if we have a variable that we did n’t specify on the left hand side of the arrow ?
The rewrite rule described above would n’t know how to decipher it as we did n’t explicitly define it .
Qi has chosen the route of warning the user but defining the function as opposed to generating an error .
We can see the behavior below . ( define bad - rewriteX -> Y ) ======>
Warning : the following variables are free in bad - rewrite : Y ; bad- rewrite ( 62 - ) ( bad- rewrite 10 ) If you are a Lisp programmer , you may worry about variable capture due to this rewrite rule .
Fortunately , Qi handles this case for us via the rewrite system and we do n’t have to worry about it in this case .
This also means we can return proper names from functions in the relatively few cases where we want to do this .
But expressive power always means we need to take care of how we code things , thus the reason for the warning .
( 63 -) ( ( /. Y ( bad - rewrite Y ) ) 12 ) Whew .
Congrats to all that made it to the bottom of this pedantic look at the Qi pattern matching system .
You should note that this only covers rewrite rules without guards ( the Qi “ where ” special form ) .
If you delve further into Qi , you will find that the combination of the arrow and where can allow native backtracking of the functions that you call .
Yes , I said native backtracking of function calls !
More on that later .
Enjoy your Qi!
PS : Mark Tarver , the main implementer of Qi , had this to say about the warn vs error issue with Qi variables .
The main motivation for this is to allow users to mix
Lisp code into Qi code .
Since Lisp reverts to the
uppercase when case sensitivity is invoked ( Qi is
case sensitive ) , if you want to mix Lisp into Qi you have to violate
the free variable condition .
( 0-) ( define implode
Chars -> ( COERCE Chars STRING ) )
====== >
Warning :
the following variables are free in implode : COERCE ; STRING ;
implode
( 1-) ( implode [ # \a #\b # \c ] )
" abc "
You see the idea , that is why you get a warning and
not an error .
Being able to mix the two is a big plus .
However if you really want to block off functions like
bad - rewrite then ( strong - warning + ) will do it and you
get an error and not a warning .
( 3-) ( strong - warning +)

0 .
