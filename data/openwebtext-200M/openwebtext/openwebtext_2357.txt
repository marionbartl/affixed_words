It all began in a homely 1985 fire pit , lightly adorned with bubbling magma and a drawbridge that collapsed with one swift axe chop .
In these hallowed days Mario was about half the size of ol ’
Bowser , easily outwitting him with superior speed and uncanny jumping abilities .
Super Mario , on the other hand , doubles in size to overtake his reptilian nemesis by one measly pixel line .
Hardly an imposing figure now , is he ?
Bowser reappeared a few years later as a spiky - haired leapster capable of out - jumping Mario any day of the week .
No more plodding around , blindly blasting fire at will .
As you can see , he ’s buffed up a bit , with Mario baaaaarely approaching his chubby hands .
Even Super Mario has to look up to Bowser now .
This sets a precedent that most , if not all subsequent Mario / Bowser pairings show some kind of slight adjustment .
No one wrote a hard and fast rule that says “ Mario is 5 ’ 6 ’’ , Bowser is 8 ’ 7 ’’. ”
Hard to tell exactly how large Bowser was in 1991 , what with his baffling , surely drug induced contraption that defies categorization .
However , we can see his spiky hair has blossomed into a mousse - caked Royal Mane of the Mushroom Kingdom .
Super Mario looks like he ’s about half the size of Bowser now , losing ground with each sequel .
At this rate he ’ll barely come up to his knees in the next game .
Too bad the exact opposite happens ...
Bowser somehow shrunk himself down to roughly the same size as Mario for a friendly putting about on the go - kart course .
Oh we get why they ’re the same size , but c’mon , two minutes ago he was twice Mario ’s height .
Five , maybe six people played the NES version of Mario ’s Time Machine , and as far as Bowser ’s concerned , it ’s a damn good thing .
This embarrassing , compromising ending image shows the big meanie crying his eyes out while Mario throws up Mushroom Kingdom gang signs to all his fallen soldiers .
At least they ’re on the same page as Mario Kart though , with Bowser just a bit taller and wider .
More or less how they were in Super Mario Bros .
3 .
Nintendo apparently had some yacht bills piling up in the early ‘ 90s and decided to release enhanced versions of the previous three NES games for easy money .
The Mario sprite found in the remake of the first SMB game stayed about the same , but Super Mario actually drops a few pixels from his original size .
As seen at the very top of the page , he used to be slightly taller .
Hello , retcon .
Super Mario World 2 took place when the two were just babies , forcibly tying their twin destinies together for all gaming eternity .
Even with diapers clinging to their poopy butts Bowser still had a slight edge over Mario .
Then came the most extreme size difference of all , though it ’s artificially instigated – the magical villain Kamek sprays baby Bowser with fairy dust , causing him to burst into Godzilla territory .
For the complete visual breakdown of the final battle , head to vgmuseum .
Ick , here come the mid ‘ 90s , a time of rendered 3D sprites and barely recognizable polygons .
Who needs crisp , defined sprites when we can have such instantly dated visuals as those in Mario RPG ?
We kid , we kid .
It ’s an excellent game by all rights and we ca n’t wait to check out the latest .
Here they seem to be in the same Mario 3 / Mario Kart range , but that ’s all about to change with the next game ...
Mamma mia !
Now this is a drastic departure from every previous game .
Bowser has grown tremendously and it ’s plainly clear why that is – Nintendo needed Mario 64 to blow everyone away , and a same - sized villain just would n’t resonate as much as a towering , fire - breathing menace .
They had the technology , they rebuilt him etc insert tired Six Million Dollar Man reference here .
As you can see , Mario , who once saw eye to eye with King Bowser , now neatly fits in the latter ’s mouth .
Amazingly enough , he becomes even larger in the sequel – more on that in a sec .

Memory makers are going to be looking for better ways to overclock RAM in the coming Intel X58 chipset motherboards running the Core i7 processor .
Asus has confirmed that Intel is telling board makers that memory voltages over 1.65V could kill the CPU .
With overclocking , too much voltage always meant the risk of killing something in your pricey computer system .
The catch with the X58 Core i7 combo is that the voltage you can't exceed for memory is well under what some enthusiast memory kits need to hit high frequencies .
According to The Inquirer , 1.65 volts is the kick - off point , beyond which one begins to run the risk of sending a brand - new Core i7 off to meet the big CPU maker in the sky .
This is not good news for enthusiasts with expensive RAM around including some OCZ Reaper kits needing 1.9V .
Some performance memory needs even more voltage — Corsair Dominator kits that need up to 2.1V .
Mushkin told The Inq that it was redesigning performance kits for the Core i7 CPU on an X58 chipset motherboard and expected to have tri-channel memory kits out in November .
Presumably other manufacturers will quickly follow suit , though this requirement could leave an awful lot of high - voltage RAM ( relatively speaking ) stuck on the market without a premium product to mate with .
One member at XFastest posted pictures of a retail packaged Asus P6T motherboard for the Core i7 using the X58 chipset .
A sticker on the RAM slots shouts out to the enthusiast that going over 1.65 V on memory could damage the CPU permanently .
If you are wondering the exact reason anything over 1.65V means death for the Core i7 CPU , there has been no official explanation from Intel .

Above , snapshot of a rally organized by " Alaska Women Against Palin " this weekend .
Some 1500 people are said to have participated , making it possibly the largest single political protest in the state 's history ( here 's video ) .
Buried on page 4 of a 5 - page New York Times article on Sarah Palin 's political history in Alaska :
[ L ] awmakers in April accused her of improperly culling thousands of e-mail addresses from a state database for a mass mailing to rally support for a policy initiative .
While Ms. Palin took office promising a more open government , her administration has battled to keep information secret .
Her inner circle discussed the benefit of using private e-mail addresses .
An assistant told her it appeared that such e-mail messages sent to a private address on a " personal device " like a BlackBerry " would be confidential and not subject to subpoena . "
Ms. Palin and aides use their private e-mail addresses for state business .
A campaign spokesman said the governor copied e-mail messages to her state account " when there was significant state business . "
On Feb .
7 , Frank Bailey , a high - level aide , wrote to Ms. Palin 's state e-mail address to discuss appointments .
Another aide fired back : " Frank , this is not the governor 's personal account . "
Mr. Bailey responded : " Whoops~ ! "
Mr. Bailey , a former midlevel manager at Alaska Airlines who worked on Ms. Palin 's campaign , has been placed on paid leave ; he has emerged as a central figure in the trooper investigation .
Another confidante of Ms. Palin's is Ms. Frye , 27 .
She worked as a receptionist for State Senator Lyda Green before she joined Ms. Palin 's campaign for governor .
Now Ms. Frye earns $ 68,664 as a special assistant to the governor .
Her frequent interactions with Ms. Palin 's children have prompted some lawmakers to refer to her as " the babysitter , " a title that Ms. Frye disavows .
Like Mr. Bailey , she is an effusive cheerleader for her boss .
" YOU ARE SO AWESOME ! " Ms. Frye typed in an e-mail message to Ms. Palin in March .
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
Static Typing , Dynamic Language Performance , V8 and Tracing JITs
There has been a lot of good buzz recently about dynamic language performance ; including Steve Yegge 's Dynamic Languages Strike Back essay and the more concrete demonstration in the impressive V8 Javascript Engine inside the google Chrome browser .
Two of my favourite quotes on programming languages and ' the typing issue ' come from Gilad Bracha :
" Only a subset of all possible programs can be written with statically typed languages .
For some people that is enough . "
" For optimisation , more is known about a program written in a dynamically typed language at runtime than is known about programs in statically typed languages at compile time "
The first quote makes an interesting point .
In a statically typed language the compiler must know ( either by inferencing or through explicit declarations ) the type of every object everywhere you use it .
This places restrictions on what you can do , but because of these restrictions the compiler is able to provide you with extra information ( is the program type safe ) and make performance optimisations ( no need for dynamic dispatch or member lookup - they can all be statically bound ) .
So it is a trade - off , there are things you just can't do in a statically typed language that you can do in a dynamically typed language - but you make this trade - off for the sake of the compiler .
Note
Those who use statically typed languages do n't do it merely because they " have n't yet discovered dynamically typed languages " .
When you become fluent in any complex system you start to think within its terms - and those who are proficient with statically typed languages think in terms of its types and leverage the information and feedback from the compiler .
This means that when presented with a dynamically typed language you have taken away the framework within which they think .
Exactly the same is true for those who have only programmed with dynamically typed languages , they simply can't think within a statically typed framework .
This is why the two sides get on so well ...
The point of this blog entry is not that dynamic typing is better , but that it is a trade - off ( on both sides ) .
However performance need n't be one of those trade - offs .
Of course typically statically typed language implementations are able to be faster than dynamically typed languages where a lot of extra work has to be done at runtime .
Back in the late eighties a bunch of incredibly smart guys did a lot of research around improving the performance of dynamic languages like Smalltalk .
They were convinced that dynamic languages could even outperform statically typed languages through runtime optimisations .
One of the results was a paper An Efficient Implementation of Self , a Dynamically - Typed Object - Oriented Language Based on Prototypes along with the Strongtalk VM .
Unfortunately ( to quote Gilad again ) this is rocket science , and when Sun snapped them up to work on the Hostspot JIT compiler for the Java Virtual Machine not many people continued their work .
( At PyCon the Microsoft guys I spoke to acknowledged that Hotspot - a dynamic JIT - was superior to the JIT in the .NET framework , but they claimed that their garbage collection implementation is better .
In a managed VM garbage collection has a big performance impact and is one of the areas where PyPy is already faster than CPython . )
This work has resurfaced in an interesting place .
The paper on Self was referenced from one of the design documents on the Javascript V8 engine .
Like Self , Javascript is a prototype based language - and their description of some of the optimisations are surprisingly readable .
From Design Elements of the Google V8 Javascript Engine : Fast Property Access :
" JavaScript is a dynamic programming language : properties can be added to , and deleted from , objects on the fly .
This means an object 's properties are likely to change .
Most JavaScript engines use a dictionary - like data structure as storage for object properties - each property access requires a dynamic lookup to resolve the property 's location in memory .
This approach makes accessing properties in JavaScript typically much slower than accessing instance variables in programming languages like Java and Smalltalk .
In these languages , instance variables are located at fixed offsets determined by the compiler due to the fixed object layout defined by the object 's class .
Access is simply a matter of a memory load or store , often requiring only a single instruction . "
" To reduce the time required to access JavaScript properties , V8 does not use dynamic lookup to access properties .
Instead , V8 dynamically creates hidden classes behind the scenes .
This basic idea is not new - the prototype - based programming language Self used maps to do something similar .
( See for example , An Efficient Implementation of Self , a Dynamically - Typed Object - Oriented Language Based on Prototypes ) .
In V8 , an object changes its hidden class when a new property is added . "
Of course immediately after the release of Chrome a whole raft of benchmarks came out comparing it to the JIT that Mozilla are working on integrating into Firefox to improve Javascript performance : Tracemonkey .
Tracemonkey ( based on Tamarin from Adobe ) is a quite different Just - in - Time compiler than the one used in V8 .
Both compile higher - level languages to native machine code ( although interestingly V8 has no intermediate bytecode step ) .
V8 ( like the .NET JIT ) compiles ' up - front ' , whilst Tracemonkey - as its name implies is a tracing compiler .
This is the same technology being implemented in the PyPy project .
Note
One of the fantastical things about PyPy is that it is more than just ' Python - in - Python ' - it is a whole interpreter compiler toolchain .
Interpreters are ' described ' in RPython ( a static subset of Python ) and then compiled into interpreters capable of running standalone ( using the C backend ) or on the CLR and JVM .
The PyPy tracing JIT is ( for a limited range of types currently ) capable of emitting machine code ( or . NET / Java bytecode ) optimised for specific operations ( e.g. typed bytecode that only adds numbers if that is what your program is doing ) .
On the .NET / JVM backends this bytecode will be translated into machine code by the JIT of the underlying platform - so your Python code under the PyPy interpreter will be ' double - jitted ' on these platforms .
So what is a tracing JIT ?
Rather than compiling up - front , a tracing JIT analyses the flow of types through your program and can compiled specialised ' paths ' for the frequently used parts .
If you have a function that is called with integers and adds them , then machine code that performs this operation will be generated .
The function is protected with a guard so that if it is ever called with different types then new code can be generated or the normal language mechanisms used .
In theory this approach is capable of offering more optimisations than compilers that operate ' up - front ' ( like the .NET and V8 JITs ) .
By analysing the flow of types through the program a tracing JIT is capable of making much smarter decisions about what can be inlined for example .
So whilst both V8 and Tracemonkey have plenty of room to get faster ( I 'm sure ) , Tracemonkey has the most room ahead of it .
In terms of Python , the CPython Virtual Machine is written in C , with several design decisions ' hard - coded ' throughout the source code .
These include garbage collection by reference counting and the Global Interpreter Lock .
Changing this would be very painful ( although integrating Tracemonkey involved Mozilla in a move away from reference counting to garbage collection - and they managed to automate the process of changing a lot of the source code ) .
This was what motivated the creation of the PyPy project .
It makes it much easier to experiment with new implementation strategies - and if the JIT lives up to its promises then Python may get faster , a lot faster .
Twatter and MultiDoc on Mono Windows Forms ( Mac OS X )
At Resolver Systems we 've been busy preparing for PyCon UK .
As well as sponsoring the drinks for the Saturday evening dinner there are several of us speaking :
Plus of course Menno , Christian and I will be giving our Developing with IronPython tutorial on the Friday .
We finished and ' handed in ' the tutorial handouts , which are a great twenty - odd - page introduction to IronPython , so sometime I 'll put them online with the example code .
The example code is a simple Twitter client called Twatter .
It uses Windows Forms and as we intend to support it on Windows , Linux and the Apple Mac I 've been testing it with Mono 1.9 on Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) .
Not what you would call beautiful , but acceptable .
( It is currently hardwired to just use my image - and I did n't write that code - so it is n't a bug .
Twatter is still a ' work in progress ' . )
I 've also been playing with MultiDoc , which is a tabbed text - editor and the example application for chapters 3 - 6 of IronPython in Action .
The interesting thing about this is that the ' Name Tab ' dialog was actually created by the Visual Studio forms designer ( generating C# ) - and works fine from Mono .
The chapter on testing in IronPython has a functional test for MultiDoc , and I 've expanded on this ( and added more tests ) to illustrate some of the principles behind functional testing for my talk .
UPDATE : I 've just tried these apps with Mono 2.0 Preview 2 .
There are some tiny aesthetic improvements , but some bugs that I was going to have to track down have gone - which is nice ( unhandled exception on exit for example ) .

Mexican prosecutors are taking the unusual step of jailing six policemen from the resort town of San Jose del Cabo for what they say could be 30 days or more while they investigate how and whether a vacationing Oregonian was beaten to death in officers ' custody , according to U.S. officials .
Steve Royster , spokesman for the U.S. State Department 's Bureau of Consular Affairs , said Tuesday that last week 's death of 38 - year - old Sam Botner of Yoncalla was " a grave concern . "
The State Department is monitoring Mexico 's investigation , he said .
Botner , a father of three who was vacationing with his wife after returning from a commercial fishing trip , reportedly suffocated on his own blood Aug. 27 in a San Jose del Cabo jail .
He was arrested in a condominium parking lot that day when he reportedly got into a fight .
Botner 's wife , Kym , said she believes her husband was beaten to death while handcuffed and in police custody .
After viewing postmortem photos , Kym Botner said someone at the jail " just mutilated " Sam .
" His nose was totally off the side of his face , " she said .
" The handcuff marks were horrible . "
Typically , authorities are given just two days to investigate before deciding on charges , said the State Department 's Royster .
It was unclear Tuesday why Mexican authorities had extended the process in this case .
Officials at the Mexican Consulate in Portland said they were waiting to hear about their government 's position on the case .
Sergio Hayakawa - Leon , coordinator for the Portland office 's protection department , said the office had not received autopsy reports or any video footage related to the case .
But he said it was n't necessarily the Mexican Consulate 's job to get involved in the death of an American citizen .
" Our duty is to get involved in the Mexican national issues in the United States , not the American citizens ' issues in Mexico , " Hayakawa - Leon said .
The equivalent of the attorney general 's office in the state of Baja California Sur , which is investigating the case , did n't have any other details available late Tuesday .
But Baja California
Sur state deputy prosecutor Omar Barajas told The Associated Press that the police officers gave contradictory statements about the man 's incarceration .
One confessed to kicking him in the face .
Others said the victim hit his face on the ground when they pushed him to the floor to subdue him .
Surveillance video and witness statements indicate that officers struck the victim , Barajas said .
Kym Botner said the incident happened after her husband had returned to their condo while she remained on the beach .
She said she heard her husband and another man yelling in the parking lot .
A truck with seven or eight policemen pulled into the lot ; the men were armed with what looked like machine guns , she said .
The officers arrested her husband , who , she said , was resisting .
She said police told her to come to the station the following morning , so she spent an anxious night alone in her condo .
The next morning , she went to the police station with the manager of the condos where she and her husband were staying .
The manager acted as an interpreter when Kym Botner was told her husband had died in custody .
" I did n't understand it , " she said .
" It did n't make sense to me .
They did n't know if he fell or got pushed .
It was a red flag for me . "
She said she was told his nose had been broken .
She said her husband is 6 - feet - 1 and 250 pounds and it would have taken a significant blow to break his nose .
She said it was n't until that night that she learned police officers were suspected of involvement in the death .
She said she met with the Mexican prosecutor in the case , who told her that her husband 's death was being investigated as a homicide and that police were involved .
She learned from accounts in the Mexican media and from her conversations with authorities there that her husband was beaten , placed in a cell , then removed and beaten again after two cellmates tried to get help for him .
Kym Botner said the coroner listed his cause of death as asphyxiation .
She said her husband was a fisherman and timber cutter who was raised in Yoncalla .
They met in high school and had been married for 12 years .
His children range in age from 10 to 16 years old .
" That was one of the hardest things , to have to come home and tell my 10 - year - old , " she said .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has finally pulled the trigger .
In the most momentous move yet in the credit crisis , the UK government is effectively partially nationalising the UK banking system .
For months , I have maintained that the financial system needed to be recapitalised in the UK and elsewhere .
If any country is to work its way out of these difficulties , it will need to address the lack of capital that financial institutions now have .
Yes , this will cost UK taxpayers tens of billions and yes this is a very bold move .
But , it is wholly necessary if Britain is to have a chance to escape this credit crisis without succumbing to a deflationary spiral .
I commend Brown on having the courage to do this .
As I examine the details , I will keep you abreast of how effective this measure is likely to be .
On the face of it , Brown seems to have done the right thing .
Other countries , especially the US , should take note .
This is far more powerful and effective use of taxpayers ’ money than simply buying up bad assets at inflated prices .
Gordon Brown , the UK prime minister , on Tuesday night ordered a massive taxpayer - backed cash injection to rebuild the balance sheets of Britain ’s high street banks , effectively part - nationalising the sector at a cost of tens of billions of pounds .
The momentous decision came after a day of turmoil on the London stock exchange , where shares in RBS , the banking group , fell by 39 per cent to add to a 20 per cent tumble the day before .
Rival HBOS more than halved over two days .
Faced with an intensifying banking crisis , Mr Brown sanctioned moves for the taxpayer to recapitalise leading banks , in a bid to restore confidence in the system and to encourage them to start lending again .
The total cost of the scheme was estimated at between £ 35 - £ 50bn , which is expected to be executed through the government acquiring preferred shares .
Mr Brown is expected to insist the taxpayer receive generous dividends and profits on the deal if share prices recover .
Full details may not be given until Wednesday morning , although Mr Brown ’s team said a statement would be given before the London markets open .
The plan may also include provisions to ensure government representation on the boards of the banks and possible caps on future remuneration for banks ’ chiefs , and a fund to ensure they can continue to fund day - to - day operations .
Mr Brown had wanted more time to develop a fully - formed bank rescue package , but was pressured into acting immediately by the markets , after reports circulated that banks were demanding an urgent injection of public money .
At £ 50bn , the recapitalisation of UK banks would more than double planned public borrowing this year , pushing public sector net borrowing close to £ 100bn and over 6 per cent of national income , worse than any year since 1994 - 95 .
The additional borrowing , coming on top of increasingly dire independent forecasts for the public finances , will reinforce pressure on Alistair Darling , chancellor of the Exchequer , to explain how the government will reconcile its new desire to borrow at whim with its existing budgetary rules , which prohibit such action .
Mr Darling will seek to explain the actions as necessary emergency measures in an economic downturn in a lecture on Wednesday evening , when he will also set out a new framework seeking to bring borrowing under control in the medium term and restore credibility to the government ’s economic framework .
Spain on Tuesday became the latest European nation to take unilateral measures to deal with the world ’s deepening financial crisis , announcing a € 30 - €50bn emergency fund to provide liquidity to the financial system by buying Spanish banks ’ assets .
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , the prime minister , told a hastily convened news conference that the temporary fund was designed to provide credit for borrowers starved of funds by the seizing up of interbank lending .
European Union governments on Tuesday sought to put aside their differences on how to stop the financial whirlwind sweeping through Europe and announced agreement on a set of principles for rescuing troubled banks .
EU finance ministers said each of the country ’s 27 member states would be free to adopt measures ranging from recapitalisation , the purchase of bank assets and state - backed guarantees of bank liabilities .
But the ministers failed to establish clear guidelines for protecting the bank savings of individual depositors , saying all countries would guarantee savings of € 50,000 for one year but some countries might raise the figure to € 100,000 .

Massive rescue plan for banks – FT
The USDA ( rather belatedly ) began tracking farmers ’ markets in 1994 .
Although they ’re still not very good at it ( a check of their database shows exactly THREE in my hometown of Cincinnati which in reality hosts dozens every week ) even with their limited knowledge of and connection with actual farmers (! ) they ’re seeing significant growth in number of farmers ’ markets over the years .
In a post below John argues , wrongly I think , that a profound loss in November will bring at least a little sanity to the online right .
Glenn Greenwald had a similar thought earlier today :
I receive e-mails fairly commonly these days pointing out some bad policy or another that Obama is advocating and asking why I favor an Obama / Biden victory in light of that .
Even if you do n’t see much difference between the two parties and dislike both presidential candidates , the need to rid ourselves of the people who do things like this — infecting our political discourse with abject idiocy and bottomless dishonesty , shaping their own realities to match their base desires — is reason enough to favor that outcome .
It pains me to disagree so strongly with both John and Glenn , but the idea that a crushing defeat will shame the fringe right into silence or even quiet them down a bit is simply crazy .
My argument comes from four simple points .
1 ) Defending all three branches of government is a much less fun job than attacking it .
Defenders own the real consequences of real policies whereas critics can take credit for any number of righteous things that did n’t happen because nobody listened to their advice .
2 ) Movements thrive as oppressed minorities ; in power they infight and splinter .
To illustrate the point , look at how Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi energized rightwing blogs .
In what conceivable way are Reid and Pelosi remarkable in any way ?
Remember that Reid is pro-life .
They bend over backward to give the GOP a fair shake , even more so when you compare them to the clusterfuck that came before .
There ’s nothing particularly exceptional about either of the two , but by putting a name and face on the Other / Enemy they give the Movement something to hate and fear .
The flip side is also true : Republican power wrecked America but it gave the online left a common enemy and an organizing focus .
I think that single point best explains why the rightwing internet went from its Clinton - era juggernaut to the sad shadow of the leftosphere that it is today .
3 ) In general conservatives dislike overpowered government .
Bear with me here .
There are subspecies like neocons and theocons who like it just fine and others who will compromise big gummint for perks like protection from soul - crushing fear , but at the very least watching their team make a massive grab for dictator powers divides the right .
Think John Cole , John Dilulio and Pat Buchanan .
You can make the same case for every other compromise and ideological betrayal that the President ’s online allies have to either defend ( Powerline ) or condemn ( as often as not , Malkin ) .
4 ) Even if some conservatives like some kinds of government power , the movement viscerally loathes any power that is n’t Theirs .
Ref : Clinton .
Black helicopters .
Death list .
Et cetera ad nauseum .
Taken together these points make a compelling argument that online wingnuttery is not at anything like a peak .
It ’s at a nadir .
Wingnuttery , online , at home and in paranoid little gatherings , is about to get almost unimaginably worse .
Bloggers know better than to say it in so many words , but as a community defending crap like Katrina , Rumsfeld , Harriet Miers and Alberto Gonzales has left the online right depressed , let down and exhausted .
It ’s important for us lefties to remember that these points apply as much to ‘ us ’ as to ‘ them . ’
Laugh at me now , but at the same time that the online right is scraping bottom the online left is very likely somewhere near a peak in terms of influence , unity and enthusiasm .
In a one - party state , it wo n’t take long before partisan leftwing blogs start chafing against principled activists like Greenwald and equal - opportunity muckrakers like Josh Marshall .
It ’s a serious mistake to think that unity in the leftwing blogosphere is more than an artifact of the political left ’s profound powerlessness .
Incoming counsel will be less coherent when we fully own the sausage factory of governing , while at the same time broad power will inevitable reduce the party ’s need to listen to us .
I can grant that the online left should come out better than the online right for the simple reason that Democrats can govern .
As long as the party does its damn job then at least we wo n’t have to play defense for disgraces like Tom DeLay , Jack Abramoff , the Schiavo bill and hurricane FEMA .
But overall the point stands .
Jonah Goldberg et alia have not yet begun to wingnut .
The stupid that will come after their party leaves town on a rail will make the last eight years look like a junior UN meeting .
I hate to think that I ’m right about this , but the natural consequence of what I ’ve laid out that Dave Niewert ’s knowledge of fringe hate groups will make him as useful for explaining the next decade as Paul Krugman ( among other things Krugman is an expert in financial collapse ) and Al Gore .
The first thing that comes to my mind when trying to go green is reducing the level of consumption of new goods .
Reduce , then reuse , then recycle .
Money does n’t seem to go as far as it did even a few years ago , and raising a family while being green can be expensive if we believe all of the hype about buying more green stuff .
Over the last ten years , our family has learned to reduce our consumption , choose good green products , and live on a budget so that we can avoid unnecessary debt .
It was definitely a challenge at first , as it requires a shift in thinking , a lifestyle change , but now it ’s become second nature .
30 Green Ways to Stretch Your Family ’s Budget :
Go green and use less fuel :
1. Plan all of your errands and make one trip in the car instead of multiple trips throughout the week .
This also helps to cut your spending , because it ’s easy to get just one more thing every time you go to the store .
2. Break out the bikes .
Anytime we can go somewhere on our bikes or on foot , we do .
A bike seat or tag - a - long or trailer makes it easy to go by bike with kids , and a baby backpack or carrier and stroller will help with the pedestrian conversion .
3 . Cut back on your car insurance .
If you can get by with mostly bike / walking / public transport , you may be able to just get “ recreational ” insurance for your vehicle .
Usually there is a mileage restriction per month / year , but if you live close to work / shopping , it may work for you .
The savings are quite a bit .
Ask your agent .
Go green and save on clothing :
4 . Plan a clothing swap with other families , and pass on the clothes your kids have outgrown .
Invite
families with kids of all ages , and you may get new stuff for all of yours .
5 . Free boxes are a great idea .
We were recently in Telluride , Colorado , and the free box there is unbelievable .
Granted , Telluride is not your average town , but I think there are many municipalities that would embrace a free box .
A great project for a community organizer …
6 . Thrift stores , secondhand stores , and yard sales are our first choices when looking for kid ’s clothes .
7 . A sewing machine can work miracles when fitting hand - me - downs and repairing favorite clothes .
With a little practice , you can even sew simple clothes from recycled fabric .
Go green and save on food :
8. Plan and plant a garden , even if it ’s just a windowbox garden .
9 . Grow sprouts in your kitchen .
10 . Shop at the Farmers Market and buy seconds .
11 . Go to a pick - your - own produce farm .
12 . Learn to preserve food – canning , drying , and freezing .
13 . Buy only ingredients and prepare your food at home .
Go green and save on books :
14 . Use your library for borrowing and reserving books .
I like to use the interlibrary loan program to get books from all over the country instead of buying them .
15 . Check the “ discard ” shelves at the library for free books .
We ’ve built up our kid ’s library this way .
16 . Yard sales are great for finding books at a bargain .
17 .
Many used bookstores will give credit towards books by taking the ones you no longer want .
Go green and save on household expenses :
18 . Make your own cleaning products .
19 .
Give up paper towels by cutting up and using old towels for cleaning .
Use them instead of paper napkins as well .
20 .
Dry your clothes on a clothesline , inside or out .
21 . If you do use an electric dryer , re-route the vent hose inside your house to help heat in the winter .
Do n’t do this with a gas dryer !
22 . Buy concentrated laundry soap in bulk .
Use less and skip all of the packaging .
23 . Unplug all appliances when not in use to reduce phantom loads .
24 . Replace incandescent bulbs with CFL bulbs .
25 .
In chandeliers , unscrew most of the bulbs so that you are only using one or two .
26 . Give up the everyday shower habit .
Take a “ navy ” shower by turning water off while soaping up .
27 . Flush the toilet only when necessary .
If it ’s yellow , let it mellow .
If it ’s brown , flush it down .
28 . Turn off the TV and give up the cable .
Free your mind , free your budget .
29 .
Use the web to find free stuff – CraigsList , FreeCycle , SwapTree .
30 .
Recycle as much as possible to reduce your trash output .
You can still live a quality life and spend less than you make by going green .
Use the money saved to pay off debt or save for your future !
Make your budget , green your lifestyle , and stick to it !

DENVER ( Reuters ) -
At least five branches of Chase bank in Colorado and Oklahoma received threatening letters on Monday , some containing an unidentified white powder .
A woman walks past a JP Morgan Chase bank branch in New York , October 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
A spokeswoman for Chase said the letters were delivered to three branches in the Denver area and locations in Oklahoma City and Norman , Oklahoma .
Some of the envelopes contained the white powder , Chase spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers said , and one employee was treated for a rash as a precaution , but it was not clear if the skin irritation was caused by the powder or had already been there .
She identified the Colorado branches as being in Lakewood and Arvada .
Fire Marshal Kevin Ferry of the Cunningham Fire Protection District near Denver said the powder in one package was found to be harmless , though the substance had yet to be identified .
That branch was inside a supermarket in the Denver suburb of Centennial .
The supermarket was evacuated as a precaution .
Several bank employees who had close contact with the package were sent to a local hospital for evaluation , he said .
A police department spokesman in nearby Lakewood , Steve Davis , said a white substance found on a parcel there appeared not to be dangerous and resembled talcum powder .
JPMorgan Chase &
Co last week surpassed Citigroup Inc to became the largest U.S. bank , and has aggressively acquired other assets as the financial system has weakened , including the banking assets of Washington Mutual Inc .
Rogers said Chase would not release the total number of banks affected until they were sure all the letters had been found .
“ We immediately called the FBI and Postal Inspection Service to handle the matter and ensure the safety of our customers and employees , ” Rogers said .
She did not know the contents of the letters or if they contained return addresses .
Report : Crucial swing states not prepared for voting problems David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008

The last several elections have been beset by voting problems , and as the 2008 election approaches , it is becoming clear that many of them have not yet been addressed .
A new report from Common Cause finds that ten important swing states have significant problems with their voting systems , with Florida , Georgia , and Virginia being the worst and Colorado not far behind .
In 2006 , 18,000 Coloradans were unable to vote because computer registration machines crashed , and the state 's replacement system is still untried .
" This is a new system , and there 's just a lot of unknowns as to whether or not voters will be successful , " Common Cause 's Jenny Flanagan told CNN .
People are also being kicked off voting rolls because of minor discrepancies that computer software is unable to accommodate , or even because of outright glitches .
Provisional ballots are provided to voters whose registration is disputed , but Common Cause is concerned that the states have not ordered enough provisional ballots to handle the anticipatable problems on Election Day .
CNN has more details on the study here .
The Common Cause report on problems is available here ( PDF ) .

Are you sick of being told what to eat , drink , and do ?
Then this is your lucky day !
Here are ten things that people tell you are bad but actually have healthy aspects to them .
In future when someone whines at you – you can point them in the direction of this list and have the last laugh !
So onwards , the ten things that are healthier thank you think .
10 Ice Cream
Ice - cream is a low GI ( glycemic - index ) food .
This means that it is a slow sugar release food that keeps you satisfied for a longer period of time than a high GI food .
For that reason , you are less likely to binge after eating ice - cream .
75 grams of Ben and Jerry ’s Cookies and Cream ice - cream contains only 114 calories compared to a slice of cheesecake with 511 calories .
Furthermore , ice - cream is made of milk which contains many essential nutrients and vitamins .
1 cup of milk contains up to 30 % of a man ’s daily recommended intake .
Other nutrients in ice - cream are biotin , iodine , potassium , selenium , vitamins a , b12 , D , and K .
Studies show a possible link between milk consumption and a lowered risk of arterial hypertension , coronary heart disease , colorectal cancer .
Interesting Fact :
In the 5th century BC , the ancient Greeks sold snow cones made with fruit and honey in the markets of Athens .
9 Dirt
Throw away the rubber globes !
Dirt is back in vogue !
Remember the days where kids played in dirt , food was served with bare hands , and straws did n’t come in individual wrappers ?
It turns out – they were healthier days than our modern sterile ones !
Early childhood exposure to bacteria , viruses , and parasites has been found to give a massive boost to our immune systems , making us less likely to get sick when we do come in to contact with various bugs .
Research has found that children with a dog in the home are less likely to suffer allergies , and regular social interaction can reduce the risk of leukemia by up to 30 % .
Those are statistics not to ignore – so throw away the anti-bacterial cleaners and get dirty !
Interesting Fact :
There are as many as 10 times more bacterial cells in the human body than human cells !
The vast majority of these are harmless .
8 Stress
Stress is universally considered a bad thing – in some cases people have successfully won lawsuits against companies for work - related stress .
But , what most people do n’t know is that a little stress goes a long way to making us healthier .
In short doses , stress can help boost the body ’s immune system .
In the first stage of stress ( the “ alarm ” stage – often known as the “ fight or flight ” response ) the body produces cortisol – a stress fighting hormone which has many benefits to the body .
Stress can give a feeling of fulfillment – when this is the case it is called “ eustress ” as opposed to “ distress ” .
Interesting Fact :
The term “ stress ” and the mental properties of it was not known before the 1950s .
Until that time it referred simply to hardship or coercion .
7 Caffeine
Not only is coffee tasty , it is a mild stimulant with many medical uses .
Caffeine contains a muscle relaxant that is very beneficial to people with bronchial problems – it can alleviate the symptoms of asthma .
Additionally , caffeine releases certain fatty acids in to the blood stream that become a useful source of fuel for muscles .
It even seems that the only serious side - effect to too much caffeine is a small amount of body - weight loss – a danger if you are anorexic .
Caffeine should be avoided by people with fecal incontinence as it loosens the anal and sphincter muscles .
Interesting Fact : Caffeine can be toxic to animals , in particular dogs , horses , and parrots .
It also has a much more significant effect on spiders than humans .
6 Red Wine
Red wine contains a group of chemicals called polyphenols ( once called Vitamin P ) which have been found to be very beneficial for health .
They reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer .
Wine has also been found to be an effective anti-bacterial agent against strains of Streptococcus ( found most often in the human mouth ) which can help reduce infections .
Some wine varieties have extra health benefits ; Cabernet Sauvignon appears to reduce the risk of Alzheimer ’s Disease .
In addition to the benefits already listed , wine is chock full of antioxidants which play a huge role in the health of the human body .
The wines found to have the greatest benefits are found in the South of France and the Sardinia region of Italy .
Interesting Fact :
Wine originated in the regions of Israel , Georgia , and Iran , around 6000 BC .
5 Chocolate
As a result of recent research into chocolate and health , it appears to be something of a panacea ( cure - all ) – coupled with the great taste and mood enhancing properties , it might be seen as a wonder drug !
Cocoa or dark chocolate improves the overall health of the circulatory system , it stimulates the brain , prevents coughs , prevents diarrhea , and may even be an anti-cancer agent .
Like coffee , chocolate is toxic to many animals .
A BBC study indicates that melting chocolate in your mouth increases brain activity and the heart rate more intensely than passionate kissing , with the effect lasting four times longer after the activity ends .
Eating regular small quantities of chocolate reduces cholesterol and the chances of a heart attack .
Sign me up for some of that medication !
Interesting Fact : Chocolate has been used as a drink since at least 1100 – 1400 BC .
4 Cannabis
Cannabis is said to be beneficial for over 250 conditions .
For this reason it is legal on prescription in a number of Western countries .
Cannabis is believed to help with arthritis , asthma , depression , glaucoma , and pain .
It is also reported to be a good treatment for constipation .
Cannabis is also useful in dealing with the sideeffects of treatments for cancer , AIDS , and hepatitis .
Cannabis has been used medicinally for over 3,000 years !
Strangely , the cultivation and use of cannabis is outlawed in most countries .
Interesting Fact : Evidence of the use of cannabis as a non-medicinal drug exists as charred seeds found in Romania dating back to the 3rd millenium BC .
3 Beer
The moderate consumption of beer has been associated with the lowered risk of head disease , stroke , and mental decline .
In addition , brewers yeast ( used in the production of beer ) contains many nutrients that are carried through to the final drink : magnesium , selenium , potassium , phosphorus , biotin , and B vitamins .
For this reason , beer is sometimes referred to as “ liquid bread ” .
In 2005 a Japanese study found that low - alcohol beer may contain strong anti-cancer properties .
Contrary to popular belief , a “ beer belly ” or “ beer gut ” is not produced by the beer , but rather overeating and lack of exercise .
Interesting Fact : Beer is one of the oldest beverages – dating back to the 6th millennium BC .
2 Smoking
Often referred to as “ Smoker ’s Paradoxes ” , there are a number of therapeutic uses of nicotine or smoking .
For example , smokers are less likely to need surgery to provide extra blood to their heart after an angioplasty , the risk of ulcerative colitis is reduced , and it even interferes with the development of Kaposi ’s sarcoma ( a type of cancer of the lymphatic endothelium ) .
Perhaps most surprisingly , is that there are connections to smoking and a reduction in allergic asthma .
There is also a large body of evidence to suggest that smokers have a dramatically reduced risk of developing Alzheimer ’s disease and Parkinson ’s Disease .
Nicotine is currently being investigated as a treatment for ADHD , and Schizophrenia .
Interesting Fact : Tobacco smoking has been a practice of humans since at least 5000 BC .
1 Pornography
Amidst the loud angry cries against pornography , a few serious scientific studies have been performed on the subject .
It seems that men and women who view pornography , have improved sex lives , better sexual knowledge , and an overall better quality of life .
Surprisingly , one study found that the more that pornography is viewed , the greater the improvements .
In an extensive study performed in Australia , the majority of married respondents stated that they believed that pornography has had a positive effect on their marriage .
While clearly not always linked to pornography , studies have found that men who had fewer orgasms were twice as likely to die of any cause as those having two or more orgasms a week .
Interesting Fact : Pornography ( and the anti-pornography movement ) as it is understood today is a concept of the Victorian era ( 19th century ) which was extremely moralistic .
Sexual imagery was not taboo before that time .

Policing Flickr.com 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It 's 11 a.m. , and a handful of Flickr.com employees have gathered around a messy conference table to discuss , as they have daily for six years , the minutiae of governing humans .
First order of business , the Brazilians .
It seems a suspicious number of people in Sao Paulo have been using the popular photo - hosting site to post pictures of dishware .
The idea is to sell the stuff -- a clear violation of the company 's no-commerce rule .
Except rules are tricky things with an operation like Flickr's .
The ban on commerce seems simple enough , but as someone at the meeting points out , Brazil 's secondhand economy is an integral part of life there , particularly among women .
When does the enforcement of a righteous - seeming regulation become a quashing of someone 's culture ?
And so mushroom many conversations here -- as they would anywhere where a smattering of individuals has converged into a genuine , if confined , civilization .
What began in 2004 as a handy site for sharing your latest vacation snapshots has grown into a vast society parallel to our three - dimensional one .
Thirty million members have posted 2.8 billion images ( and now videos ) from their lives , but more importantly the Yahoo - owned company has let them seize on the social nature of photography .
Strangers convene to comment on each others ' images , form groups based on common interests and share the project of documenting and categorizing the visible universe .
To roam Flickr is to wander through crooked teeth , local politics , nesting osprey , birth , spaghetti , divorce and every other aspect of existence .
If photos reflect life itself , so too does a Web site containing billions of them .
At first glance this parallel society has been made , quite literally , in the image of our own .
But in truth it 's more like a Photoshopped image -- the nice parts accentuated , the inappropriate bits cropped away .
So it goes with any online community , of course .
Behavior must be moderated and a communal ethos must be preserved ; Wild West cliches aside , total freedom at any entity like this would sink it in a storm of lawsuits , flame wars and gridlocked cacophony .
So directors of community exist .
And while the job of nurturing and policing any online realm would make for a fascinating study , I was particularly curious about how it worked at Flickr .
Director of Community Heather Champ does n't just guard the pool and blow the occasional whistle ; it 's a far more delicate , and revealing , dance that keeps the user population here happy , healthy and growing .
In addressing that question of how much to police and how much to let things be , Champ oversees an experiment that , outside some far - flung and sandy exceptions , one rarely sees in such detail .
There are no IEDs or snipers in this place , but it 's hard not to conclude Flickr 's conducting a kind of nation - building .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Back to the Brazilians .
An earnest , feel - our - way - in - the - dark spirit pervades community management discussions here , and there ensues a lively debate about the nature of commerce , which moves into a dissection of art , which circles back to an analysis of human interactions that are close but not quite commercial .
Finally Champ ventures a consolidated philosophical guideline for cases like this one :
" Selling stuff is bad .
Selling stuff you 've made is less bad .
Swapping stuff is less bad .
Swapping stuff you 've found on the street is worse than swapping stuff you 've made . "
Champ 's pronouncement is met with approval , and the group agrees the Sao Paolo folks will receive a warning .
They move on to the next item .
So goes this update of our own nation 's founding , all improvisation and theories of existence and Diet Coke .
If it 's not dishware in Sao Paolo , it 's something else .
Should all nudity go behind the R - rated wall ?
Given the broad international scope of Flickr 's members , whose cultural mores should be favored ?
Sure , the good of the community is central -- but what happens if the community 's values shift away from those of the company itself ?
And what about the injunction against harassing fellow members -- what if someone feels harassed for not being free to express his harassment ?
The hypotheticals can seem increasingly ridiculous , until one reflects on the absurdities that inch through our real - life courts .
A society takes shape around the bizarre intersections where one freedom is pitted against another .
When a Web site hosts visual representations of those intersections , weird questions get asked .
Back in the conference room , the morning meeting winds down , and attention drifts to the window of an adjoining office .
On the other side , another Flickr employee smiles politely through the glass .
Then he turns his back to us and lowers his pants to his ankles .
It 's a full and excellent moon , and our room delivers a restrained golf clap .
At some level I feel we 're applauding the perfect conundrum embodied by the co-worker 's butt :
What we all find funny might be thoroughly offensive in another corner of the globe .
How do the nation - builders of the online universe maintain harmony when the potential for disagreement exists in even the tiniest gesture ?
Anyway I reach for my camera , but the fellow 's pants are already back up .
* * * * *
Champ , 45 , is a lifelong photographer and a longtime geek .
Still , her three and a half years toiling amid the full - color images of humanity have done much for her worldliness .
As Champ puts it , " I 'm a nice Canadian girl .
I 'd never even heard of a Dirty Sanchez when I started here , much less seen a photo of one . "
The essence of Champ 's job , she says , boils down to defending this imprecise but holy " spirit of Flickr . "
Indeed , imprecision is an art here .
The list of community guidelines is an assortment of lawyer - vexing instructions like " Do n't be creepy .
You know the guy .
Do n't be that guy , " and " Do n't forget the children . "
If you 've spent any time online , you instantly recognize these to be meaningful and clear edicts .
Champ is only half joking when she says her is responsibility is to keep things from " encroaching on Flickr 's serenity . "
" The job always comes down to finding the fulcrum in the teeter - totter , the balance that benefits both the individual and the community , " she explains .
Indeed , for all its color , the site is governed by gray .
Take , for example , what I call the penis quandary , endemic to any operation like this :
A photo of a penis will be flagged on Flickr as offensive and relegated to the site 's version of an adults - only zone .
But what about a photo of the word " penis " ?
What about a cloud that looks like a penis ?
What about a penis on a Greek statue ?
Then there 's the matter of hate speech , forbidden on Flickr .
Could someone argue that the company compromises its larger goal by limiting representations of the outside world to only the non-racists among us ?
Where is the line drawn in these cases ?
In public life , we know how the line is drawn .
It 's drawn ploddingly by legislative and judicial bodies -- a maddening process often , but theoretically an accountable one .
In the public - private sphere of online communities , however , a company like Flickr is only as accountable as it chooses to be .
Anyone familiar with the reigning ethos at Flickr might find it strange to even mention such things -- if our public officials were half as thoughtful , attentive and responsible as the Flickr folks , the world would be a saner place .
But the company 's good juju does n't diminish the fact of its power , circumscribed as it is , and the larger trend of this power migrating from public zones to private ones .
Champ , for her part , has no qualms defending " the Flickrness of Flickr . "
A while back a group calling itself " Islam is Hell on Earth " was removed .
Champ is unapologetic : " We do n't need to be the photo - sharing site for all people .
We do n't need to take all comers .
It 's important to me that Flickr was built on certain principles . "
And so they 're defended -- and evaluated -- constantly .
One person wanted some unflattering photos taken down and enlisted the help of an American police officer to write a note .
No dice .
In other cases a parent without custodial rights wants photos of his child , posted by the other parent , removed .
Who 's the relevant custodian here ?
On the day I hover over Champ 's shoulder , a woman writes to complain that her ex-boyfriend is posting inappropriate photos of her and calling her names .
" People bring their human relationships to Flickr , and we end up having to police them , " Champ says .
She sends a warning to the ex , and explains her actions to the woman .
Lest your inner libertarian objects to such interventions , Champ is quick to correct the idea that the community would ultimately find its own balance .
" The amount of time it would take for the community to self - regulate -- I do n't think it could sustain itself in the meantime , " she says .
" Anyway , I can't think of any successful online community where the nice , quiet , reasonable voices defeat the loud , angry ones on their own . "
In this sense , Champ does n't just shepherd along the Flickr ethos ; she 's a larger advocate of intelligent growth in an often chaotic zone .
" People become disassociated from one another online .
The computer somehow nullifies the social contract , " she says .
In other words , people sometimes go nuts amid the anonymity of the Internet .
Later , she recalls one of the more inflamed periods in Flickr 's history : the purist fury loosed upon the company when it decided to host short videos in addition to photos .
" The passion that people expressed then and at a few other times -- if you could harness that , you could turn wind turbines , " she says , laughing .
Mostly , though , Champ finds humanity , or at least Flickr 's segment of it , remarkably inspiring .
" People have fallen in love on Flickr .
Some have proposed over Flickr .
It 's just a delightful thing for so many people , and I get to spend my days with them . "
Indeed , Flickr 's members tend to be dramatically more civil than those of , say , YouTube .
This is Champ 's work , though she would humbly credit the community itself and its commitment to having a place of beauty and reason online .
What they 've created is n't just a mirror held up to our society -- it 's a sanitized , civilized mirror , with the illegal , hurtful and nasty elements largely pruned away .
Sort of makes for a nice picture , when you think about it .

Rudy Giuliani has recorded a fear - mongering robocall for the McCain - Palin campaign that distorts Senator Barack Obama ’s stance on mandatory sentences for society ’s worst criminals .
Obama opposes mandatory minimum sentences for some offenses , arguing :
We have a system that locks away too many young , first - time ,
non-violent offenders for the better part of their lives – a decision
that ’s made not by a judge in a courtroom , but all to often by
politicians in Washington and state capitals around the country .
But Giuliani ’s robocall drops the , rather important , word " minimum , " making it seem that Obama opposes mandatory sentences in general :
Hi , this is Rudy Giuliani and I ’m calling for John McCain and the
Republican National Committee , because you need to know that Barack
Obama opposes mandatory prison sentences for sex offenders , drug
dealers , and murderers .
It ’s true , I read Obama ’s words myself .
And
recently , Congressional liberals introduced a bill to eliminate
mandatory prison sentences for violent criminals — trying to give
liberal judges the power to decide whether criminals are sent to jail
or set free .
With priorities like these , we just ca n’t trust the
inexperience and judgment of Barack Obama and his liberal allies .

Due to the ongoing hatred and vile nature of the McCarthy McCain / Palin campaign and Republican politicians and pundits , Keith Olbermann is moved yet again to another Special Comment .
This time , Olbermann castigates the entire notion ' Us vs. Them ' notion that the Republican Party mouthpieces have been perpetuating in their support for John McCain 's candidacy .
And worse , for someone who has made his ability to reach across the aisle in a bipartisan manner a mainstay of his campaign , John McCain 's allowing his proxies to divide Americans into " good " and " bad " camps shows how far he has slid from his " maverick " days .
( Senator McCain , ) I disagree with you on virtually every major point of policy and practice .
And yet I do not think you " anti-America . "
I would not hesitate to join you in time of crisis in defense of this country .
Fortunately you did not echo this chorus of base hatred .
But neither have you repudiated it .
What is " pro-America " , Senator ?
Transcripts below the fold :
I have frequently insisted I would never turn the platform of the Special Comment into a regular feature .
But as these last two weeks of this extraordinary , and extraordinarily disturbing , presidential campaign project out in front of us , I fear I may have to temporarily amend that presumption .
I hope it will be otherwise , but I suspect this will be the first of nightly pieces , most shorter than this ... until further notice .
And thus a Special Comment tonight about the last five days of the divisive , ugly , paranoid bleatings of this Presidential race , culminating in the sliming of Colin Powell for his endorsement of Senator Obama .
There was once a very prominent sportswriter named Dick Young whose work , with ever - increasing frequency , became peppered with references to " my America . "
" I can't believe this is happening in My America " ... -- " we do not tolerate these people in My America " -- " this man does not belong in my America " .
His America gradually revealed itself .
Insular .
Isolationist .
Backwards - looking .
Mindlessly flag - waving .
Racist .
No second chances .
A million rules , but only for the other guy .
Dick Young died in 1987 , but he has been re-born in the presidential campaign as it has unfolded since last Thursday night .
In that time , Governor Sarah Palin , Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann , McCain spokesperson Nancy Pfotenhauer , and Rush Limbaugh , have revealed that there is a measurable portion of this country that is not interested in that which the vast majority view as democracy or equality or opportunity .
They want only ... control -- and they want the rest of us , symbolically , perhaps physically ... out .
Governor Palin :
" We believe that the best of America is not all in Washington D.C. , " you told a fund - raiser in North Carolina last Thursday , to kick off this orgy of condescending elitism .
" We believe that the best of America is in these small towns that we get to visit , and in these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America , being here with all of you hard working very patriotic , very pro-America areas of this great nation . "
Governor , your prejudice is overwhelming .
It is not just " pockets " of this country that are " pro-America " Governor .
America ... is " pro-America . "
And the " Real America " of yours , Governor , is where people at your rallies shout threats of violence , against other Americans , and you say nothing about them or to them .
What you are seeing is not patriotism , Governor .
What has surrounded you since your nomination , has been the echoing shout of mob rule .
Indeed , that shout has echoed to Minnesota , where the next day an unstable Congresswoman named Michele Bachmann added to the ugly cry .
" I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America , or anti-America .
I think people would love to see an expose ' like that . "
For nearly two years , Ms. Bachmann , who made her first political bones by keeping the movie " Aladdin " from being shown at a Minnesota Charter School because she thought it promoted paganism and witchcraft , has had a seat in the government of this nation , a seat from which she has spewed the most implausible , hateful , narrow - minded garbage imaginable .
Well , Congresswoman , you have gotten that " expose ' " you wanted , have you not ?
Though not perhaps in the way you imagined .
Since giving voice to your remarkable delusion that there are members of Congress who are " anti-America , " and the extraordinary tap - dance of sleaze and innuendo about Senator Obama which followed ...
... the challenger for your house Seat , Elwyn Tinklenberg , has been inundated by donations -- 700 thousand dollars in the three days after you spoke .
Because the America you perceive , Congresswoman -- with its goblins and ghosts and vast unseen hordes of traitors and fellow travelers and Senators who wo n't ban " Aladdin " -- exists only in your head , and in the heads of the others who must rationalize the failures in their own lives and of their own policies as somebody else 's fault -- as a conspiracy to deny them an America of exclusionism and religious orthodoxy and prejudice , about which they must accuse , and murmur , and shout threats , and cleave the nation into pro-America and anti-America . "
And back it comes to the McCain campaign .
And Senator McCain 's talking head , Ms. Pfotenhauer , who on this very network Saturday , and seemingly without the slightest idea that dismissive prejudice dripped from every word , analyzed the race in Virginia .
" I can tell you that the Democrats have just come in from the District of Columbia and moved into northern Virginia , " she said .
" But the rest of the state , ' real Virginia , ' if you will , I think will be very responsive to Senator McCain 's message . "
Again , a toxic message ...
The parts of the country that agree with Nancy Pfotenhauer ... are real -- the others , not .
Ms. Pfotenhauer , why not go the distance on this one ?
It was Senator McCain 's own brother who called that part of Virginia nearest Washington " communist country . "
Cut to the chase , Madam .
No matter the intended comic hyperbole of Joe McCain ...
This is the point -- is n't it ?
Leave out the real meaning of " Communism , " Madam -- Joe McCain reduced it to a buzz - word ; it has no more true definition right now than does " Socialism , " or the phrase " a man who sees America like you and I see America . "
It 's about us ... and them .
The pro-... and the anti .
Never mind , Madam , that the bi-secting of this country you would happily inspire , means taking a tiny crack in a dam and not repairing it but burrowing into it .
It is not enough that Senator McCain and Senator Obama might differ .
One must be real and the other false .
One must be pro-America and the other anti .
Go back and -- as your boss Rick Davis said today -- " re-think , " Mr. McCain 's insistence not to drag the sorry bones of Jeremiah Wright into this campaign .
And whatever you do , Ms. Pfotenhauer , allow no one enough time to think ... about the widening crack in the dam .
And now all of this comes together to attack Colin Powell .
" Secretary Powell says his endorsement is not about race , " writes Rush Limbaugh ... the grand wizard of this school of reactionary non-thought .
" OK , fine .
I am now researching his past endorsements to see if I can find all the inexperienced , very liberal , white candidates he has endorsed .
I 'll let you know what I come up with . "
It is not conceivable that Powell might reject McCain for the politics of hate and character assassination , or just for policy .
In the closed , sweaty world of the blind allegiances of Limbaugh -- one of " us " who endorses one of " them , " must be doing so for some other blind allegiance , like the color of skin .
The answer to this primordial muck , must be addressed to one man only .
Senator McCain -- where are you ?
I disagree with you on virtually every major point of policy and practice .
And yet I do not think you " anti-America . "
I would not hesitate to join you in time of crisis in defense of this country .
Fortunately you did not echo this chorus of base hatred .
But neither have you repudiated it .
What is " pro-America " , Senator ?
Is it pro-America to call a man a racist because he endorses a different candidate ?
Senator , you have based your campaign on many premises , but the foremost ( and the most nearly admirable ) of all of them , have been the pitches about " reaching across the aisle , " and putting , as your ubiquitous banners reed , " country first . "
So when Colin Powell endorses your opponent , you say nothing as your supporters and proxies paint him in this " Anti-America " frame and place him in Governor Palin 's un-real America .
Senator McCain -- did not General Powell just " reach across the aisle ? "
Did he not , in his own mind at least , " put country first ? "
Is it not your responsibility , Senator , to , if not applaud , then at least quiet those in your half of our fractured political equation ?
Is it not your responsibility , Senator , to say " enough " to Republican smears without end ?
Is it not your responsibility , Senator , to insist that , win or lose , you will not be party to a campaign that devolves into hatred and prejudice and divisiveness ?
And Senator McCain , if it is not your responsibility ... whose is it ?

HE WAS better known for burning books than reading them .
But surviving portions of Hitler 's private library reveal the German dictator as an ardent bibliophile , owning classics , history , travel writing , biography , studies of the occult and much else .
Timothy Ryback 's main find is the portion of Hitler 's huge book collection that ended up in an obscure section of the Library of Congress .
Other books emerged from American officers who took them as souvenirs .
The Soviet army had the best pickings : the library in Berlin 's Reichskanzlei , 10,000 volumes , was shipped off to Moscow in 1945 and has not been seen in public since ( tantalisingly , it surfaced in the 1990s in an abandoned church but disappeared again ) .
But there is enough to go on .
The author neatly weaves together Hitler 's political career with his book - collecting habits , tracing the well - thumbed volumes that Hitler consulted during the writing of “ Mein Kampf ” .
Mr Ryback 's knowledge of German literature and the politics of the Nazi era makes him well placed to follow clues and draw inferences , both from the time and place of acquisition and from the marginalia that can be found in the books .
Hitler was not only an avid reader but also an inveterate underliner .
Perhaps the most chilling example of that is in Paul de Lagarde 's “ German Essays ” .
Underlined is : “ Each and every irksome Jew is a serious affront to the authenticity and veracity of our German identity . ”
As the author points out , Hitler had a magpie mind .
He speed - read books looking for material that he counted as useful — meaning anything that fitted into his mosaic of misplaced historical analogy and pseudoscience .
What did n't fit was discarded .
This , as Mr Ryback writes , was the essence of Hitler : “ Not a profound , unfathomable distillation of the philosophies of Schopenhauer or Nietzsche , but instead a dime - store theory cobbled together from cheap tendentious paperbacks and esoteric hardcovers , which gave rise to a thin , calculating , bullying mendacity . ”
Mr Ryback has done a good job maintaining a balance between dispassionate inquiry and moral revulsion .
Yet the result is still slightly creepy .
Flicking through a copy of what is probably the earliest acquisition in the collection , an architectural history of Berlin that Hitler bought in November 1915 , he discovers between pages 160 and 161 , “ a wiry inch - long black hair that appears to be from a moustache ” .
It is suddenly all a bit too close for comfort .
The self - described " hockey mom " wooed her peers , holding up a Detroit Red Wings hockey shirt and describing how her son Track , now a soldier soon to deploy to Iraq , once played for a local team .
" Michigan , you took care of my boy and now that boy is serving in the US Army and he 's going to take care of you . "
Casting the double act as political outsiders , Mr McCain urged voters to " send a team of mavericks who are n't afraid to go to Washington and break a little china " .
A mere two weeks ago , the Fannie / Freddie rescue was called “ the mother of all bailouts ” by some commentators .
If the plans of the Administration come to fruition , it will shortly be surpassed by the $ 700 billion mortgage rescue plan proposed by Hank Paulson late last week .
The increase of the request from the initial $ 500 billion and the release of the shockingly short , sweeping text of the proposed legislation has lead to reactions of consternation among the knowledgeable , but whether this translates into enough popular ire fast enough to restrain this freight train remains to be seen .
First , let ’s focus on the aspect that should get the proposal dinged ( or renegotiated ) regardless of any possible merit , namely , that it gives the Treasury imperial power with respect to a simply huge amount of funds .
$ 700 billion is comparable to the hard cost of the Iraq war , bigger than the annual Pentagon budget .
And mind you , $ 700 billion is not the maximum that the Treasury may spend , it ’s the ceiling on the outstandings at any one time .
It ’s a balance sheet number , not an expenditure limit .
But here is the truly offensive section of an overreaching piece of legislation :
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
This puts the Treasury ’s actions beyond the rule of law .
This is a financial coup d’etat , with the only limitation the $ 700 billion balance sheet figure .
The measure already gives the Treasury the authority not simply to buy dud mortgage paper but other assets as it deems fit .
There is no accountability beyond a report ( contents undefined ) to Congress three months into the program and semiannually thereafter .
The Treasury could via incompetence or venality grossly overpay for assets and advisory services , and fail to exclude consultants with conflicts of interest , and there would be no recourse .
Given the truly appalling track record of this Administration in its outsourcing , this is not an idle worry .
But far worse is the precedent it sets .
This Administration has worked hard to escape any constraints on its actions , not to pursue noble causes , but to curtail civil liberties : Guantanamo , rendition , torture , warrantless wiretaps .
It has used the threat of unseen terrorists and a seemingly perpetual war on radical Muslim to justify gutting the Constitution .
The Supreme Court , which has been supine on many fronts , has finally started to push back , but would it challenge a bill that sweeps aside judicial review ?
Informed readers are encouraged to speak up .
Nouriel Roubini does not think it passes the smell test :
` He ’s asking for a huge amount of power , ” said Nouriel Roubini , an economist at New York University .
“ He ’s saying , ` Trust me , I ’m going to do it right if you give me absolute control . ’
This is not a monarchy . ”
It would be best if this provision were expunged , but failing that , the Treasury should articulate what scenario it is worried about and any shield against legal intervention should be made as narrow as possible .
Now to the substance .
The Treasury has been using the formula that it will buy assets at “ fair market prices ” .
As we have noted , there is simply huge amounts of cash ready to bottom fish in housing - related assets ( we saw an estimate of $ 400 billion a couple of months ago ) .
The issue is not lack of willing buyers ; it ’s that the prospective sellers are not willing to accept prices that reflect the weak and deteriorating prospects for housing .
Meredith Whitney , the Oppenheimer bank analyst who has made the most accurate earnings and writedown calls of her peer group , has noted how the housing market price decline assumptions used by major banks fall short of where the market is likely to bottom , given traditional price to income ratios and expectations reflected in housing futures prices .
In addition to the factors that Whitney ( and others ) have cited , the duration of the 1988 - 1992 US housing bear market and major financial crises suggests that that a peak - to - trough decline of 35 - 40 % is realistic ( obviously , this average masks substantial variation across markets and housing types ) .
We are thus only a bit more than halfway through , as measured by the fall in prices .
Yet as we discussed , the plan makes no sense unless the Orwellian “ fair market prices ” means “ above market prices . ”
The point is not to free up illiquid assets .
Illiquid assets ( private equity , even the now derided CDOs were never intended to be traded , but pose no problem if they do not need to be marked at a large loss and / or the institution is not at risk of a run ) .
Confirmation of our view came from a reader by e-mail :
I worked at [ Wall Street firm you ’ve heard of ] , but now I handle financial services for [ a Congressman ] , and I was on the conference call that Paulson , Bernanke and the House Democratic Leadership held for all the members yesterday afternoon .
It ’s supposed to be members only , but there ’s no way to enforce that if it ’s a conference call , and you may have already heard from other staff who were listening in .
Anyway , I wanted to let you know that , behind closed doors , Paulson describes the plan differently .
He explicitly says that it will buy assets at above market prices ( although he still claims that they are undervalued ) because the holders wo n’t sell at market prices .
Anna Eshoo pressed him on how the government can compel the holders to sell , and he basically dodged the question .
I think that ’s because he did n’t want to admit that the government would just keep offering more and more .
I do n’t think that our leadership has been very good during this negotiation ( or really , during any showdowns with this administration ) at forcing the administration to own their position .
If Paulson wants this plan , then he needs to sell it to the public , and if he sells a different plan to the public ( the nonsense buying - at - market - price plan ) then we should pass that .
I ’d rather see the government act as a market maker for the assets to get them transferred over to private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds and other willing holders .
And if we need to recapitalize these companies , it seems like the cheapest way for the taxpayer is to go in and buy up the distressed debt and then convert that to equity .
So unlike the Resolution Trust Corporation , which took on dodgy assets which had fallen into the FDIC ’s lap due to the failure of thrifts , and the Home Owners ’ Loan Corporation , which was established in 1934 after the housing market had bottomed , this program is going to swing into action with the clear but not honestly disclosed intent of buying assets at above market prices when future markets and the analysts with the best track records on forecasting this decline ( you can add Robert Shiller , CR at Calculated Risk , and Nouriel Roubini to the list ) believe it has considerably further to fall .
As we said earlier , this is a covert , not particularly well designed , inefficient , and unduly costly recapitalization of the banking system .
Why ?
Losses on the paper acquired are guaranteed .
This is not a bug but a feature .
The whole point of this exercise is an equity infusion to banks .
The failure to be honest about it upfront will lead to a taxpayer backlash ( or will lead to the production of phony financial statements for the rescue entity , which will lead to revolt by our friendly foreign funding sources ) .
Taxpayers have no upside participation .
There is no regulatory reform as part of the package .
This would seem to be a minimum requirement for a donation of this magnitude .
There is no admission that deleveraging is inevitable .
This plan seems to be a desperate effort to keep bad debt from being written down .
Yet the sorry fact is that a lot of these assets simply will not be repaid .
There appears to be no intention to do triage .
The financial services industry , on the back of an explosive growth in debt , has reached an unsustainable size .
The industry will have to shrink .
Yet the Administration does not address this issue ; indeed , it appears it intends to forestall the inevitable .
Regulators need to decide who will make it , who wo n’t , and figure out what to do with damaged institutions .
Instead , the reaction is ad hoc .
The stunner was the contemplation of a possible merger between Morgan Stanley and Wachovia .
As far as I can tell , the only thing the two firms had in common was coming into crisis on roughly the same timetable .
For all I know , their IT systems are not compatible ( many an otherwise promising bank merger has been scuttled over IT integration issues ) .
Reader Marshall forwarded a note from Jon Hatzius , the Goldman analyst who was an early housing / financial firm bear and has forecast that credit - related losses to the economy will reach $ 2 trillion .
His outline of what the rescue program must do :
Basically , I see three main conditions for resolving the crisis ( a slicker marketer would call them “ The Three R’s ” ) : a ) Recognition .
We need to find out what the assets on the balance sheets of banks and other financial institutions are really worth , and what the balance sheets of the most troubled institutions look like under a regime of realistic marks .
b) Recapitalization .
The US banking system needs a lot more capital .
Credit losses are depleting equity capital , and deleveraging increases the required equity capital per unit of balance sheet capacity .
So capital infusions are needed to avert a sharp contraction in lending .
c) Relief .
In many cases , we need to restructure the loan terms of homeowners who lack the ability ( or economic incentive ) to service their mortgage .
This is n’t just in the interest of the homebuyers , but it ’s often also in the interest of the lender ( given the cost of foreclosure ) and certainly in the interest of the macroeconomy ( given the feedback effects between foreclosures , home prices , and economic performance ) … .
In any case , recognition is only a start .
In fact , recognition actually increases the need for recapitalization because it brings capital shortfalls out into the open .
So it will be important to see how the Treasury proposal addresses this .
Do they force banks to seek equity infusions from private investors in a specified time period ?
Do they simply “ pay over the odds ” for the assets ( this would promote recapitalization but jeopardize recognition ) ?
Is part of the program earmarked for the purchase of preferred stock in banks ?
Or is there a public / private partnership scheme such as an issuance of publicly financed puts in e xchange for warrants for would - be private investors ?
As we read from the Congressional staffer , they simply want to “ pay over the odds ” .
Although I agree broadly with Hatzius , I quibble with his idea that the goal is to avoid a sharp contraction in lending .
The US needs to wean itself of unsustainable overconsumption , and since consumption has come to depend on growth in indebtedness , a reversal , however painful , is necessary .
Our excesses have been so great that there is no way out of this that does not lead to a general fall in living standards ( note that the officialdom in the UK is willing to say that , but since perpetual prosperity is a God - given right in America , admitting we will be getting poorer is verboten ) .
Thus , a sharp contraction in lending seems inevitable ; the trick is to prevent it from crossing the tipping point into a vicious , accelerating downward spiral .
But regardless , there has been broad agreement that private capital will not enter the mortgage / housing market until investors have confidence that a bottom is nigh .
The Treasury program , by quite deliberately propping up asset prices , will delay finding a market clearing level and thus attenuate the financial crisis .
The unacknowledged dead body in the room is whether our foreign creditors will support this plan .
As we have noted before , sentiment in Asia ( remember , China , Japan , and Taiwan are among our biggest funding sources ) has turned against the US , particularly as AIG , a once - trusted company with a very large client base in the region , both retail and corporate , nearly went bankrupt .
The reason the US economy has not suffered much despite the magnitude of our financial mess is that we have been the beneficiary of what Brad Setser has called “ the quiet bailout ” as foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds continued to buy Treasuries ( and until recently , agencies ) to the tune of $ 1000 per person .
Now consider what we have in store .
From the New York Times :
Divided across the population , it would amount to more than $ 2,000 for every man , woman and child in the United States .
Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $ 500 billion next year .
And it comes on top of the $ 85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $ 200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Given that continuing to buy US assets will come under increasingly harsh scrutiny overseas , the US needs to bend over backwards to devise a plan that at least looks credible in terms of directing the funds that come from taxpayers and lenders to their highest and best uses and implementing reforms that will restore active and prudent oversight of financial firms .
The Administration ’s demand for a free pass , even if Congress unwisely goes along , is likely to backfire with our foreign creditors .
As reader and sometimes contributor Richard Kline commented :
This approach screams , literally screams “ DEFAULT , ” because however sensible any one such guarantee may be , in aggregate we do n’t have the dough , and are n’t going to get it from overseas , either .
So if Congress is fool enough to vote for these upfront , they have just killed our currency and sovereign debt a few quarters on , rather like the hapless homebuyers taking out an ARM on a home ten times their annual income ‘ because the opportunity is there . ’
If you think this is a tad melodramatic , consider the summary at VoxEU by Carmen Reinhart of her work with Kenneth Rogoff on financial crises ( italics hers ) :
Serial default on external debt — that is , repeated sovereign default — is the norm throughout nearly every region in the world , including Asia and Europe . …
Another regularity found in the literature on modern financial crises is that countries experiencing large capital inflows are at high risk of having a debt crisis .
Default is likely to be accompanied by a currency crash and a spurt of inflation .
The evidence here suggests the same to be true over a much broader sweep of history , with surges in capital inflows often preceding external debt crises at the country , regional , and global level since 1800 , if not before .
Also consonant with the modern theory of crises is the striking correlation between freer capital mobility and the incidence of banking crises , … Periods of high international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international banking crises , not only famously as they did in the 1990s , but historically .
We have said more than once that the the US in the same position as Thailand and Indonesia , circa 1996 , except we have the reserve currency and nukes .
It looks like we will have the opportunity to see how those two assets influence the end game .
Update 5:25 AM : I see Paul Krugman is opposed to the plan for similar reasons :
As I posted earlier today , it seems all too likely that a “ fair price ” for mortgage - related assets will still leave much of the financial sector in trouble .
And there ’s nothing at all in the draft that says what happens next ; although I do notice that there ’s nothing in the plan requiring Treasury to pay a fair market price .
So is the plan to pay premium prices to the most troubled institutions ?
Or is the hope that restoring liquidity will magically make the problem go away ?
Here ’s the thing : historically , financial system rescues have involved seizing the troubled institutions and guaranteeing their debts ; only after that did the government try to repackage and sell their assets .
The feds took over S&Ls first , protecting their depositors , then transferred their bad assets to the RTC .
The Swedes took over troubled banks , again protecting their depositors , before transferring their assets to their equivalent institutions .
The Treasury plan , by contrast , looks like an attempt to restore confidence in the financial system — that is , convince creditors of troubled institutions that everything ’s OK — simply by buying assets off these institutions .
This will only work if the prices
Treasury pays are much higher than current market prices ; that , in turn , can only be true either if this is mainly a liquidity problem — which seems doubtful — or if Treasury is going to be paying a huge premium , in effect throwing taxpayers ’ money at the financial world .
And there ’s no quid pro quo here — nothing that gives taxpayers a stake in the upside , nothing that ensures that the money is used to stabilize the system rather than reward the undeserving .
However , so far , Krugman seems to be in a minority among Serious Economists in opposing the plan , or perhaps more accurately , the ones who support it are the ones quoted in the media .
I am far from having a complete tally , but Brad DeLong has provided a list of requirements ( the plan in its current form falls notably short ) , while Alan Blinder and Nouriel Roubini give a thumbs up .
As outrageous as the Christian Right 's overall agenda is , their specific arguments and beliefs can be worse .
I have written many articles exploring the arguments and beliefs advocated the Christian Right in order to reveal just how awful , and awfully absurd , they can be .
Mere words , though , cannot always convey the true absurdity of a position .
Even the most carefully reasoned argument will not carry the emotional impact of the original ideas being dissected .
Visual imagery , though , can often communicate ideas more quickly than words and convey emotions more immediately than any argument .
For that reason I have created propaganda posters which promote some of the beliefs of the Christian Right .
The intention is satirical , not sympathetic , but even so I believe that both the images and the words accurately reflect what some on the Christian Right belief and advocate .
The original posters were produced as government propaganda , mostly during the first and second world wars .
A basic belief for the Christian Right is that America is a ' Christian Nation . '
This belief is one of the most important foundations of every other position they advocate .
So long as people believe that America is a ' Christian ' nation , it should be easier for them to get the government to adopt laws which are based upon or which promote specifically Christian beliefs or doctrines .
Schools are an important component of their efforts to encourage this belief .
Christian schools teach the doctrine outright , but secular public schools cannot -- at least , not yet .
For the time being they can only promote a very vague sort of theism which the courts turn a blind eye to by pretending that it 's no longer truly religious .
The Pledge of Allegiance , with it 's added phrase ' under God , ' plays a significant role here because every day most children recite what amounts to a patriotic affirmation incorporating a religious oath .
In this manner children are encouraged to see patriotism and theism as essentially linked .
Since most tend to come from at least a general Christian background , the Christian god is the only sort of god they 'll have in mind when they say or hear ' under God . '
Even if children do not actively and consciously believe that patriotism requires theism , that America is specially blessed by God , or that Christianity is America 's defining religion , the attitudes and assumptions necessary for such beliefs will be inculcated over years of repetition .
When they are needed , they will be there and they will be ready to exploit .
This image is based upon a World War II poster stating that ' Teaching is War - Work , Too . '
I have replaced the original text with advocacy of the concept that America is a nation ' Under God ' and that you can't be a real American unless you believe in God .
The United States of America is Blessed by God ; Americans are Chosen by God God Bless America God Bless America : The United States of America is Blessed by God ; Americans are Chosen by God to Do His Will .

The idea that God has " blessed " America is integral to Christian Nationalists ' religious and political ideology .
This concept of a blessing is n't about God generally blessing humanity , but is instead the assertion of a special relationship between God and America -- a relationship not unlike the one described in the Old Testament between God and Israel .
Without this special relationship , much of Christian Nationalists ' religious and political agenda would be difficult if not impossible to justify .
For this reason , the belief deserves closer scrutiny and greater criticism .
Christian Nationalists did not invent this .
Puritans saw themselves as a " new Israel , " repeating the biblical story of Exodus by establishing a " City on the Hill " in a " new Canaan " where a purer form of Christianity could develop and which would serve as a moral and religious beacon for the rest of the world .
In John Winthrop 's day America 's mission was to Christianize the world with Puritan Christianity .
In the 1800s the mission was secularized to include " civilizing " the world alongside " Christianizing " it .
Today , America has the mission to " democratize " the world , spreading the values of democracy and capitalism .
Words change and concepts shift , but the similarities are greater and more instructive than the differences .
Framing America as a City on the Hill or " bright hope of humanity " causes it to stop being just a nation and to become , in addition , a religion .
American soldiers are thus portrayed as having entered Iraq not only to liberate its people from a dictator , but also from darkness .
American soldiers become missionaries for the True Faith -- the True American Faith .
Instead of simply killing terrorists and insurgents , they also cast out demons .
Americans themselves are not simply citizens of a nation or even of a great nation ; instead , they are the " chosen people , " blessed for living in the " chosen land " where a the divine project for humanity has reached its highest fulfillment .
" God Bless America " signs or banners are making both a political and religious statement about America having a special relationship with God that sets it apart -- morally , religiously , and politically -- from all other nations .
Not only is this arrogant , but it serves to justify outrageous actions which would n't be tolerated if other nations did it .

Transforming America 's Military into a Christian Military Only Christians Need Apply Only Christians Need Apply : Transforming America 's Military into a Christian Military .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives Christian Nationalists ' efforts to transform American society into an expression of their own religious doctrine naturally extends to the military as well .
The Air Force appears to have been their primary target , though other branches have suffered as well .
In the Air Force academy , for example , Christianity has been promoted and endorsed by officers in a manner that has made non-Christians feel excluded and inferior .
Some have even gone so far as to claim that one of the values of foreign military intervention is to open up new regions for Christian evangelization .
This would in effect transform the military from an instrument of foreign policy and national defense into a religious sword that exists to pry open other nations for the sake of spreading the gospel .
This is a dangerous and irresponsible way of looking at America 's military , but it 's a perspective which appears to be growing in acceptance among Christian Nationalists .
It 's curious that Christians would approach the military in such a manner , but this has been developing for quite some time .
Far more disturbing , and far more common , is the lionization of America 's military within American churches .
Films demonstrating military prowess , recruiters , and American flags may share a stage with the pulpit and cross .
When churches can invite weapons of such violence and destruction into their sanctuaries , it becomes a bit less surprising to see them attempting to enter and transform the military itself into an arm of their religious agenda .
The militarization of Christianity and the Christianization of the military is something which should worry everyone , including moderate and Christians in America .
If Christian Nationalists are able to acquire significant influence through the military , they could effectively acquire a degree of military power within the United States .
There is no example of the militarization of a religion which has turned out well , nor any such example of a military coming under the sway of a particular religion .

Brutal Behavior in the War on Terror Is n't Real Brutality When Christians Do It Real Christians Do No Wrong Real Christians Do No Wrong : Brutal Behavior in the War on Terror Is n't Real Brutality When Christians Do It.
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Northwestern University Although it is technically inconsistent with Christian doctrine for a Christian to regard themselves as incapable of doing wrong , many seem to adopt this on a practical level and especially when it comes to acts designed to further a Christian religious or political agenda .
An action committed by governments like those in Nazi Germany , Soviet Russia , or communist North Korea will be reviled as violations of human rights , but when committed by Christian America in the War on Terror and the War on Islamofascism the same sort of action is welcomed as necessary or even as a sign that the government has our best interests at heart .
Conservative evangelical Christians in America are very vocal and passionate supporters of both the Republican Party and of George W. Bush .
If they think that the Bush administration has done anything " sinful " in the War on Terror , they have been fairly quiet about it .
We hear loud denouncements of abortion and homosexuality on a regular basis .
We do not hear such denouncements of " alternative " and aggressive interrogation methods , of secret prisons in foreign countries where prisoners can be questioned without oversight , of detaining of imprisoning American citizens without charges or trials , of domestic spying without warrants or court oversight , or of assertions of presidential authority to ignore both the courts and Congress .
We can learn a lot about a person and about an ideology by looking at what sorts of actions they choose to condemn and what they choose to accept , facilitate , or even encourage .
Christian Nationalists in America condemn pornography , homosexuality , and gay marriage , They accept , facilitate , or even encourage secret prisons , torture , warrantless domestic spying , imprisoning American citizens without trial , and so forth .
They would condemn ( and have condemned in the past ) such behavior when done by other nations , but it 's suddenly not so wrong when done by their Christian president .
The above image was taken from a World War II poster which also stated as its headline " This is Nazi Brutality , " but the text was about how Nazi troops had killed the men of Lidice , Czechoslovakia and deported all of the women to concentration camps .
The image of a prisoner with a hood over his head is disturbingly close to the iconic photograph from Abu Ghraib , but that may be because brutal regimes keep repeating the same tactics generation after generation .
It 's Not Really Fascism When Christians Do It Christian Fascism , Theocracy in America Christian Fascism in America : If Fascism Comes to America , It Will Come Wrapped in the Flag & Carrying the Cross .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives If Fascism Comes to America , It Will Be Wrapped in the Flag , Carrying the Cross Fascism is a term commonly used as an epithet for any ideology that a person does n't like .
Nevertheless , it is a real political phenomenon which can be defined ( if with some difficulty ) according to particular characteristics .
When we look at what fascism really is , we discover that it is not something which must be limited to Germany and Italy of the mid-20th century .
It is , instead , a phenomenon which might conceivable occur in any nation at any if the conditions are right .
America is no exception .
Robert O. Paxton , a professor emeritus at Columbia University , defines fascism in his book The Anatomy of Fascism as : " A form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline , humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity , energy and purity , in which a mass - based party of committed nationalist militants , working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites , abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion . "
It should be clear that there is nothing fascist about " Islamofascism , " so that 's an example of people using the fascist label as a means of attack rather than as a serious description .
Fascism is more like a religion than it is like a political movement .
Fascism is n't motivated by rational conclusions about economics , political philosophy , or social policy .
This makes real religions like Christianity well suited for integration with a fascist movement .
If fascism occurs in America , it will be Christian in nature because only Christianity has the power to motivate a mass - based movement with a passionate concern for unity , redemption , victimhood , and nationalism .
Christian fascism will also be convinced of its own righteousness , moral purity , and godly intentions .
This image was taken from a World War II poster of an American prisoner of war saying " Do n't Let Me Down " and " You are still free to work . "
Americans are free to work , but how free are they to enjoy the rest of the liberties which Americans fought and died to protect in World War II ?
Overt repression in America has n't started , but once a people unjustly puts others in shackles , they put on their own shackles as well .
One is imprisoned by the brutality of the other ; the latter is imprisoned by the need to perpetuate their own brutal methods lest the repressed rise up .
Now We Can All Sleep Safely , if Lightly Vichy Democrats & God 's Own Republicans have Bipartisan Torture Agreement Now We Can All Sleep Safely , if Lightly : Vichy Democrats & God 's Own Republicans have Bipartisan Torture Agreement .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Nazi Propaganda
Things have gotten pretty bad in America when it becomes unsurprising or even expected that Republicans would support authorizing the state to torture or abuse suspects detained under any circumstances .
The sight of so - called " progressives " from the Democratic Party joining in , though , is enough to make even a cynical person weep with despair .
When a political party stands behind the abandonment of the normal standards of morality or justice in the pursuit of political policy , then they stand behind moral evil .
What does a political party stand for , though , when they are unable or unwilling to stand up against moral evil ?
Can they be described as standing for anything at all ?
Tell me again why secularists and godless liberals need to learn to be more accommodating of liberal religion and liberal Christianity ?
I can't begin to count how many times liberal Christians have lectured to godless liberals about how secularism and secularists harm progressive causes by making the Democratic Party look anti-religion and anti-Christian .
Apparently , Democratic political fortunes would be much better if they could only appear to be more friendly towards religion -- like God 's Own Republicans , for example .
Is the Republican Party really a model to emulate , though ?
The simple and unavoidable fact of the matter is that " secular " Americans ( which must include atheists and agnostics , but probably also some non-religious theists ) are far less likely to support torture under any circumstances than any denomination of Christian Americans .
Christians , in turn , are far more likely to say that torture is sometimes or often justified than secular Americans .
I do n't think that either liberal or conservative Christians have anything to teach non-religious atheists on morality ; if anything , the opposite may be the case .
Given these numbers , is it unreasonable to think that if the Democratic Party were more secular , then perhaps it would be less likely to join God 's Own Republicans in authorizing the torture and abuse of suspects detained by our government ?
Liberal Christians have either failed to imbue the Democratic Party with their moral values , or those values are unable to prevent the support of torture .
Either way , they might want to consider that they could achieve more by a greater secularization of the Democratic Party .

All Hail the King : President George W. Bush God 's Appointed Leader for America , Speaks and Acts for God All Hail the King : President George W. Bush , God 's Appointed Leader for America , Speaks and Acts for God.
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives America is supposed to be a democratic nation founded by " we the people " and based upon the will of the people .
This conception of government contrasted sharply with European traditions that rulers were essentially chosen by God and thus the decisions of rulers were effectively divine mandates .
Unfortunately , more than 200 years of democratic tradition have failed to extinguish the religious impulse to attribute divine agency to democratically elected leaders .
There are many who believe God is responsible for George W. Bush being president -- including , it seems , George W. Bush himself .
There are reports of President Bush claiming that he was chosen by God to be president during this time in history .
There are also reports of Bush claiming that he speaks to God , with God giving him instructions on foreign policy -- including the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
If Bush were alone in this it might simply be dismissed as egotistical delusions , but many of Bush 's Christian supporters completely agree .
They believe that Bush was placed in office by God , that Bush 's authority is derived from this divine mandate , and that Bush 's policies are all the Will of God .
If people believe their leader is placed in charge by gods , they are less likely to question , challenge , or oppose his decisions .
This is what makes such beliefs popular with authoritarian , totalitarian , theocratic , and fascist rulers ; it 's also what makes such beliefs inimical to democratic systems .
If God , not the people , is the sovereign power responsible for Bush being president , then it means Bush is ultimately responsible to God rather than to the people .
Democracy requires the principle that citizens , not gods , choose their leaders and that the government is founded on human reason rather than divine agency .
This is fertile ground for Christian Nationalism and Christian Fascism because it allows for the excision of democracy , democratic elections , the separation of powers , constitutionally protected rights , and everything else which makes America a secular and free nation .
People who say that Bush was placed in office by God are denying that Bush 's authority and office derive from the will of the people .
People who say that Bush is doing the Will of God are denying that the American people have any right to challenge or stop Bush .
All of this is unequivocally anti-democratic .

Civil Liberties Mean Nothing when our Enemies Want to Kill Us Scrap the Constitution Scrap the Constitution : Civil Liberties Mean Nothing when our Enemies Want to Kill Us. Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
One of the most important issues coming out of the international War on Terror is the domestic War on Liberty .
It seems that every nation which has chosen to take part in America 's Crusade against Islamofascism has discovered that they can't fight terrorism while continuing to respect traditional civil liberties .
People are being told by their governments that this is a " new era " and that there are " new challenges " which require us to rethink our old commitments to liberty , freedom , and justice .
Sometimes it 's explicit and sometimes it 's implicit , but the basic message is that we have to choose between liberty and survival .
The ways in which many conservatives , now revealed as actually authoritarians in disguise all along , are seeking to limit or eliminate liberties are varied and numerous .
George W. Bush is led the way by asserting unprecedented power to do whatever he wants in the name of national security : warrantless spying on Americans , military tribunals beyond any other institution 's oversight , torture , secret prisons , indefinite detention without charge or trial , denying American citizens entry into the United States , and much more .
Barack Obama demonstrated that he could go even further by assuming even more power , for example the power to assassinate American citizens anytime and anywhere without any independent review .
Some conservatives managed to find a way to tie in the domestic " Culture Wars " with the international " War on Terrorism " by arguing that Bush was right : " they " hate us because of our " freedom , " but more specifically because we " abuse " our freedom .
The Islamofascists do n't attack us because of our freedom of speech , but because people abuse that freedom by burning flags .
They do n't hate us because of our freedom of religion , but because people abuse that freedom by starting weird cults .
They do n't hate us because of our freedom to marry whom we want , but because we abuse that freedom by having no - fault divorce laws and gay marriage .
Surveys reveal that conservatives and conservative Christians are only too happy to go along with all this .
Members of the political party which has trumpeted the cause of " small government " for so many years seem willing to accept a police state in its place -- almost half of all Republicans are willing to let the government randomly search mail and more and half are OK with the government monitoring telephone conversations , random car searches , random personal searches , and more .

Evolution & Darwinism in Schools Teaching Evolution & Darwinism Encourages Immoral , Bestial Behavior Evolution & Darwinism in Schools : Teaching Evolution & Darwinism Encourages Immoral , Bestial Behavior .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Conservative evangelical Christians believe that evolutionary theory is incompatible with morality , civilization , and of course Christianity .
They have no serious scientific arguments to make against evolution , so it 's most common to see them offering religious , social , and moral arguments against it .
They do n't seem to realize that even if all of these arguments were valid , they would n't constitute good reasons to pretend that evolution is n't true .
One popular anti-evolution argument is a moral one .
According to the Christian Right , evolution teaches that we humans are ultimately descended from animals rather than that we are special beings created in the image of God .
When people believe that God created them specially and that humans are images of God , they are supposedly encouraged to behave more like God wants them .
If kids believe that they are simply another form of animal life , then they are supposedly encouraged to behave like animals .
If kids believe that they are not a special product of divine will , then it is claimed that they will lose hope and stop caring about either their lives or the lives of others .
None of this really follows from evolutionary theory .
At most , it only appears to follow because of the narrow and rigid nature of conservative evangelical Christianity .
This form of Christianity justifies hope , civilization , and moral behavior on such limited and narrow terms that any deviation from the foundation leads to the collapse of the entire structure .
Thus if there is a problem , it 's not with evolution teaching that humans are descended from other animals , but rather than conservative Christians cannot come up with any reason for moral behavior other than the idea that humans were specially created in the image of God and separate from other animals .
The above poster was created by the German government during World War I and said ' Elend und Untergang folgen der Anarchie ' ( Misery and Destruction follow Anarchy ) .
Depicted is an anarchist monster carrying a knife and a gun .
The original was an attempt to urge people not to give in to anarchist criticisms of the war of the German government .
I have replaced the text with the standard canard about the teaching of evolution or Darwinism leading to immoral , even bestial , behavior .
America 's Actions are Just and Decent if Others Behave Worse It 's Not Torture if No One Dies Defining Brutality Downwards : America 's Actions are Just and Decent if Others Behave Worse .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Defining Brutality Downwards America's War on Terrorism has produced significant casualties -- including America 's reputation for respecting human rights .
Time and again stories have leaked out about Americans using torture , brutality , and questionable methods for dealing with or interrogating detainees .
Awful things happen in every war , but these cases are unusually bad for two reasons .
First , they appear to have been authorized from the highest levels rather than being the acts of a few overzealous or poorly trained people ; second , they have been defended and justified to the hilt by religious conservatives who are more commonly seen attacking liberals for their alleged lack of morality .
An important part of Christians ' defense of brutality and torture is the idea that the Islamofascists are doing worse ( like kidnapping people and beheading them for TV ) , so what America has done must be acceptable .
It 's as if America can do anything and remain moral , just so long as the enemy continues to do worse .
That 's a perfect example of relativistic morality , something which the same conservative Christians commonly attack .
Moral relativism is n't so bad when it 's just Muslims who are suffering .
It should n't be a surprise that Christians could have been so violent , brutal , and cruel during eras like the Crusades and Inquisition -- values like " love your neighbor " and " turn the other cheek " simply are n't followed when it 's inconvenient .
Christians , and especially conservative evangelical Christians , have no special moral authority from which they can justifiably criticize others .
The behavior of Christians in this War on Terror makes this particularly clear .
The next time a Christian Nationalist tries to criticize any morality not based on their Bible and their god , find out what they think about American torture , brutality , and injustice in the War on Terror .
If rather than denounce it they start mumbling vague excuses , do n't let them get away with this -- call them on it , and denounce them for their unethical attempts to justify inhumane behavior .
Point out to them that surveys show how secular , nonreligious Americas are less likely to accept torture as justified under any circumstances .
If that is n't a sign of being more moral , what is ?

Cleansing the Community of Infection via Redemptive Violence Encouraging Christian Violence Encouraging Christian Violence : Cleansing the Community of Infection via Redemptive Violence .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
An important component of fascism , and one which has n't entirely developed in America even among movements which tend to appear very fascist in their approach , is the idea that violence is a redemptive act which allows a chosen few to transform society -- usually through the elimination of certain minorities .
Thus for the Nazis the elimination of the Jews was n't simply because the Jews were hated for themselves but also because violence against them allowed the German Volk to redeem themselves and show themselves worthy of the position due them .
This has n't really appeared in full force in America , but that 's not to say that some have n't tried .
The above image , based upon a World War II poster describing the importance of oil in the war effort , uses the words of Ann Coulter at a speech where she encouraged audience members to deal with protesters : " You 're men .
You 're heterosexuals .
Take them out . "
Notice the implicit taunt in which she mocks the masculinity of the men who have not yet of their own accord acted violently .
This presumes that true manliness is based upon violent behavior and encourages said violence by making non-violent men feel inadequate .
We should also keep in mind that the fascist gangs of brownshirts which played such a decisive role in the rise of Nazi fascism in Germany were motivated in no small way by a perceived need to both display their manliness and to ward off encroaching femininity .
Weimar culture was attacked for being too weak , passive , and feminine .
Even traditional Christianity was attacked for being too feminine -- many Protestant preachers advocated a more " manly " Jesus who rolled up his sleeves and engaged in violence rather then turning the other cheek .
Thus , the words and ideas which Ann Coulter are using are not an aberration ; they are , instead , a standard feature of the fascist perspective .
We are fortunate this has n't taken hold in America , but that 's not an excuse to dismiss such incidents .
People like Ann Coulter will normally try to excuse their words by saying that they are just jokes , but they are n't .
Encouraging violence like this is never a joke ; when it occurs in a context like this , though , it 's nothing less than a appeal for the creation of fascist storm troopers .
That 's not joke , that 's a specific threat against our democratic order .
Should it gain any traction , it could provide the basis for the development of a genuinely fascist Christian movement .
Christian Nationalists Assuming Control & Authority over Meaning of the Flag This Flag is Our Flag This Flag is Our Flag : Christian Nationalists Assuming Control & Authority over Meaning of the American Flag .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
One area where Christian Nationalists have attempted to exercise more subtle control over American culture is through the American flag .
Efforts to ban flag burning have a lot in common with efforts to ban gay marriage as well as a host of other hot - button conservative issues .
The issue is not the issue : it 's not about burning or protecting flags and it's not about protecting the sanctity of marriage .
It 's about retaining control over important cultural symbols upon which people base their identities .
Why do so many religious and political conservatives insist that same - sex marriages " threaten " and " undermine " traditional heterosexual marriages ?
Marriage is not just an institution , but also a symbol of a culture 's ideals about sex , sexuality , and human relationships .
Such symbols are a common cultural currency which we use to help create our sense of self .
Thus when the nature of marriage is challenged , so are people 's basic identities .
Flag burning fits in here because it's a way in which people seek to radically alter others ' perceptions of the flag as not just a symbol within the culture , but as a symbol of America as a whole .
Bans on flag burning and desecration are a way to avoid discussing what the flag as a symbol means and what America itself should stand for .
They are saying to everyone : " This is our country .
This is our flag .
If you do n't adopt our meanings , you do n't belong . "
For Christian Nationalists , a ban on burning or desecrating the American flag is just the beginning : it represents a first step towards taking rights away from political minorities and establishing the power of a majority to dictate the terms of public discourse .
They talk about the " right of the majority to rule , " which in this case means the power of the majority to dictate to everyone how exactly the flag will be treated , what it will mean , and what sort of relationship one is allowed to have with the flag .
Christian Nationalists hope that this will open the door to similar changes in other areas of law .
If the majority has the power to censor certain forms of political speech , why not other speech and expression such as pornography ?
If the they are given the power to determine the meaning of the flag for everyone , why not also the power to determine the meaning and importance of the Ten Commandments for everyone ?

Beware of Skepticism , Atheism , Secularism Faith is So Important that Skepticism , Questioning , Doubt are Intolerable Beware of Skepticism , Atheism , Secularism : Faith is So Important that Skepticism , Questioning , Doubt are Intolerable .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Library of Medicine Faith is a critical pillar in the religious ideology of Christian Nationalists .
Faith here is not simply a religious virtue , but also a political and social necessity .
Just as one must have faith in God , one is also expected to have faith in the basic goodness and competence of political leaders who are acting as representatives of the Will of God .
Without faith , the political and religious claims of Christian Nationalism crumble into the sea .
For this reason , doubt and skepticism must be treated as basic enemies .
This obviously includes being subjected to the critical questioning of a nonbeliever who offers good reasons to doubt the reliability of the claims being made .
Such attitudes may be an important reason why atheists and skeptics tend to be so reviled by conservative evangelicals : the very existence of atheists is perceived as a threat because they demonstrate how a person can live and even thrive without faith in any gods .
The denigration of doubt goes further , though , and includes for example efforts to cover up anything which would cause people to doubt religious leaders and institutions .
Scandals , crimes , and hypocrisy are swept under the rug " for the sake of the community " and uncomfortable truths are suppressed as much as possible .
The flip - side of this is the promotion of falsehoods which are thought to bolster faith .
In the past such falsehoods were called " pious myths " and often involved someone suffering or dying for their faith as a means to encourage others to persevere in the face of great challenges .
Today these myths may depict nonbelievers trying to suppress believers or believers winning amazing arguments against skeptics .
No one seems to care if the stories are true or not -- they pass the tales along as if they were simply because they make believers feel better about themselves ... and worse about skeptics .
The above image was taken , as one might guess , from a World War II poster warning members of the armed forces about women who look " clean " but might be carrying sexually transmitted diseases .
I chose this to convey the idea of warning Christians to be careful about whom they date because of the irony : a number of Christians groups encourage members to date outsider for no reason other than to gain new recruits and " save " their souls .

Christian Nationalism & Christian Fascism Christian Nationalism & Christian Fascism : What Will it Take to Cause Christian Nationalism to Become Fully Fascist ?.
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Nazi Propaganda What Will it Take to Cause Christian Nationalism to Become Fully Fascist ?
Many are disturbed about far - right movements in America displaying too many characteristics of fascism .
The central organizing ideology behind these groups is Christian Nationalism , the belief that America should have its cultural , legal , and political institutions organized along narrowly defined conservative , evangelical Christian lines .
Christian Nationalist movements exhibit many of the basic characteristics of fascist movements except for one : organized , militant groups willing and able to use violence to achieve their goals .
There have been attempts to create such militant gangs , for example the militia movement , but none have had broad success .
More recently vocal representatives of Christian Nationalism have encouraged people to become more militant .
Ann Coulter , for example , has asked " Where are the skinheads when you need one " in the context of driving someone out of Yale and said to a crowd " You 're men .
You 're heterosexuals .
Take 'em out . " in response to critics of a speech she was giving .
Especially serious are remarks from Michael Savage who said on his radio show that he wants all licensed gun owners to organize in their neighborhoods and " learn how to create a homeland defense system in this country . "
He also said that he wants the militarization of our children : " They 're training their sons to use an AK - 47 , and we 're teaching our sons how to swing a baseball bat .
Tell me who wins that fight .
... I have nothing against baseball , but the times do n't call for an obsession with sports .
They call for a militarization of our children . "
This sounds like a call for the organization of armed gangs in our neighborhoods and the training of our children to become foot soldiers in an uncontrolled American army -- a militia answerable only to whatever leaders are able to hold their attention .
This would be nothing less than an American equivalent of the SA , the brownshirts whose street battles in Weimar Germany helped the NSDAP acquire power .
Rather than allowing children in America to enjoy childhood , he wants to enlist them in a war against " Islamofascism . "
Most look at the militarization of children in other nations with dismay ; proto - fascists in America look at this as a model to emulate .

Control of Women 's Sexuality & Reproductive Organs Men Asserting Authority Over Reproduction and Women Control of Women 's Sexuality & Reproductive Organs : Men Asserting Authority Over Reproduction and Women . Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress
It has become almost a cliche for the Christian Right to denigrate the idea that women should be able to make their own decisions about their reproductive organs , their reproductive processes , and whether they will even reproduce or not .
In effect , this takes very basic decisions about a woman 's body and bodily functions away from her -- but if she is not in control of them , who is ?
Power and authority over women 's reproductive processes are placed in the hands of men : whether it 's men in their lives like husbands and fathers or predominantly male institutions like churches .
In the past , reproduction was controlled almost exclusively by social rather than chemical means ; because women were generally denied basic rights and privileges accorded to men , this means that the social control of reproduction was almost entirely in the hands of men .
Granting women equal civil rights -- like the right to vote , to choose whom to marry , and to divorce -- was the first step in changing this situation .
Once women had the authority to make decisions about their own marriages , they had greater power to make decisions about whether and when they would have children .
The advent of chemical birth control played an even bigger role in transferring power over reproduction to women .
In the past physical birth control was the responsibility of men .
Today , birth control pills allow women to take personal control over their own reproductive processes .
Women , acting independently , can virtually guarantee that they will not get pregnant and this frees them up to make more decisions about when and with whom they will have sex .
Most of these changes occurred or really gained force in the past half century and conservative Christianity simply has not had time to catch up -- assuming it ever will .
The Christian Right relies heavily upon nostalgia for the " good old days " when women could n't make their own , independent decisions about reproduction and sexual behavior .
The corollary to this which often goes unspoken is that men would make all the decision for women .
The above image was taken from a World War II poster which is disturbing close to the theme here .
It 's of a woman saying " I 'm proud ... my husband wants me to do my part . "
In other words , she 's proud of her husband for not just grudgingly allowing her to enter the work force , but actually wanting her to do so .
Of course , she certainly lost her job and was relegated to being a homemaker as soon as the war was over .
Democrats Seek a Liberal Fascism in America & Christian Men Must Stand Firm Christians Standing Up to the Demofascists Christians Standing Up to the Demofascists : Democrats Seek a Liberal Fascism in America & Christians Must Stand Firm .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives Fascism is more popular as an epithet rather than as a neutral description .
People tend to label as " fascist " any ideology they do n't like or which they see as threatening .
Conservatives and Christian Nationalists appear to be becoming enamored of combining it with other labels as a smear against beliefs and positions they want to discredit .
Thus it's not Islam or Islamic extremism , but Islamofascism -- even though Islamic extremism has no or almost no characteristics of a real fascism .
We are also hearing about Demofascists as a substitute for Godless Liberals and Godless Sodomites .
Is there anything genuinely fascist about the political platform of the Democratic party or about the common attitudes of liberals in America ?
It 's true that fascism can be difficult to define because it takes on a very different guise in each culture where it develops , but there are common characteristics which have been identified and which scholars tend to focus on .
None of them apply to the Democratic party specifically or liberals generally .
Demofascist is thus as much of a misnomer as Islamofascist , but why is it being used ?
It 's possible that those using these words really do n't understand what fascism is and think that they are being clever for coming up with new way to smear those whom they dislike .
Just as possible , and far more disturbing , is the possibility that this is a deliberate attempt to inure people to seeing the fascist label , to render the label meaningless , and / or to deflect attention from their own behavior .
The sad fact of the matter is that the political movements which exhibit a significant number of genuinely fascist elements are Christian Nationalism and other far - right groups whose ideologies have had influence within the Republican Party .
This is not to say that they are fascists -- there are few genuine fascists in America -- though they might fairly be described as " proto - fascists . "
If one is concerned , though , that the fascist label might be too true for comfort , using it to attack everyone else is one way to prevent others from realizing this and deflect attention from one 's growing fascist agenda .
The above image is based on a World War II poster exhorting munitions workers to " Keep Em Coming . "
I 've used it to reference the use of Demofascists as if they were genuine fascists like in World War II , the idea that the conflict is between Christians and fascists , and the idea that violently combatting enemies is a manly task .

In theory , a " real Christian man " should perhaps be someone who eschews violence of all sorts , who turns the other cheek whenever they are struck , and who insists on favoring peace over war no matter what the circumstances .
That 's the theory , at least , but it 's rarely the reality .
Not only have many Christian men throughout history eagerly engaged in violent combat , but not a few have treated combat as a test of one 's Christian manliness .
The links between a willingness to fight in war or to violently confront one 's enemies on the one hand and disdain of women and homosexuality on the other should not be underestimated .
War is a task for " real men " and women are excluded from combat roles while gays are excluded from the military entirely .
If women and gays were allowed to openly and equally fight alongside heterosexual men , how could combat remain a sign of heterosexual masculinity ?
That this is also linked with Christian Nationalism is curious .
In America there have been several movements to disentangle Jesus from meek pacifism .
Many conservative evangelical leaders have promoted a vision of Jesus as confrontational , assertive , aggressive , combative , and even a little violent .
This " Battling Jesus " is willing to step up to take direct , even violent action in the name of a just cause .
Once Jesus could be seen as a " man 's man , " ready and willing to let his fists do his talking rather than meekly turn the other cheek , it could n't have been too difficult to link war and combat , manliness and heterosexuality , with Christianity and the proper social roles of Christian men .
A great deal of this is probably due to the need of evangelical Christianity to conform to the social mores of the antebellum south where masculinity was commonly defined by gambling , drinking , duels , and the violent defense of personal honor .
How great is the difference between engaging in duels to defend " personal honor " and going to war to defend a nation 's " international credibility " ?
Today efforts to insist that America 's fight against " Islamofascism " is a test of Christianity and of America 's masculine resolve almost cries out for ridicule and satire .
It 's the theme of Jesus ' General , which was an inspiration for the above image .
The original was a World War II poster exhorting workers to " Keep 'em Fighting " because " Production Wins Wars . "
Is it coincidence that for an image promoting fighting , they chose a bare - chested man holding something awfully large and suggestive ?
Godless Sodomites are Enemies of Christianity & the Bible Christians ' Religious Liberty Threatened by Godless Sodomites Godless Sodomites are Enemies of Christianity & the Bible : Christians ' Religious Liberty Threatened by Godless Sodomites .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : Northwestern University
It can be difficult for extremists on the Christian Right to convince everyone else that their desire to discriminate against gays , women , atheists , and sundry non-Christians is justified or appropriate in America .
The " American Way " is supposed to be freedom and equality , not privilege and discrimination .
This means that the best tactic for convincing others that discrimination and oppression are necessary is to convince them that it 's somehow to preserve freedom .
It 's an Orwellian tactic to get people to believe that War is Peace in this manner , but it can be amazingly persuasive if framed correctly .
For Christian Nationalists , the basic argument they use runs something like this : denying Christians the ability to discriminate against gays prevents them from freely " exercising " their religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral .
Therefore , denying Christians the ability to discrimination is an unconstitutional infringement on their First Amendment rights .
Godless Sodomites are thus the enemy of Christianity , of biblical scriptures , and of basic religious liberties .
A similar argument can be made for all the other groups Christian Nationalists would discriminate against .
If you believe this , then you have been convinced that discriminating against gays and infringing on their civil liberties is necessary to protect the religious liberties of Christian extremists .
A more extreme version of this argument , promulgated by even more extreme Christians , is the that gays , atheists , secularists , and others are involved in a conspiracy to destroy Christianity itself .
Whether knowingly in league with Satan or merely unwitting dupes , they actively seek the elimination of Christianity and perhaps of Christians themselves .
It 's not Christians ' religious liberties that are threatened , but the future of Christianity itself .
Such paranoia feeds extremism ; the belief that one is fighting for one 's existence justifies abandoning normal standards of justice morality , making such arguments exceptionally dangerous .
This image is based on a World War II propaganda poster depicting the same hand sticking the same knife through the Bible .
The only difference is that instead of " Godless Sodomites " on the wrist , the original poster has a swastika to symbolize the threat posed by the Nazis to Christianity .
Few people at the time realized , or perhaps wanted to believe , the strong connections that existed between Nazism and German Christianity .
Gay Agenda vs. Civil Liberty Radical Homosexual Lobby is a Threat to Religious , Civil Liberty in America Gay Agenda vs. Civil Liberty : Radical Homosexual Lobby is a Threat to Religious , Civil Liberty in America .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
A major subject of the ire of Christian Nationalists is homosexuality -- in particular , efforts to protect gay Americas from discrimination on the basis of their homosexuality .
Conservative evangelical Christians profess to " love " gays and only " hate " their sin of homosexuality , but for some reason their " love " does n't translate into refusing to discriminate against them or refusing to treat them as inferior , second - class citizens .
Christian Nationalists claim that being prevented from discriminating against gays would infringe upon their religious and civil rights , a position beset with fatal problems .
It assumes that actively discriminating against gays , rather than just expressing disapproval of homosexuality , is required by their religion .
Even if this were true , they also assume that they have a religious liberty interest in discriminating against gays which is more important than gays ' civil liberty interest in being treated equal under the law .
Finally , it assumes that there is something about homosexuality which justifies such a position even though this argument would never even be made , much less taken seriously , if the targets of discrimination were Jews , women , or blacks .
It 's important to remember what the opposition to laws protecting gays from discrimination really means .
These laws would prevent people from discriminating against gays when renting apartments and selling houses , so Christian Nationalists support the ability of bigots to deny gays fair housing .
These laws prevent people from firing and refusing to hire , promote , or give bonuses to people just because they are gay , so Christian Nationalists support the ability of bigots to deny gays equal jobs and wages .
These laws prevent people from refusing to provide medical , legal , accounting , and other basic services to gays , so Christian Nationalists support the ability of bigots to deny gays the same services everyone else takes for granted .
The image above is based upon a World War II poster describing " Willful Absenteeism " as striking at our liberty .
It 's disturbingly similar to the " Stab in the Back " myth which helped animate support for the Nazis and other far - right nationalists in Germany .
Christian Nationalists today seem to view support for the equal rights of gay Americans as a betrayal of American principles and an assault on freedom -- their freedom to discriminate .

Given the relatively small numbers of atheists in America , it 's curious that they would be portrayed as such an incredible threat .
Even if we take into account the larger numbers of irreligious , secular , and atheistic people in other Western countries , they still do n't seem to be big enough to constitute any sort of menace .
Then there is the fact that in countries where atheists are a small minority , they are an even smaller minority in prisons ; countries which are more generally irreligious and secular have lower rates of violent crime than countries with higher rates of religious theism .
So what 's going on ?
Where 's the big threat being posed by irreligious atheists ?
There are a couple of things which Christian Nationalists have in mind .
Many are worried that atheists undermine the allegedly biblical basis for American law , even though no such basis can be identified .
Others worry that atheists will persecute Christians in the same way that Christian Nationalists attack non-Christians .
More than a few express concern over communism -- something that might have been half - way reasonable 10 or 20 years ago , but it 's persistence today reveals a lack of imagination on the part of Christians who keep bringing it up .
What might be more serious is something that is generally left unsaid : atheists represent a specter of doubt , questioning , skepticism , criticism , and even blasphemy .
Irreligious atheists are like metaphysical anarchists who do not submit to the authority of any religious institution , not even those of " false " religions , and thus feel free to criticize all religions .
Irreligious atheists call into question the validity of religion generally just by the fact of their very existence .
By living , and worse yet by living well , they demonstrate the irrelevancy of religion to having a good life .
Christians Nationalists do n't understand how they do it , but they know that it 's intolerable .
Irreligious atheists are a threat to the leaders of Christian Nationalism for the simple reason that their existence demonstrates that religious leaders just are n't needed .
Worse than any criticism is to be laughed at , and worse still is to be dismissed as irrelevant , unneeded , and unimportant .
At least when people are laughing at you they are taking you seriously enough to make jokes about you ; when you are completely irrelevant , however , you are ignored .

Submission & Obedience to Husbands Women Must Submit to Husbands in Marriage , Church in All Things Submission & Obedience to Husbands : Women Must Submit to Husbands in Marriage , Church in All Things .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Carefully structured and clearly organized hierarchies of power appear to be very important not only to Christian Nationalists , but conservative and fundamentalist religious believers of all types .
This concern extends along the entire spectrum of power relationships , including most especially the power relationships within the smallest , most fundamental social unity of society : the family .
According to Christian Nationalists , the role of the woman requires her to be subordinate , obedient , and helpful while the man 's role requires him to take charge , lead , and make the tough decisions .
Such ideas about how husbands and wives should relate were at one time uncontroversial , but today the rest of society has changed too much for such attitudes to be accepted uncritically anymore .
Modern society has made great strides towards the emancipation of women , something which conservative evangelicals and fundamentalists find abhorrent .
There are regular stories about conservative churches attempting to stem the tide by becoming even more reactionary and misogynistic than a strict interpretation of their doctrines requires .
There is no question but that such acts merit criticism , but no criticism can be considered informed and reliable without taking into account what I described at the outset above : efforts to keep women " in their place " are merely part of a larger desire to see all power relationships be made more strict and more clear .
Conservative evangelical Christians perceive a strict hierarchy between God and humans which must be replicated in the social and political spheres .
Children must obey parents ; wives must obey husbands ; Christians must obey ministers ; citizens must obey leaders .
It is believed that problems in society stem from the chaos of too much freedom , too much license , and weakened expectations about one 's social role .
Women who voluntarily enter or remain in extremely patriarchal religious communities cite as one of their primary reasons the fact that their social and familial roles are clearly laid out , as are their expectations of husbands , children , and neighbors .
Clarity of purpose , place , and direction mean a lot to some people .

One thing which has confused many observers is Christian Nationalists ' intransigent opposition to almost anything designed to improve or protect the environment .
Their opposition to abortion and homosexuality make some sense ; their opposition to lowering pollution levels and fighting global warming do not .
Even if the proposed measures were flawed in some fashion , there are n't any theological principles at issue -- are there ?
In fact there are .
Christian Nationalists oppose environmental legislation for several reasons , almost all of which are basically religious .
The one possible political reason for Christian Nationalists ' opposition to most environmental legislation is the fact that they are in a political alliance with business interests which oppose this legislation on financial grounds .
Supporting the legislation would mean opposing their usual political allies and it makes sense that they would n't want to do this .
On the other hand , Christian Nationalists do n't normally give in when they have theological issues at stake , so it 's not clear just how strong of a reason this really is .
The more important reasons are religious .
In the first place , many sincerely believe that because the Bible says God will provide , then this means that there are sufficient natural resources for everyone on the planet .
They do n't believe that there is any real crisis , so there is no reason to conserve or recycle because we wo n't run out .
We especially do n't need to limit population growth .
Any effort to do such things is a sign that one does n't really believe in God 's promise that he will provide .
If they are n't hypocrites , these Christians also do n't save money or buy much beyond their immediate needs .
God will provide , after all .
A second and perhaps larger reason is the popular belief that the End Times are close .
The End Times are always close and there are always signs that it is approaching ; today , these signs include flood , drought , hurricanes , and other ecological problems .
These Christians may not even dispute that there are severe environmental problems because they just do n't care .
If the disasters are a sign of the Second Coming , it does n't make much sense to fix them .
If the world will end soon , it does n't make much sense to worry about the environment .
Christian Nationalists have other concerns .

America 's Problems are Due to Godlessness and Godless Liberals Crush the Godless Liberals Crush the Godless Liberals : All of America 's Problems are Due to Godlessness and Godless Liberals .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives Political movements that are driven by fear and that promote authoritarian government typically require a scapegoat : some group upon which people 's fears can be projected and against which authoritarian measures appear justified .
There are several groups in America which Christian Nationalists have used as scapegoats , with gays and humanists being among the most popular .
In recent years , however , all of the scapegoats have become lumped together into a single group : Godless Liberals .
According to Christian Nationalists , every problem in American society ( and quite a few non-problems which they have invented ) are due to the unwholesome actions or policies of Godless Liberals .
Godless Liberals are blamed for the increased social acceptance of homosexuality and the drive for gay marriage , for the legalization of abortion and increased used of contraceptives , for the amounts of sexual imagery in our media and the failure of teens to remain celibate until marriage , for the increasingly secular nature of public institutions and the strength of non-Christian voices in public debates .
In short , everything which Christian Nationalists do n't like about America today is blamed on Godless Liberals and the solution , they claim , is to give them a free hand at transforming society at will -- to remake America into their own image which they claim is how America was originally designed to be .
As bad as all this sounds , we must remember that scapegoats are not treasured pets ; on the contrary , scapegoats are generally meant to be eliminated from society in order to purify it .
Attacks on Godless Liberals are not simple political disagreements where people have differing opinions while being able to respect the others ' position .
The rhetoric of Christian Nationalists tends to be violent and even eliminationist in nature .
Christian Nationalists do n't want an accommodation with liberals , godless or otherwise , nor are they interested in reaching some sort of political compromise .
Nothing less than the elimination of godless liberalism and the carriers of this infection is their goal .
Few openly advocate violence and those who do try to justify their words as mere jokes , but this is n't a laughing matter and it's something we should all be concerned with .

Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress
A popular myth for the Christian Right is the idea that atheists forced God , prayer , and Bible reading out of public schools , leading to social , moral , and educational disasters which continue to plague America .
By promoting such beliefs , the Christian Right encourages people to think that atheists are a threat to religious liberty as well as social order , that America is worse off than it once was , and that proper Christianity is the solution to everything troubling us .
Every aspect of this myth is wrong .
First , God , prayer , and Bible reading were not removed from public schools .
All three are still there , but under the auspices of the private actions of individual students .
What was removed were state - written and state - mandated prayers , state - mandated reading of state - chosen Bibles , and official endorsements of particular conceptions of God .
These changes were unequivocal victories for the religious liberties of children and parents .
Second , atheists were not responsible -- they were involved in some of the lawsuits , but so were Christians .
If the atheists ' cases had never existed , the results would have been the same .
Finally , the problems attributed to these changes cannot be blamed on them .
There is some correlation in time between the changes and some social problems , but there were many social changes occurring at the same time .
Perhaps the most important was racial integration .
Not long before courts forced public schools to stop choosing and mandating prayers or Bible readings , they also forced schools to end long - standing racial segregation .
Many of the people who complained loudest about the end to religious indoctrination in public schools had already been on the forefront of complaints about the end to racial segregation .
The correlation between social problems and racial integration is at least as strong as that between those problems and the elimination of state - mandated prayers .
Why do n't conservatives blame integration and argue for a return to segregation ?
If they do n't believe that a causal connection exists here , then they cannot claim that one exists between the religion cases and social problems .
The above image was created from a World War I poster about the need to feed motherless , fatherless , and starving children in war - torn France .
I have replaced the text with the claim that the destruction in the background is because of the secularist removal of God from schools and that this is something America should avoid .
Christian Nationalists Believe Bush Was Chosen by God , not by the People Thank God for George W. Bush Thank God for George W. Bush : Christian Nationalists Believe Bush Was Chosen by God , not by the People .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress
An important facet of Christian Nationalist ideology is the principle that God selects the nation 's leaders .
When leaders are good , it 's because God wants them to lead the nation to victory .
When leaders are bad , it 's because God wants them to lead the nation to defeat as punishment for its sins .
The idea that a nation 's leaders are divinely selected is probably as old as religion itself .
It allows for tighter integration of religious and political institutions , with religious figures backing the leader 's claims to divine election and the leader backing the religious figures ' claims to divine authority .
If people believe their leader is placed in charge by gods , they are less likely to question , challenge , or oppose his decisions .
This is what makes such beliefs popular with authoritarian , totalitarian , theocratic , and fascist rulers ; it 's also what makes such beliefs inimical to democratic systems .
Democracy requires the principle that citizens , not gods , choose their leaders and that the government is founded on human reason rather than divine agency .
Both the American Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were written under a conscious rejection of Europe 's long - standing belief in the Divine Right of Kings -- the idea that monarchs owe their rule to the will of God rather than the will of the people .
Unfortunately , over 200 years of democratic tradition have failed to extinguish the religious impulse to attribute divine agency to democratically elected leaders .
There are many who believe God is responsible for George W. Bush being president -- including , it seems , George W. Bush himself .
This is a problem because if God , not the people , is the sovereign power responsible for Bush being president , then it means Bush is ultimately responsible to God rather than to the people .
Bush 's job becomes doing the will of God , at least as he interprets it , rather than the will of the people or to serve the interests of the people .
This is fertile ground for Christian Nationalism and Christian Fascism because it allows for the excision of democracy , democratic elections , the separation of powers , constitutionally protected rights , and everything else which makes America a secular and free nation .
The above image was created from a World War I poster describing how the " Victory Fund Campaign " ( and presumably religious faith ) " sustained him " and " supported the war - time agencies that helped him . "
What Would Jesus Do? Strike Down the Islamofascists !

Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Christianity is supposed to be a religion of peace .
Despite that , Christians often find themselves embroiled in violent conflicts where their religion is utilized to motivate them to kill .
There are plenty of nasty examples in history and the Crusades stand out as especially strong , but Christians in modern America are not immune from the call to go out and kill despite the injunction from their Lord and Savior to not strike out against those who hit you .
Today 's most popular target of rhetoric encouraging violence are the " Islamofascists . "
Muslim extremists are n't anywhere even remotely close to fascists , but a label incorporating " fascist " helps people believe that they are in a fight for world civilization not unlike the fight against fascism and the Nazis in the mid-20th century .
This is important not just because political and religious leaders evidently think that their cause is so weak that they can't advance it without associating the current enemy with a past one .
It is also important because of what it says about their goals .
When people fight against an enemy who is presumed to be an existential threat - a threat to one 's existence and the future of civilization itself - then it is easier to justify all manner of extremist responses .
Niceties like civil liberties and human rights may be appropriate for parlor - room conversations in peace time , but when locked in a violent struggle where defeat means the end of one 's existence and the end of a civilization that can even conceive of civil or human rights , then it hardly seems appropriate to tie one 's hands and risk losing everything .
This is how the struggle against fascism and Nazism was portrayed , and there was some justification to that .
Even so , standards of civil rights and human rights were generally upheld .
Today the Christians associating the threat Muslim extremism with the existential threat of fascism are also those who tend to dismiss the idea that traditional standards of civil rights or human rights must be maintained .
Is that What Jesus Would Do ?
The above poster was created from an American World War I poster encouraging people to give to the Victory Fund campaign .
The original text was " Shall Chaos Triumph " and evidently meant for people to give as much as possible to advance the military campaign against the Huns - who during this era were described in terms not too different from how American Christians today describe the " Islamofascists " among Muslims .
America as a Christian Nation , America as a White Nation Racism & White Supremacy in American Christianity America as a Christian Nation , America as a White Nation : Racism & White Supremacy in American Christianity .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives Conservative , evangelical Christianity in America is not inherently or necessarily racist .
However , there has been significant convergence between racism , White Supremacy , and conservative Christianity throughout American history .
Not only have conservative evangelical Christians been leading defenders of slavery , racism , and segregation , but there are aspects of evangelical doctrine which encourage the continuation of racist outcomes .
Evangelical Christianity 's development as a defender of racist social structures was n't inevitable from a theological standpoint , but it was necessary from a political one : itinerant evangelical preachers in the South made little headway so long as they retained their revolutionary attitudes .
In order to become more accepted socially , they had find acceptance by society 's leading figures : the white gentry .
This led to numerous changes , including a new emphasis on the supremacy of whites over blacks , pushing women to the margins , acceptance of sinful behavior like drinking and gambling , and stronger defenses of social order .
Southern evangelical churches ended up on the forefront of defending slavery against Northern abolitionist movements , also generally originating in evangelical churches .
Southern churches framed the defense of slavery as a religious cause and the Civil War as a Religious War .
They lost , but hateful theology never dies -- it just goes underground and waits for new opportunities .
In this case , the same basic theology arose again in the fight over segregation a century later .
Today few conservative evangelical Christians are openly racist , but some doctrines encourage racist outcomes .
Evangelical Christianity encourages conformity and discourages efforts that " rock the boat , " even if to achieve justice .
Sharing the gospel takes precedence over social justice for minorities .
Evangelical Christianity also generally denies the moral agency of institutions -- thus institutional racism cannot exist and so long as individuals are themselves not racist , then social outcomes must be racism - free .
If it appears that blacks are failing , it must be their own fault .
A few Christians do remain openly racist , and sometimes they justify their racism or White Supremacy on the basis of Christian doctrine , just as their ancestors did .
Christian racism is also not limited to conservative evangelicals .
We can find it across the spectrum of Christian denominations , including Catholicism .
Secular Schools are Hostile to Religion You 're Attacking Christianity if You 're Not Actively Endorsing Christianity Secular Schools are Hostile to Religion : You 're Attacking Christianity if You 're Not Actively Endorsing Christianity .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
A popular claim made by many Christian Nationalists is that the absence of any explicit endorsement of their religion by public schools - or indeed by government generally - represents an expression of hostility towards their religion .
In particular , it is their position that the failure of schools to promote creationism , Bible reading , Christian prayers , and other examples of Christian beliefs means that the schools are effectively denigrating those beliefs .
Thus the fact that schools do n't explicitly endorse Jesus , either through images of Jesus hanging in schools or in school lessons , is treated as though schools were actually trying to take Jesus away from children .
This is the example represented in the above image , taken originally from World War II poster of a girl holding a picture of her father and imploring people not to " kill her daddy with careless talk . "
The very idea that schools are taking Jesus away from children by not explicitly promoting Jesus to them is absurd .
There are lots of things which schools do not explicitly endorse or promote , but this cannot be construed as an effort to denigrate or undermine them .
Schools obviously do n't promote other religions like Buddhism or Hinduism , so does this mean that they are trying to undermine those religions ?
Schools generally do n't promote any particular liberal or conservative political doctrines , so does this mean that the schools are trying to attack those doctrines ?
Of course not - I do n't think that there is any other segment of society where such claims are made and such beliefs promoted .
There are far more things which the government and government institutions do n't promote than they do promote , but no one actually believes that the government is therefore attacking all those beliefs .
At worst people might despair over the neglect of their favorite causes , but that 's about it .
Only Christian Nationalists have gotten the idea that the absence of endorsement is the presence of hostility .
Training Christian Students to Take Dominion Over America Conservative Christian Schools Conservative Christian Schools : Training Christian Students to Take Dominion Over America .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : National Archives
A basic belief of the most extreme elements of the Christian Right , and one which is gaining traction in the rest of the movement , is the idea that God has given Dominion over the planet generally and America in particular to Christians .
This is as much a political as a theological doctrine and leads such Christians to the belief that they have been authorized by God to assume political control of the United States .
They mean to ensure that America is a " Christian Nation " in every sense of the word -- historically , culturally , legally , and politically .
Whereas the language of theocracy often seems to be more a rhetorical strategy for many on the Christian right , for Dominionists it 's a deliberate expression of a conscious agenda .
It is for this reason that they can accurately be labeled " Christian Nationalists , " for they are Christians who seek to transform America into a nation defined exclusively along the doctrinal and theological lines of their brand of Christianity .
An important component of this agenda naturally lies in the education of young people .
Public schools are under constant attack for being secular , for not promoting Christianity , for having classes dealing with sexuality or evolution , and so forth .
In their place , conservative evangelicals are promoting special Christian schools where ideology trumps education and reality .
These schools may teach creationism over evolution , a warped view of history ( especially American history ) , and worse .
The above image was originally taken from a World War II poster which said " This is America ... ... where every boy can dream of being President .
Where free schools , free opportunity , free enterprise , have built the most decent nation on earth .
A nation built upon the rights of all men .
This is your America ... Keep it Free ! "
This sentiment is much the opposite of the Christian Nationalists who do n't want to see anyone by Christians hold elected offices , who want to see an end to free public schools , and who do n't really believe in any " rights " not constrained by Christian doctrines .
Pregnancy as a Punishment for Sex ?
Women Should Suffer the Consequences of Sex and Sexual Activity Pregnancy as a Punishment for Sex ?
Women Should Suffer the Consequences of Sex and Sexual Activity .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Northwestern University Library Conservative evangelical objections to contraception , emergency contraception , and even abortion can often be traced at least in part to their objections to " irresponsible " sexual activity .
Attempts to avoid pregnancy are thus attempts to avoid the consequences of one 's " irresponsible " choices .
Since avoiding the consequences of irresponsible choices is itself irresponsible as well as something which makes such choices easier , it follows that people should be forced to bear those consequences .
When it comes to sexual activity , this includes women accepting pregnancy .
Many will deny that they perceive pregnancy as a " punishment " or something which women must " suffer , " but a close examination of common language and arguments reveals that this attitude often lurks beneath the surface .
It may be an unconscious attitude , so those who deny it may be sincere and really not realize what they are doing .
Hopefully , if they reflect upon it enough , they will recognize what it going on and make some changes .
One of the most important developments of the " Sexual Revolution " was to transform people 's expectations about sexuality and sexual behavior .
Whereas before sexual intimacy was expected to be limited to marriage ( though it often was n't in practice ) , afterwards people began to expect such intimacy even in non-marital relationships .
Sex has become an expression of physical , emotional , and psychological intimacy in a variety of relationships , not just marriage .
Being able to avoid some of the consequences of sex - especially pregnancy - has been a key factor making this development possible .
Making it harder for people to avoid pregnancy would make it harder for people to engage in sexual activity outside the boundaries of what the Christian Right deems morally licit .
Some actually do want more women to get pregnant ; most , however , seem to hope that the fear of pregnancy will induce more women to just say " no " to sex at all .
In this way , pregnancy is definitely being treated like punishment not unlike fines or jail are a punishment designed to alter people 's behavior .
The above image was originally a World War II poster designed to encourage people to buy more war bonds .
The headline said " I Gave a Man ! "
She has sacrificed far more than those who are only being asked to spend at least 10 % of their earnings on war bonds to help fund the war effort .
War on Terror vs. Geneva Conventions
We can be Trusted to Abandon the Geneva Conventions in the War on Terrorism War on Terror vs. Geneva Conventions :
We can be Trusted to Abandon the Geneva Conventions in the War on Terrorism .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Christian Nationalists are vocal in their advocacy of America becoming a Christian state .
This may lead some to conclude that Christianity is the only basis for their ideology , but this would be a mistake .
Christian Nationalism is at least as nationalistic as it is Christian and this nationalism on behalf of America is important in their policies , attitudes , and values .
Whereas patriotism may simply be a positive attitude towards one 's country , nationalism tends to be much more extreme in that it sees the nation as exceptional , something to be placed above all else .
This helps justify policies in which traditional standards of morality or justice are abandoned .
When it comes to defending the nation , everything is permitted .
If Christian Nationalists were merely Christian , we might expect them to make common cause with Christians around the world -- Christianity is , after all , a universal religion .
Anyone can become a Christian and all Christians are equal before God .
Not everyone is an American , however , and not all nations are equal in the eyes of Christian Nationalism .
Christian Nationalists frequently adopt positions at odds which Christians elsewhere in the world because those policies are designed to advance American economic , political , or military interests .
Christian Nationalists also frequently adopt positions which are arguably at odds with traditional Christian moral values , but this is also because those positions advance nationalistic interests .
All of this is evident in America 's War on Terror .
Christians elsewhere in the world , including conservative evangelicals , object to America 's invasion of Iraq and as well as America 's treatment of detainees .
Christian Nationalists , however , do n't even try to defend their positions via Christian traditions or doctrines .
America 's actions in the War on Terror are justified in almost Machiavellian terms in which the survival of the nation is all that matters .
The actual suffering of detainees or Iraqis is less important than the theoretical suffering of Americans in the future if harsh tactics are n't adopted .
The immorality visited upon detainees and the injustice of the loss of domestic civil liberties are less important than the immorality and injustice of a theoretical terrorist attack in the future if detainees are n't vigorously questioned ( i.e. , torture ) .

Fear and Hatred of Godless Sodomites Gays and Atheists are Vermin or a Disease to be Eradicated Fear and Hatred of Godless Sodomites : Gays and Atheists are Vermin or a Disease to be Eradicated .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : National Archives Christian Nationalists sometimes can't seem to decide whom to attack most and most viciously : gays or atheists .
Perhaps that 's why they invented the epithet " Godless Sodomites , " because it allows them to attack both groups simultaneously .
It even allows them to pretend that the two groups are effectively the same : that gays are all godless atheists and that atheists are all , or at least tend to be , gay themselves .
I can't begin to tell you how often I 've had conservative evangelical Christians writing to me and assuming that I must be gay .
As disturbing as this may be , it is n't nearly as disturbing as the language of disease which Christian Nationalists tend to use when discussing Godless Sodomites .
Sometimes it 's subtle and sometimes it 's overt , but if you watch carefully you 'll find these Christians associating Godless Sodomites with infection , disease , bacteria , and other things which typically need to be eradicated for the safety of the body or community .
The more overt references occur when Godless Sodomites are themselves described as a disease which is infecting society and which needs to be eliminated .
More subtle references occur when Godless Sodomites are simply associated with disease -- when , for example , they are accused of spreading disease through the community .
It might be easy to dismiss this as overly zealous concern about something like AIDS , but it must be remembered that Jews were accused in the Middle Ages of spreading disease and that this was often used as an excuse for discrimination , bigotry , or even pogroms .
It 's not a coincidence that Jews were also accused of being a disease by the Nazis and therefore of needing to be eradicated .
The language of disease is popular among those who would like to eliminate some group entirely because that is what we do with disease .
A disease is n't something we compromise with or accommodate .
Even in those rare cases where a disease provides some benefit ( like sickle cell anemia providing some protection from malaria ) , we still fight it as hard as possible with the goal of eliminating it completely .
People do n't tolerate the presence of disease in their lives and they should n't tolerate the presence of disease - like groups , such as Godless Sodomites .
This image is based on a World War II poster telling people to cover their mouth when sneezing or coughing because not doing this spreads disease .
Suppressing Books & Ideas : Books Cannot be Killed by Fire ... ... but They Can Be Kept Out of Your Hands Suppressing Books & Ideas : Books Cannot be Killed by Fire , but They Can Be Kept Out of Your Hands .
Image © Austin Cline , Licensed to About ; Original Poster : Library of Congress
The suppression of inconvenient or unfavorable ideas is a characteristics shared by all authoritarian movements throughout history .
Authoritarians among the Christian Right are certainly no exception and there seems to be no end to the sorts of ideas which they would like to suppress .
America 's constitutional protections for freedom of speech make it very difficult for them to achieve this on an official level and with the use of government force , however .
Constitutional limitations on what the government can do are no barrier to private companies and this means that the Christian Right can accomplish a great deal by targeting those who manufacture and distribute materials which they find objectionable .
Stores are pressured to stop selling books and magazines which contain ideas , images , or information which the Christian Right wants kept out of people 's hands .
Publishers are pressured to avoid certain topics or authors .
Even libraries , which are government entities , are pressured to restrict certain materials to make them more difficult to find - especially by children .
The above was originally a World War II poster which presented a quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt : " Books can not be killed by fire .
People die , but books never die .
No man and no force can put thought in a concentration camp forever .
No man and no force can take from the world the books that embody man 's eternal fight against tyranny .
In this war , we know , books are weapons . "
Roosevelt was right that books are weapons because books communicate ideas - ideas which might transform the world .
Roosevelt was also right that books cannot ultimately be burned .
Individual copies of books may be burned , but ultimately books will survive so long as human beings will survive .
What Roosevelt did not realize , I suppose , is that there are many more ways to suppress ideas than by simply burning the books which contain them .
Burning books is political theater and not an effective way to accomplish serious goals .
Keeping books out of people 's hands by ensuring that they never see and learn about them is less dramatic , but far more effective .
Criticism of Religions is Not Free Speech Don't Abuse your Free Speech Rights by Offending Religious Believers Criticism of Religions is Not Free Speech : Do n't Abuse your Free Speech Rights by Offending Religious Believers .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : University of Minnesota
One of the most pernicious forms of attempted censorship of unwelcome views is n't overt repression , but rather to convince people not to express those unwelcome views in the first place .
It 's always much better to head off the wrong thoughts before they are expressed rather than clamp down on them after they are already out in public .
Why employ the blunt instrument of state repression if people can be convinced to repress themselves ?
This is precisely what happens with unwelcome criticisms of religion , especially in the West where nations have little to no authority to officially censor material that is critical of religion .
The most common excuse is to claim that non-adherents of a religion should not " offend " religious believers by criticizing their faith .
This argument is based on the idea that criticism of a belief system is the same as a personal attack on the believers .
Sometimes , and in some cases , such a connection may be valid -- but for the most part it is not .
Believers insist that they and their religion should be respected and , therefore , that attacks on religion are not a valid use of one 's free speech rights .
However mush respect a person might deserve as a human being , though , that does n't mean that their beliefs themselves deserve automatic respect as well .
Beliefs have to earn respect ; many actually earn disrespect .
Beliefs which are true and valid cannot be harmed by criticism , even by unfair and incorrect criticism .
Beliefs which are not true or valid will only be revealed through criticism .
What this means is that if we care about the truth , we should welcome criticism of even our most treasured beliefs : if they are true then this will strengthen us ; if they are wrong , then we will know and be free to follow new beliefs .
Attacks on free speech have most recently come primarily from Muslims .
Some threaten violence if ideas , images , or words which they find offensive are given public expression .
Others deplore both threats and actual violence , but they are perfectly willing to benefit from them and are no less eager to insist that criticisms of their religion are offensive and should not be permitted under the cover of " free speech . "
They do n't seem to realize that the free speech which protects their critics protects them as well .

Without God , All Things are Permitted Godless Atheists Promote a Valueless , Immoral World without Order or Structure Without God , All Things are Permitted : Godless Atheists Promote a Valueless , Immoral World without Order or Structure .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : National Archives Religious believers tend to associate their religion closely with morality .
Some go so far as to think that the two are inseparable -- that without their religion , or religion generally , or at least some sort of theism , morality and moral behavior are impossible .
Depending on their attitude , this can lead people to insist that unless a person is a member of their religion , or is a member of some religion , or is at least a theist , then they can not be moral and if they are given any power then they will end up promoting immorality .
These attitudes are exhibited to one degree or another by many on the Christian Right .
Christian Nationalists in particular act like their religion is necessary as a moral foundation for America and , furthermore , that all of America 's ills can be traced to people 's failure to uphold traditional Christianity .
Atheists especially are targeted for criticism -- not only do they reject Christianity and likely any religion at all , but they do n't even believe in any gods .
In fact , atheists are sometimes approached by apologists with the argument that atheism is incompatible with morality and , therefore , that the need for morality is a good reason to become a Christian .
They do n't realize that even if there were no reason to be moral in the absence of any gods , that would at most provide a prudential reason to believe in God .
This cannot support the claim that some god actually does exist .
If morality requires a god , and there are no gods , then we simply have to live in a universe where there are no absolute , independent moral standards and where we have to make our own way .
Some on the Christian Right even take advantage of tragedies to make both of the above points .
School shootings , for example , lead some to argue that the absence of morality is due to the absence of Christianity , that atheists and secularists are the cause of all this , and finally that atheists should convert to Christianity to stave off future tragedies .
This image is based on a World War II poster depicting a soldier telling workers at home not to get hurt because they are needed on the job full time .
It is similar to a real ad used by Answers in Genesis which depicts a child pointing out gun at the viewer .
Accompanying the image are the words " If you do n't matter to God , you do n't matter to anyone . "
The implied message is that without God in our lives , nothing matters at all and this causes us all to descend into barbaric violence .
Beware of Recruitment into the Homosexual Lifestyle Godless Sodomites Will Subvert Heterosexual Christian Society Beware of Recruitment into the Homosexual Lifestyle : Godless Sodomites Will Subvert Heterosexual Christian Society .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : National Archives
A common which the Christian Right tries to make against gays and efforts to increase social acceptance of homosexuality is the idea that gays want to " recruit " others -- especially children -- into their " lifestyle . "
People who know gays and understand homosexuality find this position absurd , but it does seem to follow logically from the starting assumptions which the Christian Right has about homosexuality generally .
Perhaps the most important assumption which serves as a foundation for all Christian Right attitudes towards homosexuality is that it is a chosen behavior rather than an innate orientation .
They define homosexuality as same - sex sexual behavior , not same - sex attraction that has emotional and psychological as well as sexual components .
In this manner it is treated as a sin just like theft -- however strong the desire may be , it 's something a person has control over acting on .
Just as a kleptomaniac 's obsessive desire to steal must be punished , so must a homosexual 's desire to engage in same - sex behavior be punished .
This is what lies behind the entire notion of a person becoming " ex- gay . "
They may continue to experience attraction to members of the same sex , but so long as they do n't act on their desires then they are n't really " gay " anymore .
It 's also what lies behind the belief that gays have to " recruit " others into their " lifestyle . "
Because attraction to members of the same sex is unnatural , then it must necessarily be created by others Christian Nationalists are especially concerned about children being recruited .
They fear that anything which depicts homosexuality in an even neutral manner is part of an organized conspiracy to subvert Christian morality and Christian civilization .
Thus the suppression of non-negative depictions of homosexuality is like suppressing non-negative depictions of stealing , assault , or even murder .
It 's simply not a question that requires any serious ethical debate : of course children should n't be given the impression that such sinful behavior is even remotely acceptable .
If they start believing this , then they might start engaging in this behavior themselves .
This image is based on a World War II poster encouraging soldiers to " Keep Clean " and " Take a bath every day you can . "
I 've only changed the text -- the expressions and positions of the men are precisely as they are in the original .
The homoerotic overtones are unmistakable and quite curious .
Boy Scouts Must Be Prepared to Fight Godless Atheism Bigotry & Discrimination are Needed for Christian Society Boy Scouts Must Be Prepared to Fight Godless Atheism : Bigotry & Discrimination are Needed for Christian Society .
Image © Austin Cline ; Original Poster : Library of Congress Official , institutional bigotry and discrimination against atheists used to be much more prevalent in America .
There was a time when the testimony of atheists would not be accepted in courts of law .
Several states technically bar atheists from elected office right in their constitutions , though these provisions are no longer enforceable .
Atheists today continue to encounter personal bigotry and resulting discrimination , but not so much in the context of social institutions enforcing official policies .
The biggest exception to this shift away from bigotry and towards equal treatment has been the Boy Scouts of America .
Although the Boy Scouts ' discrimination against gays appears to be most widely known , they discriminate against atheists on basically the same basis .
According to the Boy Scouts , atheists cannot be morally straight or the best kinds of citizens ; therefore , they have no place in the organization either as scouts or as adult leaders .
People who admit to being atheists are kicked out regardless of their past accomplishments -- in other words , the amount of good a person has done either in their lives or in the Boy Scouts is less important than simply not believing in any gods .
It 's disturbing that the media has focused on discrimination against gays , ignoring discrimination against atheists .
Many of the court cases challenging Boy Scouts ' discrimination have been brought by atheists .
It was just such a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and established that the Boy Scouts are technically a private organization which has a right to discriminate against anyone they want and for any reason they want .
The fallout from that decision is still developing : as a private organization that discriminates , they have no moral or legal claim to public assistance , support , or endorsement .
This outrages conservatives who want it both ways : they want the Boy Scouts to be private so they can in bigoted discrimination , but they want them to be public in order to obtain lucrative benefits and government support .
In effect , they want the Boy Scouts ' discrimination to come without social consequences .
Their arguments end up trying to make the case that discrimination against gays and atheists is a positive public good which deserves public support .

I Also Dated Zarathustra
On the Dating Game
It 's not the questions that count , and it 's not exactly the answers .
You ask a silly thing : " What kind of fruit would you be ? " and you hope a voice on the other side of the dividing panel , one from the row of three men on stools the audience can see but you cannot , will reach through the make - up and studio laughter to give a sign that he knows , yes , this is stupid , but what we want is not stupid : who , after all , knows how to find the person he will love ?
I had looked nearly everywhere else and decided that if necessary , and it seemed to be necessary , I would look here , too .
I would sit in a tight short dress with my legs placed at an advantageous angle to the camera , crossed at the knees with one high heel dangling from my toes .
It 's a favorite pose and successful .
The men I was quizzing could n't see it but the cameraman was driven crazy .
With each question I asked , he returned to dwell on the ankle and bare heel .
Well then .
What kind of fruit would he be ?
Bachelor Number One ?
" Something that will make a really great pie .
And that 's a promise .
I am one dependable fruit . "
Bachelor Number Two ?
" I 'd be plums , I 'd be sweet and red and very juicy .
And honey , I 'm always ripe . "
Bachelor Number
Three ?
" I am a north wind to ripe figs .
I am a prophet of the lightning and a heavy drop from the clouds .
I am an intoxicated sweet lyre -- a midnight lyre , a croaking bell which no one understands but which still must speak ! "
I did n't move but I was suddenly aware of my thighs , of the insides of my arms .
Bachelor Number
Three had a voice like a cloud speaking , traces of roar and thunder and waves held together with honey - cello .
But what did I know about him ?
He might be ridiculous , I thought .
He might be sublime .
When a man is mysterious enough , when I have no idea which things will be good or bad or where the problems will be or even what will happen next , it makes me think that anything might be possible .
" Num Ber Two ! Num Ber Two ! " the female audience chanted during the Thinking Music .

One hugged and kissed me .
Number
Two slipped a note with the number of his hotel room down the front of my dress .
Number
Three stiffly bowed .
He was older than the others .
His eyebrows were shaggy and his mustache needed trimming .
He wore a long black coat , which would never , in the course of our acquaintance , be removed .
He bowed and shook my hand .
Then , lifting his eyebrows , he peered at it : a hand , yes , in his hand , a hand attached to other parts of a fairly beautiful woman with whom he was about to spend a weekend in Las Vegas .
That is where they were sending us , to the glittering neon desert , to try our luck .
" Ah , " he said .
" What a long and beautiful hand !
It is the hand of one who has always distributed blessings .
But now it holds fast him you seek , me , Zarathustra . "
On Love of the Strange , and of Men
Oh , it 's a love of aching things , not sweet things , a love of stars , long silences , birds that sing at night .
A love like an old Victorian house that is almost empty : a winding staircase to a room paneled in dark wood , its worn polish dimly reflecting light from a chandelier with yellow bulbs , a few notes of Chopin played in another wing of the house by an overnight guest who does not speak .
( I would love him , too , thin like a carved rail of the staircase , awkwardly holding a glass of wine at dinner so that you might think his hands had n't comfortably mastered the world ; and yet , the Chopin . )
A love like stamps from a country whose name you do n't recognize , exquisite writing in a script you can't read or a language you do n't know .
I have never loved anything I 've understood .
" All mousetraps of the heart have now again been set !
And wherever I raise a curtain , a little night - moth comes fluttering out . "
I was on the balcony , standing in the hot sun looking out over the Nevada desert , where the bare mountains were made beautiful by shadows .
Zarathustra , in the hotel room , stretched his hands to the blasting air conditioner and spoke to himself .
The strange are often the best defended ; that is how they have kept themselves strange .
" I am not on my guard against deceivers , I must be without caution , " Zarathustra said .
Their hearts are not guarded deliberately , but by being essentially impenetrable .
It 's a love that is like loneliness .
Of Balancing on Four Legs
It was a warm night , with lots of neon .
It was one of those nights when the world seemed to be made not of people , but of couples .
Everywhere I looked bodies were paired together , connected at the hands or more tightly around the waist , awkward animals walking with a tilt and lean , off - balance , unsymmetrical .
They reminded me of those children 's books with the pages cut in three , each section the top , middle , or bottom of an animal , so that the normal old heads and legs and bellies could be made into sillier creatures : a salamousowl , a girelephish , a pandazebrogator .
And yes , I wanted to be part of it all .
Of course I did .
Oh , to be damply interlaced at the palms .
To be affectionately leashed , tethered in the crowded streets , appended .
To make a wider obstacle on the sidewalk , a wandering self - absorption that others had to navigate , rather than this narrow thing that darts and slips politely by .
But Zarathustra understood nothing of this .
He would walk between or duck under the arms of people clearly together , something I by instinct could not do .
It was impossible to truly accompany him , to predict and accommodate his walking speeds or stopping places .
He seemed to resent being tied down , even by gravity .
He walked with high fast steps and frequently bumped into things .
Really he could n't see very well ; until he was at arm 's length he was n't completely certain what he was looking at .
This meant that everything out of reach was immensely interesting , and the things close by merely obstacles .
And so we wandered , over the Brooklyn Bridge , into the great pyramids .
When he pushed people aside to get a better view of the volcano or the pirates , I apologized and petted them , winked and shrugged : he 's hopeless , what can I do ?
And really most people did n't mind so much once they saw him .
He was so completely taken over by the spectacle , so silly looking and so utterly happy , that often enough they ended up watching us instead .
If there were a Couple Game , a prize for the oddest match on the Vegas strip , we would have won .
Zarathustra could have been my father .
Or crazy .
Perhaps he was extremely wealthy ?
Something the casinos had flown in .
And surely I was being paid .
Madmen did n't get girls with legs this long .
The casino had hired me , to raise the stakes .
Or he had hired me , for much the same function .
Oh was n't he a lucky man !
We just did n't look like we were on a date .
I wondered if this was why the show had assigned us a chaperone -- to give Zarathustra a backup option , and to let me off the hook .
Surely this odd man could n't be my type ?
" Perhaps you would like a game of poker ? " the chaperone had suggested , after dinner .
" I have played dice with the gods at their table , the earth , " said Zarathustra .
" Oh , really ?
And where was this ? "
The chaperone was a motherly type .
She was a mother - in - law on a honeymoon who wanted desperately to be a fairy godmother .
We had tickets to a show , coupons for free drinks , a hundred dollars in betting tokens , all of which she had bestowed upon Zarathustra , all of which had entered the pockets of his coat , never to be seen again .
She had tried to take the coat from him back in the hotel room .
It was thick black wool , buttoned from his chest to his knees , and must have felt like wearing a portable oven .
Still , it seemed possible that he had simply forgotten it was there .
The chaperone suggested , coquettishly reaching for the top button , that she would make him more comfortable .
Zarathustra said to her , " This is the tarantula 's cave !
Do you want to see the tarantula itself ? "
She did n't .
She never mentioned it again .
I had said nothing .
By then I 'd come to enjoy the prospect of removing the coat myself , at the end of the night .
I pictured my long arms snaking from behind , my bare skin on his black wool , undoing him button by button .
And what was Zarathustra thinking , when he looked at me ?
Did he like tall redheads ?
Did he wish I was wearing more ?
" You have the most lovely shoulders , " as the chaperone put it , winking at Zarathustra , who missed his cue for a courtly compliment .
It was difficult to imagine either of them on a date .
She needed to have always been married ; he needed to be taken by the arm and gently steered , directed this way or that with no mention made of the change of pilot .
Or so I had thought ; that was an innocent time , early evening .
" Try your luck ! " the chaperone said , giving each of us a quarter as we passed a row of slot machines .
They jingled and blinked happily among themselves like well - fed babies in need of occasional burping .
Zarathustra fed the nearest one his quarter , and I dropped mine in after , doubling the bet .
The dizzy smile started up , spinning to lock on cherry ; cherry ; cherry .
Quarters poured out .
It was a good sign , I thought .
Zarathustra picked up a quarter and gave it back to the chaperone , then walked on .
The chaperone had a wordless fit : sputter !
etc .
She saw that yes , we really did intend to walk away .
This was her chance .
A thousand quarters : she looked hungrily at the pile , thinking that among so many there must be others that would win , she had only to find them , to kiss each frog and find the princes .
And so we left her .
We did n't need a chaperone ; we had his coat .
We walked for hours .
The signs , the palm trees , the cars , the casinos , the people he passed on the street and the things they carried , all seemed to Zarathustra equally there for entertainment .
The boy whose cotton candy he sampled ( gazing in rapture at the pink cloud , plucking a wisp from it , licking tentatively at the barely there ) had no right to scream at him , no , not when one possessed an object so delicious !
Not when one possessed an object he wanted .
I was n't able to explain this to the boy or his father , but bought the boy another cone and a small teddy bear , hoping he would n't notice how much it resembled Zarathustra .
When I caught up again a uniformed chauffeur had handed Zarathustra a vividly illustrated brochure of a desert brothel , and was offering to drive him there .
Zarathustra seemed confused that the pamphleteer was not , as he had naturally ( so he insisted ) assumed , a philosopher or revolutionary .
Clearly anyone distributing printed material deserved his full attention .
" Ah , " he said , standing in a bright spotlight to study the pamphlet .
As he considered the transcendent ideologies of Daisy and Trixie , his shadow roamed over the side of a building across the street .
He raised his arms and the shadow tried to climb through the window of a hotel room much too small for it .
Two blonde teenaged girls approached and the arms went after them , straining for a squeeze , wiggling fingertips poked their knees and tried to trip them , the pamphlet waved madly over their bodies as they escaped unclutched .
The shadow shrugged .
Zarathustra shook his head at it disapprovingly .
" I must keep it under stricter control -- otherwise it will ruin my reputation . "
I pulled him away by the arm , and found a moth hole in the outside of his coatsleeve , which fit my little finger like a ring .
Z did n't seem to notice , so I kept it there .
By this time it was becoming quite clear how much he needed me .
Of Dancing Things
" Listen , " said Zarathustra .
" It is night : now do all leaping fountains speak louder . "
We were sitting side by side on the low concrete ledge of the fountains in front of our hotel .
" And what do they say ? "
" They are deep but without thoughts , like little secrets , like after - dinner nuts . "
Zarathustra had his hand in the shallow water , plucking it with his finger , a soft plink plink , plink plink .
I slipped off my shoes , and stepped in .
My legs were a lovely blue in the reflected light .
The pool was ankle deep , gently swirled and bubbled by the water spraying and tumbling in the middle .
Zarathustra scooped some pennies from the bottom of the pool , a few of the good luck pennies which were everywhere , and dropped them in again .
They plopped straight back to the bottom , shy as frogs .
" I know what the water says .
It says it 's given up waiting for the pennies to swim , it wants people to throw goldfish , instead . "
" Everything is asleep , " Zarathustra said .
" Even the water is asleep .
Its eye looks at me drowsily and strangely .
But it breathes ; I feel it .
And it is dreaming , look how it tosses and turns . "
The air was warm , the water was warm .
My feet were delighted .
I walked through the shallow pool to the other side of the fountains on my blue legs , nudging pennies with my toes .
Which felt better , stork steps , or fish steps ?
Which felt better , going from the air to the water , or the water to the air ?
Zarathustra could n't see it , but I was dancing .
The water 's hands slipped teasing through my fingers .
My tall partners the palms swayed out - of - reach above me .
The desert breezes came in now and then , stretched across us like a chorus line .
Each of us with our private shivers .
I thought it would be nice , on a night like this , to fly .
So I left the water in a balletic leap , toes neatly pointed , one arm up , one to the side .
But when I came down I slipped on the pennies .
I slid into a sharp pain -- a bottlecap .
My foot was cut .
Zarathustra , in his brown leather boots and thick coat , came striding through the water to see what I was swearing at .
The cut was n't deep ; a small bleeding gouge on the side of my big toe .
I dried it with tissue , and found a band - aid in my purse .
But Zarathustra was at war : there were to be no bottlecaps among the pennies .
He went down on hands and knees to search them out .
His coat settled into the water reluctantly , floating and full of pocketed air , then sponging and swelling and sinking .
At first he was amusing , almost gallant .
The eradication of sharp edges , the world made safer for toes .
But .
He kept on and on , crawling through the water , attacking nickels then releasing them , puzzling over gum wrappers and bits of palm leaf , banishing all manner of suspicious things to his wet pockets .
I wanted to go .
I wanted a drink , and I said so .
I wanted a cold , numbing , double margarita .
Zarathustra ignored me , or maybe did n't hear .
I said this louder .
Putting on my shoes made my toe hurt more .
" Come on , " I said .
Zarathustra tucked another bottlecap into his coat pocket .
Probably they were falling back out again as he crawled .
" This is ridiculous ! " I shouted .
" All fish talk like that ; what they cannot fathom is unfathomable , " he said .
" I 'm going inside , " I said .
At the hotel entrance I turned back to see if he had followed .
He had n't .
He lay in the fountain stretched full length , legs spread , arms wide , his hands flapping and spanking the water , cooling his overheated addled brain and burbling .
On the Compassion of the White Tigers
Sometimes it helps to be drunk .
One stiff margarita and I remembered how much I liked being wet , how charming I would look with my hair thoroughly soaked and shaken into ringlets .
The fountain would tell me so itself , really , I was ready to hear all sorts of things .
I was ready to sing along .
But Zarathustra had finished his bath .
I found him wandering the main corridor of the hotel , waving his arms and spraying drops like a wet , happy dog .
I preceeded him at a safe custodial distance .
He did n't notice me ; being human was sufficient camouflage .
The corridor led past a large white room , the mountain - kingdom throne room of the resort 's white tigers , and there Zarathustra came to a sudden , astounded stop .
Two white tigers lay on the floor not far from him , gazing into a distance we were certainly no part of .
" Ah , my brothers !
If only my lioness Wisdom had learned to roar fondly ! "
He sat down on the floor of the marble walkway and spoke to them , earnestly , and at great length .
Their heads went slowly side to side , looking at everything as though they already knew it in their painted kingdom of empty white spaces and artificial things , snow in their minds .
They both had beautiful intelligent expressions and seemed complete , resigned to a stable satisfaction , not requiring further enlightenment .
He told them everything .
I leaned half - behind a marble pillar and listened .
" I have always wanted to caress every monster .
A touch of warm breath , a little soft fur on its paw -- and at once I have been ready to love and entice it .
Love is the danger for the most solitary man , love of any thing if only it is alive ! "
With my eyes closed , without the dreadful evidence of the wet coat , without the spreading streams of water the other casino - goers were gingerly stepping around as they passed him , looking at him and also trying not to look , not to spoil the night 's glitter , not to wet their shoes , but especially not to hear him , surely this was gibberish , a language they did n't share , an animal speaking to animals , they pretended he was grunting --
With my eyes closed there were only his words , his words like little spotted night moths , and his low voice .
The most enticing sort of monster is a soul aching with ferocious tenderness .
" To be sure , I am a forest and a night of dark trees : but he who is not afraid of my darkness will find rosebowers too under my cypresses . "
Did I think I could change him ?
Yes .
Did I care what the others thought , the tip - toers , the avoiders of puddles ?
No .
Did I think he would escort me through the dark cypresses into his rose bower ?
Yes .
I pictured pale yellow climbing roses , a weathered bench strewn with fallen petals .
I thought he had made the bower with its little bench so that I would have a place to sit .
" Ah , my friends , it is the evening that questions thus within me .
Forgive me my sadness !
We were made for one another , you gentle , strange marvels .
And we have already learned so much with one another ! "
He left them , much cheered and quieted , though still dripping , and followed me into the nearest bar .
On Learning to Drink from All Glasses
Zarathustra was fascinated by the little white and red striped straw that came with his margarita .
It made slurps in such a nice assortment , hollow air sucks , loud bubble - burble , liquid squishes .
It suffered lime - pulp obstructions , it poked under cubes of ice , it vacuumed the last stray drops .
He kept the straw in place between his lips and sipped liked a bird , lowering his head to the glass , tilting side to side , poking and hunting .
Finally the ice was sucked tasteless .
But Zarathustra had n't had nearly enough of the straw .
Here and there on the empty tables were glasses left behind , some with enough color to be more than ice melt .
Come to us , they called , we are diluting .
The straw perked like a lower appendage .
He could n't resist .
" He who does not want to die of thirst among men must learn to drink from all glasses , " he said as he left me .
But most of these abandoned drinks were only drowned remains , melted ice and cherry stems and gnawed wedges of orange or pineapple .
They were insufficiently alcoholic .
He saw a fresh cocktail with a pink umbrella on another table , and with his straw , went directly to it .
The woman who had ordered the drink was horrified .
She stared at the glass as though a man had popped out of it , not into it .
It might happen again , acrobats could leap from the glass and stick their daiquiri - flavored tongues into her open mouth .
The couple at the next table said that someone really ought to call security .
So I told them , leaning over confidentially , that Zarathustra was a paid comedian .
" Yes , it 's part of his act , " I said .
And truly , this was a stroke of genius .
" Oh ! " they said , of course , it all made sense , and then they excitedly told the next couple .
The world is so much nicer when it 's making sense .
I could see the rumor navigate the bar , who had heard and who had n't , by the shift from flinches to smiles , then even to competition for Zarathustra 's attention .
Men called him over to shock their wives , a giggly , safely titillating little shock , and women offered up their drinks to him as he passed .
Zarathustra was delighted .
Here was the world as he had intended it to be , here he was understood !
Drunk , he was the perfect entertainer , a cross between a host and a clown , offering toasts and renaming all the drinks .
The Death of God ! he pronounced .
The Will to Power ! Live Dangerously !
Eternal Recurrence !
The names were a bit mystifying to the drinking folk , but they loved him .
He leaned over to suck another drink and lost his balance in a plump , elderly lap .
The plump woman laughed and tried to grab him .
" O Earth , you have grown too round for me ! " he cursed .
" Live Dangerously ! " they toasted .
And to me , " He 's good , is n't he ?
It 's very clever . "
Finally he came back to our table .
He was merry and elated and fidgety , reaching out when fresh drinks passed , glazing over with alcohol and exhaustion .
It was getting late .
I was ready for a little gratitude .
I moved my chair around the table very close to his .
He still had the perky little straw in his mouth .
" You have n't yet tasted me , " I said , and sucked on the end of his straw .
It pinched his tongue , and he spat it out .
" Oh , your straw ! " I said .
It had fallen to the floor on the other side of his chair .
I leaned over to get it , full across his lap , and while I was there I took the time to undo the two lower buttons of his cool damp wool cocoon .
He was absolutely still .
Inside and out .
But he thanked me for the straw .
" Zarathustra , " I said , sort of snuggling up to him but distracting him by pointing to a young couple kissing vigorously in a dark corner of the bar .
" Look .
What are they doing ? "
" They are discovering new words . "
" You mean , speaking with different tongues ? "
" Before long they will be devising festivals ! "
" I like it when they smile between kisses . "
" Like cats they arch their backs , they purr . "
" Well , look where his paw is . . . "
" You must not want to see everything . "
" But I do .
I think I do want to see everything , do n't you ? "
" For that you must have long legs . "
" Let 's see . "
I hooked my foot under his and stretched our legs out , to measure them side by side .
" Mine is longer !
I thought so . "
" You are making this cave sultry and poisonous , you evil sorceror ! "
" Sorceror ! "
" If I may tickle you with this name . "
" I would prefer fingers . "
Someone had left a marble in the ashtray on our table , a milky blue color , which Zarathustra began to roll across the table .
I said it was the moon 's right eye , sent to spy on us .
" He is lustful and jealous , the monk in the moon , " Zarathustra said .
" And what about you ? "
" I am invulnerable only in my heels . "
" Are you lustful ?
Do you like the girl over there , kissing ? "
" One should speak about women only to men . "
" Why ?
Tell me !
What do you think of women ? "
" They know how to blow horns and to go around at night and awaken old things that have long been asleep . "
" Zarathustra , " I said , " what are you hiding under your coat ? "
" It is a little truth that I carry .
But it is as unruly as a little child , and if I do not stop its mouth it will cry too loudly . "
" Ah , " I said .
" Oh . "
" You want to call it by a name and caress it .
You want to pull its ears and amuse yourself with it . "
" Yes , " I said , " you 're right , I do . "
I suggested that it was time to go back to the room .
Of an Introduction to the Ideal Woman
I led our trek from bar to bedroom through a small dense jungle , under waterfalls , over a green and gold wooden elephant , through beaded curtains into a dim red room painted with a harem scene .
We leaned against the wall of bare - breasted dark - eyed women and pretended to choose a favorite , whispering to each other in the opium light , bumping and brushing hands in the purple shadows .
And then I found the perfect finale .
On a pedestal advertising the week 's performers was a classic chorus girl mannequin , leg kicked high , arms wide .
What a fetching pose , I thought .
I could do that , too .
A private Vegas floor show for Zarathustra .
I climbed up and danced a can -can with her , kicking my equally long legs , my arm across her shoulders .
She was so cute .
She was terribly sweet and happy .
And Zarathustra gave us just the look I wanted , he gazed adoringly , ecstatically at the two of us intertwined .
He said exactly what I wanted him to say : " Something unquenched , unquenchable , is in me , that wants to speak out .
A craving for love is in me ... "
Oh yes , finally , yes yes yes .
I let her go , and he walked up and reached out his arms and took her face in his hands , and kissed her .
He kissed her again , on her nose and her cheeks , her chin , on the corners of her smiling lips .
He kissed her very nicely , too ; sweet lingering little pecks .
" Who could behold her smile and not dissolve into tears ? " he asked me .
Ah , yes .
Indeed .
Tears .
Then he stepped back to admire her , to take in the full measure of his luck .
That this , this , should be waiting here , just for him .
She had those long showgirl legs ( well , so do I ) , enhanced breasts ( mine are real ) set off by feather boas , and she had big unblinking blue eyes that said you were just exactly what she had all her life been waiting for ( mine blink ) .
Furthermore , you knew immediately that she would always look at you that way .
In fact I think it 's safe to say that most of one 's first impressions of her were entirely accurate .
Her behavior was in no way misleading .
She might disappoint you , but she would never let you down .
She was impeccably calm .
Here was a woman who could face life 's batterings and joys with the same unwavering expression :
Oh , how big and strong you are !
J'adore !
She would never complain .
She was patient and always willing to listen , but never intrusive .
She was never jealous .
Now , I have softer breasts and better legs , and I am warm , I bend and squish and lick and sing , my mouth opens , my hands grip and stroke , I can dance a tango in spike high heels .
But I could n't compete .
Zarathustra whispered to her , something I could n't hear , then looked into her eyes as if she had agreed , yes , between them there was perfect understanding .
Well , perhaps there was .
I am only jealous of perfection when I see it taking a man away from me .
" I will rescue you from all corners , " he said , gently pushing down her kicking leg .
" I will brush dust , spiders , and twilight away from you . "
He hoisted her from the platform , knocked over everything , and dislodged most of her feathers .
After some fidgetting they fitted together with her stiff welcoming arms hooked over his left shoulder .
He grasped her by her sequined ass and carried her toward the exit sign .
She smiled at me over his shoulder , apparently delighted , as she was with all things .
She went with him into the night with her eyes wide open .
" Come , cold and stiff companion !
Let me show you my nocturnal world and the big , round moon and the silver waterfalls by my cave .
The dog howls , the moon is shining .
Here are caves and thickets : we shall go astray !
Give me your hand !
Or just a finger !
Where now do you take me , you unruly paragon ? "
I never saw him again .
Though I still hear his voice from time to time , at night , when the ocean mutters to itself .
Perhaps this was to be expected from a man who spent ten years in a cave , whose best friends were a serpent and an eagle .
What other things could reach him , on his mountaintop ?
Even the serpent had to be flown there in the talons of the eagle .
Perhaps , if I had grown wings and thick talons , Zarathustra would have let me carry him away .

The Supreme Court justices appeared closely split Wednesday on whether environmental laws can be used to protect whales and other marine mammals from the Navy ’s use of sonar off the coast of Southern California .
A Bush administration lawyer argued that when national security is at stake , the president and his top military commanders are entrusted with setting the rules .
“ The ability to locate and track an enemy submarine . . . is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike force . . . and therefore , critical to the nation ’s own security , ” said U.S. Solicitor Gen. Gregory G. Garre .
For years , the Navy has conducted training exercises off the California coast to test whether ships can detect quiet - running enemy submarines .
These exercises are “ in the judgment of the president and his top naval officers in the paramount interests of the United States , ” he added .
Garre urged the high court to throw out a Los Angeles judge ’s order that put limits on the Navy ’s operations .
Acting on a suit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council in Santa Monica , U.S. District Judge Florence - Marie Cooper ordered the Navy to shut down its high - intensity sonar whenever a whale or marine mammal is spotted within 1.25 miles of the ship .

The sonar emits a powerful sound wave in the water -- as “ if we had a jet engine in this courtroom and you multiplied that noise by 2,000 times , ” said Los Angeles lawyer Richard B. Kendall , who represented the NRDC .
He said beaked whales , in panic , dive deeply to escape the sound , and they sometimes suffer bleeding and even death when they try to resurface .
He also cited the Navy ’s own estimate that 170,000 dolphins and other marine mammals would flee the sonar .
Garre agreed some marine animals might swim away , but he disputed the claim that they would be hurt or killed .
“ There have been beachings of beaked whales in Southern California .
None of have been tied to sonar operations , ” he said .
For his part , Kendall disputed that the judge ’s order would hurt the Navy or disrupt its war - game exercises .
He said the Navy had conducted 13 extended training exercises off California under the restrictions set by the judge , and only on a few occasions were ships forced to turn off their sonar .
The case has turned into a dispute over whether judges , acting on a suit brought by environmentalists , have the power to halt a government project because of its failure to carry out an environmental impact statement in advance .
Cooper cited this failure by the Navy when she issued her order .

On Wednesday , she came under criticism from several justices .
“ Is Judge Cooper an expert on antisubmarine warfare ? ” asked Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. “ Is n’t there something incredibly odd about a single district judge making a determination on that defense question . . . contrary to the determination the Navy has made . ”
Justice Antonin Scalia said the law requiring environmental impact statements was “ procedural ” only .
It did not give judges the power to stop government projects , he suggested .
And Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that in balancing the interests , the judge did not give enough weight to the Navy ’s concern .
He described it as the “ potential that a North Korean diesel electric submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor undetected . ”
On the other side , Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter wondered how the Navy could know its sonar would not harm the whales until it had studied the matter .
“ The whole theory of the environmental impact statement is we do n’t really know what the harm will be , ” Stevens said .

The Navy said it is working on an environmental impact statement on its training exercises , but it will not be complete until February , when the exercises are due to end .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , who usually casts the deciding vote in close cases , asked several questions but did not come down squarely on either side .
At one point , Justice Stephen G. Breyer said it was frustrating to resolve the conflicting evidence over whether the sonar does or does not harm marine mammals .
“ Why could n’t you work this thing out ? ” he asked Kendall .
“ The Navy is focused on having it its way or no way , ” he replied .
Advertisement
“ That ’s not fair , ” the chief justice countered .
The Navy had taken steps to protect the marine mammals , he said , and the judge gave it little credit for doing so .
“ No good deed goes unpunished , ” he added .
The justices are likely to hand down a ruling in the case , Winter v. NRDC , within a few months .

My nearby market town of Lewes has started issuing its own pound notes : Tom Paine 's portrait is on one side , Lewes Castle on the other .
The Bullion Vault , a London gold broker , reports " phenomenal interest " in its product .
The multi-millionaire media magnate Felix Dennis tells the FT that he has followed the instructions of his financial adviser to " buy gold .
Physical bits , small bits , so when you need to get a sandwich you can take it down the shop and take 300 sandwiches away ;
God help me , in a vault here in London , I have huge quantities of small bits of gold . "
We should not assume from this that the pound sterling is about to go the way of the Zimbabwean dollar .
Lewes has ever been a contrary place ; the Bullion Vault is obviously talking up its own business ; Felix Dennis is highly impulsive .
Yet these are also straws in the wind , or rather a howling gale .
When Governments spend vast sums of money to shore up the banking system , you just know that it would be all too convenient for it to let inflation erode the national debt incurred in the process .
Even before these gigantic expenditures , Britain 's true level of national debt , according to the economist Liam Halligan – the Government wo n't give the real figure including off - balance sheet liabilities – is over £ 1,300bn .
This is equivalent to £ 50,000 per household .
Perhaps Gordon Brown might call it " imprudence with a purpose " – he dumped Prudence some time ago , although he kept on telling everyone that they were still an item .

In America , the situation is much the same , only , as you would expect , bigger .
Last Saturday , the digital display in New York showing the current level of national debt did not have enough digits to show the real number , after it breached the $ 10 trillion mark ( $ 10,150,603,734,720 to be precise ) .
Per American household this works out as $ 86,023 ( £ 49,747 ) ; so Mr Brown , in this respect at least , is in no position to lecture George W Bush on economics .
There is , however , a small band of men and women – long insulted as fanatics or even fantasists by the political mainstream – who can now say : " We told you so . "
I am not referring to the Communist Party of Great Britain ( Marxist - Leninist ) .
No , I 'm talking about the followers of the great Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises ( 1881 - 1973 ) .
in his 1912 work , The Theory of Money and Credit , Mises declared that the corruption and distortion of money by the state and bankers , usually to pay for wars , was the principal cause both of inflation and – to coin a phrase – boom and bust .
As the chief economic advisor to the Austrian government in the 1920s , Mises put his theories into practice and slowed down inflation in his native country ( which , as a Jew , he later fled ) .
He used his " cycle " theory to forecast that the " New Era " of apparently permanent prosperity in the 1920s was illusory , and that it would end in runs on banks and depression :
The Wall Street crash of 1929 was exactly what Mises had predicted .
Mises believed that any currency which was not backed by gold was powerless to resist the depredations of governments and bankers addicted to the possibilities of limitless credit .
Until the past few weeks , this has been seen as a bizarrely old - fashioned and eccentric outlook ; but I would not be surprised if many young people – who have hitherto been comfortable with the idea of money as something which can just exist in the ether , travelling through the digital highway – now wonder whether anything of intrinsic value lies behind it all .
As far as Mises was concerned , even money made of paper , if it had nothing behind it other than the good word of politicians and central bankers , was inherently unsound ; he lived just long enough to see the United States of America – where he ended his days – break decisively with the international Gold Standard .
Up until August 1971 , the owner of dollars could , at least theoretically , exchange them for gold .
That month France , to whom the US owed about $ 3bn as part of the financing of the Vietnam War , demanded that the dollar debt be repaid in gold .
Unfortunately , there was no longer enough in the vaults of Fort Knox .
Apparently there exists a tape of Richard Nixon saying : " Screw the French ! " - some accounts have the President using a more alliterative verb .
America immediately came off the gold standard , after which there was no theoretical limit to its ability to print money and – according to the followers of Mises – the age of high inflation was under way .
John Maynard Keynes , rather than Ludwig von Mises , is the economist whose name is currently being invoked on the airwaves in Britain .
in his own day , too , Keynes obliterated Mises : it became fashionable to believe that Roosevelt 's New Deal was a kind of successful rudimentary application of Keynesianism .
Yet Roosevelt 's policy of massive intervention by the state to prop up wage rates and inflate credit gets a much better press than it ever deserved .
Consider this : in September 1931 the US unemployment rate was 17.4 per cent and the Dow Jones industrial Average stood at 140 .
By January 1938 , unemployment was still at 17.4 per cent , and the Dow Average had dropped to 121 .
Mises ' followers insist that the present problems in the economies of the West have not been caused by laissez - faire , but by the opposite : politically sensitive central bankers so desperate to prevent any stock market slump that they cut interest rates to a level which turbo - charged the debt markets .
So when George Osborne , as he did yesterday , declares that " laissez - faire is dead " , the Mises - ites – one of whom is the libertarian ex-Presidential candidate , Congressman Ron Paul – would protest that such a policy was never tried in the first place .
Yesterday , I spoke to one of the leading academic figures in that movement , Professor Thorsten Polleit of the Frankfurt School of Finance .
The professor is less enthusiastic than the stock market about the British Government 's injection of taxpayers ' money into the weakest banks .
He points out that by standing behind those banks , but giving no general guarantees , the Government is encouraging savers to pull all their money out of well - run smaller institutions and switch it into badly run bigger banks .
The Government will insist that it is no time to be debating economic theories and the origins of this crisis – that we should simply do what we can to inject confidence back into the system .
Professor Polleit sees it differently : " A proper diagnosis is necessary before you know the right remedy .
Your Government – and others – are dealing with the symptoms but not the causes . "
As any doctor will tell you , that is not in the patient 's long - term interest .

Anne Hathaway 's New L.A. Mystery Man
Actressmay have found a new love interest .
The gorgeous celebrity broke off her relationship withon the eve of his arrest by the FBI in June 2008 .
In the course of their investigation , federal agents confiscated some personal and reportedly racy photos of Anne .
That phase of her life is history and the star has apparently turned a corner by letting slip the fact that she has met someone .
The talented 25 - year - old has been moving full speed ahead with her life with appearances and movie premiere 's for Get Smart , Rachel Getting Married and Passengers .
To say she is a hot commodity is an understatement .
Of her new man , she had this to say :
" This guy I know in L.A. is kind of doing it for me right now .
When I think of sexy I think of him .
I 'm totally single right now but I happened to meet a sexy guy the other day .
You know when you do n't know someone very well - you 'll probably never see them again - but you just meet them and you 're like ' Wow , you really have it going on ' ? "
Sounds like she 's sending a subtle message to her mystery man .
No doubt every male she has spoken to in L.A. recently is assuming he's her guy and he 's really got it going on .
It should be interesting to see who surfaces .
Hathaway is scheduled to star with Johnny Depp in Tim Burton 's Alice in Wonderland .
She has signed on to play the White Queen .

Post systems ( think of generative grammars ) are string transformations based on repeated , perhaps context - sensitive , substitutions -- replacements of substrings by other strings .
The substitutions are expressed via a finite sequence of rules ( grammar productions ) .
The order of applying the rules is not defined .
Normal Markov algorithms , true to the name , are a restricted , `normal ' form of rule - based substitution systems .
Substitutions are performed in the strictly defined order and regardless of the surrounding context .
The whole string transformation process runs deterministically and can be done by a simple mechanism , a `machine ' .
Normal Markov algorithms deserve to be called `algorithms ' .
( There is a play of words missing in English : `algorithm ' is `алгоритм ' in Russian .
Markov called his system `алгорифм '. )
Normal Markov algorithm is hence a machine that repeatedly rewrites the given input string according to an ordered sequence of rewriting rules .
Each rule is a pair of strings : the source src and the replacement rplc , each of which may be empty .
Some rules may be marked as terminal .
The work cycle of the machine is : find the first rule in the sequence whose src appears as a substring of the input string .
Replace the leftmost occurrence of the src with the rplc of the rule .
If the rule is terminal , stop .
Otherwise , start the cycle anew , the just rewritten string being the input .
If no rule applies , stop .
As an example , the following sequence of rules , written as an OCaml array , converts a big-endian binary number ( a string of 0 s and 1 s ) into the string of vertical bars encoding the same number in unary .
let bin_to_unary = [| rule " 1 " " 0 | " ; rule " |0 " " 0|| " ; rule " 0 " " " ; | ]
run bin_to_unary " 110 "
" | | | | | | "
Curious readers may want to work out how the following rules
let gcd = [| rule " aA " " Aa " ; rule " a# a " " A# " ; rule " a # " " # B " ; rule " B " " a " ; rule " A " " C " ; rule " C " " a " ; rule " # " " " ; | ]

Markov has shown that all known classes of string transformations performed by a finite sequence of rewriting rules can be expressed as a normal algorithm ( that is , `normalizable ' ) .
This let him pose that all algorithms are normalizable .
He justified his thesis more than either Turing or Church did for the corresponding Church - Turing thesis .
Here is how V.M. Glushkov ( cited from the English translation ) describes this justification :
The validity of this [ Markov normalization ] principle is based first of all on the fact that all the algorithms known at the present time are normalizable .
Since in the course of the long history of the development of the exact sciences a considerable number of different algorithms have been devised , this statement is convincing in itself .
In actuality it is even more convincing .
We can show that all the methods known at the present time for the composition of algorithms which make it possible to construct new algorithms from the already known ones do not go beyond the limits of the class of normalizable algorithms .
...
However this is not all .
A whole series of scientists have undertaken special attempts to construct algorithms of a more general form and all these attempts have not been carried beyond the limits of the class of normalizable algorithms .
I 'd like to clear a common misunderstanding about the exact period when A.A. Markov developed his theory of algorithms .
All the English sources that I have seen claim that Markov Algorithms was the work of 1960s -- most likely , based on the publication date of the very brief English translation of Markov 's work .
However , the theory was published in Russian quite a bit earlier .
According to the bibliography of A.A. Markov ( referenced below ) , the first paper ` Theory of algorithms ' appeared in Steklov 's Mathematics Institute journal in 1951 .
Three years later , in 1954 , A.A. Markov published a 376 - page book with the same title .
He was working in the area of string algorithms already in 1947 , when he published his famous result : undecidability of word problems in semigroups .
An analysis of the gut contents from an exceptionally well - preserved juvenile dinosaur fossil suggests that the hadrosaur 's last meal included plenty of well - chewed leaves digested into tiny bits .
The fossil , Brachylophosaurus canadensis aka " Leonardo , " is the second well - substantiated case in which the gut contents of a plant - eating dinosaur have been revealed , said Justin S. Tweet , who was a graduate student at the University of Colorado at Boulder when he studied the fossil with colleagues there including paleontologist Karen Chin .
The dino , found in what geologists call the Judith River Formation , in Montana , will go on display to the public Friday at the Houston Museum of Natural Science 's " Dinosaur Mummy CSA : Cretaceous Science Investigation " exhibition .
" Our interpretation suggests that the subadult Judith River Formation brachylophosaur had a leaf - dominated diet shortly before its death , " the authors write in the September issue of PALAIOS , the journal of the Society for Sedimentary Geology .
Skin and scales Leonardo is a 77 - million - year - old duckbilled dinosaur whose remains are covered with patterned fossilized skin .
The specimen has given scientists a rare peek inside a dinosaur .
Digital technology and X - ray scans , some of which were conducted at NASA Johnson Space Center 's Ellington Field facility in Texas , has helped paleontologists reconstruct what Leonardo looked like in life , what it ate , its muscle mass and its limb movements .
An analysis of pollen found in the specimen 's gut region revealed a variety of plants , including ferns , conifers and flowering plants .
Although the pollen could have been ingested when the dinosaur drank water , the tiny leaf bits , under 5 millimeters ( a quarter - inch ) in length , indicate that Leonardo was a big browser of plants , Chin said .
Hadrosaurs were certainly capable of processing food into tiny bits in part with their continually replacing teeth and grinding jaws .
The tricky part with the analysis was building a case that the plant matter found inside the gut came from the dinosaur 's last meal , not from material that penetrated the body or flowed into the area after death .
The case was helped by the fact that Leonardo was buried quickly and undisturbed by scavengers , and its body cavity appears to be undisturbed .
At least 12 percent of the gut contents in the carcass included organic matter , such as leaves .
The rest was clay and grit .
Some of the inorganic stuff probably flowed into the body after death , Tweet said .
Overall , the most exciting part of the research was working with material that could actually be gut contents , Tweet said .
" This is very rare for dinosaurs , where we usually have to settle for generalizations of feeding behavior based on skull anatomy , " he told LiveScience .
The research was funded by grants through the University of Colorado and its Museum of Natural History and a Geological Society of American Graduate Student Grant .
' Cranial Cuisinart ' Houston Museum of Natural Science Curator of Paleontology Robert T. Bakker , one of the first scientists to work on the fossil , said that duckbilled dinosaurs like Leonardo had large beaks and jaws full of tiny teeth , about 800 of them , that ground and chopped tough plants and plant parts , including conifer needles , bark and twigs , like a " cranial Cuisinart . "
The contents of the gastrointestinal tract then were processed by digestive juices and gut microbes .
Leonardo has a pebbly skin texture , like the lower leg of an ostrich or another big bird , Bakker said , but on the front of Leonardo 's ankle and shin , the skin becomes very thick like armor which helped it move through the underbrush .
The fossil was discovered in the summer of 2000 during an expedition to a cattle ranch about 15 miles north of Malta , Mont .
Leonardo was named after graffiti found on a nearby rock that read : " Leonard Webb loves Geneva Jordan 1916 . "
The Houston exhibition will also feature an icthyosaur " mummy , " which has contents of her intestines and four babies preserved inside her body , and the only mummified Triceratops skin ever found .
The exhibition 's opening was delayed a week as a result of conditions and power losses in the Houston area after Hurricane Ike , including five days without primary power at the museum .
Leonardo and other exhibition specimens were unharmed , a museum spokeswoman said .

John Bolton and Mengele ’s Moustache
Let us all please , please understand : John Bolton is a war criminal , one of the most loathsome wretches ever vomited up by the corrupted , militarised power structure of the US elite .
He happily , gladly , giddily went to work for Trump , knowing he was a corrupt , racist , authoritarian scumbag .
His only objection to Trump was that the feckless casino boss was not quite as murderously , berserkly war - like enough to satisfy Bolton ’s lifelong perversion for mass murder .
Remember also : it was Bolton who , snuffling and shuffling as Trump ’s dogsbody , personally eliminated the government ’s pandemic response team .
He was happy to act as Trump ’s point man in surrendering the American people to the ravages of a far more deadly foe than the Iranians , Russians and Chinese who goose Bolton ’s creepy night - dreams .
He ’s not part of the “ Resistance , ” he ’s not a hero , he ’s not an ally ; he would very happily see your children burned alive in a worldwide conflagration to satisfy his extremist bloodlust .
And his stupid little self - fluffing book – offering up tidbits that he cravenly refused to provide in the impeachment process , when it might have done some good – is nothing but a slobbering grab for big money by an ignorant goober who will probably die the same way Josef Mengele did : choked on a hairball from anxiously chewing the ends of his ludicrous moustache .
Sons of the South : Juneteenth and the Enduring Shackles of Racism
As many are pointing out today on Juneteenth , the formal ending of slavery did not mean an end to peonage for Black Americans .
The rich and powerful worked closely with law enforcement to thrust multitudes of African - Americans back into forced labor , for generations .
The elite manipulated the courts and prison systems to ensure a steady supply of cheap or free labor to replenish the fortunes they 'd made from slavery , and to build the " New South " where Jim Crow reigned supreme .
Many years ago , I read an excellent book on the subject , " Worse Than Slavery , " by David Oshinsky .
Several more good histories have been written since .
After reading the book , I wrote the song below , recorded here in a rough form four or five years ago .
I 'd probably do it differently now , but here it is , for whatever it 's worth .
The Georgia Debacle : The Democrats Surrender Democracy Again
When you are ruled by unconscionable wretches , this is what happens .
And the Georgia vote debacle was a deliberately designed test run for the November election .
As I 've said for months , there is not going to be anything remotely like a fair and open election across much of the country .
The GOP vote - suppression machine has been growing wider and more brazen year after year .
The Democratic leadership has watched it happen and done almost nothing about it , never made it a signature issue ; they 've never gone to the mat to fight with everything they 've got to ensure that voters can have their say -- even when the voters being disenfranchised by hook , crook and " breakdown " overwhelmingly vote Democratic .
While Obama spent * years * seeking his " grand bargain " with the GOP to cut Social Security and Medicare in exchange for some watered - down social programs , the GOP were shutting down literally thousands of polling places in Democratic districts , throwing hundreds of thousands of Democratic - leaning voters off the rolls in state after state , and imposing draconian " Voter ID " targeted at the poor .
Now we are reaping the whirlwind -- and now , only now , are some Dem leaders beginning to ... yes , do that thing they do so well : talk about maybe doing something possibly about it at some point .
The fact is , if the November vote is to be saved it all , it will have to be saved by people and groups like those in this story , who go to the frontlines and help facilitate the process for those being suppressed , who stand their ground against illegal police intimidation when they exercise their rights : by people who DO something , not those who make empty gestures with Kente cloth while allowing an authoritarian criminal to loot the country in front of their eyes ( Yes , again : why has Trump not been impeached for his vast , open , undeniable financial crimes and corruption ?
Why ?
Why ?
Why ? ) and allowing a party of rabid extremists to destroy the democratic process itself .
Our only hope lies in the people in this story -- and in the hundreds of thousands of people now on the streets of America , demanding action , not willing to be fobbed off any longer with mewling promises of incremental " reform " somewhere down the line .
We Are Devo : the UK's Barbaric , Trump - like Embrace of Mass Death
As I said before : Johnson is going to go Full Trump and simply surrender to the virus , which is what he 's wanted to do from the very beginning .
We 're just going to have to live in a Covid - riddled world , and hope for the best .
And yes , this might end up all right for most of us ; but we must also steel ourselves to say goodbye to a goodly proportion of friends and loved ones with ill health or advanced age long before they should have left us .
But our leaders do n't care about that .
Johnson and his gaggle of greed - blinded ministers have already overseen a viciously brutal culling of the most vulnerable among us , as they consigned tens of thousands to die in care homes -- the same care homes sold off to callous investors by Tory profiteering extremists over the past ten years .
It 's often said that the true moral value of a society is shown in how it treats its most vulnerable members .
There is evidence of the most primitive humans and even Neanderthals caring tenderly for the sick and damaged among them , not regarding them as burdens but as loved , valued members of the tribe .
What we are seeing today in modern Britain ( and modern America ) is a staggering degeneration of these ancient values ; a dearth of empathy that would have profoundly shocked our ancestors .
A Shrivelled Soul in a Bag of Bluster : BoJo , the World 's Most Racist Clown
A man who calls black people , in print , " piccaninnies " with " watermelon smiles " etc. – vile racist terms – now calls for some kind of undefined " inquiry " into ... racism .
This vague notion was " announced " not by the government , but in a small article in a rightwing newspaper that has paid the slur - slinger hundreds of thousands of pounds over the years to spew a barrage of demonstrable lies .
But even in grudgingly floating the " inquiry " idea , the Man Who Speaks Racism in Print for Pay makes sure to belittle the effects of racism .
He says he wants the dark people he disparages for money to get over their " sense of victimisation . "
That 's the real problem , you see ; those people FEEL like they 're victims .
They 're suffering from the self - inflicted wound of " victimisation , " not the objective , lived reality of systemic racism .
If they 'd just stop doing that to themselves , why then , we 'd see those wonderful " watermelon smiles " again , not all these nasty protests !
( Of course , the most violent protest , by far , has been the hours - long riot in the center of London by right - wing mobs who feel and speak about blacks the same way the prime minister does .
As in the US , they feel empowered and emboldened by having a sympathetic purveyor of racist tropes leading the whole country .
Although to be fair to Donald Trump , he 's never used , in public , the gutter language that Johnson has employed . )
This is all part and parcel with the non-apology Johnson once muttered when challenged on his racist words .
He said he was sorry if anyone " felt offended " by what he wrote .
He was n't sorry he used the racist language , you understand ; he did n't feel he was wrong in using it ; he did n't apologize for using it .
He was only sorry that some of the silly dark folk got their feelings hurt like a bunch of little PC snowflakes .
Such is the corroded character of this wretched man : a shrivelled soul in a bag of bluster .
' I could still snort you under the table ' : Elton 's shocking reply after worse - for - wear Lily verbally assaults him onstage
They both have form for hell - raising , so it was always likely to be a lively combination .
But when Elton John and Lily Allen got up on stage to host a prestigious awards ceremony , no one predicted quite such fireworks .
The pair began quarelling in front of a shocked celebrity crowd when Miss Allen became drunken and dishevelled after gulping down champagne as the pair handed out awards .
War of words : Sir Elton John and Lily Allen exchanged verbal missiles at the GQ Men of the Year Awards last night
Top up : Lily kept her glass full throughout proceedings
Tension : Lily looked completely disinterested in proceedings while Sir Elton appeared less than impressed
Well hydrated : Sir Elton gave a look of concern as Lily indulged in yet another sip
Miss Allen , the daughter of actor Keith Allen , already looked well - refreshed by the time the GQ Men of the Year Awards began at London 's Royal Opera House on Tuesday evening .
The 23 - year - old , decked out in an extravagant Dolce and Gabbana ballgown and Chopard jewellery , soon began slurring , swearing and ad - libbing .
And when she introduced Carol Vorderman to the stage with a verbal tirade , saying ' F ***' no fewer than five times in the same sentence , her co-host decided enough was enough .
When Miss Allen came to announce '... and now the most important part of the night ' , Elton chipped in ' What ?
Are you going to have another drink ? '
She fired back : ' F*** off Elton .
I am 40 years younger than you and have my whole life ahead of me !'
The shocked audience fell silent .
Calm before the storm :
The pair started off the evening playing nice as the arrived on the red carpet
A clearly rattled Elton replied ' I could still snort you under the table ' .
To which she replied : ' F*** off .
I do n't know what you are talking about . '
On more than one occasion , Sir Elton could be seen having a stern word with her in the wings between awards .
And it was n't just Elton having a hard time at the receiving end of Miss Allen 's comments .
She also drunkenly blurted out the news that her brother , the stage actor Alfie Allen , had got engaged to girlfriend Jaime Winston , much to the couple 's shock since they had not even circulated the news among their friends .
And when Sir Elton made reference to 82 - year - old crooner Tony Bennett 's age as he was given the Inspiration Award , Miss Allen interrupted : “ I 'll still f*** him . ”
Miss Allen could be seen pouring herself champagne from a bottle she had hidden behind the lectern , gulping it down in between awards , and finally slumping down at the back of the stage .
Such was her state that she barely made it off the stage after the awards ended .
She went on to drink even more champagne at the afterparty and had to be helped out to her car by her ever - present bodyguard .
Dramatic entrance : Lily Allen arrived at the event wearing a giant ballgown
The galaxy of celebrities in attendance also witnessed stars as disparate as Led Zeppelin and London Mayor Boris Johnson collect honours .
With his windswept blond locks and unkempt appearance Mr Johnson may have been the most unlikely winner in the style stakes , but he was named Politician of the Year at the ceremony .
He received his gong from fashion experts Trinny and Susannah who not doubt gave the London Mayor their opinion on his chosen ensemble .
Helping hand :

Mr Johnson certainly stood out among the glamorous guests who attended the event , where there was no shortage of glittering frocks and impressive outfits .
Elizabeth Hurley , Elle Macpherson and Thandie Newton all presented awards to the successful winners .
Miss Hurley bestowed the Blackberry Entrepreneur of the Year award to Gordon Ramsay , who won Chef of the Year in 2007 .
Meanwhile Elton John took centre stage to present singer Tony Bennett with an Inspiration award .

Greg Mitchell reminds usof something that action star , and Republican , Chuck Norris said this past January , which Mike Huckabee looking on and not objecting :
“ Chuck Norris brought his tough - guy approach to the campaign trail Sunday , taking aim at John McCain ’s age and suggesting the Arizona senator might not last even a single term .
Norris , an ardent supporter of Mike Huckabee , told reporters he believes serving as president accelerates the aging process 3 - to - 1 . ‘ If John takes over the presidency at 72 and he ages 3 - to - 1 , how old will he be in four years ?
Eighty - four years old — and can he handle that kind of pressure in that job ? ’
Norris said , as Huckabee looked on .
‘ That ’s why I did n’t pick John to support , because I ’m just afraid the vice president will wind up taking over his job within that four - year presidency . ’ added the action star . ”
President Palin taking over the reins of the finance crisis , anyone ?
It ’s okay , you do n’t need to retire anyway .
Daniel Davies , in one of the great blog posts of this era , laid down a key principle :
Good ideas do not need lots of lies told about them in order to gain public acceptance .
He was talking about the selling of the Iraq war , but it applies more generally .
So , this morning Hank Paulson told a whopper :
We gave you a simple , three - page legislative outline and I thought it would have been presumptuous for us on that outline to come up with an oversight mechanism .
That ’s the role of Congress , that ’s something we ’re going to work on together .
So if any of you felt that I did n’t believe that we needed oversight : I believe we need oversight .
We need oversight .
What the proposal actually did , of course , was explicitly rule out any oversight , plus grant immunity from future review :
Sec. 8 . Review .
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
I ’m not playing gotcha here .
This is telling : if Paulson ca n’t be honest about what he himself sent to Congress — if he not only made an incredible power grab , but is now engaged in black - is - white claims that he did n’t — there is no reason to trust him on anything related to his bailout plan .
Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
Analysis of competing hypotheses , sometimes abbreviated ACH , is a tool to aid judgment on important issues requiring careful weighing of alternative explanations or conclusions .
It helps an analyst overcome , or at least minimize , some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient intelligence analysis so difficult to achieve .
ACH is an eight - step procedure grounded in basic insights from cognitive psychology , decision analysis , and the scientific method .
It is a surprisingly effective , proven process that helps analysts avoid common analytic pitfalls .
Because of its thoroughness , it is particularly appropriate for controversial issues when analysts want to leave an audit trail to show what they considered and how they arrived at their judgment .
84
*******************
When working on difficult intelligence issues , analysts are , in effect , choosing among several alternative hypotheses .
Which of several possible explanations is the correct one ?
Which of several possible outcomes is the most likely one ?
As previously noted , this book uses the term " hypothesis " in its broadest sense as a potential explanation or conclusion that is to be tested by collecting and presenting evidence .
Analysis of competing hypotheses ( ACH ) requires an analyst to explicitly identify all the reasonable alternatives and have them compete against each other for the analyst 's favor , rather than evaluating their plausibility one at a time .
The way most analysts go about their business is to pick out what they suspect intuitively is the most likely answer , then look at the available information from the point of view of whether or not it supports this answer .
If the evidence seems to support the favorite hypothesis , analysts pat themselves on the back ( " See , I knew it all along ! " ) and look no further .
If it does not , they either reject the evidence as misleading or develop another hypothesis and go through the same procedure again .
Decision analysts call this a satisficing strategy .
( See Chapter 4 , Strategies for Analytical Judgment . )
Satisficing means picking the first solution that seems satisfactory , rather than going through all the possibilities to identify the very best solution .
There may be several seemingly satisfactory solutions , but there is only one best solution .
Chapter 4 discussed the weaknesses in this approach .
The principal concern is that if analysts focus mainly on trying to confirm one hypothesis they think is probably true , they can easily be led astray by the fact that there is so much evidence to support their point of view .
They fail to recognize that most of this evidence is also consistent with other explanations or conclusions , and that these other alternatives have not been refuted .
Simultaneous evaluation of multiple , competing hypotheses is very difficult to do .
To retain three to five or even seven hypotheses in working memory and note how each item of information fits into each hypothesis is beyond the mental capabilities of most people .
It takes far greater mental agility than listing evidence supporting a single hypothesis that was pre-judged as the most likely answer .
It can be accomplished , though , with the help of the simple procedures discussed here .
The box below contains a step - by - step outline of the ACH process .
Step 1
Identify the possible hypotheses to be considered .
Use a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities .
Psychological research into how people go about generating hypotheses shows that people are actually rather poor at thinking of all the possibilities .
85
If a person does not even generate the correct hypothesis for consideration , obviously he or she will not get the correct answer .
Step - by - Step Outline of Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
1. Identify the possible hypotheses to be considered .
Use a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities .
2 . Make a list of significant evidence and arguments for and against each hypothesis .
3 . Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and evidence down the side .
Analyze the " diagnosticity " of the evidence and arguments -- that is , identify which items are most helpful in judging the relative likelihood of the hypotheses .
4. Refine the matrix .
Reconsider the hypotheses and delete evidence and arguments that have no diagnostic value .
5 . Draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis .
Proceed by trying to disprove the hypotheses rather than prove them .
6 . Analyze how sensitive your conclusion is to a few critical items of evidence .
Consider the consequences for your analysis if that evidence were wrong , misleading , or subject to a different interpretation .
7. Report conclusions .
Discuss the relative likelihood of all the hypotheses , not just the most likely one .
8. Identify milestones for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course than expected .
It is useful to make a clear distinction between the hypothesis generation and hypothesis evaluation stages of analysis .
Step 1 of the recommended analytical process is to identify all hypotheses that merit detailed examination .
At this early hypothesis generation stage , it is very useful to bring together a group of analysts with different backgrounds and perspectives .
Brainstorming in a group stimulates the imagination and may bring out possibilities that individual members of the group had not thought of .
Initial discussion in the group should elicit every possibility , no matter how remote , before judging likelihood or feasibility .
Only when all the possibilities are on the table should you then focus on judging them and selecting the hypotheses to be examined in greater detail in subsequent analysis .
When screening out the seemingly improbable hypotheses that you do not want to waste time on , it is necessary to distinguish hypotheses that appear to be disproved from those that are simply unproven .
For an unproven hypothesis , there is no evidence that it is correct .
For a disproved hypothesis , there is positive evidence that it is wrong .
As discussed in Chapter 4 , " Strategies for Analytical Judgment , " and under Step 5 below , you should seek evidence that disproves
hypotheses .
Early rejection of unproven , but not disproved , hypotheses biases the subsequent analysis , because one does not then look for the evidence that might support them .
Unproven hypotheses should be kept alive until they can be disproved .
One example of a hypothesis that often falls into this unproven but not disproved category is the hypothesis that an opponent is trying to deceive us .
You may reject the possibility of denial and deception because you see no evidence of it , but rejection is not justified under these circumstances .
If deception is planned well and properly implemented , one should not expect to find evidence of it readily at hand .
The possibility should not be rejected until it is disproved , or , at least , until after a systematic search for evidence has been made and none has been found .
There is no " correct " number of hypotheses to be considered .
The number depends upon the nature of the analytical problem and how advanced you are in the analysis of it .
As a general rule , the greater your level of uncertainty , or the greater the policy impact of your conclusion , the more alternatives you may wish to consider .
More than seven hypotheses may be unmanageable ; if there are this many alternatives , it may be advisable to group several of them together for your initial cut at the analysis .
Step 2
Make a list of significant evidence and arguments for and against each hypothesis .
In assembling the list of relevant evidence and arguments , these terms should be interpreted very broadly .
They refer to all the factors that have an impact on your judgments about the hypotheses .
Do not limit yourself to concrete evidence in the current intelligence reporting .
Also include your own assumptions or logical deductions about another person 's or group 's or country 's intentions , goals , or standard procedures .
These assumptions may generate strong preconceptions as to which hypothesis is most likely .
Such assumptions often drive your final judgment , so it is important to include them in the list of " evidence . "
First , list the general evidence that applies to all the hypotheses .
Then consider each hypothesis individually , listing factors that tend to support or contradict each one .
You will commonly find that each hypothesis leads you to ask different questions and , therefore , to seek out somewhat different evidence .
For each hypothesis , ask yourself this question :
If this hypothesis is true , what should I expect to be seeing or not seeing ?
What are all the things that must have happened , or may still be happening , and that one should expect to see evidence of ?
If you are not seeing this evidence , why not ?
Is it because it has not happened , it is not normally observable , it is being concealed from you , or because you or the intelligence collectors have not looked for it ?
Note the absence of evidence as well as its presence .
For example , when weighing the possibility of military attack by an adversary , the steps the adversary has not taken to ready his forces for attack may be more significant than the observable steps that have been taken .
This recalls the Sherlock Holmes story in which the vital clue was that the dog did not bark in the night .
One 's attention tends to focus on what is reported rather than what is not reported .
It requires a conscious effort to think about what is missing but should be present if a given hypothesis were true .
Step 3
Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and evidence down the side .
Analyze the " diagnosticity " of the evidence and arguments - that is , identify which items are most helpful in judging the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses .
Step 3 is perhaps the most important element of this analytical procedure .
It is also the step that differs most from the natural , intuitive approach to analysis , and , therefore , the step you are most likely to overlook or misunderstand .
The procedure for Step 3 is to take the hypotheses from Step 1 and the evidence and arguments from Step 2 and put this information into a matrix format , with the hypotheses across the top and evidence and arguments down the side .
This gives an overview of all the significant components of your analytical problem .
Then analyze how each piece of evidence relates to each hypothesis .
This differs from the normal procedure , which is to look at one hypothesis at a time in order to consider how well the evidence supports that hypothesis .
That will be done later , in Step 5 .
At this point , in Step 3 , take one item of evidence at a time , then consider how consistent that evidence is with each of the hypotheses .
Here is how to remember this distinction .
In Step 3 , you work across the rows of the matrix , examining one item of evidence at a time to see how consistent that item of evidence is with each of the hypotheses .
In Step 5 , you work down the columns of the matrix , examining one hypothesis at a time , to see how consistent that hypothesis is with all the evidence .
To fill in the matrix , take the first item of evidence and ask whether it is consistent with , inconsistent with , or irrelevant to each hypothesis .
Then make a notation accordingly in the appropriate cell under each hypothesis in the matrix .
The form of these notations in the matrix is a matter of personal preference .
It may be pluses , minuses , and question marks .
It may be C , I , and N / A standing for consistent , inconsistent , or not applicable .
Or it may be some textual notation .
In any event , it will be a simplification , a shorthand representation of the complex reasoning that went on as you thought about how the evidence relates to each hypothesis .
After doing this for the first item of evidence , then go on to the next item of evidence and repeat the process until all cells in the matrix are filled .
Figure 15 shows an example of how such a matrix might look .
It uses as an example the intelligence question that arose after the US bombing of Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993 : Will Iraq retaliate ?
The evidence in the matrix and how it is evaluated are hypothetical , fabricated for the purpose of providing a plausible example of the procedure .
The matrix does not reflect actual evidence or judgments available at that time to the US Intelligence Community .
Figure 15
Question : Will Iraq Retaliate for US Bombing of Its Intelligence Headquarters
The matrix format helps you weigh the diagnosticity of each item of evidence , which is a key difference between analysis of competing hypotheses and traditional analysis .
Diagnosticity of evidence is an important concept that is , unfortunately , unfamiliar to many analysts .
It was introduced in Chapter 4 , and that discussion is repeated here for your convenience .
Diagnosticity may be illustrated by a medical analogy .
A high - temperature reading may have great value in telling a doctor that a patient is sick , but relatively little value in determining which illness a person is suffering from .
Because a high temperature is consistent with so many possible hypotheses about a patient 's illness , this evidence has limited diagnostic value in determining which illness ( hypothesis ) is the more likely one .
Evidence is diagnostic when it influences your judgment on the relative likelihood of the various hypotheses identified in Step 1 .
If an item of evidence seems consistent with all the hypotheses , it may have no diagnostic value .
A common experience is to discover that most of the evidence supporting what you believe is the most likely hypothesis really is not very helpful , because that same evidence is also consistent with other hypotheses .
When you do identify items that are highly diagnostic , these should drive your judgment .
These are also the items for which you should re-check accuracy and consider alternative interpretations , as discussed in Step 6 .
In the hypothetical matrix dealing with Iraqi intentions , note that evidence designated " E1 " is assessed as consistent with all of the hypotheses .
In other words , it has no diagnostic value .
This is because we did not give any credence to Saddam 's public statement on this question .
He might say he will not retaliate but then do so , or state that he will retaliate and then not do it .
On the other hand , E4 is diagnostic : increased frequency or length of Iraqi agent radio broadcasts is more likely to be observed if the Iraqis are planning retaliation than if they are not .
The double minus for E6 indicates this is considered a very strong argument against H1 .
It is a linchpin assumption that drives the conclusion in favor of either H2 or H3 .
Several of the judgments reflected in this matrix will be questioned at a later stage in this analysis .
In some cases it may be useful to refine this procedure by using a numerical probability , rather than a general notation such as plus or minus , to describe how the evidence relates to each hypothesis .
To do this , ask the following question for each cell in the matrix :
If this hypothesis is true , what is the probability that I would be seeing this item of evidence ?
You may also make one or more additional notations in each cell of the matrix , such as :
Adding a scale to show the intrinsic importance of each item of evidence .
Adding a scale to show the ease with which items of evidence could be concealed , manipulated , or faked , or the extent to which one party might have an incentive to do so .
This may be appropriate when the possibility of denial and deception is a serious issue .
Step 4
Refine the matrix .
Reconsider the hypotheses and delete evidence and arguments that have no diagnostic value .
The exact wording of the hypotheses is obviously critical to the conclusions one can draw from the analysis .
By this point , you will have seen how the evidence breaks out under each hypothesis , and it will often be appropriate to reconsider and reword the hypotheses .
Are there hypotheses that need to be added , or finer distinctions that need to be made in order to consider all the significant alternatives ?
If there is little orno evidence that helps distinguish between two hypotheses , should they be combined into one ?
Also reconsider the evidence .
Is your thinking about which hypotheses are most likely and least likely influenced by factors that are not included in the listing of evidence ?
If so , put them in .
Delete from the matrix items of evidence or assumptions that now seem unimportant or have no diagnostic value .
Save these items in a separate list as a record of information that was considered .
Step 5
Draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis .
Proceed by trying to disprove hypotheses rather than prove them .
In Step 3 , you worked across the matrix , focusing on a single item of evidence or argument and examining how it relates to each hypothesis .
Now , work down the matrix , looking at each hypothesis as a whole .
The matrix format gives an overview of all the evidence for and against all the hypotheses , so that you can examine all the hypotheses together and have them compete against each other for your favor .
In evaluating the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses , start by looking for evidence or logical deductions that enable you to reject hypotheses , or at least to determine that they are unlikely .
A fundamental precept of the scientific method is to proceed by rejecting or eliminating hypotheses , while tentatively accepting only those hypotheses that can not be refuted .
The scientific method obviously cannot be applied in toto to intuitive judgment , but the principle of seeking to disprove hypotheses , rather than confirm them , is useful .
No matter how much information is consistent with a given hypothesis , one cannot prove that hypothesis is true , because the same information may also be consistent with one or more other hypotheses .
On the other hand , a single item of evidence that is inconsistent with a hypothesis may be sufficient grounds for rejecting that hypothesis .
This was discussed in detail in Chapter 4 , " Strategies for Analytical Judgment . "
People have a natural tendency to concentrate on confirming hypotheses they already believe to be true , and they commonly give more weight to information that supports a hypothesis than to information that weakens it .
This is wrong ; we should do just the opposite .
Step 5 again requires doing the opposite of what comes naturally .
In examining the matrix , look at the minuses , or whatever other notation you used to indicate evidence that may be inconsistent with a hypothesis .
The hypotheses with the fewest minuses is probably the most likely one .
The hypothesis with the most minuses is probably the least likely one .
The fact that a hypothesis is inconsistent with the evidence is certainly a sound basis for rejecting it .
The pluses , indicating evidence that is consistent with a hypothesis , are far less significant .
It does not follow that the hypothesis with the most pluses is the most likely one , because a long list of evidence that is consistent with almost any reasonable hypothesis can be easily made .
What is difficult to find , and is most significant when found , is hard evidence that is clearly inconsistent with a reasonable hypothesis .
This initial ranking by number of minuses is only a rough ranking , however , as some evidence obviously is more important than other evidence , and degrees of inconsistency cannot be captured by a single notation such as a plus or minus .
By reconsidering the exact nature of the relationship between the evidence and the hypotheses , you will be able to judge how much weight to give it .
Analysts who follow this procedure often realize that their judgments are actually based on very few factors rather than on the large mass of information they thought was influencing their views .
Chapter 5 , " Do You Really Need More Information ? , " makes this same point based on experimental evidence .
The matrix should not dictate the conclusion to you .
Rather , it should accurately reflect your judgment of what is important and how these important factors relate to the probability of each hypothesis .
You , not the matrix , must make the decision .
The matrix serves only as an aid to thinking and analysis , to ensure consideration of all the possible interrelationships between evidence and hypotheses and identification of those few items that really swing your judgment on the issue .
When the matrix shows that a given hypothesis is probable or unlikely , you may disagree .
If so , it is because you omitted from the matrix one or more factors that have an important influence on your thinking .
Go back and put them in , so that the analysis reflects your best judgment .
If following this procedure has caused you to consider things you might otherwise have overlooked , or has caused you to revise your earlier estimate of the relative probabilities of the hypotheses , then the procedure has served a useful purpose .
When you are done , the matrix serves as a shorthand record of your thinking and as an audit trail showing how you arrived at your conclusion .
This procedure forces you to spend more analytical time than you otherwise would on what you had thought were the less likely hypotheses .
This is desirable .
The seemingly less likely hypotheses usually involve plowing new ground and , therefore , require more work .
What you started out thinking was the most likely hypothesis tends to be based on a continuation of your own past thinking .
A principal advantage of the analysis of competing hypotheses is that it forces you to give a fairer shake to all the alternatives .
Step 6
Analyze how sensitive your conclusion is to a few critical items of evidence .
Consider the consequences for your analysis if that evidence were wrong , misleading , or subject to a different interpretation .
In Step 3 you identified the evidence and arguments that were most diagnostic , and in Step 5 you used these findings to make tentative judgments about the hypotheses .
Now , go back and question the few linchpin assumptions or items of evidence that really drive the outcome of your analysis in one direction or the other .
Are there questionable assumptions that underlie your understanding and interpretation ?
Are there alternative explanations or interpretations ?
Could the evidence be incomplete and , therefore , misleading ?
If there is any concern at all about denial and deception , this is an appropriate place to consider that possibility .
Look at the sources of your key evidence .
Are any of the sources known to the authorities in the foreign country ?
Could the information have been manipulated ?
Put yourself in the shoes of a foreign deception planner to evaluate motive , opportunity , means , costs , and benefits of deception as they might appear to the foreign country .
When analysis turns out to be wrong , it is often because of key assumptions that went unchallenged and proved invalid .
It is a truism that analysts should identify and question assumptions , but this is much easier said than done .
The problem is to determine which assumptions merit questioning .
One advantage of the ACH procedure is that it tells you what needs to be rechecked .
In Step 6 you may decide that additional research is needed to check key judgments .
For example , it may be appropriate to go back to check original source materials rather than relying on someone else 's interpretation .
In writing your report , it is desirable to identify critical assumptions that went into your interpretation and to note that your conclusion is dependent upon the validity of these assumptions .
Step 7
Report conclusions .
Discuss the relative likelihood of all the hypotheses , not just the most likely one .
If your report is to be used as the basis for decisionmaking , it will be helpful for the decisionmaker to know the relative likelihood of all the alternative possibilities .
Analytical judgments are never certain .
There is always a good possibility of their being wrong .
Decisionmakers need to make decisions on the basis of a full set of alternative possibilities , not just the single most likely alternative .
Contingency or fallback plans may be needed in case one of the less likely alternatives turns out to be true .
If you say that a certain hypothesis is probably true , that could mean anywhere from a 55 - percent to an 85 - percent chance that future events will prove it correct .
That leaves anywhere from a 15 - percent to 45 percent possibility that a decision based on your judgment will be based on faulty assumptions and will turn out wrong .
Can you be more specific about how confident you are in your judgment ?
Chapter 12 , " Biases in Estimating Probabilities , " discusses the difference between such " subjective probability " judgments and statistical probabilities based on data on relative frequencies .
When one recognizes the importance of proceeding by eliminating rather than confirming hypotheses , it becomes apparent that any written argument for a certain judgment is incomplete unless it also discusses alternative judgments that were considered and why they were rejected .
In the past , at least , this was seldom done .
The narrative essay , which is the dominant art form for the presentation of intelligence judgments , does not lend itself to comparative evaluation of competing hypotheses .
Consideration of alternatives adds to the length of reports and is perceived by many analysts as detracting from the persuasiveness of argument for the judgment chosen .
Analysts may fear that the reader could fasten on one of the rejected alternatives as a good idea .
Discussion of alternative hypotheses is nonetheless an important part of any intelligence appraisal , and ways can and should be found to include it .
Step 8
Identify milestones for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course than expected .
Analytical conclusions should always be regarded as tentative .
The situation may change , or it may remain unchanged while you receive new information that alters your appraisal .
It is always helpful to specify in advance things one should look for or be alert to that , if observed , would suggest a significant change in the probabilities .
This is useful for intelligence consumers who are following the situation on a continuing basis .
Specifying in advance what would cause you to change your mind will also make it more difficult for you to rationalize such developments , if they occur , as not really requiring any modification of your judgment .
Summary and Conclusion
Three key elements distinguish analysis of competing hypotheses from conventional intuitive analysis .
Analysis starts with a full set of alternative possibilities , rather than with a most likely alternative for which the analyst seeks confirmation .
This ensures that alternative hypotheses receive equal treatment and a fair shake .
Analysis identifies and emphasizes the few items of evidence or assumptions that have the greatest diagnostic value in judging the relative likelihood of the alternative hypotheses .
In conventional intuitive analysis , the fact that key evidence may also be consistent with alternative hypotheses is rarely considered explicitly and often ignored .
Analysis of competing hypotheses involves seeking evidence to refute hypotheses .
The most probable hypothesis is usually the one with the least evidence against it , not the one with the most evidence for it .
Conventional analysis generally entails looking for evidence to confirm a favored hypothesis .
The analytical effectiveness of this procedure becomes apparent when considering the Indian nuclear weapons testing in 1998 .
According to Admiral Jeremiah , the Intelligence Community had reported that " there was no indication the Indians would test in the near term .
" 86 Such a conclusion by the Community would fail to distinguish an unproven hypothesis from a disproved hypothesis .
An absence of evidence does not necessarily disprove the hypothesis that India will indeed test nuclear weapons .
If the ACH procedure had been used , one of the hypotheses would certainly have been that India is planning to test in the near term but will conceal preparations for the testing to forestall international pressure to halt such preparations .
Careful consideration of this alternative hypothesis would have required evaluating India 's motive , opportunity , and means for concealing its intention until it was too late for the US and others to intervene .
It would also have required assessing the ability of US intelligence to see through Indian denial and deception if it were being employed .
It is hard to imagine that this would not have elevated awareness of the possibility of successful Indian deception .
A principal lesson is this .
Whenever an intelligence analyst is tempted to write the phrase " there is no evidence that ... , " the analyst should ask this question :
If this hypothesis is true , can I realistically expect to see evidence of it ?
In other words , if India were planning nuclear tests while deliberately concealing its intentions , could the analyst realistically expect to see evidence of test planning ?
The ACH procedure leads the analyst to identify and face these kinds of questions .
Once you have gained practice in applying analysis of competing hypotheses , it is quite possible to integrate the basic concepts of this procedure into your normal analytical thought process .
In that case , the entire eight - step procedure may be unnecessary , except on highly controversial issues .
There is no guarantee that ACH or any other procedure will produce a correct answer .
The result , after all , still depends on fallible intuitive judgment applied to incomplete and ambiguous information .
Analysis of competing hypotheses does , however , guarantee an appropriate process of analysis .
This procedure leads you through a rational , systematic process that avoids some common analytical pitfalls .
It increases the odds of getting the right answer , and it leaves an audit trail showing the evidence used in your analysis and how this evidence was interpreted .
If others disagree with your judgment , the matrix can be used to highlight the precise area of disagreement .
Subsequent discussion can then focus productively on the ultimate source of the differences .
A common experience is that analysis of competing hypotheses attributes greater likelihood to alternative hypotheses than would conventional analysis .
One becomes less confident of what one thought one knew .
In focusing more attention on alternative explanations , the procedure brings out the full uncertainty inherent in any situation that is poor in data but rich in possibilities .
Although such uncertainty is frustrating , it may be an accurate reflection of the true situation .
As Voltaire said , " Doubt is not a pleasant state , but certainty is a ridiculous one .
"
87
The ACH procedure has the offsetting advantage of focusing attention on the few items of critical evidence that cause the uncertainty or which , if they were available , would alleviate it .
This can guide future collection , research , and analysis to resolve the uncertainty and produce a more accurate judgment .

SCRAPPING THE AYERS ATTACK ALREADY ?….
The political world was told to expect some ugly , guilt - by - association attacks last night .
We ’d hear about Bill Ayers .
And Tony Rezko .
And maybe even Jeremiah Wright .
The phrase “ unrepentant terrorist ” would be bandied about .
And then , nothing .
The telegraphed punch was never thrown .
Did McCain just forget ?
Or did he perhaps think that a town - hall forum was the wrong setting for the attacks ?
Apparently , this was deliberate .
This morning on “ Fox & Friends , ” McCain aide Nicole Wallace backed off Ayers - related talk , saying the association “ is between Barack Obama and the voters . ”
The Politico reported that the smear campaign that ’s been in the works for days may be scrapped altogether .
[ McCain ’s ] top aides suggested afterward that , going forward , the candidate would n’t focus on the former domestic terrorist nor invoke the name of Obama ’s controversial pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Nicolle Wallace , a top McCain adviser , hinted McCain would not bring it up .
“ If asked about it , of course [ he ’ll talk about Ayers ] , ” she said .
McCain ’s chief strategist , Steve Schmidt all but said the controversial pastor remained off - limits . [ … ]
It ’s no mystery why McCain is easing back on , or withholding entirely , such character - based assaults :
Even with the $ 700 billion rescue plan signed into law , the economic crisis appears to be worsening not stabilizing .
“ As long as the Dow is down 500 points a day , that ’s going to push a lot of the Rezko and Ayers stuff off the front pages , ” acknowledged a Republican National Committee official .
It ’s hard to know for sure what the thinking is behind all of this .
It ’s possible that the McCain campaign talked up these attacks just to reintroduce the concept to voters and reporters , and never had any real intention to pursue this tack .
Given Sarah Palin ’s recent rhetoric , though , this seems unlikely .
This really was going to be a major offensive .
So why pull back ?
Probably because it was a spectacularly bad idea to shift the campaign ’s focus away from the economy in the midst of a financial meltdown and deep voter / consumer anxiety .
Greg Sargent added that the shift “ suggests that the McCain campaign ’s internal polling on how the Ayers stuff is playing is just brutal , likely among independents .
It also suggests that Obama ’s counter - attack — lambasting McCain ’s campaign for wanting to change the subject from the economy to personal attacks — has been effective . ”

By now you ’ve likely heard of microfinance , and the idea behind it — lending a small amount of money to support a person in the developing world create or enhance a business , and they pay back the money on very palatable terms .
A small amount goes a long way , coupled with the ingenuity born of necessity .
Sound familiar , entrepreneurs ?
It sounds like a fine idea , but you have n’t gone there yet .
What ’s stopping you ?
Perhaps it still somehow sounds like charity .
Do yourself a favor , and go watch the introductory video on the new KivaB4B site , which makes the most clear , compelling connection between entrepreneurs like yourself , and people in the countries that microfinance serves .
It shows , side by side , the similar needs and activities we all have as entrepreneurs — a little boost , a bit of advice , and a lot of encouragement and community .
In a powerful synergy , Kiva , one of the top players in this realm , has partnered with Advanta , a credit issuer that is highly supportive of small businesses , to create KivaB4B .
It ’s simple really :
You as a business owner put money towards someone via Kiva , and Advanta matches it , dollar for dollar , up to $ 200 a month .
This may sound small , but think about it this way :
If only 1 % of Advanta ’s 1.3 million customers put even $ 50 towards this , that would mean $ 1.3 million going to these people .
Dollars that go a lot farther then they do here , making for a potentially significant positive impact for people just like yourself , really .
You were once ( or perhaps you still are ) getting started in business , and for many of you , there was some break , some nudge , some sign that you were going to go further than just an idea , just another company failing after a year .
KivaB4B now provides you with a simple , no maintenance way to do the same , for the person of your choice , at as little or as much money as you care to put towards this .
Not all corporate social responsibility efforts need to be grandiose .
Sometimes it ’s the smallest of gestures that can have the greatest of impact .
And satisfaction .
To see specific examples of who ’s giving and who ’s receiving , go the the KivaB4B website , and click the Who ’s Giving link .
You may just recognize yourself in these people .
To learn more about KivaB4B , and other happenings in the world of microfinance ( or to write about it yourself ! )
KivaB4B has a community blog here .
Readers :
What sort of businesses would you like to support through microfinance ?
What are some other examples of microfinance and social enterprise development you ’ve seen and admire ?
What are some other models of creating economic and social vitality that exist or your propose ?

There has been over 400 versions of the English Bible since the King James Bible was published in 1611 .
They come in every flavor , fashion and fad imaginable .
Starting with the Revised Version ( 1881 ) ; to the American Standard Version ( 1901 ) ; to the Amplified Bible ( 1958 ) ; to the Living Bible ( 1967 ) ; to the New International Version ( 1973 ) ; to the New King James Bible ( 1979 ) ; on and on they go .
. .
There ’s feminists Bibles such as the Feminist NIV Inclusive and the TNIV ; the African - American Jubilee Bible ; and the piles and piles of Children ’s and Teen Bibles – we have seen it all .
Or. . .
We just thought we had seen it all .
. .
The latest $ cam running the gamut of the Bible PERversion trail is the new " fashion " magazine teen Bibles .
They are modeled after the " teenage - fashion " magazines complete with the trendy " beauty secrets " , " ask a guy " , and " BLABS " columns .
The first to crawl out of the " fashion " pile is the Revolve Bible .
The Revolve Bible is aimed directly at the young teenage Christian girl .
It is published by Thomas Nelson Publishers under Transit Books ( www.transitbooks.com).Transit.com says of it ’s new creation , " It 's the complete New Testament , but it looks just like a fashion magazine ! " and a little P.$ .
" Order your copy today at www.amazon.com! " A " boy " version of the Revolve is also in the works .
Zondervan reportedly , also has " fashion - bibles " on the way .
( did I hear ca$h - ching ? )
And yes .
. .
The Revolve " Bible " does indeed , look , feel and read just like a teenage " fashion " magazine .
As the saying goes , " If it looks like a duck , walks like a duck , and quacks like a duck – it ’s probably a duck . "
An updated Bible PERversion translation says , " If it looks like a fashion magazine , feels like a fashion magazine , and reads like a fashion magazine – it ’s probably a new Bible PERversion " .
If the fashion - magazine - madness was not bad enough – the Bible text used in the Revolve is the New Century Version ( NCV ) .
The NCV is the product of the Church of Christ affiliated World Bible Translation Center ( WBTC ) .
The NCV was originally created in 1978 as an easy - reader Bible for the Deaf titled the Easy Reader Version ( ERV ) .
In 1983 , the ERV was repackaged ( can you say ca$h - ching ? ) as the best - selling Children ’s International Version .
And in 1984 , it was repackaged again ( can you say ca$h - ching .
. . ca$h - ching ? ) as the New Century Version .
The NCV holds the title as feminist " gender - neutral translation " .
( Vern S. Poythress & Wayne A. Grudem , The Gender - Neutral Bible Controversy , Muting the Masculinity of God ’s Words , p. 9 )
It ’s odd with so much emphasis put on " gender - inclusive " and all the Bible publishers zooming into overdrive to produce " gender- inclusive "
Bibles that they are now producing a " gender- exclusive " Bible devoted EXCLUSIVELY to teenage girls ?
( Did I hear a ca$h - ching . . .?)
The NCV ranks among the most liberally mis-translated and corrupted Bibles in circulation .
We will examine the history and text of the NCV a later with our article : The New Century Version : Easy to Read OR Easy to Mislead ?
But let ’s first examine the fashion - folly - foolishness of the Revolve .
The cover of the Revolve screams at you with the typical " in your face " fashion magazine gaudy layout .
The cover of Revolve shouts the following headlines : " Are You Dating a Godly Guy ? " and other Quizzes

The above feature columns are colorfully scattered throughout the Revolve , weaving in between the New Testament text of the New Century Bible .
Interesting , the top of Revolve reads , " NCV The Complete New Testament "  but " new testament " is not found in the New Century Version !
The NCV replaces " New Testament " with " New Agreement " .
Why did n’t the Thomas Nelson - Revolve staff write on the cover " NCV The Complete New Agreement " ?
Simple . . .
They knew better .
But they ’ll market and promote the same misleading and mis-translated Bible to our teenagers .
Can you say ca$h - ching , see 1 Timothy 6:10 ?
The Revolve " design " is the work of " rock ‘n roll " Four 5 One of Dublin , Ireland .
Four 5
One is also the design team for the album covers , CD inserts , posters , programs , etc. for the rock group U2 , among others .
Four 5 One. . .
Now , that is a good " godly " choice to design " God ’s Word " .
Let ’s take a few examples of the Revolve ’s feature columns : " GUYS SPEAK OUT " Like the other features , the " Guys Speak Out " sections are littered throughout the Revolve .
Described on the cover of Revolve as : " Guys Speak Out on Tons of Important Issues " .
Let ’s look at a couple of the " important issues " found in the " Guys Speak Out " : Q : How long should you date before you say " I love you ? "
A : I would say that when all you can do is think about that person , and you know them really , really well , then you can say " I love you . "
( Revolve , p. 67 )
Q : Do you ever think about getting married ?
A : Kinda , I guess .
But not really .
Like , I ’d never buy a wedding magazine or anything .
( Revolve , p. 281 ) Brilliant . . .
Spiritual words of wisdom .
. .
Parents , do you really want hormone - crazy teenage boys to give advise on " tons of important issues " to your young teenage daughter ?
As a father of two teenage daughters , I think I ’ll pass on that deal .
To show the hormone mindset of the average teenage boy , look at the following answers to the simple question : " What do you think about girls and guys praying together ? " :
Q : What do you think about girls and guys praying together ?
A : There are exceptions , but usually it ’s pretty sketchy .
I ’d avoid it until you ’re engaged .
( Revolve , p. 342 )
Q : What do you think about girls and guys praying together ?
A : It ’s cool , but you gotta be careful that you do n’t get carried away .
( Revolve , p. 258 )
It sounds like these teenage " guys " are talking about necking , making out or something worse !
The question was about " praying " !
Avoid " praying together " until " you ’re engaged " !
Be careful about " praying together " so that you " do n’t get carried away " .
The last time I checked , " praying " was talking to the Lord .
You know what ’s " on their mind " 
And it ’s not " praying " .
What a goofy , godless , carnal , mess .
Young ladies , may I give you the Lord ’s ANSWER :
Be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God .
Philippians 4:6
Pray without ceasing .
1 Thessalonians 5:17
Of course , why ask the Lord when you can always pick up the Revolve and get the " Guys Speak Out " spiritual wisdom .
" BLAB 's "
The most popular and numerous section infecting the Revolve is the " BLAB " Question and Answer sections .
The " BLABS " cover topics such as tattoos , homosexuality , witchcraft , mini-skirts , environmentalism , drinking beer , boy - girl relationships , MTV and sex .
Hence , the title of our article " revolve blable " .
Let ’s examine a few examples of the " BLAB's " :
Our first " BLAB " deals with " making - out " ( a.k. a heavy kissing , necking , etc. ) .
Q : I have a question about dating .
If I ’m going out with a guy , is it bad to make out with him ?
In other words , is making out a sin ?
A : That ’s a really good question .
There is no place in the Bible where it says " Making out is a sin . "
But there are places where you can go to read that you should n’t let there be even a hint of sexual immorality .
Making out is a really dangerous thing .
So your best bet is to avoid heavy make - out sessions ‘ till you are married .
It will be so much better then and you wo n’t have to feel any guilt .
( Revolve , p. 77 ) What an irresponsible answer to an impressionable , teenage girl !
" There is no place in the Bible where it says ‘ Making out is a sin ’ " .
That ’s the same wicked logic of this lost , " present evil " world .
How many times have I heard ; " The Bible never says smoking marijuana is a sin " .
. .
Or " Show me in the Bible where gambling is a sin " .
. .
Or " Just show me a verse in the Bible that says making out is a sin " .
I have an enlightening " revelation " for the spiritually - blind staff of Revolve .
The Word of God is an eternal book ( Matthew 24:35 ) .
A book for not only 2003 or the 21st century or the 19th or 20th century , et. al but – FOR ALL GENERATIONS !
If the Lord would have said " Thou shalt not make out " – who in the 1300 ’s or 1400 ’s or 1700 ’s would have a clue to what He was referring to ?
Does the Lord address the subject of " making out " ?
Of course , He does .
He gives a very precise , simple answer : 2 Timothy 2:22
Flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
Notice also the lack of spiritual discernment and warning found in the last part of the answer : " So your best bet is to avoid heavy make - out sessions ‘ till you are married .
. . "
The answer was not to avoid " make out sessions " but " your best bet " is to avoid " HEAVY make out sessions " .
How different from the Lord ’s compassionate warning , " Flee also youthful lusts . . . "
Not just " AVOID HEAVY make out sessions " but " FLEE – run " from even the mere " LUSTS or thoughts " of it .
Thank you Lord for warning our young people !
I must also mention the contrast our wonderful Lord makes in 2 Timothy 2:22 , not only " Flee also youthful lusts " – but then the Lord adds " but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a PURE heart . "
Wow !
Is n’t that beautiful !
Is there any greater advice anyone could give to our young people .
P.S. Compare the previously quoted 2 Timothy 2:22 in the King James Bible to the dull , dreary , dead 2 Timothy 2;22 in the Revolve ’s NCV : 2 Timothy 2:22 , NCV
But run away from the evil young people like to do .
Try hard to live right and to have faith , love , and peace , together with those who trust in the Lord from pure hearts .
Several " BLABS " deal with the subject of homosexuality .
Being " politically - correct " ( and may I add , spiritually - stupid ) the Revolve staff downplays the sin of homosexuality .
For example , in the following " BLAB " the Revolve downplays the " sin of homosexuality " as " just like gossiping about your best friend is a sin " .
The Revolve answer also includes a swipe at the church whose " view " of the sin of homosexuality is a " little harsher " than the sin of " gossiping about your best friend " .
Q : What is God and the church ’s view on homosexuality and its place in our world ?
A : You want God ’s view , or the church ’s ?
Start with God.
Romans chapter 1 says that it is impurity .
It ’s a sin , just like gossiping about your best friend is a sin .
You need to stop acting on your impulses .
Sometimes the church ’s view can be a little harsher .
Many people in the church see it like the worse of all evils .
But they are looking at it through human eyes .
God says it ’s a sin ;
It ’s not how he made you , so stop .
( Revolve , p. 310 ) I ca n’t help but thinking how God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for the " sin of homosexuality " with fire and brimstone ( which by the way , is the same judgement as hell ) ; or in Leviticus 13:20 where the Lords commands Israel to kill those who commit the " sin of homosexuality " ; or Romans 1 where God " gave them up " for the " sin of homosexuality " ; or in 1 Corinthians 6:9- 10 where the " …effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind .
. . shall inherit the kingdom of God " that maybe .
. . just maybe . . . the Lord considers the " sin of homosexuality " a little - bit more serious than " . . . just like gossiping about your best friend . . . "
I would have to add the Lord ’s view of homosexuality is a " little harsh " .
In another " BLAB " dealing with homosexuality ( p. 43 ) a teenage girl asks advice on how to deal with another girl who is in love with a female teacher .
Look at this lame and pathetic answer .
Q ;
This girl at church told me that she was in love , yes , in love with one of her female teachers .
This girl is fourteen years old .
I just need some advice on what I should say to her if I get to speak to her again .
A : For a woman to fall in love with another woman is considered a sin according to the Bible .
You ’ve got to remember one thing though :
It ’s the Holy Spirit ’s job to convict her and teach her .
In the Bible it says that God remains faithful even when we are faithless .
Your job is to show this girl the love of God .
How ?
Stay her friend .
Prayer changes things .
It can move mountains .
It can radically alter lives .
Just make sure you remember who God is and that you ’re not him .
( Revolve , p. 43 ) In other words , do not " judge " her for the lusts of homosexuality .
And do n’t dare tell her it ’s wrong – that would be judging her .
But just " show her the love of God " .
Remember " it ’s the Holy Spirit ’s job to convict her and teach her " .
Can a saved person actually READ the Bible and be that far off base ?
Look at the last part of the BLAB – now preachers , this is a nugget – " Just make sure you remember who God is and that you ’re not him . "
What spiritual insight !
That had to come through hours of study and prayer .
. .
Compare the Revolve ’s absurd answer to John the Baptist ’s open rebuke in Matthew 14 of King Herod .
14:1
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus ,
2 And said unto his servants ,
This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him .
3 For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
4 For John said unto him ,
It is not lawful for thee to have her .
Notice , who John the Baptist openly rebuked and judged .
. .
THE KING . . .
May I also remind you ,
The Lord Jesus said John was the greatest man born of women ( Matthew 11:11 ) .
And what shall I more say ?
for the time would fail me to tell of the open rebuke and judgement of Jeremiah , Noah , Joshua , David , Daniel , Gideon , Isaiah , Ezekiel , Paul , Peter , James , Martin Luther , John Knox , Billy Sunday , J. Frank Norris and thousands of others .
In another " BLAB " a teenager girl asks how to reach a friend involved in Witchcraft .
Q : Hey , I have friends who are into Wicca .
I know a lot about witchcraft , but I do n’t know how to start a convo with people who are happy with that religion .
I need an example of something one might say .
Could you please help me out ?
I do n’t want them to go to hell because I did n’t try to help them .
A : If you want something to say , just tell them how you feel .
Say , " You know my religion and you seem cool with it .
However , I ca n’t say I agree with your choice .
I just want you to know that I ’ll be praying for you . "
Do n’t try to talk them into changing their faith — no one likes to be forced into anything .
Pray for them .
( Revolve , p. 344 )
Here is a Christian young lady who is burdened about her friend " going to hell " – and she is asking advice from the Revolve staff on how to reach this friend .
And the Revolve staff replies , " Do n’t try to talk them into changing their faith — no one likes to be forced into anything . "
How can you possibly witness without talking to them about " changing their faith " ?
How can they EVER know the wonderful plan of salvation without " talking to them " ?
Can you believe this ?
Again , look at John the Baptist .
The Bible said John " was a man sent from God " ( John 1:6 ) .
The Bible also says " The same came for a WITNESS " ( John 1:7 ) And what is John ’s definition of a witness ?
A VOICE .
John 1:22 -23
22 Then said they unto him , Who art thou ?
that we may give an answer to them that sent us .
What sayest thou of thyself ?
23 He said , I am the VOICE of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias .
Young person , if you are saved and you have family and friends that are going to hell – DON ’T LISTEN TO REVOLVE !
Talk to them about Jesus Christ and the judgement of hell !
Warn them – over and over and over !
Pray for them .
Do n’t give up !
TALK to them .
You may be the only VOICE God has to deal with them .
Please do not listen to Revolve .
Another BLAB deals with the subject of tattoos .
Tattoos have taken over this generation .
From the rock stars , Hollywood celebrities , sports stars , even children ’s toys – virtually every walk of life is sporting a tat .
Thank God , the Lord clearly " nails " the pagan and satanic " blood - letting " tattoo to the forbidden wall in Leviticus 19:28 Leviticus 19:28
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD .
That should certainly clear up any doubt for the Christian and tattoos .
Right . . .?
Wrong . . .
Check out the Revolve and the forbidden tattoo : Q : I really , really want to get a tattoo , but what does the Bible say about them .
Is it against God ?
A : In the Old Testament law tattoos were forbidden .
But when Christ came , he redeemed us from the curse of the law ( Galatians 3 ) .
This means that now God looks at your heart , your motives , when it comes to what you do .
Check with your parents , and follow their advice .
( Revolve , p. 85 ) Galatians 3 means " that NOW God looks at your heart , your motives , when it comes to what you do " ?
Chapter and verse ?
That is completely contrary to the clear word of God .
Have you ever read 2 Corinthians 5 and the " judgement seat of Christ "  " knowing therefore the TERROR of the Lord " ?
2 Corinthians 5:10 - 11
10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
It ’s not our motives – but " the things DONE " – " according to that he hath DONE " .
It ’s not your motives – but what you DID !
In 1 Corinthians 3:13 , which also refers to the " judgement seat of Christ , the Lord says , " Every man 's WORK shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's WORK of what SORT it is " .
Christian young person , do not believe the Revolve staff .
You will be JUDGED for your WORKS and what you DO .
Let me also mention , the Lord Jesus Christ did not do away with or destroy the law .
Matthew 5:17
Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
You do not have the Lord ’s blessing to kill , or commit adultery , or worship other gods , or steal , etc. – which is found in the ten commandments .
Nor do you have the Lord ’s blessing to " mark " your body , which if you are saved  is the temple of the Holy Spirit ( 1 Cor. 6:19 ) with a forbidden , pagan , blood - letting tattoo .
If Leviticus 19:28 has been done away with and God is looking at our hearts .
. .
Then I would assume Leviticus 19:29 , the next verse , is also no longer valid .
Leviticus 19:29
Do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
Leviticus 19:29 is the ONLY verse in the Bible , both the Old and New Testament , that explicitly forbids someone to " prostitute thy daughter " .
Applying Revolve ’s same wicked logic of tattoos , I wonder if the Revolve staff would answer the " BLAB " question : " It is alright to be a prostitute " ?
with the same answer : " when Christ came , he redeemed us from the curse of the law ( Galatians 3 ) .
This means that now God looks at your heart , your motives , when it comes to what you do .
Check with your parents , and follow their advice "
There are several other BLABS that discount the " action " and emphasize the " motive " .
The following is a BLAB that explains what you can or can not wear , such as revealing " mini skirts , tube tops " , depends on the motive .
I wonder how Revolve would reply to " Hookers for Christ " .
Do n’t laugh .
I have an actual article of a group of " Hookers for Christ " .
According to the article their " motive " is to win people to Jesus Christ .
I wonder if they got their idea from the Revolve ?
Hmm … Q :
What is appropriate for girls to wear ?
I ’ve been told I ca n’t wear tube tops and mini skirts .
But it is okay to wear a tankini - top bathing suit that hardly shows your belly button ?
What is going too far ?
A : You ’ve got to look at your motive when it comes to clothes .
If your motive is to get guys to like you because of your body , your dress will be more revealing .
If your goal is to worship God in everything you do , your clothes will naturally be more modest .
You ca n’t decide item by item — it ’s a lifestyle decision .
( Revolve , p. 241 ) As far as the " motive " is the main thing .
. .
Ever read Matthew 16:21 - 23 ?
Matthew 16:21 - 23
21 From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
22 Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be unto thee .
23 But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
Notice , Peter ’s " motive " in Matthew 16 was his " love " for the Lord Jesus .
Peter loved the Lord Jesus and did not want Jesus Christ to be crucified .
But also notice , Satan completely took over Peter !
Even though Peter ’s " motive " was right and pure – love for the Lord Jesus Christ – Peter ’s " actions " were wrong .
So wrong , that Satan was speaking out of the mouth of Peter !
Motive alone is not enough .
In one BLAB the question of drinking beer comes up .
The answer is amazing .
" Drinking alcohol is not a sin in Scripture " .
What scripture are they reading ?
Oh , I forgot the liberal NCV .
But in REAL scripture " drinking beer " is certainly a sin .
Notice , the Revolve also turns the sinless Lord Jesus into a " party animal " even " bringing the wine " !
Q : My dad drinks like three or four beers every night .
Is that a sin ?
How much can you drink before it is a sin ?
A : 1.5 cups .
Would n’t you love it if someone could tell you that easily .
There is no easy answer .
Drinking alcohol is not a sin in Scripture .
Even Jesus turned water into wine at a party .
But getting drunk is a different story .
( Revolve , p. 272 ) The Bible makes a clear distinction between fermented liquor and new wine , or grape juice .
Speaking of fermented liquor , Proverbs 23 says , " Look not thou upon the wine when it is red ( speaking of fermentation ) , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright ( speaking of the bubbling and carbonation ) .
At the last it BITETH like a serpent , and STINGETH like an adder . "
A description of new wine is found in Isaiah 65:8 , " as the NEW WINE is found IN THE CLUSTER . "
Not in a bottle !
You can't get FERMENTED LIQUOR from a CLUSTER !
Fermented LIQUOR is placed in a bottle , with yeast and allowed to FERMENT .
Genesis 40:11 gives a clear picture of new wine , " I took GRAPES and PRESSED them in Pharaoh 's cup . "
But did n’t Jesus drunk wine at the Last Supper ?
In Matthew , Mark and Luke where the account of the Last Supper is found , the word " wine " is never even mentioned .
The Bible very carefully says they drank - " FRUIT OF THE VINE ! "
What about when Jesus turned the water into wine at the marriage in Cana .
If Jesus Christ turned water into fermented liquor , he directly disobeyed Habakkuk 2:15 , " Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest thy bottle to him , and makest him drunken also . . . "
And , if Jesus disobeyed Habakkuk - HE WAS A SINNER !
The Bible makes it very clear in 1 Peter 2:22 , 2 Corinthians 5:21 , and other verses - THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS WITHOUT SIN !
God has placed a very strong warning in 1 Corinthians 6:9- 10 , " Be not deceived : NO DRUNKARDS , . . . shall inherit the kingdom of God . "
Much , much more could be given on the sin of drinking alcohol .
A theme running through the Revolve is the " new-age-mother -earth - environmental - wacko " gospel .
" Respect the planet , man " .
Here ’s a BLAB preaching the " respect the planet " gospel .
Q : Is it ever okay to litter ?
I mean are n’t we going overboard with this whole ‘ save the planet ’ thing ?
A : Being concerned for our planet is not a radical stance to take .
God gave us dominion over the earth and animals and that means that he trusts it all to our care .
There are really two issues .
One is honoring God and that which has he has given us to protect .
The other is that littering is against the law .
And we are asked to obey the law even if we do n’t agree with it .
So , if you want to honor God , then respect the planet . "
( Revolve , p. 99 ) Somehow , I missed the verse that says " Honor God , then respect the planet " .
But I do remember the verse where the Lord says
He is going to completely burn up this planet : 2 Peter 3:10 - 12
10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
Friend , Jesus Christ did not come into this world to save the planet .
God Almighty is not in heaven nervously " pacing the floor " worrying about the litter .
The Lord is not in heaven " wringing His hands " over the pollution or the ozone layer .
Jesus Christ is not in heaven interceding for the environment and the EPA .
He ’s not concerned about the planet .
But
He is very concerned about the eternal souls of people .
He is so concerned , He died on a rugged cross .
You want to REALLY honor God – tell somebody about the Lord Jesus Christ and Calvary .
My favorite BLAB concerns the subject of MTV and rap music .
In the course of our ministry , I have personally researched many disgusting and degenerate subjects .
If there ’s anything in the mainstream that is more disgusting than the filth and nastiness spewing forth from rap and MTV – I have not found it .
Read the Revolve staff ’s opinion of MTV : Q : I was just wondering is MTV or rap music bad to watch and listen to ?
A : God is present everywhere , even on MTV .
But , do n’t feed your mind that stuff 24/ 7 .
Whatever you constantly feed your mind , that is what you will believe .
So spend more time talking to God and reading the Word .
Dig into that and then you will see him everywhere .
( Revolve , p. 317 ) Can you believe that ?
" God is present everywhere , even on MTV " .
What a brainless , stupid answer .
. .
Because God is everywhere or omnipresent that means " God is on MTV " !
God is now rapping and rocking on MTV !
Because God is everywhere – that means MTV is ok ?
What if the young girl asked : " I was wondering is porno bad to watch and listen to " ?
Would Revolve also answer : A : God is present everywhere , even in porno .
But , do n’t feed your mind that stuff 24/ 7 .
Whatever you constantly feed your mind , that is what you will believe .
So spend more time talking to God and reading the Word .
Dig into that and then you will see him everywhere . "
This is incredible .
It would be laughable , if the consequences were not so serious .
Now you know why so many Christian young people are so spiritually blind and confused .
This is the kind of answers many sincere young people are receiving from the vast majority of pastors and youth leaders .
God help us .
. .
Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
And of course , no self - respecting , new version - Bible - correcting - publisher is going to pass up a chance to take a swing at the King James Bible : Q : What do I do if my parents only let me use KJV ?
They say the modern versions are n’t accurate , but I ca n’t understand it !
A : Grab a couple of different versions of the Bible and sit down with your parents .
In the front of any translation , it should explain to you how the translation was written [ Does this one ? ] .
In most any modern translation the scholars did extensive research in the original languages .
They are very accurate .
But the thing here is that you have to honor you parents .
So sit and talk with them , explain to them that you ’d like to deepen your Bible study , and see what they say . "
( Revolve , p. 196 ) Notice in the reply .
The modern versions " are very accurate " .
Which is a joke .
The new versions use the deceptive " dynamic equivalency " ( DE ) translation method .
In DE translation methodology , rather than translating what the ORIGINAL words actually mean  the translator CHANGES the ORIGINAL wording into what the translator BELIEVES it SHOULD read .
In other words , it is not longer " thus saith the Lord " but " thus saith the translator " .
The Queen of the new versions , the beloved New International Version ( NIV ) plainly states in the NIV’s Preface : " They [ the NIV translators ] have striven for more than a word - for - word translation . "
Also it is a thoroughly , documented FACT , the King James Bible agrees with 99 % of the Greek NT manuscripts .
While the new versions ( including some of the NEW King James ) uses two primary manuscripts – the corrupt Siniaticus and Vaticanus ( a.k.a. Westcott and Hort Greek text ) .
The NIV removes 15 complete verses !
The NASV removes 16 complete verses !
The RSV removes 25 complete verses !
The NCV removes 16 complete verses !
The Revolve also implies ( very strongly ) in order to " deepen your Bible study " you need to ditch the King James and get a new version .
Question for the Revolve staff :
How is it the greatest Bible teachers and preachers , such as Arthur Pink , Clarence Larkin , C.I. Scofield , John Wesley , Moody , Torrey , Bullinger , Oliver Greene , Lester Roloff , and thousands and thousands of others believed ONLY the King James Bible ?
How is that every revival of modern time came through the fruit of the King James Bible ?
How is it since the new versions cropped up we ’ve had 45 million abortions , legalized sexual sodomy and perversion , pornographic explosion , rock and roll hell , the new age outbreak , the Satanic Bible and church , and the spiritual killing of America ?
Do tell if thou knowest .
. .
Let me also ask the Revolve staff this :
If the new versions are so much " easier to understand and read "  why is it that according to surveys by Barna Research of people who read their Bible on a daily basis , " The King James Version is more likely to be the Bible read during the week than is the NIV by a 5:1 ratio . "
And that is even more surprising when you consider that the NIV alone now outsells the KJV – not to mention the accumulated millions of other new versions sold .
Another " BLAB " clearly teaches the false and heretical teaching of " Lordship Salvation " .
Lordship Salvation teaches that " in order to be saved " Jesus Christ MUST be the " Lord of your life " .
If you are saved , Jesus Christ is your Lord and Saviour .
But salvation is by faith ALONE in the blood of Jesus Christ and His payment for your sins .
Yes , your desire should be for Jesus Christ to be the Lord of your body , soul and spirit .
But Lordship Salvation is a satanic salvation " by works " heresy that NO ONE can obtain .
One of their favorite sayings is " If He ’s not Lord of ALL , He ’s not Lord at ALL " .
The simple FACT is , no person who ever lived EVER made Jesus Christ the Lord of everything in their life .
If they did , they would be sinless .
Read the struggles of the greatest Christian that ever lived fought in Romans chapter 7 .
Q : If you accept Christ but later you turn from him , or start to go down the wrong road , does God stick with you ‘ til there is no chance of restoration ?
A : Scripture tells us that salvation has nothing to do with what we DO but with what we believe , that is , in Christ .
[ If the Revolve would have stopped here , their answer would be correct .
But now they go into the heresy of Lordship Salvation ]
But it also says that we should make him Lord of our lives .
But if a person claims to be saved but then acts like they are an enemy of God , disobeying him purposefully , then they probably never really made him Lord of their life .
( Revolve , p. 147 ) This is an amazingly warped answer considering the worldly and carnal answers to some of the other " BLABS " .
Do you see why so many young people are spiritually confused ?
Do you see why so many Christian teenagers want nothing to do with " the adults " God ?
With these kind of spiritually hypocritical and ridiculous answers who can blame them .
It bothers me when I see this type of stuff being promoted and fed to our young people .
Especially when I know how simple and pure God ’s Word is in the King James Bible .
What a shame .
What a crime to our young people .
If Jesus Christ does not come back soon – with the shallow , spiritual garbage being fed to our Christian young people – they will never survive spiritually .
God help us . . .
There are over 200 of such BLABS in the Revolve .
And most are like the given examples – pure carnal , humanistic , politically correct , nonsense .
TOPten
Also throughout the Revolve are " TOPten columns .
The TOPten columns are " top ten " lists of various topics aimed at Christian teenage girls .
For instance there is the TOPten Christian CDs ( of course , all 10 are Christian rock CDs ) , TOPten books , etc .
But the TOPten " Random ways to make a difference in your community " is a classic .
This really illustrates the complete and total spiritual blindness of the Revolve staff .
Remember , this is supposed to be for Christian teenage girls .
TOPTen Random ways to make a difference in your community 1 .
Plant a tree
2 . Pick up someone else ’s litter
3. Smile freely
4 . Drop a dollar in charity boxes .
5 . Offer to baby - sit your neighbors ’ kids for free .
6 . Clip the plastic rings on soda six - packs .
7 . Use washable containers instead of plastic wrap for your lunch .
8. Recycle cans and bottles .
9 . Donate your old clothes to needy families .
10 .
Do yard work for the elderly or sick .
( Revolve , p. 109 ) Is there anything spiritual or Biblical in the whole list ?
Is there anything about witnessing to someone about the Lord Jesus ( oops , that would be " talking to them into changing their faith " and that ’s a no - no ) .
Or inviting someone to church ?
( oops .
That would also be " talking to them into changing their faith " .
. . sorry I forgot ) .
Or passing out tracts .
Or going to the nursing home and ministering to the elderly .
Was the Lord Jesus ’s " Great Commission " in Matthew 28:19 19
Go ye therefore , and plant a tree .
. . ?
Notice that 5 ( numbers 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) of the " top ten " ways to make a difference are the gospel according to the environmental - wacko .
Who in heaven ( or hell ) cares if you " use washable containers instead of plastic wrap for your lunch " ( 7 ) or " recycles cans and bottles " ( 8 ) ?
Do you believe the Lord ’s " top ten " ways to make a difference would include " Pick up someone else ’s litter " ( 2 ) .
And remember this – that is not JUST TEN " Random ways to make a difference in your community " .
These are the TOP TEN ways to make a difference in your community !
So according to the Revolve staff  " plant a tree " or " Clip the plastic rings on soda six - packs . " or " Recycle cans and bottles " is BETTER and MORE IMPORTANT than leading a soul to Jesus Christ !
Say it ai n’t so .
. .
Christians can not be that spiritually blind and ignorant .
There is simply no way this article will do justice to the silliness and sacrilege of the Revolve " Bible " .
Needless to say , we could go on and on and on , spending hours , examining the ridiculous stuff in the Revolve Bible .
To simply say they are unbelievable and unthinkable is too much charity .
Let ’s now turn our attention to the Revolve ’s Bible text of the New Century Bible ( NCV ) .
New Century Version ( NCV ) : Easy to Read or Easy to Deceive ? >>
Photo catches McCain celebrating birthday with indicted con man David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Although John McCain has made condemning the influence of lobbyists in Washington one of his signature issues , his own campaign is largely run by high - powered lobbyists , including his campaign manager , Rick Davis .
The connection with Davis appears to be behind McCain 's having spent his 70th birthday partying on the yacht of Italian conman Raffaello Follieri -- who hired Davis 's business partner to lobby for him just a few months later -- along with Follieri's then - girlfriend , actress Anne Hathaway .
The date was Aug. 29 , 2006 and the place was Montenegro , where McCain had traveled with a delegation of US senators to celebrate that nation 's independence .
Although the meeting has been reported previously , the Nation has now confirmed it with a photo of John McCain preparing to board Follieri 's yacht .
Rachel Maddow offered an exclusive preview of the photograph on her new MSNBC program on Wednesday , noting that it " appears to undercut the well - crafted , focus group - tested image of John McCain being pushed on the American people . "
Follieri , who was arrested in April for allegedly passing a bad check , has just pleaded guilty to eight counts of wire fraud and five counts of money - laundering resulting from a scheme in which he obtained millions of dollars in investments by claiming to have connections in the Vatican .
" The McCain campaign has confirmed the senator 's encounter with the conman guy , " Maddow noted , " telling the New York Daily News it was ' entirely social ' and ' nothing came of it . ' "
She went on to wonder how come , in that case , " it is Barack Obama who is the celebrity , when McCain is the one spending his birthday on a yacht in the Adriatic Sea with a faboo movie star and her conman Italian boyfriend ? "
Maddow was then joined by Ari Berman , co-author of the Nation article on the McCain - Follieri encounter , who suggested that McCain " has a little bit of a celebrity fetish . "
Maddow asked , " Do we know why [ Follieri ] hired Rick Davis 's lobbying firm and whether or not that connection had anything to do with John McCain ? "
Berman replied that Follieri , who had already tight connections with some of Bill Clinton 's aides and financial supporters , " wanted to do the same thing with McCain .
He was playing both sides .
...
We think he was [ in Montenegro ] because McCain was there , and what happened after that yacht party with McCain is , he ended up sending Rick Davis business information . "
McCain had marked his previous birthday , Aug. 29 , 2005 , by celebrating with President Bush as Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans .
His 71st birthday in 2007 was spent attempting to raise cash for his then - faltering presidential campaign , with his wife Cindy writing in a fundraising appeal , " Birthdays are always special occasions in the McCain family . "

Republicans have a long and storied history with the Minneapolis Star Tribune 's pollsters .
The short version :
They loathe Minnesota polls .
A new survey out over the weekend shows a surprising result in the state 's U.S. Senate race , causing tensions to flare up once again .
The poll , conducted by Princeton Survey Research , surveyed 1,084 likely voters 9/30 - 10 / 2 for a margin of error of +/- 3.7 % . Republican Senator Norm Coleman , satirist Al Franken of the Democratic - Farmer - Labor Party and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley were tested .
General Election Matchup
Franken ........ 43 ( +6 from last , 9/12 )
Coleman ........ 34 ( - 7 )
Barkley ........ 18 ( +5 )
Pollsters found Coleman 's once - strong job approval rating diving to 38 % , the lowest ever measured in the Star Tribune poll , and suggested Franken 's lead can largely be attributed to Barack Obama 's strength in the state .
Republicans fired back , with Coleman 's pollster issuing a memo questioning the Star Tribune 's results .
The memo points to a SurveyUSA poll from earlier last week that showed Coleman with a ten - point lead over Franken , and to eight of eleven polls that have Coleman ahead .
The Star Tribune poll " is wrong and inaccurate , " pollster Glen Bolger wrote , arguing that Democrats were significantly oversampled .
" These numbers would be accurate if the Star Tribune had done this poll in New York -- not in Minnesota ! "
" Based on our own internal polling , as well as the trend averages of public polls over the past month , it is my opinion that we hold a narrow , but statistically significant lead going into the final weeks of the campaign , " Bolger concluded .
Republicans have had problems with Star Tribune pollsters since at least 2002 .
But the most recent poll over which Republicans cried wolf turned out to be surprisingly accurate .
Two Star Tribune polls out in early October and early November 2006 showed then - Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar leading Rep. Mark Kennedy by a 21 - point margin .
After the Star Tribune took serious beatings from the GOP , Klobuchar won by twenty points .
The paper is using a different pollster now than they did in 2006 , but it has n't stopped Republicans from finding fault with the Star Tribune 's numbers .
The barely - concealed hatred is bubbling back to the surface .
Ron Paul : ' We 're going to all suffer and pay ' for the bailout David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) has been an opponent of the government 's financial bailout plan from the outset , and he does n't like it any better for the recent tweaks .
" I do n't think it 's going to do any good whatsoever , " Paul told CNN 's Kiran Chetry on Friday .
" The credit markets are starting to loosen up a bit , " Chetry suggested .
" Is that a sign that maybe it is working ? "
" Maybe to some degree on the short run , " Paul acknowledged .
" But that just means that we 'll have more inflation .
You can't create $ 5 trillion out of thin air and not expect inflation .
...
In time , we 're going to all suffer and pay for this . "
" Economically , it 's a disaster , " continued Paul .
" This is going to cause a great deal of harm .
It 's like a drug addict taking a strong fix , and he feels better for a day or two , but believe me , we 're going to kill the patient ... so I would say , let 's get off this addiction . "
Paul said he does n't see much to approve of in either major party candidate 's program , although he favors McCain 's approach to health care and Obama 's promise to bring the troops home from Iraq .
However , he felt that on balance an Obama victory would be " a disaster for the country , " because at least with a Republican president confronting a Democratic Congress , " they'd be fighting a little bit instead of just having no restraints whatsoever . "
Paul believes that the current economic problems will be good for his own movement in the long run .
" As this situation deteriorates , " he suggested , " more people are going to say , hey ... maybe limited government and freedom work and this idea that we can depend on government for all these programs is an illusion . "

Joe Klein writes :
Biden on McCain : Biden 's opinion of his old friend John McCain has changed significantly -- for the worse -- during the course of this campaign .
Biden called me in June to express his amazement that McCain continued to insist that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the leader of Iran , even after I pointed out -- during a press conference -- that the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei controlled Iran 's foreign policy and nuclear program .
McCain 's response was that the " average American " thought Ahmadinejad was Iran 's leader ... and Biden proceeded to jump all over that in a subsequent interview with Think Progress :
I do n’t want an average American as president ....
[ A ] verage Americans do n’t want an average American president of the United States of America .
I want someone above average .
I want someone who knows what they ’re dealing with .
And it surprises me that John did n’t understand the complexities of the power struggle going on in Iran right now .
Biden told me that he was amazed and disappointed by the changes in McCain during the course of the campaign .
" I just do n't recognize the guy anymore , " he said .
" It 's a shame . "
No doubt , Biden will have more to say on that subject now -- which is one of the great advantages of picking him for vice president : according to the polls , foreign policy is McCain 's greatest strength .
In reality , McCain has been captured by neoconservative extremists and is proposing an extremely dangerous course of action internationally .
Biden has the stature and knowledge -- and the blue - collar , no bull pugnacity -- to call McCain on his imprudent militarism .
Another advantage :
If McCain does go with Romney , Biden would have a significant knowledge advantage in the vice presidential debate .
( And if McCain goes with Joe Lieberman , I 'd be willing to pay good money to watch that one . )
Palin Too Close for Comfort
It 's time to start taking Sarah Palin seriously .
Though the latest polls show the Obama - Biden ticket ahead , the Alaska governor is still uncomfortably close to becoming vice president of the United States .
The thought should concentrate the mind of every American who remembers the abuse of executive power by the administration of Richard Nixon .
Just look at what Palin has done , in a short time , with the authority delegated to her by Alaskans .
The " Troopergate " report , conducted by an independent investigator and released Friday by a bipartisan legislative committee , tells the tale .
It documents the campaign that Palin and her husband Todd waged to get her former brother - in - law fired from the Alaska state troopers .
Palin did , indeed , have the authority to dismiss the state 's public safety commissioner , the report says .
But she violated a state law , the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act , which prohibits state officials from taking actions that benefit personal interest .
According to the report : Palin abused her power as governor when she " knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda , to wit : to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired . "
I shudder to think of the Internal Revenue Service , the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon at her beck and call .
The role played by Todd in carrying out his wife 's vendetta was highly unusual .
He had no official duties in government .
He acknowledged , however , that he made numerous calls to state officials to press his case against the governor 's ex-brother - in - law .
It 's been well reported that Todd Palin ’s involvement in his wife ’s official business unsettled some Alaskans .
He has been known to sit in on the governor 's meetings , use her office for his own meetings and intervene in state business using his status as " First Gentleman . "
Clearly , he 's a man with a lot of time on his hands .
What if he assumed the same role in Washington ?
Imagine Todd in a town that has no use for snow machines ( which he loves to ride ) or work for commercial fishermen ( of which he is one , during the summer months ) .
What would he do ?
Would he follow the vice president to her White House office ?
Join her meetings in the Situation Room ?
Sit in on her daily national security briefings ?
Where does Todd Palin stand on America anyway ?
Neither he nor Sarah Palin ever explained his seven - year membership in the Alaska Independence Party , a group that seeks a vote on secession from America .
" I'm an Alaskan , not an American " was the slogan of the party 's founder , Joe Vogler , who also said " I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions " and " I wo n't be buried under their damned flag . "
What made Todd Palin hitch his wagon to that anti-American train when Alaska offered the Democratic and Republican parties ?
Troopergate shows the Palins to be small - bore people unable to distinguish selfish personal interests from official responsibilities .
Imagine the power of the U.S. government at their disposal .
The prospect of Vice President Sarah Palin is no laughing matter .
“ You say , well if we were using Haskell for this then we would just do this thing ; can we adapt that to what we ’re doing here ?
Not saying you have to use Haskell to solve it , but could you use that kind of approach ? ” — Damian Conway
I ’ve been experimenting with parsing for a while now .
I ’m on the verge of digging into tokenizing and grammars .
Before I hunker down and educate myself , I just want to see how far you can go with less industrial - strength approaches .
I think it ’s pretty cool how combining a single good regex with a closure gets you what is for all intents and purposes a mini-compiler .
This is a pretty handy trick ; filing away such dynamically generated functions in a hash table can lead to some pretty powerful techniques , too .
A dispatch table like that can even be used to create a simple programming language on the fly .
Tokenizing a string is just another algorithm … and on first glance , grammars appear ( in a way ) to be fancy dispatch tables .
How do you bring them all together ?
Some kind of deep magic from the dawn of time – something I would never figure out by trial and error or intuition .
I ’m getting there .
But just for fun , let ’s generalize some of these ideas and ( at the same time ) temporarily ignore them .
Let ’s go entirely orthogonal to this plane of thinking for a moment .
OOP as it gets applied in ‘ the real world ’ is primarily a defensive exercise : “ I do n’t like you and I do n’t like the way you code .
Let me just wall off on my little corner and do my thing .
Let me work with your stuff without having to understand your code .
Do n’t break the contract , either , bub .
Somehow , I do n’t think this is where Alan Kay intended us to go with this ….
Think about the difference between Checkers and Chess for a second .
The permutations of moves are effectively infinite in both games .
But the space of possibilities have different ‘ shapes ’ .
If you were , like some sort of Paul Atreides , to look out at the limitless patterns in the games , for chess you ’d see an expansive plane of cascading options .
Checkers would look more like an infinitely deep well .
The way we tend to do OOP is more like Checkers than it is like Chess .
The calls between and among the various objects seems brittle and constricted .
Like talking to someone through an incredibly long pipe instead of face to face … .
So how to open things up and make things more fluid and fluent ?
My idea is to swing the emphasis in OOP back much more toward the message passing concept , steal a few idioms from Lisp , and generalize heavily on the overall theme of DSL’s .
( I always thought it was cool how in Lisp practically everything had a straight - forward text representation .
The reader transforms what you type into a tidier , more consistent representation … and then shows it to you as the response . )
What if in designing a programming language , you divided it up into various objects or components .
To extend the language you just drop in new objects .
The classes that the objects derive from each come ( after a fashion ) with their own DSL .
Each object would ‘ know ’ how to generate its own source code .
While working with an object via a REPL , you could modify the object … then view and / or save the modified source without dropping back to the IDE or text editor .
The object source code should understand the concept of testing and incorporate test code into its specification .
When you talk to code via a REPL , you end up doing lots of little tests anyway .
You should be able to incorporate those off - the - cuff tests into the code without thinking about it .
( Any inconvenience in automated testing development just makes it that much more likely that it does n’t get done .
Get rid of everything that stands in the way of it . )
So each object in the system would know how to do stuff like read , source , save , and load .
Each object would have its own mini-language that you can focus on separately without having to think of all of the parsing at once .
Your collection of objects would get wrapped in a unified reader .
The main reader would pass messages to each object - group in the deck until something understood the message .
( And just like “ library lists ” on the AS / 400 , you could rearrange the reading order on the fly . )
Simple !
Now you can build a programming language without having to think about the whole thing at once– and you get modularity and testability benefits in the process .
If you do n’t have time to write ‘ real ’ compilers and DSL ’s , this might be enough to get you by for a while .
Of course , it might be enough to make you buckle down and learn some real computing techniques , too .
Judge for yourself .
If you ’d like to play with this ( or see more specifically part of what I ’m trying to describe ) , I ’ve implemented the gist of the idea in Perl .
There ’s nothing fancy in it ; I ’m just using the bottom 30 % of the language for the most part .
There ’s plenty of places the overall idea could be further generalized and tightened up .
( I think I ’m part way through reinventing Smalltalk , but this is just for fun anyway . )

The Final Debate : Angry White Man
John of the Grimaces met Barack the Unflappable in Hempstead tonight , and the guy with the arctic cool , not surprisingly , prevailed .
Now we know why Obama ’s aides were goading McCain earlier this week to raise the Bill Ayres issue in the debate .
They wanted to play McCain ’s rage against Obama ’s measured , judicious , statesmanlike , even a bit boring presidentiality .
And McCain obliged them big time .
The Arizona senator had been doing well up until that moment , which came about half an hour into the debate .
But as he recounted the Obama attack ads ( which may outnumber McCain ’s in raw numbers , since Obama has more money than God , but which come nowhere close to the percentage of McCain commercials that are attack ads ) , McCain started seething , and after Obama answered his attack on the Ayres connection , McCain could n’t stop .
He kept on attacking , then remembered that people did n’t actually like this , pirouetted to say that his campaign was about issues , and fell flat on his face , not to rise again for the duration of the debate .
The Obama campaign has always believed that if McCain was going to be knocked out in the course of a debate , it would be at the hands of McCain .
Obama ’s role , not the most scintillating , was to swat away the attacks and get back to some real - world issue for the second - half of each answer .
It was to look resolute , but also to be the world ’s least
angry -- or more precisely , anger - able -- black man .
At times , McCain recalled the Bob Dole of the ’ 96 campaign , mixing indignation with the Beltway shorthand that even a candidate running against Washington cannot escape after spending several decades in Congress .
Discussing the merits of the Colombian Free Trade agreement with references to the FARC -- how many Americans knew what the hell he was talking about ?
By the debate ’s last half - hour , in which the candidates went over health care , energy , abortion and education , Obama was on his home turf and McCain plainly was n’t .
( Watching CNN , which has those squiggles representing swing voter reaction to every word , I noted that the dials moved not at all as McCain got into the weeds of his health care plan :
On health care , McCain was flat - lining . )
Plainly , Obama ’s goals in the three presidential debates were to show his understanding of how the nation ’s problems affect real people and to put out some plausible - sounding solutions , and , just as if not more important , to show people he was serious , reliable , thoughtful and safe -- just the guy to steer us through rough economic times .
As the debates dwindled down to a precious one , McCain ’s goals were all but contradictory : to attack Obama hard enough to get the kid to crack and to reverse voter sentiment , but not hard enough to reinforce the impression that he was waging a preponderantly negative campaign or , worse yet , that he was an angry white man .
In short , he had to square a circle .
In short , he did n’t .
Rupert Murdoch brokered a " tentative truce " between Barack Obama , the presidential candidate who has won his enthusiastic backing , and the head of Fox News , the influential rightwing network he owns that has regularly pilloried the Democratic nominee , the media mogul 's biographer has revealed .
Michael Wolff , a US media commentator who enjoyed unprecedented access to the 77 - year - old News Corp chairman , describes in an article for Vanity Fair how Murdoch 's meeting with Roger Ailes descended into a furious dispute before resulting in a " tentative truce " .
He outlines how Murdoch has enthusiastically courted Obama even though the Democratic candidate repeatedly snubbed his advances , and this despite senior News Corp executives having recruited the Kennedys to act as go - betweens .
This marked a " leap " for the mogul - whose empire stretches from the Sun , the Times and BSkyB in the UK to 20th Century Fox , the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal in the US , and Star TV in Asia - because " Murdoch has traditionally liked politicians to come to him " .
Wolff relates that Obama finally relented early in the summer and the pair met with Ailes at the Waldorf - Astoria hotel in New York .
According to Wolff 's account , the meeting began cordially , with Obama asking Murdoch about his relationship with his father and his path from a single Adelaide newspaper to global media magnate .
In turn , the mogul imparted his view that , having known possibly as many heads of state as anyone living today and met every US president since Harry Truman , nobody had much time to make an impression - " leadership was about what you did in the first six months " .
But as Murdoch switched places with Ailes , Obama " lit into " the Fox News man .
" He said that he did n't want to waste his time talking to Ailes if Fox was just going to continue to abuse him and his wife , that Fox had relentlessly portrayed him as suspicious , foreign , fearsome - just short of a terrorist , " wrote Wolff , who was not present at the meeting but said yesterday his detailed account was correct " to the very best of my knowledge " .
" Ailes , unruffled , said it might not have been this way if Obama had more willingly come on the air instead of so often giving Fox the back of his hand .
A tentative truce , which may or may not have vast historical significance , was at that moment agreed upon . "
" Murdoch is strongly , if not firmly , in the Obama camp .
How that plays out on Fox is another question , " Wolff said yesterday .
" He actually has relatively little ability to affect what 's on Fox , assuming he does n't want to fire Roger Ailes , which I do n't think he does .
But I do think he would prefer him to be a little less unreconstructed . "
The opinion - led US news network became intrinsically linked with the Bush administration and its key pundits have enthusiastically backed John McCain .
In the article , to be published on Friday , Wolff says Murdoch , partly due to the influence of his third wife Wendi , is " becoming a liberal - sort of " .
" Fox has been his alter ego .
For a long time he was in love with the Fox chief , Roger Ailes , because he was even more Murdoch than Murdoch .
And yet now the embarrassment can't be missed - he mumbles even more than usual when called on to justify it ; he barely pretends to hide the way he feels about [ Fox pundit ] Bill O'Reilly .
And while it is not possible that he would give
Fox up - because the money is the money ; success trumps all - in the larger sense of who he is , he seems to want to hedge his bets . "
The article , based on almost weekly interviews with Murdoch over a nine - month period , also paints a revealing portrait of Murdoch 's love of mischievous gossip , his closeness to his children , his visceral passion for newspapers and his unsated ambition to add to his empire .
Wolff , a Vanity Fair contributing editor who wrote a book about his experience of the dotcom bust before reinventing himself as a media pundit , also believes Murdoch is serious in his ambition to buy the New York Times , the liberal totem that has cast him as " bogeyman and vulgarian " .
But when Wolff asks Murdoch in their final interview what he can do to prevent what happened to the Bancrofts , the old Wall Street Journal dynasty , from happening to his family , he throws his hands up in the air and says : " Oh , simple , I can't .
All I can do is delay it . "
It ’s the ultimate movie - plot threat : terrorists using child porn :
It is thought Islamist extremists are concealing messages in digital images and audio , video or other files .
Police are now investigating the link between terrorists and paedophilia in an attempt to unravel the system .
It could lead to the training of child welfare experts to identify signs of terrorist involvement as they monitor pornographic websites .
Have you ever wondered why the Alaska / Canadian British Columbia border looks so very odd , what with a slim panhandle running one third of the way down the BC coast ?
Alaska was once owned by Russia .
Their right was based on the establishment of fur trading locations at places such as Wrangell and Petersburg .
and was confirmed in a treaty between Russia and the UK in 1825 .
When the US purchased Alaska in 1867 they took over what Russian maps showed to be Alaska .
However the Russian maps showed more land belonging to them than stipulated in the treaty of 1825 , which was the last document to have set the boundary .
In 1872 British Columbia petitioned for an official survey of the boundary .
The U.S. repeatedly dismissed the request , deeming it too expensive .
In 1898 a joint high commission met to discuss the Alaska Boundary Dispute at which time both sides agreed to a compromise .
Unfortunately news of the compromise got out , and the western states vehemently protested , forcing the U.S. to meekly drop the compromise .
Later that same year Britain and the U.S. met to decide on a tribunal to settle the Alaska Boundary Dispute .
They could not find a compromise and discussions were halted .
When Teddy Roosevelt won the presidency , he applied his motto , “ speak softly and carry a big stick , ” towards solving the dispute .
Americans began a series of harassment measures against Canada .
Canadian miners in Alaska were denied certain legal rights , because of a loophole in the Alaskan Homestead act of 1899 .
The U.S. also erected settlements along the Southern Panhandle border .
The final harassment was policy unofficially adopted by U.S. shipping companies , which slowed Canadian shipments and sped up U.S. shipments .
Finally in 1903 the Hay / Herbert Treaty called for a six member tribunal , made up of three Americans , two Canadians and one British member , to make a decision .
In January of 1903 , the U.S. and Britain agreed on a format to address the boundary dispute arbitration .
Each side was to appoint three impartial judges of repute .
Legal teams would present their cases and the tribunal would then render a decision .
Theodore Roosevelt made his three impartial selections .
He appointed Elihu Root , Secretary of War ; Henry Cabot Lodge , Senator from Mass , and George Turner Ex-Senator from Washington .
Using his Big Stick policy , Roosevelt sent word that if the panel did n’t find correctly he would send marines in to secure U.S. rights .
So much for impartiality !
On the other side Britain appointed Baron Alverstone , the Lord Chief Justice of England ; Sir Louis A Jette , Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec ; and Allen B. Aylesworth , K.C. , From Toronto .
Canada was confident they would receive British support due to the help they gave the British in the Boer War .
The reality of the situation was that Britain was more concerned about their relations with the U.S. than with Canada .
British needed U.S. Steel and sympathies for an arms race with Germany .
Canada was a British Dominion .
Thus its interests were relegated to bargaining chips .
The other reality was that the Canadian Legal team had a weak case .
After three weeks of discussion and pouring over every document that was relevant to the dispute , The tribunal … surprise , surprise … voted in favor of the U.S. The Alaskan Boundary was established on paper , and various expeditions were ordered to properly survey the area .
The Alaskan Boundary Dispute then faded from American recollection .
This is not true for the Canadian Collective memory .
The deciding vote came from Baron Alverstone , the British member of the tribunal .
Canada thought the British would protect their interests , and consequently view the dispute as a betrayal .
The Canadian Government reacted by changing its policy in the North .
They had been told that they could not keep the Alaska Panhandle because they did not assert Canadian sovereignty there , so they changed this by sending Northwest Mounted Police to areas in the far North that were in danger of a similar dispute , such as Hershal Island in the northern Yukon Territory .
( This fact goes along ways to justify exerting our sovereignty over the northern ocean ! )
Soon after the Alaska Boundary Dispute the Canadian Government raised the duties to bring goods across the border .
This hurt the economy of Skagway , the primary border town in the Yukon region .
Also , after gold was discovered in Atlin , B.C. , the government restricted the ownership of claims to those holding Canadian citizenship .
Both policies - the expensive duties and ownership rights - were directed at Americans , apparently in revenge .
The Yukon initially reacted negatively to the Council ’s decision , but positive results have come from it with increased American investments in the Yukon and a strong Canadian Presence with the Northwest Mounted Police .
Since the final decision was made on October 20th , 1903 the outcome of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal has never been seriously challenged by the US and Canada .
Special Note :
A recent note from a reader pointed out a problem with this article .
It may sound to some that the Alaska Boundary Dispute was over the actual Alaska handle .
We did not mean to leave that impression .
The dispute was rather over the location of the border down the handle .
As you can see in the image to the left ( sorry about the quality ) , the red line indicates the Canadian declaration of the line .
The blue is the American case .
The yellow line indicates where the border finally ended up .
It is interesting to note than neither the American nor Canadian claim went as far south as the yellow line .
I wonder how that happened ?
Alaska Boundary Dispute was last modified : by
Australians may not be able to opt out of the government 's Internet filtering initiative like they were originally led to believe .
Details have begun to come out about Australia 's Cyber - Safety Plan , which aims to block " illegal " content from being accessed within the country , as well as pornographic material inappropriate for children .
Right now , the system is in the testing stages , but network engineers are now saying that there 's no way to opt out entirely from content filtering .
The Australian government first revealed its filtering initiative in 2007 , which it expected to cost AUS $ 189 million to implement .
That money would go toward imposing filtering requirements on ISPs , who would have to use the Australian Communications and Media Authority 's official blacklist , which is in turn based on the country 's National Classification Scheme .
Australia moved forward with its plans despite widespread public outcry and began testing the system in Tasmania in February of this year .
At the time , the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) said that the filters would be enabled by default and that consumers would have to request unfiltered connectivity if they wished to opt - out of the program .
Well , it turns out now that those promises were only partially true .
Internode network engineer Mark Newton told Computerworld that users are able to opt out of the " additional material " blacklist — which targets content inappropriate for children — but not the main blacklist that filters what the Australian government determines is illegal content .
" That is the way the testing was formulated , the way the upcoming live trials will run , and the way the policy is framed ; to believe otherwise is to believe that a government department would go to the lengths of declaring that some kind of Internet content is illegal , then allow an opt - out , " Newton said .
" Illegal is illegal and if there is infrastructure in place to block it , then it will be required to be blocked — end of story . "
A spokesperson for the Australian Communications Minister seemed to confirm this revelation by saying that the filters would be required for all Australian citizens .
Assuming this is in fact the way the scheme is implemented in practice , it raises plenty of troubling questions .
" Illegal " is a broad definition , leaving users wondering exactly what kinds of content will end up falling prey to the government 's apparently mandatory filtering restrictions .
Will Big Content be ringing up the Aussie government soon to have tracker sites added to the blacklist ?
What about sites that discuss topics like at - home bomb making , or something a little less explosive , like DVD decryption tools ?
And how about those sites that advise users on how to get around the filters ?
Will various Wikipedia pages be blocked ?
Australia continues to ignore its own government - funded studies from 2006 that show ISP - level filtering to be ineffective and costly .
The Australian government 's disregard for those prior studies suggests that the driving force behind the current plan is more political than technical .
I came across this interesting speech by CFTC Commissioner , Bart Chillton .
In this speech he gives three loopholes exploited by future market traders – Enron loophole , London loophole and Swaps loophole .
Basically all have a similar theme - one market is regulated and other is not and both have near similar products .
The regulators can only watch the former and the traders switch and build volumes in the latter .
This is actually problematic as because of innovation , one can create similar instruments in another exchange and build up positions ( he explains that is what Amaranth traders did ) .
Now what should a regulator do ?
He says we need more cooperation between regulators .
His take on whether speculation is driving prices :
The issue comes as speculators have increased their participation in the futures markets , primarily through swaps dealers , in an unprecedented fashion .
In fact , at least $ 250 billion dollars has come into these markets in the last several years and the question that many people are asking is whether or not that influx of capitol is having an influence on the prices of oil and other commodities .
I ’ve had the opportunity to discuss this issue with a lot of really smart people and I can tell you that a lot of them disagree .
Personally , I do n’t see how $ 250 billion dollars does n’t have a thumb - on - the - scale effect on prices .
That ’s an astronomical amount of money invested in commodities as an asset class — a new type of investment strategy in the futures markets and different approach applied to commodities trading .
But , again , a lot of smart people disagree about the impact .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic Rep. Barney Frank said on Wednesday Democrats had reached an agreement to stem one of the worst U.S. financial disasters in decades , and that there would be enough votes to pass the measure and send it to President George W. Bush to sign into law .
“ We now have between House and Senate Democrats an agreement on what we think should be in the bill , and we have a meeting scheduled at 10 a.m. tomorrow to meet with the Republicans , ” said Frank , chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee .
Proponents of a rescue plan have expressed hope that a bill could be delivered to Bush within days .
While the Bush administration had asked Congress for $ 700 billion for an unprecedented Wall Street bailout , Frank said that amount might not be delivered all at once .
“ One tranche does n’t work , ” he said , adding that “ safeguards ” were needed .
Frank said there would be tough congressional oversight of as well as limits on compensation packages for executives of companies that receive federal relief .
The Massachusetts senator said a limited number of details still had to be resolved , but thought it could be done quickly .
These matters involved bankruptcy protections for families on the verge of losing their homes and giving the government a return on its money if the company being helped prospers .
Frank took a dig at Republican presidential nominee John McCain , who interrupted his campaign to return to Washington on Thursday to help work on a Wall Street bailout .
“ All of sudden , now that we are on the verge of making a deal , John McCain here drops himself in to help us make a deal , Frank said .
He expressed fear that McCain , a U.S. senator from Arizona who has spent much of the year away from the Capitol campaigning , could end up slowing down work on the bill .
The Massachusetts Democrat noted that a meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday will be interrupted for a “ photo op ” at the White House with congressional Democrats and Republicans as well as Bush .
“ We ’re trying to rescue the economy , not the McCain campaign , ” Frank said .
“ Earlier today it became clear to me we would get the votes to pass this bill , ” Frank told CNBC in an earlier interview .
He said it could take a few days to craft final legislation .
Frank spoke shortly after Bush delivered a nationally televised address in which he warned that the United States was in the midst of a financial crisis that could push the economy into a long - term recession if the government did not act .
Frank said he was pleased that the president spoke after calls by Democrats in Congress that he explain to the nation what was at stake .
Democrats blamed the crisis largely on the failure of Bush to adequately regulate the financial industry .
Frank said that lawmakers writing the legislation have kept the Bush administration informed of what they intend to do .
“ We know very well what Treasury and the Federal Reserve think would make this unworkable .
I do not think we will have anything in here that they think would make it unworkable , ” Frank said .
The issue of government controls on compensation for executives of corporations that participate in the bailout had ignited a firestorm , with Americans complaining to their representatives in Congress that these corporate chiefs should n’t be rewarded for failure .
“ On the executive compensation thing , it went to the core of their ( the Bush administration ’s ) being , ” said Frank .
“ It was like asking the chief rabbi of Jerusalem to eat bacon on Yom Kippur .
It was the most unthinkable thing they could think of . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government will allow banks to be first to announce Treasury Department capital infusions , backtracking from a plan to announce a list of some 20 banks as early as Friday , according to a source familiar with the U.S. Treasury Department ’s plans .
The source said the Treasury changed its thinking on announcing the list of around 20 to 22 banks receiving capital injections because it would label winners and losers in the market .
“ They want to draw it out over time to lessen the contagion , ” the source said .
PNC Financial Services Group Inc earlier on Friday said it was selling $ 7.7 billion of preferred shares and warrants to the Treasury , aiding its $ 5.6 billion deal to buy ailing National City Corp .
First Horizon National Corp said late on Friday it will receive about $ 866 million in capital from the Treasury Department .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Capital One Financial Corp and SunTrust Banks Inc were also expected to receive government funds .
The Treasury had been set to announce the list of banks at 11 a.m. ( 1500 GMT ) on Friday , the source said .
The Treasury Department has said it intends to release news of government investments in a consistent and orderly way .
“ As previously stated , the Treasury will make public any agreement 48 - hours after that agreement has been reached , ” Treasury spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said on Friday .
However , there is still confusion in the industry as to exactly when that 48 - hour clock starts ticking , if it is triggered by Treasury accepting a bank ’s application or when the funds are received .
The Treasury has detailed a plan to directly inject $ 250 billion of capital into U.S. banks in exchange for preferred shares as part of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program aimed a calming financial markets .
Nine of the largest U.S. banks were essentially arm - twisted last week into signing on for the first $ 125 billion in capital infusions .
When the Treasury provided more details on Monday about the capital program , it said it would not announce any applications that are withdrawn or denied .

Neel Kashkari , the Treasury ’s interim manager for the rescue program , told lawmakers on Thursday that more banks are expected to receive capital infusions within a few weeks .
Banks are starting to announce they are weighing applying for government capital .
Synovus Financial Corp said on Friday it may be eligible to receive about $ 300 million to $ 900 million under the Treasury ’s program , according to a regulatory filing .
Oriental Financial Group Inc said it was considering applying to the Treasury for capital .
First Financial Holdings
Inc said it was “ considering the possibility ” of participating in the Treasury ’s program .
San Francisco ’s Prop H is taking on their biggest opponent today – PG&E !
The utility company has spent more than $ 9.9 Million to prevent San Francisco from having cheaper and renewable energy .
Come join the rally at : PG&E ’s downtown headquarters at 77 Beale St at noon .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/IZuwXSbb6WA&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1]
They ’ll be erecting three twelve - foot “ Yes on H ” wind turbines and showing support for green jobs and an affordable green energy future .
They ’ll have signs ready for you to carry if you want to protest !
[ social_buttons ] PG&E was ready for us .
They had security set up and barricades – but we were more than ready for them !
We had about fifty protesters from organizations like Greenpeace ’s Project Hotseat , The League of Pissed Off Voters and the leaders of the pack – the Green Guerrillas Against Greenwashing .
The demonstration included speakers Aliza Wasserman and Julian Mocine - Mcqueen rallying on how PG&E has failed to make any efforts in the renewable market and how Prop H would move the city towards those goals .
Aliza noted that Prop H does not have to exclude PG&E .
That they could step up and join the clean energy market .
That sounds like the best plan to me .

The decision by Barack Obama to return to Hawaii to visit his ailing grandmother might not be the last surprise of the last fortnight of this campaign .
Two weeks is an eternity in presidential politics , which means we 're likely to have one more twist before this ends - though with early voting , more than a quarter of the electorate now votes before Election Day .
What will the twist be ?
Reviving Jeremiah Wright , which the McCain campaign is hinting at , wo n't mean much .
Unless the Reverend Wright himself resurfaces ( he 's abroad and on radio silence ) , that thrust would be easily parried by the Obama campaign .
Given her popularity with the base , Palin could conceivably ride that rage to the top of the primary pile .
Of all the possible 2012ers , she clearly has the largest , most ardent following
Andrew Romano , Newsweek.com
Newsweek : Is Palin Making Plans for 2012 ?
That 's because John McCain is on tape saying a man 's pastor should not be relevant in judging his character .
Even if an independent 527 committee were to make an attack ad involving Wright , Obama 's got an obvious jujitsu response ad making McCain out to be a hypocrite .
Fighting for airtime Maybe McCain could buy a half hour of time for a big speech that realigns his campaign .
Osama Bin Laden 's 2004 video influenced the presidential election
The problem is , any sudden readjustments now would play into the narrative that McCain is erratic and unpresidential .
And the Obama campaign has bought up most of the remaining available time across the country , anyway .
In fact , the earliest McCain can launch any kind of new offensive is Saturday , when Obama returns to the mainland .
Otherwise it looks like he 's beating up on a guy for visiting his grandma .
But something else is going to happen .
My money is on Osama Bin Laden popping back up with a hate video , just as he did the weekend before the 2004 election .
That tape reminded the public that the country was still at risk from this sickening terrorist and that President Bush had kept us safe for the three years since the 11 September 2001 attacks .
In that close campaign , it was this video - not the Swift Boat tactics that got all the ink - that made the difference .
John Kerry , who led in several polls that weekend , saw his margin melt away .
Deciding factor
In 2005 , Kerry himself said that 9/11 was the " central deciding thing " of the 2004 election and that the bin Laden video ended any chance he had of being elected .
Just because it was convenient for him to say that does n't make it untrue .
Why did the Bin Laden tape do so much damage ?
The 9/11 attack was still fresh in Americans ' memories , and the possibility of another one was on our minds .
While sophisticated analysts could explain that bin Laden released the tape just before the election because he hoped Bush would win ( Bush was a better recruiting tool for Al Qaeda than a President Kerry would have been ) , none of that got through .
Instead of making him look like another weak Democrat , a new tape would give Obama a chance to seem muscular on national security
The tape had the effect of freezing the 2004 campaign in place .
Kerry could n't criticize Bush at all for a pivotal 24 hours .
This was partly Kerry 's own fault .
After his 2003 speech attacking Bush for letting Bin Laden escape at Tora Bora , Kerry dropped most Bin Laden references from his speeches .
Internal polling by the Kerry campaign showed that voters did n't respond well to his talking points about Bush 's failure to catch bin Laden , so he gave the whole subject a rest .
This was a terrible mistake .
Had Kerry kept the heat on , bin Laden 's re-emergence would have reinforced the message that he had not been caught .
Attacks on Bush
That 's what would happen this time if Bin Laden tried to intervene in another American election .
Seven years after 9/11 , the country is in a different place , and the Obama campaign would respond to a Bin Laden tape in a different way .
For two years , Obama has been reminding audiences that the Bush administration has failed to catch Bin Laden .
First with Hillary Clinton , then with McCain , Obama has made a point in debates of saying he would risk destabilizing Pakistan by bombing the border with Afghanistan if he had actionable intelligence that Al Qaeda targets had been identified .
In the second debate , on 7 October , Obama brought up Bin Laden again , making a point of stressing that he would " kill him " if possible .
McCain 's position on Bin Laden has opened him up to attack in a way that Obama failed to exploit .
In the second debate , McCain said , " I know how " to find Bin Laden .
This should have led Obama to respond that if he knows how to catch him , he should have told his friend George Bush .
Obama missed a chance for that riposte in the debate , but he may yet have another opportunity .
New dynamic
All of this sets up a quite different dynamic should Bin Laden release another tape .
After condemning the new tape , Obama could launch right into renewed criticism of the failure to catch Al Qaeda 's mastermind seven years after 9/11 .
Instead of making him look like another weak Democrat , a new tape would give Obama a chance to seem muscular on national security .
McCain would try to argue that the country would be safer with him , but it probably would n't have the potency of Bush 's similar claim in 2004 .
Should there be , God forbid , an actual terrorist attack between now and the election , all bets are off .
But it 's instructive that only three days after the 2004 terrorist attack in Madrid that killed 193 people , the most deadly act of Islamic terrorism in European history , the Spanish socialists won national elections .
We are n't Spain , but we 're also not a country that can have a whole election thrown into disarray by terrorists .
At least I hope we are n't any more , though we wo n't know for sure unless it happens .

What are these ?
by Vito Rispo
Ever since the 1980s , there ’s been a rumor that American Express has a special card for the elite members of society .
Supposedly the ultra - rich use it to get into the secret floor at Macy ’s or the unadvertised underground restaurants of New York .
It was cool to think there ’s a whole lifestyle that you could gain access to if only you had a special card .
Unfortunately , it did n’t actually exist until 1999 .
That ’s when American Express decided to capitalize on the urban legend and make it a reality .
Since then , the Black Card ( real name : The Centurion Card ) has worked its way into popular culture .
Rappers rap about it , writers incorporate it into books and magazines , it ’s mentioned on TV shows .
It ’s the mark of wealth .
But how hard is it to get one ?
The Centurion Card has a one time joining fee of 5,000 dollars and an annual fee of $ 2,500 dollars .
But that ’s the easy part .
If you could just put down 5 grand and pay $ 2500 a year for it , then it really would n’t really be so special .
The kicker is , it ’s by invitation only .
And to get invited , you have to have a minimum spending of $ 250,000 dollars a year , an exceptional credit rating , and already be an AmEx Platinum Card or Preferred Rewards Gold Card holder .
For major celebrities and public figures , they may waive the credit rating .
If you meet all the criteria , the word on the street is they just send out a centurion card in a fancy box without much notification .
Check out the unboxing video :
The card was originally just black plastic , but starting in 2006 , American Express starting making the card out of anodized titanium .
This gives it a substantial , heavy feel .
That ’s the feel of quality .
Ok , so you ’re a big spender with crystal credit … why get one of these ?
What ’s so great about the American Express Centurion ?
What could it possibly do for me ?
A lot , actually ; there are a massive amount of exclusive privileges you get access to as a cardholder .
First off , you get a dedicated concierge and travel agent , which is cool enough on it ’s own .
The concierge services allows card holders to call or email requests for tickets , dinner reservations , and shopping research basically anywhere .
Centurion card holders are given access to the higher paid concierges who are the top of the Platinum concierge employees .
You need Arabian horses for your daughters wedding , call up your personal AmEx concierge , he ’ll take care of it .
Plus , you get complimentary companion airline tickets on international flights , personal shoppers at high - end retailers , access to VIP airport clubs , first class flight upgrades , membership in Sony ’s Cierge personal shopping program , and memberships in all the elite shopping clubs .
There are special hotel benefits like free extra nights or upgrades , and sometimes , random gifts given throughout the year .
Some members have received , out of the blue , Canon PowerShot SD850 digital cameras , $ 2000 Judith Ripka gift cards , $ 1000 Van Cleef & Arpels gift cards , tote bags , Gucci gift card , $ 1000 Mikimoto gift cards , etc .
It ’s nice to be rich .
The ultra-rich are a high - profit / low - risk group for credit card companies .
They buy big ticket items that bring in high level processing fees from retailers .
So companies fight hard to get high end members .
Other companies started seeing the success American Express has with the Centurion , and the copycards began .
This is a fairly large market .
Supposedly there are less than 20,000 black cards out there .
There are a lot more people out there who want them , and a good amount who can actually afford them too .
We ’re a wealthy nation .

What Is Mole Day ?
Celebrated annually on October 23 from 6:02 a.m. to 6:02 p.m. , Mole Day commemorates Avogadro's Number ( 6.02 x 1023 ) , which is a basic measuring unit in chemistry .
Mole Day was created as a way to foster interest in chemistry .
Schools throughout the United States and around the world celebrate Mole Day with various activities related to chemistry and / or moles .
For a given molecule , one mole is a mass ( in grams ) whose number is equal to the molar mass of the molecule .
For example , the water molecule has an molar mass of 18 , therefore one mole of water weighs 18 grams .
Similarly , a mole of neon has a molar mass of 20 grams .
In general , one mole of any substance contains Avogadro 's Number of molecules or atoms of that substance .
This relationship was first discovered by Amadeo Avogadro ( 1776 - 1858 ) and he received credit for this after his death .

Country music icon says just $ 1 billion out of $ 700 billion could get real economy back on track
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , October 23 , 2008
Country music icon Willie Nelson has a message for Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke in the wake of the recent $ 700 billion dollar plus Wall Street bailout – how about a bailout for the desperate and struggling family farmers of America that are nearing extinction ?
“ I have written a letter as president of Farm Aid to whoever controls that money that we would like to have $ 1 billion dollars from that 700 … .$ 1 billion dollars is I think all we ’ll need to turn the economy around if we start out taking care of our family farmers , ” Nelson told The Alex Jones Show .
“ We could put 10 million farmers back on the land , making a living out there raising food and fuel …. and that $ 1 billion dollars I think would go a long way to changing our negative attitudes that we have and the confidence in ourselves and in our country right now , ” said Nelson , adding that all foreclosures on farms should be halted immediately .
“ I think that if we invested that $ 1 billion with our family farmers , we would begin to turn it around , ” stressed the country music star , later joking that $ 100 billion would be an even better amount .
Nelson has been a multi- decade activist and vocal proponent for Farm Aid , and recently performed alongside Neil Young at the highly successful 2008 Farm Aid concert which was held at the Comcast Center in Mansfield , MA , having helped organize the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Farm
Aid is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep family farmers on their land and support locally sourced , humanely - raised and organic food in the face of a gargantuan attempt on behalf of big agribusiness to squeeze the family farmer out of existence .
The letter that Nelson and fellow Farm Aid directors John Mellencamp , Neil Young and Dave Matthews sent to Congress points out , “ When farms thrive , Main Street businesses and local communities thrive .
Far from Wall Street , family farmers are creating real wealth , producing real value , growing from seeds and sunlight a product that nourishes us both physically and economically .
Supporting diverse decentralized family farming will do far more for the stability and vitality of our country than a handful of global agribusiness corporations could ever do . ”
“ The proposed $ 700 billion bailout asks taxpayers to foot the bill without giving them the opportunity to share in any gains .
A $ 1 billion investment in family farm agriculture would enrich us all , because we are all shareholders of the family farm .
The return on investment in the family farm includes thriving local economies , nutritious food for better health , a safer and more secure food supply , a cleaner environment and more renewable energy . ”
Nelson pointed out that when 8 - 10 million family farmers were on the land in America at the end of the second world war the economy was strong because , “ Agriculture is the bottom rung on the economic ladder , ” adding that the farmers became a target because they were a political problem .
“ Let ’s put out the fire now , we ’ll figure out who started it later and that ’s pretty much what we have to do , we have to stop the fire and stop the bleeding , and I think the best way to do that is still from the ground up , go back to our family farmer , he ’s the one that started taking care of us in the beginning so let ’s let him do it again , ” Nelson concluded .

Every year on October 11th , we celebrate a day where we decide to be true to ourselves and come out to friends , family , co-workers , and anyone in our lives .
It serves as an international day to come out of the closet and discuss lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , intersexual , and asexual issues .
Coming
Out is a personal as well as sometimes political / symbolic action on the part of sexual and gender minorities .
It is about the public expression of ones identity and the desire to live openly , honestly , and without fear .
The coming out process is a difficult one and a life - long journey , it is about being true to yourself as well others .
Studies show that people who know queer people are much more likely to be sympathetic to LGBTQ rights .
Coming out is indeed an activist step that not only serves to advance the cause of the gay community but also to liberate yourself from living in the shadows and suffering with shame .
Coming out is not easy and should not be dismissed as such , many people spend many years or even decades with the task of debating whether to live honest and open lives .
It is not advisable to come out if you face the risk of physical harassment or if you feel your financial status is threatened by being out .
If those variables do not apply to you , there are many resources to assist you in the coming out process .
Such as great websites , forums , videos , and more .

Feeling down ?
Wondering how to cheer up ?
Well perhaps all you have to do is sing a song .
Hey , it works for birds .
Researchers at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan have recently uncovered a breakthrough in animal behavior .
In their recent study , they concluded that singing by male birds to attract females stimulates reward centers in their brains , reinforcing their behavior .
In essence , singing for mates makes male birds really happy .
Animal brains , including humans , are designed to have a positive emotional response to certain rewarding stimuli .
These stimuli are genetically programmed and therefore are intricately related to the survival and procreation of that individual .
Thus , sex and food are among the most rewarding stimuli , eliciting chemical reactions that in turn produce positive emotional responses .
Stimuli can activate certain “ reward ” centers of the brain , which are concentrated with neurons that release dopamine in the brain .
One of these areas is located in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) and has also been shown to be the target of addictive drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine .
When given these compounds , activity is greatly increased , and dopamine released , causing a feeling of joy and pleasure .
These feelings maintain the addictive behavior .
Research by Ya - Chun Huang and Neal Hessler supports that social interactions of animals can also activate the VTA .
Working with zebra finches , native to Australia , they studied courtship song of these birds as compared with solo song .
Zebra finches uses a specific " directed " song , when courted females while they sing " undirected " song alone , possibly for song practice or communication with unseen birds .
The work by Huang and Hessler shows that the " directed " courtship song stimulated the dopamine neurons in the VTA of zebra finches while undirected song did not .

Huang and Hessler ’s findings show that the reward centers of the brain , specifically the VTA , are linked with the maintenance of social interactions .
Since songbird courtship is also necessary for procreation , it makes sense that the experience is rewarding .
This also supports some studies that demonstrate similar responses in humans done on sexual behavior and attachment which also depend on neuronal release of dopamine in the brain .
Despite the genetic and evolutionary differences between birds and mammals , there is a shared mechanism for certain social interactions and reward that produce similar chemical and therefore emotional reactions .
It seems that this one is not just for the birds .
Video shows examples of two types of singing performed by male zebra finches .
First , when males can't see other birds , they will sing " undirected " song , possibly for practice or for communication with distant birds .
Second , when males can see nearby females , they will often sing " directed " courtship song .
In this study , birds either performed only undirected or only directed singing for 45 minutes before their brain function was examined .
To increase singing motivation , in all directed singing experiments , males sang to two females ( those shown in this video ) rather than a single female .

Over the past year , US citizens have become increasingly aware of the substandard consumer - level goods flowing out of China , but new reports indicate that the counterfeit products and dubious quality controls are not confined to the consumer sector .
An increasingly large number of supposedly military - grade electronic components are turning out to be counterfeit commercial - grade hardware that , in some cases , is decades older than the manufacturing label indicates .
The problem , to be sure , is not entirely China 's fault .
Back in 1994 and 1996 , the Clinton Administration passed two bills , the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act ( 1994 ) , and the Clinger - Cohen Act of 1996 ( PDF , originally known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act ) .
Collectively , these two bills were designed to streamline and simplify federal purchasing procedures , as well as allow for the use of commercial off - the - shelf hardware in certain areas .
The concepts were sold to the public and Congress as a way to save a tremendous amount of money — rather than designing and implementing its own , custom products at tremendous manufacturing and R&D costs , the government would instead use ( or modify ) products that were readily available on today 's market .
That was the idea , anyway , but new reporting from BusinessWeek highlights how these two laws have had long - term unintended consequences .
One of the unintended consequences of both cutting the Pentagon 's budget and encouraging low - cost , off - the - shelf procurement , has been a dramatic decline in the use of authorized resellers and / or parts purchased directly from the manufacturer .
Under the new rules , government contractors were explicitly discouraged from designing systems that required the use of expensive , proprietary electronics or processors that would never be widely produced .
This left the Pentagon largely unable to fund inefficient , small - scale production runs , and gave electronics manufacturers little reason to produce them .
Moving the acquisition and sourcing for these parts to China has opened security holes that have n't gone entirely unnoticed .
As we covered earlier this year , the Department of Defense is aware that the processors it 's acquiring are vulnerable to tampering , since some of them are complex enough to easily conceal trojan horses or backdoor circuitry installed by parties unknown .
The DoD plans to launch a program designed to evaluate the best ways to detect circuit - level and chip - level tampering , but results are still years away .
Keeping China from advancing too far , meanwhile , is still a major concern of the United States .
Intel is building a fab plant in Shanghai , but the new facility wo n't come online with anything like the cutting - edge technology the chip giant deploys in its other facilities .
Even allowing Intel to build a facility in Shanghai at all is something of a bend in historical US policy .
Current Chinese fabrication technology lags the US by multiple generations , and it's not in our best interest to hand a potential enemy the tools with which we build our own leading - edge equipment .
The bad parts flowing into the military 's hands now are n't being modified in clean rooms ; rather , they 're being stripped off old boards in China 's back alleys , doctored cosmetically , and passed off as new , military - grade components .
The difference between true military - grade parts and the commercial - grade chips that are actually shipping out is non-trivial .
In many cases , military - grade components are exposed to prolonged environmental stressors that commercial components are not designed to deal with , including extreme fluctuations in temperature and humidity .
It 's absolutely critical that components remain durable and functional under such conditions , as having the radar on one 's F - 15 suddenly fail is considered slightly more hazardous than , say , the failure of one 's cellular phone .
Component failure reports from defense contractors worldwide , including Boeing , Raytheon , BAE , Northrop Grumman , and Lockheed , however , suggest that sufficient verification of part authenticity is no longer taking place , and investigations have turned up a significant number of counterfeit parts , sometimes installed in mission - critical systems .
The culprit , in this case , is price .
In the name of cost - cutting , the federal government has stripped away many of the authorization and authentication procedures that once defined federal purchasing and replaced them with a system that rewards the penny - pincher who can find the cheapest products .
It 's a warm September morning in the year 2019 , and you snap on NPR 's Morning Edition to catch a few minutes of the news before biking off to work .
But an older and wiser Steve Inskeep has grim news for you today .
The Global Extinction Awareness System , a supercomputer that accurately predicted the extinction of red squirrels several years ago , has run the numbers for our own species through the computer , and our odds of survival are n't good .
According to GEAS , Homo sapiens may go extinct by the year 2042 .
That 's the scenario that greets players in the forthcoming online game Superstruct , which is being run by the think tank Institute for the Future .
Beginning on September 22 ^nd , players will be invited to plunge into the troubled world of 2019 , and to begin to work towards solutions that could buy our species a little more time on the planet .
They 're forced to cope with five " super - threats " that are wearing down our civilization , including devastating outbreaks of a pandemic respiratory disease , climate refugees who have fled homelands made unlivable by global warming , and legions of hackers who exult in bringing down global information networks .

But this is n't just a chance for gamers to flirt with the dark edge of disaster ; they 'll also be participating in a cutting - edge experiment that tries to harness the wisdom of crowds for a higher purpose .
Superstruct is what the institute calls the world 's first " massively multiplayer forecasting game . "
The Institute for the Future does n't like to put it this way , but it 's essentially trying to use crowdsourcing to predict the future .
The Palo Alto - based institute does n't have a problem with the crowdsourcing lingo ; distributing creative work to the masses is all the rage these days .
It 's the idea that the institute tries to predict the future that raises hackles .
While the non-profit institute does keep itself afloat largely by selling its 10 - year forecasts to corporations who are very interested in what the future may hold ( and what it augers for their brands ) , institute employees say that forecasting is a very different thing than prediction .
" Future forecasting is all about testing strategies — it 's like a wind tunnel , " says Jamais Cascio , one of the game directors for Superstruct .
" We create scenarios with different kind of challenges that may come to pass , and you cantest your strategy . "
Now , instead of having that wind tunnel be designed and constructed by what Cascio calls " our little hermetic cabal of thinkers , " the institute is handing the toolbox to the unruly mob .
For a think tank that has taken pride in doling out expert opinions , giving control to the multitudes is a dramatic step .
The idea of using the masses ' collective intelligence to peer into the future is n't new ; prediction markets ( modeled after stock markets ) already exist to let people bet on the possible success of presidential candidates , sports teams , and Hollywood blockbusters .
But such prediction markets can only get you so far , says Jane McGonigal , another of the game 's directors , because they can only ask questions in which the entire range of outcomes has already been determined .
" We want to ask questions where we have no idea of the range of outcomes , " McGonigal says .
In Superstruct , the players will be presenting their ideas on how to cope with the crisis of 2019 , and McGonigal hopes they 'll come up with solutions and outcomes that she never imagined .
" That 's why the tagline for the game is ' Invent the Future , ' " she says .
" Because the future does n't just happen , somebody makes it . "
The game came together quite naturally , explains Kathi Vian , director of the institute 's Ten - Year Forecast Program .
The institute wanted to join the open source revolution and experiment with more participatory methods of forecasting .
Cascio , a futurist and scenario planner who often works with the institute , wanted to give people a venue for brainstorming ideas , in the continuation of a mission he began five years ago when he co-founded Worldchanging , a popular publication about environmental solutions .
Superstruct 's other mastermind is the institute 's resident game designer , Jane McGonigal , who joined the think tank several years ago because she " takes play seriously " and believes that impassioned gamers can accomplish amazing things .
She has previously worked on a game that asked players to role - play their way through an oil crisis .
And she 's fresh from directing a triumphant alternate reality game that was sponsored by McDonald 's and the International Olympic Commission as a promotion for the Beijing Olympics , in which she convinced players on every continent except Antarctica to run labyrinths blindfolded in order to save the world .
The team called the new game Superstruct because " society 's existing structures and organizations are n't up to the incredible challenges facing us in the 21 ^st century , " Vian says , and players will have to build new structures on top of the old .
The threats the players will confront are based on the institute 's own research about how things could go horribly wrong for humans over the coming decades .
" There are some scenarios out there that talk about the real threat of human extinction by the end of the century , " Vian says .
" So the circumstances present in the game world are a little exaggerated , but it's a plausible worst - case scenario . "
This is n't the kind of game where your avatar whips out a magic potion to ward off a bad case of bird flu .
Instead , players will essentially imagine themselves into the future , and will tell other players what they 're seeing , feeling , and doing through blog posts , videos , or whatever medium suits their purposes .
And while there will be some traditional game elements , such as missions to accomplish and points to win , it can just as easily be viewed as a kind of " collaborative storytelling , " Cascio says .
" You 've heard of LARPs — live action role - playing games — where people run around in capes , saying , ' Lightning bolt !
Lightning bolt !' " he says .
" This is n't quite that bad , but this is in some respects a LARP .
We 're asking you to take on the role of yourself , some years from now , and live in that moment for awhile , " says Cascio ( who admits that he learned a lot about managing people by acting as the God - like dungeon master while playing Dungeons and Dragons ) .
In Superstruct , players will bring their own personal knowledge and experiences to the table .
" We do n't need everybody to be experts on how climate might change and how the economy might be impacted , " says McGonigal .
" If you 're a teenaged girl , tell us how a teenaged girl would respond to this crisis .
We need that personal intelligence from everybody . "
The players will help imagine and document the world of 2019 , and will work together to come up with solutions to the challenges that are presented throughout the six - week game .
Cascio says that his highest hope is that the collaborating players will come up with innovative ideas that have applications here , in the real world of 2008 .
" The mass of ideas can become almost an epiphany engine , " he says .
The game is projected to have a couple of different payoffs for its sponsor :
It will test this method of crowdsourced forecasting and will produce scads of ideas that might make it into the institute 's expert - produced 10 - year forecast .
But Cascio says the players — even the world at large — may reap a greater reward from playing Superstruct .
" A lot of the challenges we 're dealing with this century have a very long lag time , " Cascio says .
" Even if we were to stop putting out greenhouse gases right now , we 'd still face decades of warming . "
Most humans are n't in the habit of acting on consequences they can't see , he says ; they have to be coaxed into saving money for retirement or into supporting climate change legislation that will raise energy prices .
" According to some neuroscientists , our capacity for long - term thinking emerged in the parts of the brain that were initially involved with throwing rocks at moving objects , " a skill first developed further during harsh ice ages , Cascio says .
" If you look at the major advances in the Hominid line — advances in tool use , language , and art — most of these were triggered by environmental changes , " he says .
" Foresight turns out to be a critical adaptive strategy for times of great stress . "
There 's little doubt that our world is under stress , and a little human evolution right now could help a lot .
Cascio , McGonigal , and the institute are banking on the idea that a game can get people into the habit of thinking far into the future .
If all goes well in the game world of 2019 , players may realize that for thes pecies to survive , we must all become futurists .
Honda Takes on the Hybrid Motorcycle
For a few years now , hybrids have been all the rage in the consumer car market .
The Prius has been elevated to the status of an icon and Honda is now trying to catch up with its revived Honda Insight .
But what about motorcycles , where Honda has been the unquestioned world leader for years ?
The added weight and complexity has previously kept the word “ hybrid ” from squeezing in front of the word “ motorcycle , ” but now Honda thinks they ’ve found a way to build and market hybrid motorcycles .
According to the Mainichi Shinbun , Honda will begin releasing the hybrid motorcycles in the 2010s , which will be followed up by electric motorcycles in 2011 .
Honda will be adapting the hybrid system it uses on its current cars to work with motorcycles of engine displacement between 200 and 1000 cc .
It would probably be too cumbersome to use on smaller bikes , but Honda hopes to increase fuel efficiency by about 50 % with the hybrid bikes .
Now , the real question for all you bikers out there is this : would you ride one ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- " Drill - baby - drill ! "
With the price of oil falling below $ 75 a barrel Wednesday - down about 49 % from last summer 's highs - the industry 's battle cry is sounding less and less convincing .
But falling oil prices are not the only reason why the air is coming out of the drilling balloon .
The credit crunch has hampered oil companies ' ability to fund big - ticket drilling projects .
Meanwhile , the prices that producers pay for raw materials and labor remain high .
" Any project that assumed oil would average $ 100 over the next 10 to 20 years is being seriously reconsidered at this time , " said Richard Ward , senior cost analyst at IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) .
As recently as July , tapping deep water sources and extracting crude from Canadian oil sands - two very expensive production methods - were seen as economically viable ways to deal with the energy crisis .
At that time , the price of oil was above $ 140 a barrel .
Now that the price has fallen below $ 75 a barrel , and could go even lower , many experts say the future of these projects is uncertain .
Prices .
Oil companies are quick to point out that big drilling projects are long - term investments , which are not based on today 's oil price , but on what they think the price will be in the future .
Indeed , some deep water projects have a life span of 20 to 30 years .
And some producers expect to be mining Canada 's oil sands for up to 40 years .
" Companies in the industry know that prices are volatile , " said Ron Planting , an analyst at the American Petroleum Institute .
" They probably did not plan projects that would only work at $ 140 a barrel . "
Greg Stringham , a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , said most oil companies have kept their price scenarios below $ 100 a barrel .
While producers have had to make " massive adjustments to their budgets " in light of the decline in oil prices , companies are not backing out , Stringham said .
Mickey Driver , a spokesman for Chevron Corp. ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , said the company has not " changed the scope of our current capital program , " and that " we take a long - term view in our business planning . "
A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS.A ) declined to comment because the company is in a ' quiet period ' before they release quarterly results .
Still , if prices remain low for a prolonged period of time , many analysts expect oil companies to start cutting losses on some high - end projects .
For example , projects based in the Canadian oil sands , where it can cost about $ 70 to extract one barrel of marketable oil , could be among the first to feel the impact .
If the price of oil falls firmly below $ 60 a barrel , " you may see some consolidation in the Canadian oil sands , " Ward said .
Given rapidly declining prices , tight credit conditions , high input costs and weakening demand - the outlook for bold new oil exploration is grim .
Companies that are n't able to weather a protracted low oil price scenario may find themselves selling operations .
" Expect some forced and unforced deals to be done , " said Neal Dingmann , senior energy analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in Houston .
Credit .
Falling oil prices are not the only economic challenge facing the oil industry .
Stringham points out that the credit crisis has hampered many oil producers ability to get affordable funding for big drilling operations .
While the credit markets have begun to show signs of a tentative thaw , the current climate remains difficult for borrowers .
Many of the oil industry 's big offshore drilling projects are " highly levered , " Dingmann said .
And as long as credit remains tight , those projects will be on hold , he said .
Costs .
In addition to credit concerns , oil companies are facing high costs for raw materials and labor .
Over the last four years , capital costs have increased more than 100 % for the average exploration project , according to IHS / CERA data .
A sharp increase in the price of steel has been one of the biggest problems .
The raw material is used to build drills , pipelines and tankers that make oil exploration possible .
Until recently , steel prices have been climbing along with copper and other key industrial materials .
But as the global economy slows , particularly in the developing world , steel prices on the London Metal Exchange have come down 60 % from their July peak .
And that could spell relief for oil producers .
Labor is another story .
The oil business is " the epitome of the boom - bust market , " said Stephen Schork , independent analyst and publisher of the industry newsletter The Schork Report .
When the market was booming at the turn of the last century , labor was not a problem .
But much of the industry 's workforce left the business at the end of the last boom and went on to other careers , Schork said .
Given the dim prospects for a boom in the near future , those workers are not likely to return .
" They definitely have manpower shortage in the sector , " Schork said .

If you want to know what it feels like to get hit in the NFL check out the following pictures .
Yes that is the back of my leg with the best bruise I have ever received on it .
It starts under my right butt cheek and continues down to about my calf and is now a lovely shade of red to purple .
I think in a couple of days it will start to change colors into a rainbow of blacks , blues , maybe some greens , yellows , and reds .
It happened during special teams last week and hurts like hell .
There is only one thing that comes to mind , I think would compare to the shot I took in the leg .
And that is to have Barry Bonds back in his prime take a upper deck home run swing into the back of your leg and just get floored by it and see if the damage would be the same .
The day after the game was awfully painful for me and felt like I got trampled by an elephant .
Anyway I hope you guys like the pictures , as proof of the punishment we players endure week in and week out to play in the NFL .
Thanks ,
Yoder
( Video : an intro that precedes the movies of Max Hardcore ; no nudity or sexual acts in this embedded video above ) .
A US District Court in Florida has sentenced " extreme shock porn " gonzo director and distributor Max Hardcore , aka Paul F. Little , to four years in prison over obscenity charges .
Writing for Salon , Glenn Greenwald wrote that he believes the verdict is a blow to first amendment rights :
" So , to recap , in the Land of the Free : if you 're an adult who produces a film using other consenting adults , for the entertainment of still other consenting adults , which merely depicts fictional acts of humiliation and degradation , the DOJ will prosecute you and send you to prison for years .
The claim that no real pain was inflicted will be rejected ; mere humiliation is enough to make you a criminal .
But if government officials actually subject helpless detainees in their custody to extreme mental abuse , degradation , humiliation and even mock executions long considered " torture " in the entire civilized world , the DOJ will argue that they have acted with perfect legality and , just to be sure , Congress will hand them retroactive immunity for their conduct .
That 's how we prioritize criminality and arrange our value system . "
The hometown Tampa , FL paper where Little was convicted wrote about the case in a condemning tone :
His pornographic persona , Max Hardcore , is all swagger and sadism – forcing women in his movies to do things that can't be described in a family newspaper .
But in federal court today , as he faced a federal prison sentence , Paul F. Little trembled and begged a woman for mercy .
" It just seems a very high price to pay , I think , " Little told U.S. District Judge Susan Bucklew , " and I ask you to understand how much I 've suffered . "
Judge Sentences Porn Producer To 46 Months In Prison ( Tampa Bay Online ) .
Similar accounts published in Max Hardcore 's home town paper , The Pasadena ( CA ) Star - News , and in this Tampa Bay paper .
Why was Little , aka Hardcore , convicted in Florida , when the offending material was produced elsewhere and distributed in many places , even overseas ?
IANAL , but as I understand it : producers are subject to obscenity charges in any state the material can be downloaded when local standards deem the material to be obscene .
The landmark Supreme Court case of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell is informative background reading .
But the most authoritative voice I have read on the Max Hardcore case is that of Susannah Breslin , whose work I 've blogged here many times .
If you read one piece on this story , read hers .
Unlike most ( perhaps all ) of the voices you 'll read on this topic , she 's actually spent time on the kind of porn sets where " shock producers " like Hardcore preside , and she 's watched more of his work than I could ever stomach .
I can't speak for her , but I think the point of this powerful essay she 's just published is this : the story is complicated .
If we 're going to talk about the big , abstract , meta issues — and we should — we owe it to the human beings involved to observe the human story , up close , with all the ugly details .
Stories like this are n't easy or binary , and deserve complex , respectful treatment .
We send reporters to Baghdad for in - depth reporting about the war ; reporters covering this story would do well to understand this reality up close and personal , unromanticized .
From Breslin's piece :
In Max Hardcore movies –" Anal Agony , " " Hardcore Schoolgirls , " " Max ! Do n't F**k Up My Mommy !" –women are verbally and physically degraded in an unprecedented myriad of ways .
They are choked , slapped , throat -**** ed , penetrated with fists , given enemas , pile - driven , urinated upon , vomited upon , and in some instances instructed to drink from glasses the money shots that have been delivered into their rectums .
Most of the time , Little as Hardcore is the perpetrator of these acts .
Not infrequently , his scenes are fraught with pedophilia themes , beginning when he stumbles upon his subjects in playgrounds , where they sit alone , in pigtails , talking baby - talk , and sucking on lollipops .
Mostly , the sex scenes end with his latest costar a mess and Hardcore triumphant .
Even for the most jaded porn watcher , Little 's ouevre is over the top .
Watching Little 's work is less like watching a porn movie than it is akin to witnessing a vivisection .
On the screen , Hardcore bends over the female bodies before him , sometimes with speculum in hand , as if attempting to get at something within her at which he can never quite get , and so to which he is doomed to return , his methods more and more hardcore .
In Porn Valley , Little is something of a pariah .
The larger , more mainstream - oriented and consumer - friendly adult production companies like Vivid Video and Wicked Pictures pride themselves on turning out adult content that plays by the rules , thereby , they hope , protecting the industry from legal persecution .
In contrast , Little and company , other producers believe , put the entire industry at risk by creating content more likely to be targeted in obscenity indictments .
( See : The Cambria List . )
In 2005 , the Bush administration launched its so - called " War on Porn , " forming the Obscenity Prosecution Task Force , a Department of Justice outfit dedicated to pursuing obscenity prosecutions , and the FBI began recruiting for a " porn squad , " otherwise known as the Adult Obscenity Squad , focused on " manufacturers and purveyors " of pornography .
In late 2005 , federal agents raided Little 's offices in Altadena , California , but it was n't until early 2007 that his indictment was unsealed .
As it turned out , OPTF Director Brent Ward had found getting US Attorneys to pursue obscenity prosecutions was n't easy .
Consequently , US Attorneys who preferred dedicating their resources to crimes other than obscenity in districts more likely to win the administration obscenity convictions were eliminated .
Late last year , the OPTF 's first trial began in Phoenix , Arizona , pitting the US government against a producer of bukkake videos , but the result was an embarrassment , the pornographer slipping out of the government 's hands in the courtroom .
When it came to Little , prosecutors were gunning for a win .
Finally , three years after the OPTF was formed , the Feds got their man .

UPDATE : Susannah Breslin has added a new update post with critical responses to her essay , and first - person testimonies related to this story from folks who grew up in or spent time in the " world " at issue .
Really interesting read .
Go have a look .
Excerpt from one reader response :
Greenwald 's entire point in discussing the farcical proceedings that convicted Little is that they specifically selected a venue for prosecution best suited to clearing that first hurdle :
' Even though he lived and worked in California , the Bush DOJ dragged him to Tampa , Florida in order to try him under Tampa 's " community standards , " on the theory that his website used servers physically based in Central Florida and some of the films were sent to Tampa customers who purchased them . '

Poll respondents are increasingly glum about the economy .
USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL FINANCIAL TURMOIL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
More coverage : Recession is official , economists say WASHINGTON  Neither President Bush nor the two men vying to succeed him , John McCain and Barack Obama , has won the confidence of a majority of Americans that he and his advisers will be able to " fix " the nation 's economic crisis , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll .
Two - thirds of those surveyed say their personal financial situation has been harmed by the mortgage meltdown and the stock market 's fall , and even more expect to suffer long - term damage .
They are braced for more bad news : 73 % call the economy " poor , " a record high , and 84 % predict it 's going to get worse .
INTERACTIVE : Bush 's approval ratings through the years
The findings include a series of highs and lows for a nation that could hardly be more glum .
A record 91 % say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States , the highest in the three decades Gallup has asked the question .
Just 7 % , a record low , say they are satisfied .
Bush , McCain and Obama all delivered comments Monday aimed at reassuring an anxious public .
Bush spoke at the White House after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
McCain addressed a campaign rally in Virginia Beach .
In Toledo , Ohio , Obama endorsed a tax credit for job creation and a 90 - day moratorium on home foreclosures .
Three weeks before Election Day , Obama leads McCain 51 % - 44 % among registered voters , just outside the survey 's margin of error of +/—3 percentage points .
The poll of 1,269 adults was taken Friday through Sunday , before the Dow 's stunning 936 - point rally Monday .
Despite his lead , 50 % of Americans say they do n't have confidence in Obama and his advisers to fix the economy ; 44 % do .
Even so , that lukewarm endorsement is better than the 31%-63 % rating for McCain .
The president scores lowest of all : 16 % express confidence in him and his team , 80 % no confidence .
Bush 's job - approval rating matches his low of 25 % while his disapproval has risen to a new high , 71 % .
Americans are split on whether the economy 's problems represent a temporary financial downturn ( 47 % ) or a more permanent change in the economy that means it wo n't recover for a long time ( 49 % ) .
Most believe that the government can have significant influence over fixing what 's gone wrong .
In the survey , 37 % say the government can have " a great deal " of impact ; 42 % say it can have " a fair amount . "
McCain was defiant about his standing in the polls .
" The national media has written us off , " he told the rally .
" But they forgot to let you decide , " he said , describing himself as " a fighter " and the underdog .
" We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now , " Obama said .
" We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle class … right now . "
Using Gallup 's traditional model of likely voters , Obama edges McCain 50 % - 46 % .
Under an alternate model based solely on whether respondents say they plan to vote , his lead is 52 % - 45 % .

Sarah Palin and John McCain are going all over the country saying how Sarah Palin killed the Bridge to Nowhere ( not true ) and that she said “ No Thanks ” to the Feds when presented with the money .
Really ?
What happened to the $ 223 million Palin is saying she said “ No Thanks ” to ?
She kept it .
Once it was no longer earmarked for the Bridge , Palin kept it for other pork barrel projects of her own choosing .
Biofuel Industry Will Help Clean Up Chernobyl Site
September 24th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Many different methods have been used to clean up the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site , but I never thought harvesting biomass crops would be one of them .
Apparently , the Belarus government believes that harvesting biomass crops repeatedly on the disaster site will eventually remove radionuclides from the soil .
If the plan works , radioactive contamination could be removed from 50,000 square km of land in 20 to 40 years — an encouraging timeline considering it will otherwise take centuries for radionuclides to disappear .
Greenfield Project Management is spearheading the project with a multi-fuels refinery that will produce ethanol , biodiesel , biogas , and electricity .
The fuels will initially use feedstocks from clean lands , but the facilities will begin using crops from contaminated areas after safety checks and field trials .
The planning phase of the project will finish next year , and the refinery will begin production in 2010 .
While the thought of using contaminated feedstocks makes me uneasy ( despite safety assurances ) , this is great news for the Chernobyl area , which has been afflicted with radioactivity for far too long .

Advertisement A plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Germany after two British women tried to open a cabin door mid-flight , police have said .
The women , aged 26 and 27 , were drinking heavily and had to be held in their seats by security staff until the plane landed in Frankfurt .
They were arrested and released after two hours , Frankfurt police said .
The XL Airways plane was flying from the Greek island of Kos to Manchester when Wednesday 's incident happened .
An airline spokeswoman said the women were thought to have been smoking in the plane 's toilet , and were suspected of bringing their own alcohol on board .
She said they had started to swear at and threaten staff who refused to sell them any more alcohol from the bar .
The women had then said they wanted to open the door to get " some fresh air " into the plane .
" Their language was totally unacceptable , as was their behaviour .
They were very abusive and threatening , " the spokeswoman said .
" We wo n't tolerate this sort of behaviour .
The cabin crew did an excellent job and were very professional . "
Reuters news agency reported that the 26 - year - old woman tried to strike a flight attendant with a vodka bottle .
The incident happened at an altitude of about 10,000 m ( 32,808 ft ) while the plane was flying over Austria .
We wo n't tolerate this sort of behaviour
XL Airways spokeswoman Hartmut Scherer , a spokesman for police at Frankfurt International Airport , said the captain had thought the best option would be to make an unscheduled stop in Frankfurt and remove the women from the plane .
" Someone from the security held them in their seats until the landing , " he said .
Two - hour delay
The women face charges of grievous bodily harm and violating air traffic regulations , according to Reuters .
The flight , XLA 237 , which left Kos at 1445 BST , had 214 passengers and seven crew on board .
After stopping at Frankfurt , it later flew on to Manchester after a two - hour delay , landing at 1825 BST .
Meanwhile the women were questioned by police but released and allowed to return to the UK .
The XL Airways spokeswoman said the airline was considering taking legal action against the woman .
Mr Scherer said police were deciding whether to press charges , adding that the pair could also be fined or forced to pay compensation .

What are these ?
You might be forgiven if , upon watching this video of Sarah Palin meeting with and talking to heads of state , you think to yourself , " But , Sarah Palin has never address the United Nations ! "
Because we did .
The video mashes up some actual audio of Palin discussing foreign policy and the religious case for " Drill , Baby , Drill " with footage of " Palin " discussing those things with heads of state , as she might be called to do as VP ( or , God forbid , President ) .
It might be the scariest thing you see all Halloween .

Barbie Snodgrass had agreed to meet me at a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet , on a strip of fast - food restaurants and auto shops west of downtown Columbus , Ohio , but she did n’t have much time to talk .
Her shift as a receptionist at a medical clinic , which got her out of the house at six in the morning , had just ended , at three ; the drive home , to a housing development in a working - class suburb south of the city , took half an hour .
She then had a little more than an hour to eat , change clothes , let the dog out , check up on her sister ’s two teen - age daughters — Sierra and Ashley , who were under her care — and then drive back into Columbus , where she worked the evening shift cleaning the studios of a local television station , and where her day ended , at ten .
She also worked some weekends .
She was forty - two , single , overweight , and suffering from stomach pains .
Snodgrass sat down at my table and refused the offer of a soft drink .
She was wearing a drab ensemble of gray cotton sweatpants and a loose - fitting pale - yellow knit top , and her brown hair fell in bangs just above her eyes .
I asked for her thoughts about the Presidential candidates , and she said , “ Someone who makes two hundred or three hundred thousand a year , who eats a regular meal , who does n’t have to struggle , who does n’t worry if the lights are going to be turned out — if he does n’t walk in your shoes , he ca n’t understand . ”
In Snodgrass ’s shoes , it hardly made sense to draw a paycheck .
“ You ’re working for what ? ” she asked .
She had n’t finished college , and the two jobs that kept her “ constantly moving ” brought in a little more than forty thousand dollars a year , but after the mortgage ( a thousand a month ) , car payments ( three hundred and fifty ) , levies for supplies at the girls ’ public high school , fuel , electricity , stomach medicine , and a hundred dollars ’ worth of groceries each week ( down from eight bags to four at Kroger ’s supermarket , because of inflation ) there was basically nothing left to spend .
She could cut corners — go out for a McDonald ’s Dollar Meal instead of spending seven dollars on a bag of potatoes and cooking at home .
But that meant the end of any kind of family life for her nieces .
“ These days , you have to struggle , ” she said .
“ As a kid , I used to be able to go to the movies or to the zoo .
Now you ca n’t take your children to the zoo or go to the movies , because you ’ve got to think how you ’re going to put food on the table . ”
Snodgrass ’s parents had raised four children on two modest incomes , without the ceaseless stress that she was enduring .
But the two - parent family was now available only to the “ very privileged . ”
She said that she had ten good friends ; eight of them were childless or , like her , unmarried with kids .
“ That ’s who ’s middle - class now , ” she said .
“ Two parents , two kids ?
That ’s over .
People looked out for me .
These kids nowadays do n’t have nobody to look out for them .
You ’re one week away from ( a ) losing your job , or ( b ) not having a paycheck . ”
Snodgrass , who has always voted Democratic , was paying close attention to the Presidential campaign — she had taped both candidates ’
Convention speeches , and watched them when she had time — but her faith in politicians was somewhere close to zero .
She wanted a leader who would watch out for people in the “ middle class , ” people like her who had no one on their side .
“ I think McCain is going to be just like Bush the next eight years , ” she said .
“ I do n’t see how it ’s going to change . ”
To her , Sarah Palin , a working mother close to her own age , felt more like a token choice than like a kindred spirit .
“ I think McCain picked her so women can relate to her , not because she ’s the best person for the job , ” Snodgrass said .
“ She ’s more of a show for the American family . ”
Hillary Clinton had been better , but even she could n’t fully apprehend Barbie Snodgrass ’s predicament .
She remained uninspired by Barack Obama .
His Convention speech had gone into detail about his policy proposals on matters like the economy and health care , which seemed tailored to attract a voter like Snodgrass , but they filled her with suspicion .
His promise to rescind the Bush tax cuts for wealthier Americans struck her as incredible : “ How many people do you know who make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ?
What is that , five per cent of the United States ?
That ’s a joke !
If he starts at a hundred thousand , I might listen .
Two hundred fifty — that ’s to me like people who hit the lottery . ”
In fact , only two per cent of Americans make more than a quarter of a million dollars a year , but that group earns twelve per cent of the national income .
Nonetheless , the circumstances of Snodgrass ’s life made it impossible for her to imagine that there could possibly be enough taxable money in Obama ’s upper - income category — which meant that he was being dishonest , and that she would eventually be the one to pay .
“ He ’ll keep going down , and when it ’s to people who make forty - five or fifty thousand it ’s going to hit me , ” she said .
“ I ’d have to sell my home and live in a five - hundred - dollar - a - month apartment with gang bangers out in my yard , and I ’d be scared to death to leave my house . ”
Snodgrass reacted with equal skepticism to Obama ’s proposal for expanding health care .
“ It scares the heck out of me , ” she said .
“ If the employers are going to cover more , we ’re going to get less in our raises .
My raise every year is like a cost - of - living raise .
How are they going to be able to give me more money ? ”
The margin of error in her life was so slim , she felt , that any attempt to improve lives with ambitious new programs could only end up harming her .
Obama ’s idealistic language left Snodgrass cold .
“ He ’s not saying to me how he ’s going to make my life better , ” she said .
She wanted to hear exactly how the next President was going to remove some of the tremendous financial weight bearing down on her — reduce gas prices , cut the cost of medicine — not in the distant future but right away .
A friend of hers who worked three jobs refused to support Obama on the theory that he was a Muslim , but Snodgrass said that it did n’t matter to her what race or religion the next President was , nor did the ugly tactics of the campaign have any effect other than to disgust her .
What mattered was “ your daily life , your daily day , job , family , what you do that keeps you from robbing the video store down the street . ”
Snodgrass sat talking for much longer than she had initially offered ; by the end , her words tumbled out in a plaintive rush , as if under some inner pressure .
“ You want somebody there who ’s going to take care of us , ” she said .
“ I ’m very scared about who they put in there , because it ’s either going to get a lot worse than it is or it ’s going to keep going where it is , which is bad . ”
She almost gasped .
“ Just give us a break .
There ’s no reprieve .
No reprieve . ”
Until the mid-seventies , the white working class — the heart of the New Deal coalition — voted largely Democratic .
Since the Carter years , the percentages have declined from sixty to forty , and this shift has roughly coincided with the long hold of the Republican Party on the White House .
The white working class — a group that often speaks of itself , and is spoken of , as forgotten , marginalized , even despised — is the golden key to political power in America , and it voted overwhelmingly for George W. Bush twice , by seventeen per cent in 2000 and twenty - three per cent in 2004 .
Thomas Frank ’s 2004 book “ What ’s the Matter with Kansas ? ” directed its indignation at the baffling phenomenon of millions of Americans voting year after year against their economic self - interest .
He concluded that the Republican Party had tricked working people with a relentless propaganda campaign based on religion and morality , while Democrats had abandoned these voters to their economic masters by moving to the soft center of the political spectrum .
Frank ’s book remains the leading polemic about the white reaction — the title alone has , for many liberals , become shorthand for the conventional wisdom — but it is hobbled by the condescending argument that tens of millions of Americans have become victims of a “ carefully cultivated derangement , ” or are simply stupid .
Last year , four sociologists at the University of Arizona , led by Lane Kenworthy , released a paper that complicates Frank ’s thesis .
Their study followed the voting behavior of the forty - five per cent of white Americans who identify themselves as working class .
Mining electoral data from the General Social Survey , they found that the decline in white working - class support for Democrats occurred in one period — from the mid-seventies until the early nineties , with a brief lull in the early eighties — and has remained well below fifty per cent ever since .
But they concluded that social issues like abortion , guns , religion , and even ( outside the South ) race had little to do with the shift .
Instead , according to their data , it was based on a judgment that — during years in which industrial jobs went overseas , unions practically vanished , and working - class incomes stagnated — the Democratic Party was no longer much help to them .
“ Beginning in the mid -to - late 1970s , there was increasing reason for working - class whites to question whether the Democrats were still better than the Republicans at promoting their material well - being , ” the study ’s authors write .
Working - class whites , their fortunes falling , began to embrace the anti-government , low - tax rhetoric of the conservative movement .
During Clinton ’s Presidency , the downward economic spiral of these Americans was arrested , but by then their identification with the Democrats had eroded .
Having earlier moved to the right for economic reasons , the Arizona study concluded , the working class stayed there because of the rising prominence of social issues —
Thomas Frank ’s argument .
But the Democrats fundamentally lost the white working class because these voters no longer believed the Party ’s central tenet — that government could restore a sense of economic security .

Such a change in party allegiance across a vast section of the electorate takes decades to achieve , and to undo .
But this year should mark the beginning of a reverse migration .
When will the class war ever finally drown out the culture war , if not in 2008 ?
Under Republican rule in Washington , wages have stayed flat while income inequality has increased ; the numbers of uninsured have soared ; unemployment recently passed six per cent , its highest level since the early nineteen - nineties ; gas and heating - oil prices have doubled , while basic food prices have gone up by fifty per cent ; and the country ’s financial system has come closer to collapse than at any moment since 1929 .
More profoundly , Republican dogma no longer offers convincing solutions , and in some cases it does n’t even acknowledge the problems .
( Income inequality has long been considered a nonissue in conservative free - market circles . )
The question that Ronald Reagan asked voters to such devastating effect in 1980 , when the white working class began turning away from Democrats —
“ Are you better off than you were four years ago ? ” — should , in theory , produce an equal and opposite effect this year .
This is particularly true in big , aging , economically battered swing states like Michigan , where unemployment is nearly nine per cent , and Ohio , where residents told me that a whole generation of young people is leaving the state to seek higher education and work elsewhere .
A man in Brown County , along the Ohio River , in the southwestern part of the state , said that a year ago there was one foreclosure notice in the local paper each week ; now the number is six or eight , and the listings for the week of September 12th announced fifty - three foreclosure sales in a county with only fifteen thousand households .
In the town of Wilmington , outside Dayton , a D.H.L. facility with eight thousand workers — a third of the area ’s population — is likely to close .
On September 9th , the day I flew into Cincinnati , a woman named Marla Bell , attending an Obama rally near Dayton , told National Public Radio , “ It almost feels like it ’s a dying state . ”
The next day , Governor Ted Strickland , a Democrat who remains popular in Ohio , announced a budget shortfall that would require painful spending cuts across the board .
The state ’s budget director , Pari Sabety , told me , “ There are a lot more part - time jobs , jobs without benefits , jobs that require a broader social safety net than we currently have .
We are not creating high - value jobs at a rate that can absorb people who are losing high - value jobs of the old economy . ”
The economic crisis , she went on , is so grave that it has created room for a renewed discussion about the role of government in people ’s lives .
“ Here ’s the opportunity before us .
What ’s happening is a slow - motion Katrina to economies like ours .
I feel like we are where F.D.R. was . ”
Obama has had particular trouble with the prized demographic group that once delivered the Presidency to Roosevelt and his successors .
Anecdotally , and in polls , unusually large numbers of working - class voters seem to remain undecided or determined to sit the election out , as if they could n’t bring themselves to vote Republican this year but could n’t fathom taking a chance on Obama .
Roger Catt , a retired farmer and warehouse worker , who lives in a small town near Eau Claire , Wisconsin , characterized the choice this way : “ McCain is more of the same , and Obama is the end of life as we know it . ”
Gloria Fauss , the longtime political director in Ohio for the Service Employees International Union , or S.E.I.U. , which backs Obama , said , “ I ’m very worried .
The conventional wisdom is that the economy will trump this year .
I ’m not so sure .
The economy may override social issues this year and people still might not vote for Obama . ”
Fauss has spent years studying the results of polls and focus groups among Ohio voters , and she has learned that judgments about character and values can be decisive even among those who rate jobs and health care as more important than abortion .
“ You ca n’t make the assumption that because people are suffering economically and the last eight years have been downhill and things are very bleak for them — you ca n’t make the assumption they ’ll vote Democratic .
There ’s just no basis for that . ”

A picture is worth a thousand words :

From Architecture2030 :
According to the US Energy Information Administration , oil production from drilling offshore in the outer continental shelf would n’t begin until around the year 2017 .
Once begun , it would n’t reach peak production until about 2030 when it would produce only 200,000 barrels of oil per day ( in yellow above ) .
This would supply a meager 1.2 % of total US annual oil consumption ( just 0.6 % of total US energy consumption ) .
And , the offshore oil would be sold back to the US at the international rate , which today is $ 106 a barrel .
So , the oil produced by offshore drilling would not only be a “ drop in the bucket ” , it would be expensive , which translates to “ no relief at the pump ” .

Kevlar is great stuff .
It 's strong , lightweight and fire resistant , making it an ideal material for suits worn by firefighters , police and other emergency workers .
It is used in everything from tires to body armor .
Now researchers plan to add germ - fighting to the list of Kevlar 's virtues .
At University of South Dakota , Yuyu Sun and Jie Luo have developed a new method to coat Kevlar with a substance called acyclic N - Halamine .
They tested it against E. coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Candida tropicalis ( a fungus ) , MS2 virus , and Bacillus subtilis spores ( to mimic anthrax ) .
After a short time , large amounts of microorganisms stuck to untreated fabric samples , but the coated fabrics showed little to no adherence of the infectious agents .
The coating is long - lasting and can be reactivated if needed , the scientist will report in the Aug. 6 issue of the American Chemical Society 's journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research .
" The resultant fabric materials provided potent , durable , and rechargeable biocidal activities , " the researchers write .
" The excellent thermal and mechanical properties of the original Kevlar fabrics were successfully retained after the coating treatment . "
The PMAA - based coating , as it's called , is said to have antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral , and antispore functions .
" Although more studies are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of the coated Kevlar fabrics , " the researchers write , " these findings point to the great potential of the PMAA - based coating approach for a broad range of real applications .

Is the Internet More Vital Than Water ?
Not for everyone , of course — Brock Lesnar , for instance , does n’t go near the Internet .
But as mobile browsing is fast becoming a reality , I love watching how people use the Internet to shape their lives in ways large and small .
Here are a pair of interesting examples .
Granted , both of these fall into the “ small ” category :
1 . A web site called Better Than the Van , which is building a community of free places to stay for touring bands .
The idea is that music fans can offer up their homes as crash pads .
As someone who used to drive around the country in a van playing clubs with my band , worried about having enough gas money to make it to the next town — when gas was a bit cheaper than now — I was always very happy to find a free place to stay instead of a Motel 6 or Cricket Inn .
( Unfortunately , the free places were often even grodier than the motels . )
2 . A site called Get Drunk Cheap , founded by three Univ. of Michigan engineering students , which “ compiles beer prices from the campus area of Ann Arbor to help you find the best deals in town ! ”
Here ’s more from Hani , one of the students :
We currently have about eight stores and their prices and will have close to 20 total within two weeks before school starts .
We started the site because we realized a significant amount of college students drink and at the same time like to save money .
If [ we ’re ] successful , our goal is to expand to other campuses .
We are also going to talk to local bars and beer stores to see if they would like to advertise on our site .
There may well be significant overlap between the users of these two sites .
They have a couple of other things in common too : they both encourage more miles driven at a time when overall miles are falling ; and they might also lead to the sort of trouble that gives liability lawyers a lot of business .
But a little bit of risk is what makes the world exciting , no ?
Denver , Colorado , September 6 , 2019 –
In a significant victory for communities in Colorado and the climate justice movement , federal judge William J. Martínez ruled last night that the climate lawsuit against Suncor Energy and Exxon Mobil will be decided in Colorado state court , rather than federal courts .
EarthRights International , the Niskanen Center , and Denver attorney Kevin Hannon represent Boulder County , San Miguel County , and the City of Boulder in the case against the companies for their role in causing and exacerbating the climate crisis in Colorado .
Fifteen local and state governments around the country have filed lawsuits against the oil and gas industry for the climate damages caused by fossil fuels .
The companies have tried to move the cases to federal court as part of a strategy to avoid liability .
With the Colorado decision , four out of five federal courts have now rejected this industry gambit , ruling that the cases belong in state court .
The case is expected to immediately move forward in Boulder County District Court .
Decisions returning cases to state court are ordinarily not appealable .
The decision highlighted the oil companies ’ mischaracterizations of the plaintiffs ’ claims , which are about paying for the costs of climate harms , not controlling emissions or regulating the industry .
It also noted that Exxon ’s current arguments were contrary to positions it had taken in a previous climate case brought by an Alaska native community .
The ruling comes on the heels of a recent and powerful victory for states and local governments against opioid manufacturers , involving similar claims , similar types of damage , and similar types of conduct by industry .
Boulder County , San Miguel County , and the City of Boulder sued Suncor and Exxon in April 2018 for the costs that they face due to climate harms .
Colorado is one of the fastest - warming U.S. states , and these communities continue to experience problems associated with rising temperatures , including more frequent and destructive wildfires , droughts , and heatwaves ; a reduced snowpack ; degraded air quality ; and more .
Over the next three decades , these communities are expected to face costs reaching hundreds of millions of dollars or more to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change .
Statements :
“ This is a significant victory for our clients , confirming that their claims should be heard in Colorado courts under Colorado law .
These local governments are doing what they can to address the climate crisis , while Exxon and Suncor have acted and continue to act recklessly .
These companies knew of the damages that fossil fuels inflict on the environment and communities , but chose not to come clean . ”
– Marco Simons , General Counsel , EarthRights International
“ Defendants threw in the kitchen sink to try and get this case in federal court , arguing seven different bases for federal jurisdiction .
The court recognized defendants ’ arguments for what they were – an attempt to find a more favorable forum by confusing the issues , and ultimately to avoid having to answer for their behavior .
We are pleased that the court saw through this effort . ”
– David Bookbinder , Chief Counsel , Niskanen Center
“ Colorado communities and local businesses and industries are suffering from the economic , health , and safety consequences of the climate crisis .
Adapting to these impacts requires significant planning and spending by local governments .
It ’s unjust for these costs to fall on Colorado residents .
Exxon and Suncor , who profited from their reckless actions , need to step up and pay their fair share rather than footing Colorado taxpayers with the bill . ”
– Boulder Board of County Commissioners
“ The climate crisis is now directly impacting the health and lives of people in our communities , our ecosystems , and our economy .
Local governments face the increasing burden of addressing mitigation actions and direct impacts to our public health and safety , roads and infrastructure , and in our case the uncertain future of our ski area–our main economic driver .
It is unacceptable to allow fossil fuel companies to continue to benefit from massive profits , while our taxpayers face increasing costs directly attributable to the actions of these corporations .
We are hopeful that these companies will either join us in seeking solutions or be forced to by the Colorado Court system . ” –San Miguel County Commissioner Hillary Cooper .

NASA this week awarded Lockheed Martin a $ 485 million contract to design , build and operate the spacecraft for NASA 's 2013 space mission known as Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN ( MAVEN ) program .
Maven is set to analyze the upper atmosphere and climate changes on Mars .
The spacecraft will circle Mars in an elliptical orbit as it studies current atmospheric losses with an emphasis on the role of the solar wind .
These present - day losses will give insight to the massive climate change Mars experienced in the past , NASA said .
After arriving at Mars in the fall of 2014 , MAVEN will use its propulsion system to bring the ship into an orbit ranging 90 to 3,870 miles above the planet , NASA said .
The spacecraft 's eight science instruments will take measurements during a full Earth year , which is roughly equivalent to half of a Martian year .
MAVEN also will drop to an altitude 80 miles above the planet to sample Mars ' entire upper atmosphere .
During and after its primary science mission , the spacecraft may be used to provide communications relay support for robotic missions on the Martian surface , NASA said .
The mission 's leader is Bruce Jakosky of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder which will get $ 6 million to fund mission planning and technology development during the next year , according to NASA .
The spacecraft is based on the designs of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) and 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft - both designed and built by Lockheed Martin .
MRO was launched in August 2005 and Odyssey was launched in April 2001 .
Both spacecraft are still performing science operations as they orbit the planet .
Lockheed Martin also conducts flight operations for both missions for NASA .
MAVEN is the second mission in NASA 's Mars Scout Program - a series of small , low - cost , principal investigator - led missions to the Red Planet , NASA said .
The Phoenix Mars Lander was the first mission under the program .
Lockheed Martin is the industry partner on the Phoenix mission .
It designed and built the spacecraft , and also provided flight operations and currently surface operations for the lander .
The mission has been extended through Sept. 30 , 2008 .

Stop the Imminent Execution of Troy Davis
Please up this and get the information out as far and wide as possible .
Take action .
This is so not right !
___
Troy Davis is scheduled to be executed by the state of Georgia on October 27 , even though his serious claims of innocence have never been heard in court .
Take action right now to stop this execution !
http://www.amnestyusa.org/troydavis
Troy Davis was convicted of murder solely on the basis of witness testimony , and seven of the nine non-police witnesses have since recanted or changed their testimony , several citing police coercion .
Others have signed affidavits implicating one of the remaining two witnesses as the actual killer .
But due to an increasingly restrictive appeals process , none of this new evidence has ever been heard in court .
Take action and then forward this action to ten friends !
On October 14 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Davis ' appeal .
This decision means that no court of law will ever hold a hearing on the witnesses who have recanted their trial testimony .
An execution under such a cloud of doubt would undermine public confidence in the state 's criminal justice system and would be a grave miscarriage of justice .
Take action for Troy Davis .
Troy Davis was sentenced to death despite a tainted case and serious claims of innocence .
© Georgia Department of Corrections
The Georgia Board of Pardon and Paroles refused to grant Troy Davis clemency last month , yet they have the power to reverse their decision at any time .
Urge the Board to do the responsible thing and grant clemency to Troy Davis !
In solidarity ,

You can use something called the Mirror App
It 's actually really simple .
Not many people actually know this but screens are actually made of mirrors and PC boards with a little bit of wires and string .
You need to get a screw driver set and peel off the adhesive rubber screw protectors around the screen , they should reveal screws , remove the screws and you should be able simple just remove the screen front cover .
This will reveal a lot of PC boards and the display unit , there will be screws around the display unit , all you need to do is remove those screw , lean the display unit at an angle and disconnect any wires attached to it .
You need a mirror approximately the same size as the display unit that you just removed .
Now you need to take your hot glue gun ( silicon works just as well , but get the most expensive one as that ensures high quality adhesion and you do n't want the wires to come off once all the screws are back in . ) , for each wire , place a blob of glue on the back of the mirror , carefully attach each wire to the glue , it does not matter what gets placed where , if there is a plug attached to the end of the wire then just pull it off .
You need to be very careful , as there are no screw holes for the mirror , you just need to use your hot glue or silicon to stick the mirror back in place , once you have done this , place the front cover back and all it 's screws .
You can throw away all left over screws , plugs and the display unit you removed .
Congratulations you have successfully installed the mirror app .
" Real men have fabs . "
— Jerry Sanders , former AMD CEO .
Designing microprocessors is like playing Russian roulette .
You put a gun to your head , pull the trigger , and find out four years later if you blew your brains out .
— Often attributed to AMD board member and former Digital CEO Robert Palmer .
AMD has kept investors and enthusiasts wondering about its Asset Lite Asset Smart strategy since the company first announced its existence , but has finally seen fit to lift the veil of secrecy and discuss the plan in more detail .
AMD intends to split itself into two companies , with one focused on CPU and GPU design and the other on manufacturing .
The design side of the company will keep the AMD moniker and brand ; AMD is currently referring to the foundry side simply as The Foundry Company .
For the purposes of this article , I 'll refer to the two companies as AMD Design and AMD Foundry .
The basics of the money trail and the asset transfers / investments are laid out below .
The basic structure and financing of the new companies .
AMD not only unloads debt , it picks up an additional $ 1 billion in cash
The ATIC ( Advanced Technology Investment Company ) is wholly owned by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ; the company describes itself as : " focused on making significant investments in the advanced technology sector , both locally and internationally .
Its mandate is to generate returns that deliver long ? term benefits to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ...
ATIC seeks to leverage the unique advantages it enjoys as an investor from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to identify and realize long ?
term investment opportunities in the highly competitive and capital ?
intensive advanced technology sector . "
ATIC will invest $ 1.4 billion directly into AMD Foundry , and will pay $ 700 million to AMD for a 55.6 percent stake in the company .
This makes AMD a minority owner in its own spin-off , but the structure of the deal invests Sunnyvale with equal voting rights .
Enter Mubadala , stage right .
The Arabian company , also owned by Abu Dhabi , will increase its stake in AMD from 8.1 percent to 19.3 percent , and will pay AMD ( aka AMD Design ) $ 300 million in exchange for 58 million stock options and 30 million warrants .
As for AMD Foundry , AMD intends to transfer people , manufacturing assets , Fab 36 debt , and " some " intellectual property to the company ; total capital investment from AMD into AMD Foundry is estimated at $ 2.1 billion .
The newly formed foundry will continue the conversion of Fab 30 /38 , and plans to break ground on the planned New York fabrication plant that was first announced in 2006 .
The big picture
The split is n't a done deal yet , as it must still pass muster with both the government and the company 's stock holders , but AMD believes this is the best — possibly the only — way to remain even marginally competitive with Intel .
Despite the current performance gap between Intel and AMD products , AMD 's foundries are still some of the most advanced in the world .
Even so , Sunnyvale has consistently lagged Santa Clara when it comes to transitioning to new process nodes ; the two companies have n't transitioned at the same time since both moved to 0.18 micron back in 1999 .
The graphs below — included as part of AMD 's presentation ( PDF ) on the deal ( PDF ) — explain the company 's problem quite clearly .
The trend lines on these graphs apply to Intel just as much as AMD , but Santa Clara has the funds and market position to bear the cost of design , R&D , and manufacturing in - house , while AMD does n't .
In a sense , AMD is actually behind the curve — most other semiconductor manufacturers saw the writing on the wall long ago and sold their manufacturing assets to pure - play foundries like TSMC or UMC .
AMD expects its side of the company — AMD Design , as I 'm calling it here — to receive some $ 1 billion in total additional investments , rid itself of ~ $ 1.2 billion in debt , and substantially reduce its capital expenditures .
The company 's relationship and technology - sharing program with IBM remains in effect , and the entire deal was obviously structured in a way that allows AMD to continue to design and manufacture x86 processors under the terms of its licensing agreement with Intel .
One final note on the cost - per - node chart as shown above .
One of AMD 's arguments in its ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Intel is that Intel 's past actions in the 2002 - 2006 timeframe substantially damaged AMD 's ability to invest in future technology , ramp up production , and remain competitive .
Whether you agree or disagree with AMD 's lawsuit , the data presented here demonstrates why most other semiconductor design firms left the foundry business long ago — and how AMD 's ability to generate revenue in past years directly impacts the state of its technology today .
When Jerry Sanders said " Real men have fabs , " the math behind that statement was extraordinarily different than it is today .
Given the cost of ramping production at 32nm , 22nm , and 12nm process nodes , spinning off the foundry business and backing it with Arabian oil money makes a good deal of sense , and could significantly help AMD 's plans to return to profitability .

Quite a few people believed this will never happen but after many years of development Xerces - C++ 3.0.0 is finally out .
This major release includes a large number of new features , bug fixes , and clean - ups .
It also happens to break a few interfaces ( especially in DOM ) so application adjustments may be required .
For the complete list of changes in this version refer to the official announcement on the project ’s mailing lists .
In this post I am going to cover some of the major improvements in more detail .
As with 2.8.0 , this release comes with a wide range of precompiled libraries ( total 17 ) for various CPU architectures , operating systems , and C++ compilers .
For most platforms 32 - bit and 64 - bit variants are provided .
Note also that while the libraries are built using specific C++ compiler versions , most of them will also work with newer versions of the same compilers .
For example , libraries built with GCC 3.4.x will also work with GCC 4.x.y .
Similarly , libraries built with Sun C++ 5.7 ( Studio 10 ) will work with Sun C++ 5.8 .
The first thing GNU / Linux , UNIX , and Mac OS X users will notice is the new , automake - based build system for these platforms .
There is no more XERCESCROOT or runConfigure and all the standard configure options are supported .
There is also a number of options specific to Xerces - C++ which can all be viewed by executing configure -- help .
For Windows users the distribution comes with VC ++ project files .
In this release a set for VC ++ 9.0 ( 2008 ) was added .
Additionally , project files for VC ++ 7.1 , 8.0 , and 9.0 now include targets to build Xerces - C++ with the ICU library as a character transcoder .
Other infrastructure work includes the removal of deprecated components ( DepDOM , COM ) as well as project files for unmaintained compilers .
The documentation was cleaned - up and split into the website and library categories with the Xerces - C++ distributions now only including the library documentation ( build instructions , programming guides , etc ) .
Overall , I believe all of this will get the Xerces - C++ project back on the regular release track with the next release ( 3.1.0 ) in about a year .
Now to the new functionality in the library itself .
The Xerces - C++ component that got the most work in this release is probably XML Schema .
It includes a large number of bug fixes and errata changes .
In particular the long - standing bug that resulted in long execution times and stack overflows on schemas with large minOccurs and maxOccurs values has been fixed .
Also the new interpretation of the ##other namespace designator has been implemented .
Related but not limited to XML Schema is the work done to review and clean - up all the diagnostics messages issued by Xerces - C++.
They were all clarified and now consistently start with a lower - case letter and do not include a period at the end .
Prior to the 3.0.0 release Xerces - C++ included the draft DOM XPath 1 interfaces that were barely usable and required a lot of casting to the implementation when used with XPath 2 processors such as XQilla .
In 3.0.0 , the DOM XPath interfaces were extended to support both XPath 1 and XPath 2 data models .
As a result , the application can now depend only on interfaces .
The 2.2.0 release of XQilla , due in a few weeks , will include support for Xerces - C++ 3.0.0 .
Furthermore , the 3.0.0 release implements the XML Schema subset of XPath 1 in DOM .
This allows you to execute basic XPath queries without requiring a separate XPath processor library .
Another major change in Xerces - C++ 3.0.0 is the porting of all public interfaces and a major part of the implementation to use 64 - bit safe types .
This means that if you design your application to be 64 - bit safe ( e.g. , use std : : size_t for indexes , lengths , etc. ) , then you do n’t need to perform any casts when interfacing with Xerces - C ++.
Finally , a number performance - critical parts were optimized for speed in this release .
This resulted , for example , in both DOM parsing and XML Schema validation showing about 25% - 30 % improvement compared to 2.8.0 .
When I first started working on the 3.0.0 code base it was in quite a mess with the automake - based build system still unfinished and having most of the source code 64 - bit ignorant .
At that point I decided that we will need to maintain both 2.8.0 and 3.0.0 in parallel in case the 3.0.0 release happens to be a disaster .
This is why the Xerces - C++ project website now includes two sections , one for 2.8.0 and one for 3.0.0 .
As a release manager , my primary goals for Xerces - C++ 3.0.0 became to make it cleaner , easier to build , better tested , as well as to provide better XML Schema support .
Two betas later and I think 3.0.0 came out to be a very solid release , better than 2.8.0 in every aspect and , in retrospect , making that website split probably unnecessary .
In fact , we were confident enough to build all our XSD 3.2.0 binary distributions with Xerces - C++ 3.0.0 .
Yesterday , I got a call from a friend in Ljubljana , asking if my family and I were OK , and if we still had food and shelter .
He sounded sure I had already lost my job , and offered to help .
At first I did not understand what he was talking about : for the most part , life goes on as normal here in Iceland – but finally I realised he had been reading the British media .
The British prime minister has repeatedly said that Iceland , as a country , even as a nation , is going bankrupt , that our government has defaulted on its legal obligation , that we are virtually doomed – falling into an economic abyss .
Neither is true .
We have never denied our legal obligation regarding the Icesave accounts , and the people of Iceland are not going bust .
Ask yourself : would you lend £ 100 m , as Chancellor Darling has just announced he will , to a bankrupt ?
Our currency might be in trouble and that hits us hard , our pay has been significantly devalued by rising costs , our stock exchange is still closed – but the foundations are still stable – no thanks to Gordon Brown and his menacing rhetoric of last week .
And despite what is written in the London tabloids , we still go to work every day , receive our salaries , pay our bills and gather in the pub in the evenings .
Today , Icelandic officials are in Moscow talking to the Russians who have offered a helping hand .
The IMF is involved and many other measures are being taken – including , now , the Bank of England loan to Landsbanki .
Let 's look at some facts , shall we ?
The high - flying , globetrotting business elite that came out of Iceland and started spreading borrowed money all over the UK and Europe has very little to do with the ordinary working public in Iceland .
However , for some peculiar reason , the UK media thinks it is all our fault .
It seems to me that you have fallen for a cruel and calculated PR stunt by Brown , whose only mission with his destructive attack on the Icelandic public was to save his miserable political life for another day .
For that , the people of Iceland are paying severely .
Yes , of course , we are angry .
We are angry towards these reckless business tycoons for gambling with our good name , the most precious asset a small nation can have .
But ordinary Icelanders are no more responsible for the risk - seeking businessmen who happen to hold our passport than the people of north London are responsible for the destructive behaviour of the talented Amy Winehouse .
And even though most of us still enjoy most things British , we are furious with the UK government .
In fact , when Brown used anti-terrorist legislation to bully Iceland 's largest private firm , Kaupthing bank , into the ground , he almost made us forgive our own government , which failed to act when the troubles started to rise on the horizon .
When the Republic of Iceland ran into the greatest troubles in its young life ( it gained independence in 1944 ) and asked for help , none of our so - called friends stood up .
The people of Iceland are paralysed by the lack of help and the destructive attack by the British PM .
Iceland is an active participant in European cooperation and a founding member of Nato , but in the end , it seems Russia is Iceland 's only friend .
Brown 's insult to Iceland will be remembered long after this £ 100 m debt has been repaid .
One entrance to The San Diego Union - Tribune was closed Wednesday after a large envelope that authorities say contained a powdery substance labeled " anthrax " was opened in the newsroom .
Officials at the Sacramento NBC affiliate KCRA - TV claimed they also received a similar envelope .
San Diego City Fire Department spokesman Maurice Luque said a hazardous materials team examined the package that was opened by a news assistant .
Investigators determined the package did not contain any threat .
No one was evacuated or hurt .
Luque said the powdery substance was attached to a CD containing a picture of former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
Also inside was a small packet , like a sugar packet .
Luque said the word anthrax was scribbled inside .
Members of a hazardous materials team , all wearing full protective suits , went into the building to test the package .
The Associated Press office in San Diego is in the building .
Investigators said many of the mailings had the same fictitious Sacramento return address .
So far , all of the powder in the packages has tested negative , said FBI agent Darrell Foxworth in San Diego .
Investigators would n't say what was on the CD .
Foxworth said officials do n't know who is sending the packages .
The packages the agency has identified so far were sent to the Union - Tribune , the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina , two Sacramento television stations and the office of Rep. George Radanovich in Modesto , said FBI agent Steve Dupre in Sacramento .
KCRA reported that the package containing white powder that arrived there was 10 - by - 6 - inches .
The powder packet was taped across the hole in the middle of the Powell CD and had a typewritten placard reading " ANTHRAX Shock & Awe Terror " pasted to the packet .
Anthrax mailed to congressional offices and others in 2001 killed five people and sickened 17 .

The open - source implementation of Microsoft's .NET is due to hit its second release today , with many .
NET 3.5 features and a few notable exceptions .
Mono 2.0 will be announced today a year and a half later than expected but - thanks to that delay - it features an open - source version of C# 3.0 and Language Integrated Query ( LINQ ) .
Mono lets you build and run .
NET - style desktop and server applications on Linux , OS X and Solaris in addition to Windows .
Project leader Miguel de Icaza told The Reg it was delays on Mono 2.0 that gave people the opportunity to begin working on C# 3.0 and putting in the completely new LINQ , for language - level integration with SQL to simplify programmatic access to data sources .
Mono 2.0 , though , is missing Microsoft 's latest work in web services around workflow , communications and presentation as these would have pushed out Mono 2.0 even further .
de Icaza said early work has at least begun on the Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF ) , and a completed version will be in Mono 3.0 , which he penciled in for mid 2010 .
Windows Workflow Foundation ( WF ) and Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) look less likely to appear in Mono 3.0 , at this stage .
de Icaza said he 's tempted by WF but it would require a lot of work and shifting of priorities .
There 's no Mono WF work underway .
As for WPF , de Icaza said he 's seen very little uptake in developer circles .
" It would detract us from more important things like ASP.
NET , " he said .
de Icaza said Mono 's in good shape and was worth the wait .
The delay cropped up as the team worked on Windows Forms .
It was during this time people began working on the open - source versions of C# 3.0 and LINQ , which means Mono 2.0 is closer to the latest version of Microsoft's .
NET Framework - 3.5 - than it would have otherwise been .
" What 's nice about LINQ is they integrate SQL into the language - that 's what 's exciting .
A lot of people are now using LINQ on Linux , " he said .
The next version of Mono 's integrated development environment - 2.0 - will support LINQ and C# 3.0 .
There 's no date yet on the IDE .
Separately , de Icaza said the first version of Moonlight , the open - source implementation of Microsoft 's Silverlight media player and browser plug - in , should be out in the next few weeks - before November .
Moonlight 1.0 , which is currently frozen , will map to Silverlight 1.0 , not 2.0 expected later this month . ®
I think this series of articles is starting to pay off …
A few people are using my first article to learn how to set up a new Pinax website .
And also , I am getting feedback on how to do things better .
On the pinax - users list , Bob Haugen pointed out that I was not following the recommended setup , because I was creating my new website inside Pinax ’s project directory .
There was no real harm , but he was right .
I updated my instructions so Pinax and the custom website are in separate directories .
As I wrote on the user list :
Let me explain my motives .
I use Subversion daily and I ’m comfortable
with it .
I knew that just copying the directory would give me lots of
trouble when I decided to update Pinax .
So the “ export ” idea was
natural .
I just exported it alongside the sample project because I was just
starting to learn Pinax and did n’t want to mess too much with the
structure because I did n’t know about its dependencies .
I had read the
customization doc , but it was not so clear to me at first sight .
But the official doc is right .
I think we should consider Pinax more
like a library , like Django itself , that should be installed and
updated on its own , and the website we build should be a separate
project , with its own version control .
So it should be natural to put
Pinax where we store random software ( I used ~ / opt ) and our website
where we put things we ’re working on or software we deploy ( I used
~/ Projects ) .
I ’m very grateful for the feedback and I hope this humble series may be helpful .
Cheers !
MSNBC and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency ( JTA ) are reporting that Gov. Palin met this afternoon with the board of directors of the America Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) and Sen .
Joe Lieberman to , in the words of one McCain campaign official cited by MSNBC , put â€ œthe American Jewish community at ease over her understanding of US - Middle East relations.â€
Itâ€™s worth noting that Palin , who has obviously been completely off - limits to reporters since she was rolled out as McCainâ€™s running - mate in Dayton Friday , stiffed a reception in her honor sponsored by none other than Phyllis Schlafly a couple hours later .
( One wonders what other lobbies have tried to arrange a meeting with Palin in the last 96 hours and with what success . )
â€ œWe had a good productive discussion on the importance of the U.S. - Israel relationship , and we were pleased that Gov. Palin expressed her deep , personal , and lifelong commitment to the safety and well - being of Israel , â€ AIPAC spokesman Josh Block said after the meeting .
â€ œLike Sen. McCain , the vice presidential nominee understands and believes in the special friendship between the two democracies and would work to expand and deepen the strategic partnership in a McCain / Palin Administration.â€ 
â€ œShe was extremely well received , â€ McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb said , noting that Palin was interrupted by applause twice , â€ according to the JTA account .
He added that Palin spoke about â€ œthe relationship between Israel and American national security , and the threats to Israel from Iran and others.â€ 
Evidence of nervousness in the McCain campaign about Palinâ€™s impact on Jewish voters and donors was made clear when the Likudist Republican Jewish Coalition circulated a video of her Alaska office in which it found a small Israeli flag , in the words of Politico , â€œpoking out from behind a drape.â€ 
â€ œI think it speaks volumes that she keeps an Israeli flag on the wall of her office , â€ RJCâ€™s executive director , Matt Brooks , told Politico in an e-mail .
â€œIt clearly shows whatâ€™s in her heart .â€ Politicoâ€™s analysis is well worth reading .
As I noted Friday , a Nexis search of the two years previous to her selection as McCainâ€™s running - mate failed to find a single published article in which Palin ever mentioned Israel .
I suspect it may make it into her acceptance speech Wednesday night .
It 's mid-afternoon at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal and long rows of commercial trucks are waiting to drive aboard the MV Caribou , their trailers packed with all the things the Province of Newfoundland & Labrador needs from the rest of North America : groceries , automobile parts , medical supplies , plywood .
But getting anything or anybody on or off the island of Newfoundland – where 95 percent of the province 's half million residents live – has become alarmingly expensive .
Sky - high fuel prices have triggered one fuel surcharge after another – a cumulative 27.7 percent since July 2007 – on the ferries that serve as the province 's lifeline to the rest of the world .
Provincial authorities are angry , with Newfoundland Transport Minister Diane Whalen calling the surcharges " outrageous . "
" It 's getting harder and harder for many manufacturers to justify sending their products to Newfoundland just because of ferry costs , " says Peter Nelson , executive director of the Atlantic Provinces Trucking Association in Dieppe , New Brunswick .
" If things keep going this way we 'll soon see the $ 8 head of lettuce in Newfoundland . "
In this part of the world , ferries have long been regarded as essential infrastructure , extensions of the railroads and , later , highways , that connect Atlantic Canadians to one another and the wider world .
Many communities in Newfoundland – and most in Labrador – are so remote that they are not connected to the provincial road network and people rely on local ferries to get in or out .
Residents of the province of Prince Edward Island can get to the mainland on an 11 - year - old bridge , but it costs so much ( C$ 41.50 ) that many prefer ferries , which are also faster if one is traveling farther east .
Nova Scotia is practically an island , and residents of the southwest part of the province rely on ferry links providing vital shortcuts to Maine and New Brunswick .
" We need all the ferries we can get around here , " says Harold Theriault , a provincial legislator and retired lobsterman from Digby Neck , Nova Scotia , who says they are essential to the economic livelihood of his region .
" We 've got a big fishery here , and all our fish and lobsters comes your way [ the northeast US ] .
Every bit of it is trucked , and if we can't take a ferry 30 miles across the Bay of Fundy , then we have to drive it eight hours around . "
But high fuel prices are threatening some of the region 's ferry links , many of which were privatized more than a decade ago .
As costs are passed on to consumers , fewer customers appear to be riding , making critical services inviable without fresh government subsidies .
In August , federal and provincial authorities approved over C$ 15 million ( $ 14.5 million ) in subsidies to rescue the ferry Mr. Theriault 's neighbors rely on , a privately operated year - round car ferry linking Digby , N.S. , to Saint John , N.B .
Earlier this summer , the Nova Scotia government stepped in with C$ 4.4 million ( $ 4.26 million ) to save the seasonal high - speed service between Yarmouth , N.S. , and Portland and Bar Harbor in Maine – an essential means of getting US and Ontario tourists to the region .
" The routes would not be feasible without government assistance , " says Donald Cormier , vice president of operations at Bay Ferries , the Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , company that runs all three Nova Scotia services .
He says increased fuel prices and a downturn in American travel to Canada had forced both routes into the red .
While the subsidies for the Saint John ferry continue through early 2011 , it is not clear if the Maine routes – which have existed in some form for more than 50 years – will resume next year .
Mr. Cormier declined to comment , but the company recently announced it would close those seasonal routes eight days early .
Until the late 1990s , most of these routes used to be operated by Marine Atlantic , the government - controlled corporation that operates Newfoundland 's lifeline to the Canadian mainland .
For nearly a decade , Cormier says , Bay Ferries ran them without public subsidy , saving taxpayers " hundreds of millions . "
But now that fuel prices have undermined profitability , some think the government should reclaim routes .
" When costs rise and traffic falls , we do n't go tear up the bridges and roads , " says Mr. Theriault , who adds that propping up a private service will always be a greater political challenge than simply subsidizing a government one .
" The best thing that could happen is for Marine Atlantic to take it back under their wing . "
A spokesperson for Canada 's transport ministry , Maryse Durette , says the government is studying the problem and that " anything is on the table . "
But with sky - high diesel prices , even public companies like Marine Atlantic have been unable to provide affordable service , angering Newfoundland officials .
They point out that under the 1949 agreement by which Newfoundland joined Canada , the federal government has a constitutional obligation to maintain the service , and that the firm 's mission statement promises it will be " reliable , courteous , and cost - effective . "
The 110 - mile ride from North Sydney to Port aux Basques , N.L. , currently costs C$ 35.75 per passenger , C$ 101.50 per car , and C$ 550 for a 75 - foot truck , up by almost 30 percent since July 2007 .
" The Marine Atlantic service is , in effect , a continuation of the Trans - Canada Highway , " says Ms. Whalen , who has asked Ottawa to freeze rates .
It " has to be cost efficient in order to make our province an attractive place to do business and competitive with … provinces that do n't rely on ferry travel . "
Ms. Whalen said that Newfoundland & Labrador 's ferry services face the same challenges , but that her government has reduced rates over the past two years .
Marine Atlantic 's shareholders – the federal and provincial governments – currently pay for the first C$ 26 million in fuel each year , and additional costs are passed on to customers , according to company spokesperson Tara Laing .
The fuel surcharges reflect the increased costs .
For his part , Mr. Nelson of the regional trucking association argues that the Newfoundland run – essentially a floating bridge – should be free to users .
" It 's part of the federal highway system , " he says .
" It should be treated so . "
Companies that accept major credit cards will be barred from using WEP for their WiFi security , but not until mid-2010 .
The rule is part of new security standards defined and released this week by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council , which is made up of companies like Visa , MasterCard , American Express , and Discover .
The sad thing is that WEP — which can be cracked in as little as two minutes — is still widely used in the old and decrepit point - of - sale systems used by many retailers ; the new rules should help move along the long - overdue adoption of tighter security in credit card processing .
As part of the new Data Security Standard ( DSS ) agreement , retailers that accept credit cards from PCI council members may not implement new wireless payment systems that use WEP after March 31 , 2009 .
For those that already have wireless payment systems in place , they must stop using WEP for security as of June 30 , 2010 .
The council notes that the reason for this change is " to emphasize using strong encryption technologies for wireless technologies , for both authentication and transmission . "
WEP 's hackability has been widely known since 2001 , and has been blamed for the largest incident of consumer data theft in history .
TJX , parent company of discount retailers T.J. Maxx and Marshalls , disclosed last year that hackers had stolen data covering over 45 million credit and debit cards over an 18 - month period .
In addition to pilfering over 45 million — and possibly as many as 200 million — credit card and debit card numbers , the hackers were also able to obtain other personal data from over 450,000 customers .
This included driver 's license numbers and Social Security numbers .
Although TJX has become the poster - child for consumer data theft over WiFi , it is ( by far ) not the only company to use insecure wireless technologies .
Wireless security manufacturer AirDefense released a report in late 2007 saying that a quarter of the 4,748 retail access points it surveyed across the US had no security whatsoever , while another quarter only used WEP , " one of the weakest protocols for wireless data encryption . "
Just under half ( 49 percent ) of the surveyed hotspots used WiFi Protected Access ( WPA ) or WPA 2 — much stronger encryption protocols than WEP .
The firm observed that the large majority of the stores involved in the survey maintain stronger security of their physical property than their wireless routers , showing that retailers are still slow to take data security seriously .
Banning WEP is a long overdue move , and had the industry been faster to recognize the insecure nature of WEP , the TJX incident may never have happened .
It 's unfortunate that laggards will have until the middle of 2010 to drop WEP , as it unnecessarily puts customer data at risk for data theft .

Cars equipped with Travolution inform the drivers at what speed they should travel in order to avoid red lights .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Stopping , starting and accelerating your car or SUV can burn unnecessary amounts of fuel while driving .
To combat this known challenge , two new technologies have recently come out to provide a greener driving experience .
Nissan 's Eco Pedal pushes back on a driver 's lead foot , while Audi's Travolution tells a driver how fast to go to make the next green light .
" They are definitely part of a growing trend and are also definitely a good idea — in the category of ' every little bit helps , ' " said Mike Millikin , editor of the Green Car Congress , a Web site covering sustainable transportation options .
Several efforts , such as the consumer - based hypermiling movement and the Ford Motor Company 's EcoDriving Tips , aim to encourage more efficient driving behavior , such as accelerating smoothly and braking gradually . "
The next step is to put technology in the car to make it easier for consumers to eco-drive , Millikin told LiveScience .
" Although the benefits of eco-driving , if realized , will by default happen through mass adoption by drivers of cars that do n't have the spiffy indicators , " he said .
Eco Pedal
Nissan introduced the Eco Pedal last month as a way to actively optimize driving behavior .
When the system detects that the driver is pressing too hard on the gas , the pedal pushes back on the foot to inform the driver that they are over - accelerating .
By reducing aggressive driving , the Eco Pedal can improve fuel efficiency by 5 to 10 percent , according to Nissan research .
Commercialization of the product will begin in 2009 .
It remains to be seen whether drivers will appreciate an " electronic nanny " that tries to alter their driving style .
Judging from the Internet response , many consumers are hesitant to give this much control of their vehicle to a computer .
For these people , the Eco Pedal comes with an off - switch .
Travolution
A second kind of " dummy light " technology aims to discourage those who speed all the way up to a red light .
For the past two years , Audi has been testing their traffic control system , Travolution , in the German city of Ingolstadt .
The pilot project incorporates 46 traffic lights that are optimized to increase traffic flow .
Three of these lights also beam out a signal that tells when they will turn green .
Specially - equipped cars take this signal and compute a speed that the driver should maintain to avoid having to stop at the traffic light .
As of now , there are only two cars using Travolution , but Audi plans to extend the program by 20 additional cars and 50 more traffic lights .
Changing drivers
As these technologies are designed to demonstrate , fuel efficiency is not only about buying hybrids or designing less power - hungry vehicles .
It is also about making drivers more conscientious .
Millikin said that Japan has made it clear that in order to reduce fuel consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emission , there need to be improvements in three areas : vehicle / fuel technology , driving behavior and traffic infrastructure .
" In the U.S. , we 're beginning to frame the problem publicly in that way , " he said .
( CNN ) --
It 's one of the largest age gaps between presidential candidates in American history .
Only 20 percent of those polled said Sen. John McCain 's age would be a factor when they voted in November .
Republican Sen. John McCain is 72 , a skin cancer survivor , and would be the oldest man sworn in for a first term as president .
His opponent , Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , is 47 and the fourth - youngest major party nominee .
A new CNN / Opinion Research Corp .
Poll finds that may be a political liability for McCain .
Nearly half of the Americans surveyed , 47 percent , are concerned that McCain would not finish a four - year term as president in good health .
To pre-empt those concerns , McCain has allowed reporters -- including CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- to look through more than 1,100 pages of his medical records .
This spring , McCain 's personal physician , Dr. John Eckstein , released a letter saying there is no medical reason " that would preclude McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of the president of the United States . "
Still , the issue has n't gone away in the minds of voters .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corp .
Poll , conducted in late September , 29 percent of those polled said they are " very concerned " about McCain 's ability to complete a first term ; another 18 percent are " somewhat concerned . "
Results :
How important is health , age of candidates ? »
That compares with just 8 percent who said they are " very concerned " about Obama 's ability to finish his first term in good health and 11 percent who said they are " somewhat concerned . "

Obama has not released any medical records ; however , his campaign released a statement from his doctor saying he is in " excellent " health .
Both the Obama and McCain campaigns say they will not release any additional information or records about the candidates ' health .
Are voters more concerned about a presidential candidate 's health or his age ?
In the poll , 20 percent of respondents said McCain 's age would be a factor when they voted in November .
" McCain 's age appears to be having the roughly the same effect that Ronald Reagan 's age had in 1980 , " according to Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" Back then , when Reagan was 69 years old , concerns were raised about his age , " Holland said .
That obviously did n't prevent Reagan from winning , but then again , the election in 1980 election turned out not to be a particularly close one . "
A candidate 's health is far from the top of voters ' concerns .
Just 7 percent of those surveyed in the poll said it would be the " single most important factor " in their vote , and 24 percent said it would be " one of several important factors " they would consider .
How concerned are voters about McCain 's and Obama 's medical histories ?
Of those polled , 33 percent said they would be concerned about the health of a candidate who once had cancer but no longer does ; 14 percent said they would be concerned about the health of a former smoker .
McCain quit smoking in 1980 .
Obama quit last year as he launched his presidential campaign but admits he's " bummed " cigarettes since then .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp .
Poll also included more hypothetical questions .
Eighty - nine percent said they would worry about a candidate who was an alcoholic , and 47 percent said they'd be concerned about a recovered alcoholic .
Still , some voters are hard to ruffle .
Nearly one in four said they would be " not very concerned " or " not concerned at all " even if a candidate suffered a heart attack during the presidential campaign .
The good news for McCain and Obama is that in this election , their health is n't nearly as important to voters as their plans for health care , the economy and the war in Iraq .
But in a close race , anything could make the difference .

That ’s what Republican economics will do .
We know Republicans prefer to burn books rather than read them , but had they read history they would have known that their theories had all been proven to be false in the 1920s .
But no , deregulation and let business be business is all we heard out of them for decades .
How do they like the end result now that ’s not that different from the last time they tried ?
By failing to provide the most basic oversight and regulation , the McCain - Bush economic theory has managed to topple a once proud and strong system .
It ’s no wonder McCain is running for cover and avoiding a debate .
“ The world will never be as it was before the crisis , ” Steinbrueck told parliament .
“ The United States will lose its superpower status in the world financial system .
The world financial system will become more multi-polar . ”
In stark language , Steinbrueck lay the blame for the crisis squarely on the United States and what he called an Anglo - Saxon drive for double - digit profits and massive bonuses for bankers and company executives .
“ Investment bankers and politicians in New York , Washington and London were not willing to give these up , ” he said .
“ Wall Street will never be what it was , ” Steinbrueck added .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- The Beverly Hillary - billies come to Denver .
" It 's not like [ the Clintons ] have been bending over backwards to help Obama get elected , " says Jack Cafferty .
If you look closely this week , you might catch a glimpse of Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention in between appearances by the Clintons .
Hillary Clinton is doing her dead - level best to take title to Obama 's moment in the sun .
She lost .
He won .
She and her family will be everywhere .
She speaks tonight .
Chelsea Clinton will introduce her .
She will be preceded by a video produced by her own people , the same ones who produced the " Man from Hope " for Bill Clinton .
He will speak tomorrow .
The Clintons will also use the convention to raise money to retire her campaign debts .
They even came up with a cute little contest .
Hillary Clinton awarded one lucky donor a trip to the convention with her .
And as an enticement to cough up some bucks , Bill Clinton sent an e-mail to potential contributors promising a memorable week with his wife .
( Insert your own joke here )
He said , " You 'll get to see Hillary speak on Tuesday and Barack Obama -- the next president of the United States -- on Thursday .
And I hear Hillary and you will have a chat -- I 'll make sure I stop by . "
Makes you want to borrow money against your house , does n't it ?
How gross .
It 's not like they have been bending over backwards to help Obama get elected .
Bill Clinton has barely been polite .
He could n't even bring himself to say he thought Obama is qualified to be president .
Now , Bill Clinton is reportedly not happy about the topic of his speech Wednesday night .
Politico.com reports the former president wanted to talk about the economy under President Bush compared to his accomplishments during his term in office .
The theme for Wednesday night is " Securing America for the 21st Century . "
It seems Bill Clinton is forever more interested in reminding us of what a charming guy he was while in office than in acting like one of the leaders of his party and trying to get his party into the White House .
Kind of sad , really .
Yet , Obama 's people have gone out of their way to accommodate the Clintons this week in the hopes of achieving party unity .
Obama told reporters on Monday that former President Clinton could speak about anything he likes .
Some of Hillary Clinton 's supporters had threatened to disrupt the proceedings if their candidate was n't shown the proper amount of respect .
They 're called PUMAs , an acronym for " Party Unity My Ass . "
They appear to be a humorless lot who cannot come to terms with the fact that the country did n't want Hillary Clinton to be president .
So they have been throwing a hissy fit ever since the primaries ended .
iReport.com : Clinton delegate , supporter clash
For these people there will never be unity unless Hillary Clinton is president .
For the rest of the Democratic Party , logic suggests that when it comes to a decision between Barack Obama and John McCain , they would be more inclined to stick needles in their eyes than vote to perpetuate the abysmal situation we find ourselves in courtesy of George W. Bush and his merry band of country - wreckers .
Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton owes some big bucks , as in tens of millions of dollars .
So if you 're at the convention this week and you see her out in front of the hall selling pencils , buy one .
She needs the money .

The photographer caught this fascinating ice formation shot in Huseby , Sweden .
Ice takes on all sorts of interesting asymmetrical and geometric shapes , from the icy platelets above to the incredible parallel ice shelves of the Arctic .
Ellesmere Island is famous for its ice shelves , but unfortunately they are diminishing rapidly in the face of global warming .
Climate change caused alarming losses in summer of 2008 , and scientists are concerned that this special ecosystem may soon be lost forever .
Ice Caves

Hard to believe , but those luscious sculptured waves are completely natural – and on the ceiling .
A cave in Bavaria , Germany features this unusual ice .
Ice caves are common throughout the world , but some of the largest are the massive , twisting Eisriesenwelt Caves in Austria ( shown above right ) .
Let ’s face it : in the online arena , distractions are imminent and inevitable .
There are just too many online properties that beg for your attention — and before you know it , hours have passed and you did n’t finish that project you meant to complete .
This is especially more challenging for the Marlas in the house , as creativity requires being ahead of the curve .
Marla is consistently kept busy , and that ’s probably because she ’s kept abreast of those technological innovations .
But that could be a time sink too , unless she has the right tools to manage her emails , projects , and time .
Those who are like Lou , though , do n’t know that it ’s possible to do everything one can do in the corporate world at home for a fraction of the cost ( and even better returns ) .
Without being armed with that know - how , how does a guy like Lou actually take the initiative to do what he can — at home ( as he soon may have to ) ?
In the creative world , you do n’t have to confine yourself to costly enterprise - level applications .
Free ( or really affordable ) opportunities are available .
In this article , I discuss my favorite tools to manage my clients and time online , and I invite you to share your favorite tools of the trade too .
Email
The first step to communicating with local clients and overseas prospects is to make sure you have a good email system in place .
My recommended tool ?
Gmail ( armed with Better Gmail 2 for Firefox ) .
The primary reason for choosing Gmail over all other web app solutions is because it has colored labels .
I note my client projects with a gray label called “ Clients ” and use the yellow “ todo ” label ( or a star ) for any actionable items that need my attention .
Gmail also scores big points for having the capacity to handle large files , and with over 7.2GB of storage at the present , I do n’t have to download my messages locally and can access my entire inbox from my cell phone and the many computers I use .
Many people use Gmail as a business tool and do n’t mind having a “ professional ” email address with the gmail.com domain ( I actually use my gmail.com email account straight - away for some tasks ) .
But fortunately , you can get all benefits of Gmail on your desired domain name by utilizing Google Apps for Business .
The free option is more than sufficient for the creative professional .
Documents
When I need to collaborate , Google Documents is fascinating .
Have you ever tried to work with someone else on the same document at once ?
( If not , give it a try . )
Offline , I actually am still using Microsoft Word , but I ’m a proponent of the free Open Office suite , which is a full - featured office application with a word processor , spreadsheet , and presentation tool .
I often find myself working in a simple notepad replacement known as Notepad2 ( Windows only ) for note - taking , writing drafts to blog posts ( like this one ) , and if I want to copy / paste text to save for later .
Big applications such as Microsoft Word and OpenOffice do n’t come to play very often unless I need to work on a professional presentation .
Photo Editing
Most of us creative types like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP for photo editing .
I ’m more of a creative writer and not a graphic designer , so Irfanview ( Windows only ) is great for small image editing tasks , such as resizing and cropping , which is often necessary for blogging .
I hear great things about Pixelmator for the Mac .
Calendars
Is it a surprise that I like Google Calendar ?
Again , it ’s collaborative , and that ’s a plus .
One - on - One Communication
The bottom line : when you ’re in a creative discipline , you need to be able to talk to your peers online ( and quickly ) — whether to bounce ideas off of them or whether to ask them for immediate feedback about a new design or whatnot .
While many individuals think instant messages are a productivity waster ( and that ’s true if you get carried away ) , it helps to be accessible .
Personally , I ’m always online , but I ’m barely chatting .
And for communication , my preferred tool is Pidgin , which integrates Google Talk , AOL Instant Messenger , Yahoo , MSN , ICQ , and others .
For overseas conversations ,
Skype is a great option and the free option may work for you , though there are paid subscriptions depending on who you need to call .
Collaborative Communication
With the web becoming increasingly social , the next step would be to find a way to bounce idea off of the collective or to get inspiration .
I prefer two tools for this , Twitter and FriendFeed .
Twitter is a microblogging tool that lets you tell the world in 140 characters or less about what you ’re doing and your thoughts .
In the past several months , Twitter has gained momentum and now is a great broadcast medium if you want a lot of people to give you immediate feedback about an idea .
It ’s also a great place to network with like - minded professionals .
There are a lot of creative folks using Twitter , that ’s for sure !
On the other hand , FriendFeed is a tool that lets you share your “ lifestreams , ” such as your Tweets , the RSS feeds of your websites , the social sites you ’re using , and more ( including your Amazon wish list ! ) .
While FriendFeed has a much smaller audience than Twitter , it has a lot more in - depth conversation and is very powerful tool for sharing tips , pictures , and more .
I find FriendFeed as a great source of inspiration , and active participants will find that it really does have a powerful and very engaged community .
Client Communication
If email does n’t do it for you , Basecamp is a very cool application that lets you communicate with the many clients you have .
Basecamp is professional and lets you categorize your projects .
It also allows you to share files , create to - do lists and milestones , track time , and more .
Web Surfing
Is it any surprise that I stand by Mozilla Firefox for my web surfing ?
With all the plugins it supports , I ’m able to do a whole lot with a single application .
Media
My favorite media player ever is VLC media player and that ’s because it saves time and energy since it does n’t require you to install codecs in order to run that AVI file your colleague just sent you .
Invoicing
By far , the best tool available for invoicing clients is Freshbooks .
It gives freelancers the ability to create professional looking invoices for a fraction of the cost ( free for up to 4 different clients ! )
Freshbooks also has time tracking software for the computer and for the iPhone .
Time Tracking
I mentioned Freshbooks in the previous category , but I find another tool useful to track where I ’ve been online .
That tool is called RescueTime and it lets you know what you ’ve been doing and when .
RescueTime lets you tag your activities and then graphs it out so that you can find out whether you were wasting time or actually doing productive work .
It is one of my favorite tools ever .
Backups
While I do a lot of my work online , I also do a chunk of work offline .
I need a tool to back up my most important files in case something happens .
Carbonite is a powerful application that does that for you and it is n’t intrusive at all .
Other Favorites
I use a lot of shortcut applications on my Windows machine , including Everything , a powerful search tool that will scan files of your entire hard drive and find the filename you were looking for without the extensive search .
I have it running on a computer with about 1.6TB of data .
Once it profiles your hard drive , you ’ll find the file you ’re looking for instantaneously .
I also like Launchy ( Windows ) and Quicksilver ( Mac ) to launch applications without requiring me to use my mouse in order to navigate to my Start Menu , then Accessories , then Entertainment , and then Sound Recorder .
Using Launchy , for example , I hit ALT + Spacebar , type “ soun , ” and Launchy discovers that I ’m intersted in Sound Recorder and will launch it for me .
It saves a whole lot of time , and once you get the hang of it , I assure you that you wo n’t go back to the mouse if you do n’t need to .
I disperse my work among four different computers , so RealVNC lets me get remote access to the other machines located elsewhere .
Additionally , I also play with a Linux server , and I usually remotely connect to it via Putty ( Windows and Linux ) .
How About You ?
To make this truly the “ ultimate ” productivity toolbox for creative people , we need your input .

About the Author : We ’re pleased to announce that Tamar Weinberg has joined Lateral Action as Associate Editor .
Tamar is a former contributor to Lifehacker , works with the lads over at Mashable , and displays her skills as a social media maven at her blog Techipedia .
The vice president and compliance officer at Paradigm Capital is accused of walking into the main branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto 's financial district on September 12 - just a block away from where he negotiated trades and deals - standing in the queue , smiling , and chatting up the bank teller before demanding money .
When Sarah Palin was introduced five weeks ago as John McCain ’s running mate , her impact seemed seismic .
With her injection of youth and energy to the Republican ticket , McCain ’s advisors predicted she would be a strong draw to women -- particularly independents and supporters of New York Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton who were reluctant to back Barack Obama .
That seemed plausible as the Alaska governor attracted large crowds to rallies and was credited with a surge in the polls for McCain .
But as she faces her biggest test , tonight ’s debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden , Palin ’s star power appears to have faded .
She dropped out of the headlines as the financial crisis captured attention , and her shaky performance in interviews with CBS anchor Katie Couric was widely seen as a potential problem for the McCain campaign .
Palin is still enormously popular among Republicans and continues to stoke enthusiasm in the party ’s base , but as voters learn about her , many have started to view her unfavorably .
After the GOP convention , more than half of the voters surveyed by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press said she was qualified to be president .
In a Pew poll released Wednesday , just 37 % said she would be ready to take over for McCain .

And polls now show little evidence to support the McCain campaign ’s hope that she will attract female swing voters in significant numbers .
A Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll last month found that Palin held no particular sway with women .
Among independent voters , she was more popular with men : 44 % said they were more likely to vote for McCain because of Palin , whereas just 31 % of women said so .
The poll also found just a quarter of Clinton ’s former supporters were more inclined to choose the Arizona senator because of his running mate .
Irene Holcomb , a retiree from Duluth , Minn. , is an independent voter who favored Clinton but now backs Obama .
Initially , she said , she saw Palin as “ the perfect woman , ” but she has watched her interviews and now says she “ comes off like she really does n’t know what she ’s talking about . ”
Like Holcomb , a number of female Clinton supporters surveyed said they were concerned about Palin ’s qualifications .
Nearly all singled out her lack of foreign policy experience .
Advertisement
Kelly Knuth , a 48 - year - old Democrat and Clinton supporter from Proctor , W.Va. , was just the kind of undecided voter the McCain campaign hoped to win with Palin ’s selection .
Palin seemed refreshingly “ common ” and “ down - to - earth , ” Knuth said -- a contrast to Obama and McCain , whom she views as removed from the economic struggles of working people .
Yet her admiration for Palin was n’t enough to tip her toward McCain .
“ If she had some experience , yes , I think she could do something , ” Knuth said .
For Karen Molesworth , an independent voter , her concern about whether Palin would be able to handle the Iraq war is personal -- her grandson has served four tours in Iraq .

“ She talks about Russia , but come on , they said she just got a passport , ” said 67 - year - old Molesworth , who is from Port Huron , Mich . , and supports Obama .
“ If Palin had to step in -- oh , God , she ’d better have some good people behind her . ”
Such negative impressions of Palin are on the upswing after her unsteady interviews and unflattering news reports about her record , including her decision not to cooperate with the investigation into her firing of Alaska ’s public safety commissioner .
In polling by Pew between Saturday and Monday , 4 in 10 voters said they viewed her unfavorably , compared with 32 % in a poll taken two weeks earlier .
Despite the potential limits of her appeal , Palin has exhibited a rare ability to establish an emotional connection with Republican women who flock to her rallies .
In interviews with more than 20 , few mentioned specific issues or shared ideology to explain their support -- more often they described Palin as “ real , ” “ gutsy ” and “ tenacious . ”
Advertisement
Rutgers University political science professor Ross K. Baker noted that Palin “ could be anybody ’s neighbor . ”
“ What flows from that is the belief that she may be uniquely able to understand the problems of ordinary Americans , ” he said .
Her Everyman style has drawn comparisons to Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush , and 70 % of voters surveyed in the latest Pew poll said Palin was “ down - to - earth . ”
In an interview Tuesday with talk show host Hugh Hewitt , Palin described herself as “ a normal Joe Six - Pack American . ”
At a recent rally in Virginia , Pam Arledge , a 45 - year - old mother of five , noted that she and Palin were both PTA moms and “ look just alike . ”
Advertisement
“ She gets up , takes care of the kids and goes to work .
I ’m , like , ‘ Oh , my God !
It ’s like me doing it . ’
It ’s like I ’m living through her .
She is going inspire an entire generation of women , ” said Arledge , who lives in Spotsylvania , Va .
Arledge shrugged off their ideological differences , on abortion , for example : “ I ’m a centrist , so I do n’t care what her social views are . ”
Ronda Bryce , a 46 - year - old preschool administrator from Haymarket , Va. , said the Alaska governor “ seems like somebody you could shop with and have intelligent conversation with .
It would n’t always be about the shoes , but the shoes would be good , ” she said with a laugh .
To Debbie Keller , a 51 - year - old homemaker from Littlestown , Pa. , who attended a McCain - Palin rally in Lancaster , Pa. , the debate over Palin ’s credentials seemed ridiculous , since Palin is already juggling a governorship and a campaign with her duties as a mother of five children , including a baby with Down syndrome and a pregnant teenage daughter .

“ I have six kids , so I think she has a lot of experience to do it , ” she said .
“ If you can deal with the problems in your family and your own children , you ’re not going to get overwhelmed . ”

A gang of rogue cops clobbered a Brooklyn man they saw smoking a joint , then sodomized him with a walkie - talkie antenna during a broad - daylight attack in a subway station , law - enforcement sources and the victim ’s lawyer said yesterday .
The alleged attack , reminiscent of the 1997 police assault on Abner Louima , put Michael Mineo , 24 , in Brookdale Hospital for four days .
“ This is one of the most horrendous and grievous cases I ’ve ever seen , ” said Mineo ’s lawyer , Stephen Jackson , who will file a notice of claim against the city next week .
In the Louima case , the victim was black , the attackers white .
In this case , Mineo is white and the officers are black , Hispanic and white .
Law - enforcement sources said the investigation was focusing on five cops – four patrol officers from the 71st Precinct and a transit officer – all of whom were characterized as relatively inexperienced .
The officer who allegedly committed the sodomy is believed to be in his 20s , with 2 ½ years on the job .
NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said the department ’s initial investigation turned up little to support Mineo ’s story .
“ Police officers grappled with an individual who they observed smoking marijuana after he had fled and resisted being handcuffed , ” said Browne .
“ His assertion that he was sodomized is not supported by independent civilian witnesses . ”
But law - enforcement sources told a different story to The Post – specifically noting that at least one witness reported seeing Mineo ’s exposed buttocks as cops held him down .
A co-worker at the Jiggaman tattoo parlor on Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn said Mineo had been released from the hospital , but was in pain and did not appear to be improving .
“ He ’s getting pale , ” said Keasha Brown , 25 .
“ He ’s looking sick .
Those people are dangerous .
It makes me sick . ”
Mineo was walking from his home to the Prospect Park subway station on Empire Boulevard at Flatbush Avenue at about 2 p.m. on Oct. 15 when two uniformed officers spotted him allegedly smoking a joint .
They chased him into the station , and at some point , Mineo allegedly swallowed the marijuana .
Five cops tackled him near a token booth , where they beat him and stood on his neck , said Jackson and the law - enforcement sources .
One officer then allegedly pulled Mineo ’s pants down and shoved a police radio ’s antenna into his rectum .
The cops then hauled a bleeding Mineo into a police car and issued him a desk - appearance ticket before cutting him loose , Jackson said .
They also warned him not to report the incident or they would upgrade his charge to a felony , according to the attorney .
Jackson said his client heard one of the officers yell , “ No !
Do n’t do it ! ” as his pants were being pulled down .
His roommate and co-worker , Jason Amolsch , found him yelling that the “ cops violated him . ”
Sources said the officers are still on active duty .
“ It ’s alarming that you have police officers out there who , for all intents and purposes , are guilty of gang rape , ” said Jackson .
Mineo has a pending assault case in Brooklyn .

Meltdown : Voters blaming GOP for financial crisis Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The financial turmoil that has rocked global markets appears to be benefiting US presidential hopeful Barack Obama , according to a new poll released Monday that finds the Democratic candidate pulling ahead of his Republican opponent John McCain with a 51 percent to 46 percent lead .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll also finds that by a two - to - one margin Americans blame Republicans for the current financial crisis .
Forty - seven percent of registered voters say Republicans are more responsible for the state of the economy , compared to 24 percent of registered voters who say Democrats are more responsible .
Obama 's five - point lead over McCain stands in contrast to the previous CNN / Opinion Research survey that had the candidates tied at 48 percent each , although Obama 's advantage lies within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .
The survey also indicates that more Americans think Obama would better handle the economy .
The democratic candidate holds a 10 - point lead over McCain .
Obama made gains among key constituencies that were once seen as part of McCain 's base : men and seniors .
CNN 's poll of polls , which combines numerous local and national polling data , found that 49 percent of registered voters favor Obama , compared with 44 percent for McCain .
" The economy has always been considered John McCain 's Achilles ' heel , and the CNN poll of polls started to show an Obama edge in the middle of last week -- just as the financial crisis began to hit home for many Americans , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
The survey also indicates that one of Obama 's main campaign messages -- that McCain represents " more of the same " policies of the incumbent Bush administration -- is registering with voters .
Fifty - seven percent of Americans contacted for the survey think McCain , if elected , will " mostly carry out the policies " of President George W. Bush , up three percentage points from the previous poll .
The poll also suggests Obama has recaptured the mantle of " change , " a campaign slogan for the Obama camp for over two years , adopted by McCain in the weeks since adding Alaska governor Sarah Palin to the GOP ticket in early September .
Obama holds a 14 point lead over McCain when voters consider which candidate would be more likely to bring change to the White House .
The survey finds that 35 percent of those questioned have an unfavorable opinion of Palin -- an eight point jump from the last CNN poll .
" Change has always been Obama 's strong suit , but McCain and Palin clearly made inroads into that issue during the GOP convention , " said Holland .
" Palin , in particular , was seen as an agent of change when she made her first appearance on the national stage .
That may be changing now . "
The poll results come out four days before Obama and McCain meet in Oxford , Mississippi for the first of three presidential debates .
Strong viewing figures are expected for the debates , after nearly 40 million Americans tuned in for both the Democrat and Republican convention speeches .
The poll suggests the debates could be critical for swaying opinions , with 14 percent of voters saying they have yet to make up their minds on who to vote for .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll , conducted September 19 through September 21 , interviewed 1,020 Americans , including 909 registered voters and 697 likely voters .
READ : Xavier principal 's letter to parents " But if a criminal act occurs it will be investigated by Victoria Police and if criminal offences are disclosed we will be charging the people appropriately . ''
Xavier - one of Melbourne 's most elite Catholic schools with fees of more than $ 16,000 a year for VCE students - suspended the entire year 12 group yesterday when end - of - year antics led to one student being taken to hospital amid complaints from neighbours of students ' drunken behaviour .
Residents who live near the Kew campus said students went on a rampage , harassing motorists and drinking heavily .
Police confirmed today that an Argyle Road resident 's car was damaged by a group of youths in school uniform .
Acting Senior Sergeant Philips said the roof had been damaged as though someone had been jumping on it .
Police said they were investigating whether students from other schools were involved , and were liaising with school officials .
" When these people are located , the charges will be criminal damage to the car and there may be some peripheral charges in relation to the behaviour of students ( yesterday ) afternoon , '' Acting Senior Sergeant Philips said .
Guards posted at exclusive school Security guards were posted in front of the exclusive school this morning .
One year 12 student , who did not wish to be identified , told The Age the class of 2008 had " a long history of misbehaviour ' ' and had been denounced as the " worst year level at Xavier in 30 years ' ' .
He said he had not been involved in any of the end - of - year antics and was shocked to learn he had been suspended along with his classmates .
The student said when he returned to the school today to discuss an upcoming exam with a teacher , he saw guards posted at the gates and was told that the year 12 students were to be kept out of the school .
Trouble after mass suspension Despite the mass suspension , there were further reports of trouble near the school last night .
Police said several emergency calls were received last night and early this morning complaining about " disruptive youths ' ' on the road outside Xavier College , which boasts the Latin motto of Sursum Corda : ' Lift up your hearts ' .
Melbourne talkback radio stations were flooded with calls this morning from the public and parents of Xavier College students at odds over the students ' ' muck - up day ' behaviour .
" ( They were ) throwing bottles everywhere , there were smashed bottles all through the street , '' a Kew resident identified as Chris told Radio 3AW .
" This group of unruly boys came down the street , jumped all over my car and have done considerable damage .
They got a taxi driver and jumped all over his car .
He looked terrified , '' she said .
Another woman , identified as Sandy , said a mob of 30 to 40 students was harassing traffic outside Glenferrie station last night .
" Just down from the intersection of Burwood and Glenferrie ( there were ) multiple boys in black balaclavas punching the ( car ) windows , punching the windscreen and simulating very vulgar acts , '' Sandy said .
A number of students contacted The Age to offer tell - all accounts of muck - up day behaviour in return for a fee .
No payments were offered .
Police receive multiple call - outs Victoria Police received six calls last night between 6 pm and 7 pm about youths causing trouble in the Kew area .
Another call was made at 2 am to report a disruptive group of 30 youths standing on Barkers Road , which runs along the southern boundary of Xavier College .
The manager of a liquor store near the school said there " were a few more young people than normal ' ' buying alcohol yesterday afternoon .
However , students and parents of Xavier College claim the media has over - reacted to the graduation day antics .
" I 've got a year 12 boy ( and ) it was a drastic over - reaction , '' said a Xavier College mother who identified herself as Jenny .
A Xavier College student called James told Radio 3 AW the behaviour did not warrant mass suspension .
" The school suspended us all to de-escalate the situation , '' James said .
Paramedics treat teen Loading
An ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics had treated a 17 - year - old male who had injured his leg .

Be sure to read our latest SSD article : The SSD Relapse for an updated look at the SSD market .
No one really paid much attention to Intel getting into the SSD ( Solid State Disk ) business .
We all heard the announcements , we heard the claims of amazing performance , but I did n't really believe it .
After all , it was just a matter of hooking up a bunch of flash chips to a controller and putting them in a drive enclosure , right ?
The closer we got to release and the more time I spent with competing products , the more I realized that Intel 's biggest launch of 2008 was n't going to be Nehalem - it was going to be its SSDs .
If Intel could price them right , and if Intel could deliver on the performance , the biggest upgrade you could do for your PC - whether desktop or notebook , would n't be to toss in a faster CPU , it would be to migrate to one of these SSDs .
Combine Nehalem and one of these mythical SSDs and you were in for a treat .
But that was a big if ...
Intel still had to deliver .
We already talked about the drives back at IDF .
The Intel X25 - M and the X18 - M , available in 80 GB capacities , 2.5 " and 1.8 " form factors ( respectively ) with 160 GB versions on the way .
Today we are allowed to share performance data and pricing information , one of which is more impressive than the other .
Intel will be selling the X25 - M at $ 595 MSRP through OEMs and channel vendors , although I hear the street price may be lower .
Both of the -M models are based on Intel 's MLC flash , while a X25 - E using SLC flash will be due out by the end of this year .
I 'll detail the differences in a bit .
The pricing is rough , that puts Intel 's X25 - M at cheaper than SLC drives on the market but more expensive than MLC drives .
Your options are effectively to get a 128 GB MLC drive , an 80 GB Intel X25 - M or a 64GB SLC drive .
But as you can expect , I would n't be quite this excited if the decision were that easy .
Over the next several pages we 're going to walk through the architecture of a NAND flash based SSD , investigate the problems with current MLC drives ( and show how the Intel drive is n't affected ) and finally compare the performance of the Intel drive to MLC , SLC and standard hard drives ( both 2.5 " and 3.5 " ) in a slew of real world applications .
If you want to know the ending first I wo n't make you wait .
Intel absolutely delivered with its first SSDs .
After I completed my initial testing of the drive I sent AnandTech Senior Editor , Gary Key a message :
" I think Intel just Conroe ’d the HDD market . "
Honestly , within 6 months I 'd expect it to be just as important to have one of these drives in your system , as your boot / application drive , as it was to have Conroe in your system back in 2006 .
The only issue here , the only problem I have is the price .
I was hoping for something much lower from Intel and although the pricing is justified based on the performance , it ensures that the X25 - M like most high performance SSDs , remains a luxury item .
While the X25 - M is n't the world 's fastest storage device across the board , it is among the fastest .
And in the areas that it does dominate , it does so unbelievably well .
The other great thing ?
You ’ve got one of the world ’s fastest hard drives , and it can fit in your notebook .
Let 's get to it .
LOOKING FOR THE NEW XBOX 360 SLIM ?
CHECK IT OUT HERE !
While the original Xbox is nary a memory in most of our minds , it ’s still a popular console for hacking together media centers and other homebrew apps .
But the old black behemoth of a case sure needs an update .
So when I saw this custom Xbox build out , I thought to myself , “ that ’s just what the doctor ordered ” .
Modder Coca627 refactored his original Xbox into what he ’s coined the “ Xbox Slim ” , a lean , mean fighting machine , amped up to the max .
To put it in perspective , the original Xbox measured 12.5 ″ ( w ) x 4 ″ ( h ) x 10.5 ″ ( d ) , while the Xbox Slim is just 10.2 ″ ( w ) x 2.3 ″ ( h ) x 9 ″ ( d ) , a reduction in volume of 60 % .
And the Slim weighs in at a svelte 4 pounds , less than half the weight of the ponderous 8.5 pound bulk of the original Xbox .
The Xbox Slim is decked out with a brand spaking new DVD / CD - R slim combo drive , and loaded up with a 2.5 ″ 60 GB hard drive for storage , and built - in Wi-Fi networking .
Coca even managed to integrate a hidden receiver for his Logitech wireless controller .
Under the hood , the system managed to slim down thanks to improved cooling , courtesy of a pair of heavy duty Iceberg4 Pro Chip Cooling fans .
The system is modded to run a wide variety of nifty applications including the XBMC media center dashboard and emulators for SNES , Sega Megadrive , NeoGeo and more .
Now if only he could get it to run Xbox 360 games :)

US media reports claim ...
Britney Spears ' 17 - year - old sister Jamie Lynn is expecting her second child , US media reports claim .
Jame Lynn , who gave birth to her first child , Maddie Briann , in June , is apparently eight weeks pregnant .
An unnamed source told the National Enquirer that she and her mother , Lynne , were left “ hysterical ” after she took a pregnancy test .
" Neither of them knows what to do , but for now they 're trying to keep the news from getting out , ” the source said .
" Jamie Lynn believed she could n't get pregnant while she was breast - feeding .
" She 'd expected to have her period by early September , but a home pregnancy test came back positive and Jamie Lynn cried her eyes out .
" Lynne was livid when she found out . "
The reports coincide with Jamie Lynn 's appearance on the cover of the US edition of OK Magazine .
Britney Spears and stars at the VMAs
As you know , we have many symbiotic relationships with bacteria .
In fact , the average human gut contains about 1 kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) of these microscopic cells , some of which are beneficial .
If you ’ve ever had to take antibiotics , you may have come to learn how dependent we are on certain strains of bacteria to process plant materials … albeit through a rather uncomfortable experience .
Certain flora , like E. coli , live in our intestines and help us synthesize vitamins K and B - complex , which are then absorbed by the body .
But microbes provide us with more than just dietary aide .
Actually , microbes offer a unique line of evidence into investigating human migrations , which is crucial to have in anthropology .
Since they evolve faster due to their exponentially expedited life span , we can trace how human population diverged from one another .
One of my favorite papers on the subject was last year ’s support for the Out of Africa model of human migrations using the genetics of Helicobacter pylori , another gut dwelling bacterial species .
A similar study on the topic was published today in the open access journal PLoS One .
The title , “ Amerindian Helicobacter pylori Strains Go Extinct , as European Strains Expand Their Host Range , ” does a great job at explaining the main results of the paper .
But I ’ll try to provide a bit more detail in this post .
First , let me introduce the microbe to you .
Unlike some of the other flora that reside inside of us , H. pylori , is more or less a parasite and a nasty one at that — known to cause stomach and intestinal cancers because of the chronic inflammation it causes .
The inflammation stems off of the reaction of a component of its gram - negative staining walls , a lipopolysaccharide that initiates an immune response .
However , most of us play host to this species and do a good job at keeping it under control .
Inflammation only becomes a problem when combined with other deficiencies in the health and immune system of the individual .
The authors of this study made 131 bacterial cultures , 19 of which came from from Africans , 36 from Spanish , 11 from Koreans , 43 from Amerindians and 22 from South American Mestizos .
They lysed the cells from the cultures and did lots of PCR and sequencing reactions for 7 housekeeping genes from each of the 131 cultures .
When they did a comparison of the sequences they noted an interesting , but consistent result : decreased diversity of H. pylori strains in the human group with the least genomic diversity .
In other words , Native American human populations , who experienced a population bottleneck while crossing Beringia , also inadvertently caused a H. pylori bottleneck !
We ’ve suspected that Native American populations have undergone a bottleneck because looking at their ABO blood group diversity , they show a remarkable dominance of O blood type — something not seen in European and African populations .
Among Mestizo people , H. pylori genetic diversity was high .
That ’s cause Mestizos are people of mixed ancestry — a hodgepodge of Spanish and Native American hybrids .
In fact , the authors could see the hybridization in the H. pylori from these people .
Although bacteria reproduce asexually , they have this phenomenon , called recombination , which is effectively a sharing of parts of DNA .
Mestizo H. pylori had some signatures from Amerindian H. pylori and some from European H. pylori indicating their was a sharing of H. pylori genes from these two different populations , just as there was a sharing of human genes .
Even though I ’ve made this point before , similar to languages , material culture , and our own genetics , the genetics of organisms associated with humans , be it bacteria , rats , etc. can effectively tell us a lot about human migrations .
This paper documents how a founder effect of sorts , a decrease of genetic variation of H. pylori among Native Americans due the effects of crossing Beringia some 15,000 years ago .
It also documents the increase in genetic diversity of H. pylori as these Native American groups mixed with European ones .
TRENTON , N.J. , Sept. 7 ( UPI ) -- Rocker Jon Bon Jovi showed he is a stalwart supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama by raising $ 3 million for him at a New Jersey benefit .
The New York Post said Sunday that the " Destination Anywhere " singer held a private fundraiser at his own home in Middletown , N.J. , in order to raise funds for the Illinois senator 's presidential run .

With nearly 100 people paying more than $ 30,000 to attend the exclusive event , Obama made an appearance to offer some inspiration words to his assembled supporters .
" We 're not going to be bullied , we 're not going to be smeared , " the presidential hopeful said at Friday 's event .
Bon Jovi is the second notable musical name involved in the electoral race during recent days as the band Heart blasted Republican presidential candidate John McCain regarding his campaign 's use of the band 's hit song " Barracuda . "
The Post said the popular Heart song was used , allegedly without permission , by campaign officials during this week 's Republican National Convention to help introduce Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin , McCain 's vice - presidential running mate .
Would n’t it be ironic if you go to all the trouble to show up to vote on election day , only to have your vote not count ( or not even be allowed to vote ) because your name has been purged from the election rolls ?
Several states are purging hundreds of thousands of voters from their rolls , often removing legitimate voters .
And in some states , they do n’t even notify you if your name is removed .
CBS has done a special report on this issue :
Luckily , the fine folks at VotersUnite.org have a handy - dandy web page that tells you how you can check to make sure you are registered to vote .
Another good resource is the Can I Vote website , which tells you on a state - by - state basis how to check if you are registered to vote .
Even if you voted recently , it is good to check as 19 states are purging their voter lists before the upcoming election .
And remember , if you show up to vote but they claim that you are not registered , you should always ask for a provisional ballot .
Given the stakes this year , it is probably a good idea to bring with you some ID , including proof of your current address .
And it is a good idea to have your friends and family check to see if they are still registered , as well .
Strange things can happen when you go to vote , so do n’t let what happened to Homer Simpson happen to you :
Terry Pratchett : I 'm slipping away a bit at a time ... and all I can do is watch it happen
When author Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with dementia , he was shocked to discover doctors could do little to help .
For despite the fact that the condition affects more than 700,000 Britons ( a million by 2025 ) , research into its causes and treatment has been chronically under - funded .
Patients and their families also have to cope with the stigma and ignorance surrounding dementia , as a report published today by the Alzheimer ’s Society has revealed .
In the belief that the only way to change this is to talk openly about the disease , here Terry Pratchett describes his own experiences .
Seven hundred thousand people who have dementia in this country are not heard .
I ’m fortunate ; I can be heard .
Regrettably , it ’s amazing how people listen if you stand up in public and give away $ 1 million for research into the disease , as I have done .
Why did I do it ?
I regarded finding I had a form of Alzheimer ’s as an insult and decided to do my best to marshal any kind of forces I could against this wretched disease .
I have posterior cortical atrophy or PCA .
They say , rather ingenuously , that if you have Alzheimer ’s it ’s the best form of Alzheimer ’s to have .
This is a moot point , but what it does do , while gradually robbing you of memory , visual acuity and other things you did n’t know you had until you miss them , is leave you more or less as fluent and coherent as you always have been .
Incurable : Terry Pratchett revealed on 11 December last year that he had been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer 's disease
I spoke to a fellow sufferer recently ( or as I prefer to say , ‘ a person who is thoroughly annoyed with the fact they have dementia ’ ) who talked in the tones of a university lecturer and in every respect was quite capable of taking part in an animated conversation .
Nevertheless , he could not see the teacup in front of him .
His eyes knew that the cup was there ; his brain was not passing along the information .
This disease slips you away a little bit at a time and lets you watch it happen .
When I look back now , I suspect there may be some truth in the speculation that dementia ( of which Alzheimer ’s is the most common form ) may be present in the body for quite some time before it can be diagnosed .
For me , things came to a head in the late summer of 2007 .
My typing had been getting progressively worse and my spelling had become erratic .
I grew to recognise what I came to call Clapham Junction days when the demands of the office grew too much to deal with .
I was initially diagnosed not with Alzheimer ’s but with an ischemic change , a simple loss of brain cells due to normal ageing .
That satisfied me until the next Clapham Junction day .
I went back to my GP and said I knew there was something more going on .
Fortunately , she knew well enough not to bother with the frankly pathetic MMSE test ( the 30 - point questionnaire used to determine brain function ) and sent me to Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge , where , after examination of my MRI scan and an afternoon of complex tests , I was diagnosed with PCA , an uncommon variant of dementia , which had escaped the eagle eye of the original diagnostician .
When in Paradise Lost Milton ’s Satan stood in the pit of hell and raged at heaven , he was merely a trifle miffed compared to how I felt that day .
I felt totally alone , with the world receding from me in every direction and you could have used my anger to weld steel .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' I know people who have got better from a brain tumour .
I do n't know anyone who 's got better from Alzheimers '
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only my family and the fact I had fans in the medical profession , who gave me useful advice , got me through that moment .
I feel very sorry for , and angry on behalf of , the people who do n’t have the easy ride I had .
It is astonishing how long it takes some people to get diagnosed ( I know because they write to me ) .
I cannot help but wonder if this is because doctors are sometimes reluctant to give the patient the stigma of dementia since there is no cure .
I was extremely fortunate in my GP .
I think she was amazed to find that of the two specialists in my area , one had no experience of PCA and therefore did not feel he could help me and the other would only take on patients over 65 - at 59 I was clearly too young to have Alzheimer’s .
I remember on that day of rage thinking that if I ’d been diagnosed with cancer of any kind , at least there would have opened in front of me a trodden path .
There would have been specialists , examinations , there would be in short , some machinery in place .
I was not in the mood for a response that said , more or less , ‘ go away and come back in six years ’ .
My wife said : ‘ Thank goodness it is n’t a brain tumour , ’ but all I could think then was : ‘ I know three people who have got better after a brain tumour .
I have n’t heard of anyone who ’s got better from Alzheimer ’s . ’
Undeniable signs
It was my typing and spelling that convinced me the diagnosis was right .
They had gone haywire .
Other problems I put down to my looming 60th birthday .
I thought no one else had noticed the fumbling with seat belts and the several attempts to get clothing on properly , but my wife and PA were worrying .
We still have the occasional Clapham Junction days , now understood and dealt with .
I have written 47 novels in the past 25 years , but now I have to check the spelling of even quite simple words - they just blank on me at random .
Grand memories : Terry Pratchett shows the OBE he received from the Prince of Wales on behalf of The Queen in 1998
I would not dare to write this without the once despised checker , and you would have your work cut out to read it , believe me .
On the other hand - and this is very typical of PCA - when the kind lady who periodically checks me out asked me to name as many animals as I can , I started with the rock hyrax , the nearest living relative to the elephant , and thylacine - the probably extinct Tasmanian marsupial wolf .
That ’s the gift or the curse of our little variant .
We have problems handling the physical world but can come pretty close to talking our way out of it so you do n’t notice .
We might have our shirts done up wrong , but might be able to convince you it ’s a new style .
I felt that all I had was a voice , and I should make it heard .
It never occurred to me not to use it .
I went on the net and told , well , everyone .
I wish I could say it was an act of bravery .
It was n’t and I find that suggestion very nearly obscene .
How brave is it to say you have a disease that does not hint of a dissolute youth , riotous living or even terrible eating habits ?
Anyone can contract dementia ; and every day and with a growing momentum , anybody does .
Disease of knowledge
It occurred to me that at one point it was like I had two diseases - one was Alzheimer ’s and the other was knowing I had Alzheimer’s .
There were times when I thought I ’d have been much happier not knowing , just accepting that I ’d lost brain cells and one day they ’d probably grow back or whatever .
It is better to know , though , and better for it to be known , because it has got people talking , which I rather think was what I had in mind .
The $ 1 million I pledged to the Alzheimer ’s Research Trust was just to make them talk louder for a while .
Success : Pratchett made his name with his well - loved Discworld novels
It is a strange life when you ‘ come out ’ .
People get embarrassed , lower their voices , get lost for words .
Part of the report I ’m helping to launch today reveals that 50 per cent of Britons think there is a stigma surrounding dementia .
Only 25 per cent think there is still a stigma associated with cancer .
The stories in the report - of people being told they were too young or intelligent to have dementia ; of neighbours crossing the street and friends abandoning them - are like something from a horror novel .
It seems that when you have cancer you are a brave battler against the disease , but when you have Alzheimer ’s you are an old fart .
That ’s how people see you .
It makes you feel quite alone .
It seems to me there ’s hardly one family in this country that is not touched by the disease somehow .
But people do n’t talk about it because it is so frightening .
I swear that people think that if they say the word they ’re summoning the demon .
It used to be the same with cancer .
Journalists , on the other hand - I appreciate that other people living with the disease do n’t get so much of this - find it hard to talk to me about anything else , and it dominates every interview :
Yes , I said I had PCA ten months ago , yes , I still have it , yes , I wish I did n’t , no , there is no cure .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' When you have cancer you are a brave battler against the disease , but when you have Alzheimer ’s you are an old fart '
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can’t really object to all this , but it is strange that a disease that attracts so much attention , awe , fear and superstition is so underfunded in treatment and research .
We do n’t know what causes it , and as far as we know the only way to be sure of not developing it is to die young .
Regular exercise and eating sensibly are a good idea , but they do n’t come with any guarantees .
There is no cure .
Researchers are talking about the possibility of a whole palette of treatments or regimes to help those people with dementia to live active and satisfying lives , with the disease kept in reasonably permanent check in very much the same way as treatments now exist for HIV .
Not so much a cure therefore as - we hope - a permanent reprieve .
We hope it will come quickly , and be affordable .
In the meantime we hope for Aricept , which is not a cure but acts as a line of sandbags against the rising tide of unknowing .
However , it is available free only to those in the moderate stages of the disease : others must pay £ 1,000 a year , which I do .
Eligibility is determined by the MMSE questionnaire test , and it would be so easy for a patient in the mild stage to cheat their score into the free zone that I take my hat off to
those too proud or responsible to do so .
I cough up .
Gradual unwinding
NICE says the change it makes at my stage is minimal , but we do n’t think so in our house , where those little changes make the difference between a dull day and a fine day .
The disease is , after all , about small changes , and it may be that individuals may indeed be individual .
And that is nearly it for hope at the moment .
When my father was in his terminal year , I discussed death with him .
I recall very clearly his relief that the cancer that was taking him was at least allowing him ‘ all his marbles ’ .
Dementia in its varied forms is not like cancer .
Dad saw the cancer in his pancreas as an invader .
But Alzheimer ’s is me unwinding , losing trust in myself , a butt of my own jokes and on bad days capable of playing hunt the slipper by myself and losing .
You ca n’t battle it , you ca n’t be a plucky ‘ survivor ’ .
It just steals you from yourself .
And I ’m 60 ; that ’s supposed to be the new 40 .
The baby boomers are getting older , and will stay older for longer .
And they will run right into the dementia firing range .
How will a society cope ?
Especially a society that ca n’t so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care ?
What is needed is will and determination .
The first step is to talk openly about dementia because it ’s a fact , well enshrined in folklore , that if we are to kill the demon then first we have to say its name .
Once we have recognised the demon , without secrecy or shame , we can find its weaknesses .
Regrettably one of the best swords for killing demons like this is made of gold - lots of gold .
These days we call it funding .
I believe the D - day battle on Alzheimer ’s will be engaged shortly and a lot of things I ’ve heard from experts , not always formally , strengthen that belief .
It ’s a physical disease , not some mystic curse ; therefore it will fall to a physical cure .
There ’s time to kill the demon before it grows .

On September 5 , the ballot - qualified Constitution Party of Montana submitted its presidential elector candidates to the Secretary of State .
The party informed the Secretary of State that its electors are pledged to Ron Paul for president and Michael Peroutka for vice - president .
Ron Paul was aware that the party planned to do this , and has said that as long as he can remain passive and silent about the development , and as long as he need not sign any declaration of candidacy , that he does not object .
There has been several videos that are trying to be passed off as the Harvey Weinstein sex tape , however most of them have been ...
So we were kicking around the lab for the weekend with nothing much to do ( ok , ok , we have plenty to do but we decided to goof off ) .
And what do any self - respecting Tech Geeks do with a little time on their hands ?
We take stuff apart of course .
This time our victim was the Dell Studio Hybrid .
We 'll be showcasing this machine next week in on our Video Spotlight channel but this sneak peek will actually give you a pretty solid understanding of what the Studio Hybrid is made of .
Actually , you 'll see exactly what she 's made of here ...
The Dell Studio Hybrid , that we 'll be looking at next week , is built upon an Intel 965 chipset with integrated X3100 graphics .
Though you wo n't be doing any serious gaming on the machine , it certainly can serve nicely as a Home Theater PC .
Dell ships the Hybrid with an optional Blu-ray optical drive as well .
Of course we took a video of the entire disassembly process , which was an absolute piece of cake .
Three screws and you 're in , which definitely makes for easy upgrades on things like system memory , hard drives and possibly a processor , with the right BIOS support .

Google 's new Chrome browser borrows so much from Opera 's browser , we had to ask Jon von Tetzchner , Opera 's CEO , an obvious question today - had Google hired any of his staff ?
" No . "
He did n't sound too upset , though , that Google has half - inched so many features from Opera in a smash - and - grab raid .
" Some things we recognise from Opera - putting tabs at the top [ and the address bar in the tab ] , speed dial , and basically the search and find - but that shows we 're doing something right . "
You might think he 's entitled to be - since these features will be new to 99 per cent of the world 's PC - based web surfers , who may credit Google with the innovations .
But von Tetzchner told us that Chrome 's biggest innovation is n't one Opera is in a rush to emulate .
Because Chrome is designed for running web apps , he says , " the focus is on keeping different processes for different windows - that 's a very heavy duty thing to do .
It 's an OS approach rather than a browser approach . "
And something not considered worth following .
Opera 's message to developers is twofold : it will incorporate Google Gears , the runtime that allows Google web applications to run offline , and continue to promote widgets .
Opera 's widgets will run across all of its platforms , from the Nintendo Wii to mobile devices and set - top boxes .
The Opera CEO says Google 's Chrome is good news for developers , ultimately , and for Opera :
" If they take some market share from Microsoft , then that 's good for us - because their standards implementation is better than Internet Explorer 's . "
But while Gears is already slated for inclusion in Opera , von Tetzchner does n't see much else in the code base he'd want to to take .
" Gears is something all the browsers are putting in - everyone has agreed to put in Gears .
When it comes to other parts of Chrome , I would expect us not to take anything from it . "
Why not ?
" We want to control our own code , and not be dependent on others .
We have had open source components in Opera , but we 've taken then out because customers have been asking us to remove them . "
Like ?
" There 's a JPEG decoder , and things like that , that every browser has used .
We made some better code and replaced it with our own .
We would n't have done it if customers did n't ask , but we did get the code down from 150 kb to 5 kb . "
Everyone works for Google ?
Doubts have been raised about the future of the Mozilla Foundation since the extent of Google 's browser ambitions became apparent , yesterday .
While the two have signed an agreement to continue their relationship until 2011 , almost 85 per cent of the " non profit " Foundation 's income is derived from the deal , whereby Mozilla refers Firefox users to Google 's search engine .
We now know Google has been hiring the best Mozilla developers , and surely there 's little it needs from the Foundation any more .
But then some of the same doubts may pertain to Opera , too .
Not long ago , Opera was the only browser that charged money for a licence - which perhaps explains why it is such high quality , user - focused design - but struck a referral deal with Google that permitted it to be released as a free download .
Should Google attain a monopolistic share of the internet advertising market ( it 's already under such scrutiny in the US - and controls 81 per cent of the UK market ) , might these sweet deals not end ?
" I do n't think Google is going to take 100 pc market share in advertising , " said von Tetzchner .
" We have deals with multiple parties .
When it comes to advertising , there are different advertising companies .
I think there will always be competition : Microsoft and Yahoo !
are very big players , and we work with big regional companies like Baidu . "
Then a dark cloud appeared on the distant horizon :
" If Google were to own both search and services , then that 's another story . "
Naturally .
If there 's only one great big computer in the world - why would you use a terminal made by anyone else ? ®
ST .
CLOUD - Appealing to business leaders and party faithful for support , Rep. Michele Bachmann retreated Tuesday from her televised claim that Barack Obama " may have anti-American views , " but also asserted that " a trap was laid " that prompted her remark .
While Bachmann was on the defensive , her political problems invigorated the supporters of her DFL challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg at a packed town hall meeting in Blaine Tuesday night , as the race gained national attention and Tinklenberg reaped extra campaign dollars .
" Thank you , Michele ! " one man shouted , setting off gales of laughter .
Bachmann , a Republican , defended herself during campaign stops at a lumber company , at a GOP campaign storefront and before the Rotary Club in St. Cloud .
In her talk to the Rotary Club , she blamed Chris Matthews , the host of MSNBC's " Hardball , " for setting the stage for her controversial comments about Obama .
" Sometimes you make a decision about going on a show ... I probably should have said no to Chris Matthews . "
" I had never seen his show before , " she said .
" I probably should have taken a look at what the show was like ... A trap was laid , but I stepped into it .
" I made a misstatement .
I said a comment that I would take back . "
Matthews on Friday asked Bachmann whether she believed that Obama may have anti-American views .
Bachmann replied : " Absolutely , I 'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views . "
But in her address to the Rotary in St. Cloud , Bachmann said : " I did not , nor do I , question Barack Obama 's patriotism ... I did not say that Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American . "
Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Bachmann 's MSNBC comments , which included her call for the news media to conduct an " exposé " on the views of members of Congress to " find out are they pro-America or anti-America . "
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell cited that remark as " nonsense " while endorsing Obama over the weekend .
More than $ 1 million in contributions have poured into the campaign coffers of Tinklenberg , his campaign said , since Bachmann 's appearance on " Hardball . "
Debating the impact
While Bachmann told the Rotary luncheon crowd of 100 that she did n't question Obama 's patriotism , she added : " I 'm very concerned about Barack Obama 's views .
I do n't believe that socialism is a good thing for America . "
Except for some local television interviews , this was Bachmann 's first formal public appearance since the Friday interview .
She appeared before a business group generally supportive of GOP candidates in a city where many voters share her opposition to abortion .
In a brief question - and - answer session following Bachmann 's speech , local business leaders asked her about taxes , the $ 700 billion rescue package for Wall Street , allegations of voter fraud and transportation concerns in the district .

A man who plagued a village with poison pen letters was handed an anti-social behaviour order today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Graham Speed accused a senior doctor of fathering a love child , claimed an RAF serviceman was a sex pest , and alleged a shop manager kicked him as he lay on the floor .
The 52 - year - old waged his campaign by humiliating his victims on websites and sending hundreds of emails to fellow villagers in Harmston , Lincolnshire .
Today Speed was served an anti-social behaviour order ( Asbo ) at Lincoln Magistrates '
Court banning him from the village and from contacting his 17 victims .
He was not in court throughout the three - day hearing .
District Judge Richard
Blake said : " I will be frank , this is quite an extraordinary case and with nearly 20 years at the bar and nine at the bench , I have seldom come across a case where I have seen so many genuine victims come before a court and express the distress that they have suffered .
" We live in a society where if you are a professional person and allegations are made of misconduct then they are investigated and I have seen a number of innocent and decent people in the last few days who have suffered restrictions on their work and mistrust and fear in their relationships for no other reason than an evil complaint by somebody .
" He ( Speed ) has chosen not to attend the hearing and he has put his victims through the ordeal of giving evidence and then they have had to face the allegations again in the newspapers .
" The victims are likely to have been significantly traumatised and this is likely to continue even after the stalking by Mr Speed .
" People are fearful of walking down the street , that they might bump into him and what might be his next allegation .

" This will stop or Mr Speed will go to prison and the order I have made carries up to five years . "
The court heard unemployed Speed wrote to the wife of Dr Odiri Oteri , a gynaecologist at Lincoln County Hospital , claiming her husband had fathered a love child .
The General Medical Council investigated the false claims before Dr Oteri was cleared of any wrong - doing .
Speed also accused Shaun Braithwaite , manager of Tesco in Lincoln , of insulting disabled people before kicking him as he lay on the ground , having slipped on the shop 's floor .
The court heard they had argued over disabled parking bays at the store and Speed sent several malicious emails detailing his allegations against Mr Braithwaite to local media organisations , including the BBC .
Mr Braithwaite said : " There were allegations that Mr Speed had found rat droppings in a cereal packet he had bought from the store , allegations that we were not complying with fire regulations and we had a visit from four or five different fire officers .
" When somebody sends emails about you questioning your integrity , that are exceptionally personal and totally unfounded , it causes great distress .
" It impacts on your home life , you discuss it with your partner and it creates this doubt about why somebody is doing this . "
Ewen Stockbridge , an RAF serviceman , was secretly filmed by Speed before he posted the video on the internet under the heading : " Sex pest caught on CCTV . "
He said he was questioned for three hours by his bosses as a result of the video .
Another victim of Speed was police community support officer Sarah Lingard , whom he accused of " voyeurism " .
He also alleged her lesbian partner Tanya Brumpton frightened his wife with her French mastiff dog .
Villager Zena Waite said Speed 's behaviour had a significant impact in Harmston , which is famed for its picture postcard setting .
She said : " An awful lot of people in the village felt that he had made spurious comments about them on the internet and it did cause quite a lot of ill - feeling . "
The court heard there were revenge attacks against Speed , including CCTV cameras outside his house , named Fairytale Cottage , being damaged and acid poured on his car bonnet .
Richard Marshall , representing Speed , said his client did not attend court as he suffered from a condition that caused mini-strokes .
Instead he read a statement from Speed .
It read : " When I have had disputes with my neighbours , I do n't think the police have dealt with them fairly .
" I said what I said because I genuinely believed I was acting in the public interest by bringing injustice and corruption to a wider audience . "
Mr Marshall said the case against his client was not just a " one - way street " and Speed was , to a " significant extent " , a victim .
Lincolnshire Police said the case required its own dedicated officer for two years , cost about £ 200,000 and involved the taking of 77 witness statements .
The Asbo , which was due to be handed to Speed this afternoon by police , also banned him from contacting his local newspaper with malicious stories , posting slanderous comments on the internet and making false allegations against anybody in Lincolnshire .
This woman seems to be making it up as she goes .
I am losing count on the ever - growing , long list of lies and distortions .
Certainly , she must realize that people are fact checking …
Sheesh ..

The Alaska governor has no command authority over the guardians of U.S. airspace despite her recent suggestion otherwise .
“ She does n’t have any role in that process , ” Air Force Maj .
Allen Herritage , spokesman for the AlaskaNorth American Aerospace Defense Command , told the Daily News .
“ The authority to launch and respond to a Russian incursion lies with the Alaska NORAD Region commander ” – Air Force Lt. Gen. Dana Atkins , he said .
Palin said last week that her foreign policy experience includes facing the Russians .
“ It ’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia , as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America – where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska , ” Palin told CBS ‘ Katie Couric .
“ It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , ” she said .

Jordanian police arrested a local writer on Tuesday for incorporating verses of the Qur'an , the Muslim holy book , into his love poetry , a judicial official said .
The poet , Islam Samhan , published his collection of poems , Grace like a Shadow , which allegedly insults the holy book , without the approval of the Jordanian government , the official added .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media .
Samhan was charged with harming the Islamic faith and violating the press and publication law for combining the sacred words of the Qur'an with sexual themes .
If convicted the poet could face up to three years in jail .
Jordanian law bans the publication of any books or articles that could be seen as harmful to Islam and its Prophet Muhammad .
More than two years ago , the court convicted the editors of two weekly newspapers of insulting Islam and sentenced them to two months in prison after they reprinted Danish political cartoons of Muhammad .
Jordanian writers and artists urged the government in a collective petition to immediately release the poet , saying the arrest is a " retreat in the freedom of expression , " and called for an end to the " oppression of freedom and intimidation practiced against intellectuals . "

A story about a physics exam …
October 15 , 2008 By Paul Wagorn
Sometimes it ’s easy to get caught within the bounds of where an accepted solution “ should ” come from .
We need to look a the tools that we are given , and get creative not just with the solution , but with the tools themselves .
The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen .
The story goes like this :
“ Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer . ”
One student replied : “ You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer , then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground .
The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building . ”
This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately .
The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct , and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case .
The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct , but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics .
To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics .
For five minutes the student sat in silence , forehead creased in thought .
The arbiter reminded him that time was running out , to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers , but could n’t make up his mind which to use .
On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows :
“ Firstly , you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper , drop it over the edge , and measure the time it takes to reach the ground .
The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared .
But bad luck on the barometer . ”
“ Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer , then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow .
Then you measure the length of the skyscraper ’s shadow , and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper . ”
“ But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it , you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum , first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper .
The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sq root ( l / g ) . ”
“ … or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase , it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths , then add them up . ”
“ If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it , of course , you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground , and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building . ”
“ But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods , undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor ’s door and say to him ‘ If you would like a nice new barometer , I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper ’ . ”
The student was Niels Bohr , who was known for proposing the model of the atom wherein the electrons were much like the planets in our solar system orbiting around the nucleus .
Niels
Bohr went on to be the first Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics and even had an element named after him .
One of his sons also subsequently won a Nobel Prize .
Now disappointingly , this story is not true .
It was first printed by Reader ’s Digest in 1958 and has been reprinted in various forms ( and with different people other than Niels Bohr ) .
That being said , it still demonstrates one concept quite clearly :
Sometimes the “ correct ” answer is not always the “ right ” answer .

There is an invention using cardboard to measure height .
Its using 2 similar triangles principle , one big imaginery triangle on landscape , the other is small triangle drawing on cardboard .
Those triangles are having same angles , ratio of triangles sides are equal to drawing scale .
If one of triangle side lenght known , the rest can be calculated by measuring small triangle on cardboard .
Please check to : http://maruzar.blogspot.com/2011/12/measure-height-from-distant-with.htmlYou can draw scale map by using the same triangles method , the produced map is good enough to check landscape distance , area , and landscape planning , etc. .
And its simple enough to play treasure hunt game .
http://maruzar.blogspot.com/2011/12/drawing-simple-scale-map-by-triangle.htmlYes people want predictable results according to accepted theory .
This turns something that would be enjoyable , the search for knowledge , into something unpleasant since truth is not its goal .
Rather , our modern system demands adherence to dogma despite the evidence opposing the accepted idea .
Thus , something fun is turned into something painful .
Physics is indeed fun and helps describe the world through numerical analysis .
However , if it is not corrected it will not fulfill its promise .
Information that criticizes the legitimacy of the constancy of speed of light indicates that Relativity might be wrong .
Paul Davies of an American University indicated that that might just be the case .
So many classes and schools are simply teaching / preaching / forcing conformity to create employees who will behave in a predictable , dependable , if not creative , fashion .
You have to learn how to do that to become a teacher .
Students who can't tolerate such environments are punished by sending them to schools that are even worse .
The lucky ones are discovered by some iconoclast who moves them to an environment that rewards all the behaviors described above .
But there are so few who are so lucky .
After reading all the comments , i would say that they are interesting and at the same time hilarious .
I am a high school senior and have an early admit from Dartmouth College .
I am planning to major in Physics .
I do n't think American Universities stifle creativity and independent thought .
My elder brother graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in Mathematics .
Some faculties do want narrow - minded answers but that 's prevalent everywhere , may be even @ Harvard or MIT .
By the way , i came across these excellent physics flash cards .
Its also a great initiative by the FunnelBrain team .
Amazing !!!
The really strange thing is that some of the " wrong " answers will give more accurate results than the right one !
I do n't know if this counts , but I once had to do an experiment in a group where the teacher threw away our results on the grounds that they were wrong .
She then insisted that we all do the lab write - up anyway , including a table of results and a conclusion explaining those results .
No one else in the group bothered to do it but I was annoyed so I drew the table and left it blank , wrote a conclusion that was two pages long which was worded so that it could 've applied to any set of results , taken from any experiment , with even the slightest variation within the set .
I was not failed for being insolent , I was not failed for being wrong .
I was failed on the grounds that the teacher did n't believe that most of the words I had used existed .
The teacher was a graduate of Harvard and teaching at the International School Of Geneva .
Just goes to show .
I did something similar to this in my 1st year college calculus class .
I was given a question to prove that point x was equidistant from points a and b.
I used a geometry proof : 1. Construct a line AB between points a and b.2 .
Construct a line perpendicular to AB , bisecting AB at point c , such that AC = BC3 .
If point x falls on the new line , it is equidistant from a and b ( as are all points on this new line ) by side - angle - side ( AC = BC , ACX = BCX , and CX = CX , therefore AX = BX ) It was an introductory question to get some idea how much calculus we knew prior to taking the course .
I , of course , knew nothing of calculus , and what little of geometry I remembered was from 7 years prior .
My teacher , though , was very accepting .
I have to thank her for that .
CGE wrote : " participate in current research " Well , in math , that is as simple as reading a few papers .
In an experimental science it 's different .
However , few undergrads doing " research " for profs are doing more than being cheap hands .
They do n't really have the background toparticipate in current physics research at any higher level .
It is different in graduate school - - it 's sort of difficult to do high energy physics on the experimental level without access to a high end accelerator etc.CGE , We are kindred spirits .
I agree that at the highest level , it could be helpful to ask professors questions .
I did n't because I enjoyed working the stuff out on my own and I was independent -- perhaps to a fault .
And , I was going to post the same things you did in response to Robert , but did n't want to start a flame war .
As to nanotech , solar energy etc. , these areas require lots of old physics -- onereason I chose them .
Such things as the domination by viscous forces at a certain scale , thermodynamics etc .
Similarly for the nuclear physics experiments that I mentioned .
Building Geiger Detectors teaches principles of electron flow , and building cloud chambers teaches principles of thermodynamics .
My high school physics course ( 1960's ) New York City , included derivations ofPV=nRT from the assumption of molecular chaos , a derivation of the Bohr atom , special relativity , derivation of Kepler 's laws etc.
Today , that would ( sadly ) be considered remarkable -- but back then it was standard .
I found it boring , as I had read much more physics on my own , but it wasa very good background for most students .
All I can say to this is lol .
This is basically the exact experience that I have had with the post - secondary institutions within the United States .
I can honestly say that for the majority that professors and the institution wish to stifle creativity and independent thought .
The narrow minded answers they want completely disregard the plethora of other choices that would reveal the correct answer .
Whether or not the story is true , this is the attitude of the American educational institute , for those that think outside the box continue to .
Revolutionist , non-conventionalist , and the blatant disregard for normalcy are the fundamentals to continuing our species in the area of science .
In response to Mr. Oetting , I personally think that most students choosing to take an AP Physics course are going to be taking it to learn physics , not to learn how to study .
I 'm not convinced that making physics secondary is wise or appropriate ; there are other ways to learn how to study .
One way , for example , might be to simply structure and teach the course as if it were university - level .
As for contemporary work , as Penny noted , nanotech is interesting , though I 'm a bit biased .
However , I think that focusing on recent developments can be unfortunate in a low level physics course .
Most recent physics work is built so heavily upon older theories that understanding it well is n't possible without a good grasp of basic physics .
Thus , your students will only be able to hear about things that sound impressive , without being able to really understand them , or do any theoretical work from basic principles .
That gives a very distorted view of physics , and makes real physics all the more shocking for undergraduates when they reach it .
Quite a bit of very old physics is also very beautiful and interesting , and could probably be taught to bright 12th grade students .
I 'm particularly fond of classical mechanics , Noether 's theorem , Lagrangians , and so on ; the math is wonderful , and neat , and the applications are amazing in their range .
Statistical mechanics , too , is wonderful , with absurdly simple calculations being able to make startlingly accurate approximations .
Do n't assume that older areas of physics wo n't be interesting to students simply because they are old ; many of them , if taught correctly , can be far more interesting , because the students would be learning real physics , from first principles , rather than something that is necessarily just memorization .
Memorization is not physics ; one should be able to go quite far with only a handful of equations .
Penny , it seems your story is remarkably similar to mine .
It does seem that junior high school is far more concerned with pointless procedure than actual teaching , and also that the teachers and administration there can be extremely hostile to the brightest students .
In one junior high , in a program for gifted students , instead of teaching at a higher level , some teachers decided to just give us so much work at the same level that we could n't possibly finish it .
When I discussed leaving and going to university early with some of my friends , some of our teachers actually added a section into their curriculum forcing us to repeatedly listen to all the reasons why we should n't do so , and how it would destroy our lives ; it did n't keep a around dozen of us from leaving .
I must admit , though , that I 'd never thought of sending them a triumphant letter now .
However , I 'm not sure I 'd entirely agree with your view of universities , and I do believe they serve a useful purpose even for bright students .
While things like MIT 's materials and the variety of very useful books are all nice , the ability to discuss things with professors , participate in current research , and generally be around colleagues can all add to one 's understanding and make things more enjoyable and productive .
I often ignored many lectures , and learned things from books like Landau 's series instead , but being able to ask questions and discuss things with professors was quite helpful , especially at higher levels .
I do think that these things are very dependent on the university and the department , so at some universities , such procedural nonsense might be strictly enforced .
At my university , when I thought that I knew classical mechanics well enough that the undergraduate level course would be pointless , I was told that I could take the graduate level course instead , and had quite a bit of fun learning far more interesting aspects of nonlinear and chaotic systems , complex canonical transforms , and so on .
When I noted that taking a programming course , required for physics majors , would be boring for me , and pointed to the code for my research , I was exempted from the requirement entirely , without the slightest argument .
My department actually encouraged students to do things differently and skip useless work , and respected them more for doing so : one professor I worked with was held in particular awe among the faculty in the department because , when he was an undergraduate at the university , he had decided to skip * all * of the undergraduate physics courses , and proceeded to only take graduate - level courses .
Ben ,
The length of the barometer is not needed .
Simply provide the answer in units of 1 barometer length .
Dear Robert , There are lots of interesting and elementary physics problems that arise in" nanotech " .
You might give a few to your students .
That 's contemporary .
Also include the Feynman article ( on the web ) that inspired the field .
Similarly , solar power is a good field for them to explore - - both computationally and in the lab .
They might also enjoy a unit based on cloud chambers , Geiger counters , and simple experiments .
I had an " atomic energy kit " as a child -- including thisstuff and a spintheroscope , and a zinc sulfide screen etc .
They should build the cloud chambers and Geiger Counters .
Lots of good physics in designing and building telescopes and their use in astronomy too .
Today , with the amazing things available on the web , such as MIT 's open courseware , school is even more worthless for a bright motivated kid .
I wrote : " When I was a freshman at uni , we were given physics exams and required toshow all the arithmetic at every stage .
I would n't do that , and did all the algebra and calculus first–and lost points on every test .
" To be clear , they wanted us to not use variables and derive formulae and then substitute the numbers at the end .
When I did use formulae -- correctly , and lost points , I was told " You are not ready to do that .
" In retrospect , I should have gone to the chairman of the department , and told him I wanted to skip undergraduate school and take my Phd qualifiers .
I was only 15 and scared to death of authority figures .
That is because the sort of teachers I had in elementary school and JHS as described above had battered me to an emotional fine pulp .
I had taught myself most of the physics I knew ( though I had high school physics ) by reading Dover books and an early version of the Feynman lectures .
I once had a Junior High School teacher , in a special program for gifted kids , decide on the last day to grade our notebooks .
I did n't have one -- but , I had a perfect grade on the all the tests .
He battered me for hours , gave me a very low grade , and told me " I do n't care how smart you think you are , if you do n't learn to keep a notebook , you will never get through high school , let alone into college . "
I told him to open the textbook and ask me to recite it backwardsfrom memory starting anywhere -- but he did n't care .
In the same year , I had an arithmetic teacher who insisted on her own " method " of arithmetic , which mostly involved many cross checks for mistakes .
For example to add a column of three figure numbers , one had to add up , add down , andcast out nines , and cast out elevens .
I just did all the problems mentally - - quite easily and quickly and got them all correct -- but with the points deducted fornot following orders -- I was failing .
I offered to do an extra credit report to pass , and this was accepted and I didthe report on the special theory of relativity -- with the equations derived .
My teacher failed me anyway , and told my parents that : : Your daughter might be another Einstein , but she will fail in life if she does n't learn to conform .
" About ten years later I sent them both a letter on Institute for Advanced Studystationary ( as I was a member that year ) which said : " I still do n't have a notebook , and I never learned to conform .
" School --- basically , Poison .
Well ok , here is a story of mine :
When I was a freshman at uni , we were given physics exams and required toshow all the arithmetic at every stage .
I would n't do that , and did all the algebra and calculus first -- and lost points on every test .
About three weeks into the course , I was so bored that I decided to solve all the problems using Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics -- and got C's instead of A's for not following procedure -- even if I was displaying a graduate student 's level of understanding !
This was one reason that I entered as a physics major and very quickly became a math major .
The math department liked creativity , let me minor in graduate school ( as an undergrad ) and this led to a very early PhD.
My general principle is that for the really bright students school at all levels is a complete waste of time .
One can just read and follow one 's one interests .
I think a point that a lot of people are missing is that , in this story , the guy could actually answer the question .
In my experience as a teaching assistant , students who give creative answers like this usually can't back it up with a real answer .
They think they can write down some joke and they should get marks , but do n't actually know any answer to the question at all .
It 's not about stifling the creativity of students , it 's about making sure that they can actually answer the damn questions .
I do n't know about you , but I do n't want some jokester designing bridges and office buildings with the engineering degree he learned by being clever .
I 'd prefer someone who knew what they were doing , regardless of whether or not they are a dull guy .
The lesson :
It 's fine to be clever , but do n't be an ass about it .
It 's been about 25 years since I graduated from college , but this story reminds me of something similar that happened to me .
On the final for a digital logic class , the prof gave a problem that went something like this :
You are hired to design the digital logic for a locking mechanism that reads an identity card , decides whether the bearer is supposed to have access to a parking lot the mechanism secures , and opens the gate if the bearer is , and does n't if he does n't .
There are 6 types of bearers : Freshman , Sophomores , Juniors , Seniors , Professors , and Other Inferior Staff Types .
There are three parking lots .
Determine how many bits it 'll take to represent the 6 classes of bearers , assign them unique IDs , and determine the logic circuits necessary to decode the classes into a true / false decision for each parking lot .
Use the least number of logic gates possible .
Then he gave some list of who should be allowed where , of which I remember nothing .
Freshmen only could use lot A , maybe , and sophomores lot B , juniors both A and B , and of course , professors could park anywhere they like .
Now , what he wanted us to do was say you needed three bits to represent 6 classes of bearer , assign them arbitrary three bit codes , 0 through 5 probably , write out the formulas to represent the logic , minimize that , and then sketch out all the and , or , and not gates it would take to come up with the right signal to open the gate .
So of course , that 's not what I did .
If , instead of making the assignment of codes to bearer classes be arbitrary , you instead notice that there are three bits in the bearer code , and three parking lots , and let each bit of the bearer code represent a parking lot , and assign the codes to the bearers intelligently , then you do n't need any logic circuits at all to decode the desired signal !
For instance , if bit 0 represents lot A , and bit 1 lot B , and bit 2 lot C , then the freshman should be assigned bearer code 1 ( 001 in binary ) , sophomores code 2 ( 010 ) , juniors 3( 011 ) , professors should be code 7 ( 111 ) , etc .
This was so obviously the most elegant solution to the problem possible , and the least cost to build , so I wrote all this on the paper .
This problem was worth 30 points on the final out of 100 .
The professor awarded me 5 points for this answer .
Unfortunately , at my school , there was no one to whom to appeal , professor 's grading decisions were final , and I ended up with a B- in the course .
What a pinhead .
Ok , here 's a true story : I was taking a Pascal class at a University in the early 80's .
I was not a regular student there , but was taking the class to catch up on some prereqs so that I could enroll .
Our first assignment was to generate a NxM cell maze , and then to solve the maze programatically .
I spent the first 30 minutes or so writing the program .
Then , because I was curious , rather than just printing the maze and solution ( as required ) , I started displaying the maze , and the progress of the solution to visualize the solution and see if I could come up with a better way of running the maze .
After playing with it for a while and finding several optimizations I packaged it up and turned it all in .
I was expecting an easy " A " on the project since I fulfilled all the requirements , and then some .
The next week I got my program listing back : " Grade : C -- too long .
" What ?
You can't be serious .
I went and talked to the TA , and he said , yes the grade was right , and that the program was way to long given the scope of the project that we were supposed to be doing .
I asked him if he had looked at the code at all , or had run it .
He just looked at me , as if I were pond scum , and said that he had graded the paper .
I went to complain to the professor ( a well known and published researcher and author ) .
He looked at me , looked at the program for about 10 seconds .
He then said " Does it run ? " " Of course , " I replied .
" Show me .
" So , I popped the disk into the computer on his desk and showed him my maze and solution , all drawn out in IBM character graphics ( it was an IBM XT , after all . )
He shook his head , took my paper , scratched out the grade , and wrote in " A " .
He then took out the class book and made a note .
He then said to me , " The mid term is on and the final is on .
They are both open book exams .
Your grade for the class will be determined by those two tests .
You do n't have to turn in any assignments .
However , I will warn you that if you do n't know the material , having an open book will not help you .
" I ended up missing 2 points for the whole quarter .
I think I forgot a semicolon somewhere on one of the code samples .
I teach an AP Physics course to 12th grade boys in a private school .
I tell my students that the first thing they will learn in my course is how to study for a college level science or engineering course .
The second thing they will learn is how to solve problems .
Finally , they will learn some physics , as a vehicle for the first two .
I think this is an instructive story , urban legend or fact , because it illustrates a certain agility in solving problems .
Consequently , I plan to post this site for my students to read .
Any " contemporary " thing I can do to celebrate physics and physicist is welcome !
Thank you .
A Danish student would n't say , " convert the difference in millibars into feet " , they 're on the metric system .
This was clearly written by an American .
Even though this is clearly apocraphyl , there are only two correct answers here - the traditional ' right ' one , and perhaps the final answer .
All the other answers use additional objects that are not available in the question , and so none of them could be correct .
Anyone who has ever answered an exam paper knows that you have to stick to the environment given .
Some might be valid if you knew the length of the barometer , but again there can be no presumption you know that .
This is stupid . " Knowledgeable students can give knowledgeable and technically correct answers to poorly phrased test questions without dignifying the spirit of the question that 's being asked . "
Oh .
Ok .
This has nothing to do with stifling creativity , independent thought , etc .
At all .
The only problem with the ' redo ' was that the redo question was even vaguer than the original .
Hi .
These urban legends travel more than you think .
I heard this story as a lawstudent as an example of the importance for future lawyers to think outside the box .
This must have been 94 or 95 .
I think it was given by the ( then former ) president of the Amsterdam Court , Ben Asscher .
The idea of this being an inspirational little anecdote about creativity , independent thinking , etc. makes me eyeroll .
Even pretending it was true :
The question was obviously not testing the student 's knowledge of determining the height of buildings .
It was testing the student 's knowledge of the ( intended ) use of a barometer , interpreting the measurements it gives , and the math involved in putting those measurements to practical uses .
If the question had been essentially about buildings , any of these answers would be fine .
But given that the question was about barometry , the examiner would have been right to consider it incorrect .
Giving answers like this is not being smart , it 's just being a smartass .
Meanwhilst , if this story is circulated to say something like " Look , geniuses are bad at school , so if you 're bad at school , you might actually be a genius ! "
Now , if some given person is bad at school , they * could * be an unappreciated genius , but most likely not .
So at that this story also fails , just like the equally apocryphal claims that Einstein did poorly in school ( he actually excelled in math class , etc. as any reasonable person would expect ) .
All I can say to this is lol .
This is basically the exact experience that I have had with the post - secondary institutions within the United States .
I can honestly say that for the majority that professors and the institution wish to stifle creativity and independent thought .
The narrow minded answers they want completely disregard the plethora of other choices that would reveal the correct answer .
Whether or not the story is true , this is the attitude of the American educational institute , for those that think outside the box continue to .
Revolutionist , non-conventionalist , and the blatant disregard for normalcy are the fundamentals to continuing our species in the area of science .
I wrote too quickly -- I did n't notice that you said the story was nonsense .
So please ignore my commentPennyThis is nonsense .
I heard this urban legend when i was a high school student and it has been told about practically every physics genius besides Bohr .
One proof that it is nonsense is that such a question would have been -- in Bohr 's day -- in Europe , a question whose answer would have been expected of a twelve year old .
In my school days ( 1960 's ) , it was part of the High School physics curriculumin New York City ( on the state regents exam ) .
In Bohr 's case , there is no waythat he would have been given such a question in university .
Moreover , Bohr did n't get an undergraduate degree in physics -- as they did n't exist at his university -- his only exam would have been his doctoral exam -- as they did n't give exams along the way -- as we do today .

Your backyard ( TGW ) – Hyperion Power Generation ’s “ nuclear - in - a- box ” technology will be available for commercial deployment in 2013 , CEO John “ Grizz ” Deal said .
Hyperion ’s nuclear power reactor units are about the size of a typical backyard hot tub , and are able to generate 70 megawatts of heat energy , or 27 megawatts of electricity from a steam turbine – enough to power 20,000 homes .
The nuclear battery is sealed and buried at the generation site , and taken back to the factory for refueling every five years .
The reactor unit ’s size is supposed to bring down capital costs 30 % and operating costs 50 % .

The Company Store , Debt and Serfdom ( October 24 , 2008 )
Way back in May 2006 I wrote about Michael Hudson 's work on The New Road to Serfdom : A Negative - Equity Mortgage .
I am now thinking there 's another analog to our entire economy : the company store .
I actually lived in one of the last plantation " company towns " in Hawaii , and though Dole Pineapple did n't operate a " company store " in 1969 , earlier plantations ( and coal mining towns , etc. ) did -- and the set - up was sweet indeed .
Much like a serf renting / sharecropping land owned by a manor - house or nobility , the plantation worker needed to borrow money to buy food and other necessities at the company store , which just happened to operate as a monopoly and just happened to charge skyhigh prices .
( The serf needed to borrow seed for the next planting , and money to buy food for the family in between harvests . )
The rate of interest paid by the serf / worker was always much higher than market rates -- another monopoly capital ( and highly profitable ) feature of the set - up .
The system 's most pernicious feature : the worker / serf never escaped debt .
Indeed , the system was constructed to increase the debt to the point it could never be paid off , insuring a lifetime of profitable servitude to the nobility / corporation .
Now the Powers That Be , as embodied in this Republican Administration and its lackeys / minions in both parties , have perfected an entire economy based on this " Company Store " / manor - house model .
As Jesse over at Jesse 's Cafe Americain noted in The Safety and Immediacy of Liquid Assets in a Deleveraging Panic :
This is a critical point , and little debated or understood as it is emotionally charged with words like ' socialism . '
Most do not understand the fractional reserve banking system , but it seems more official , more palatable , to give them billions , enormous sums , and to give the public as little as possible for fear of debasing the value of work and the currency .
Paulson and Bernanke both view the economy as an adjunct to the financial system so from their perspective the choice is obvious .
The power of the serf / company store model is only truly revealed by examining not just negative - equity home mortgages but negative - equity auto loans , credit card debt , etc .
How about the serf who bought an SUV with no money / low money down ?
How much is his auto loan , and how much is the gashog SUV worth now ?
Far less than what he owes ; he has hugely negative equity in not just his house but in his vehicles and indeed , in everything he " owns " which was purchased on credit .
And how about the clothing and TVs and other toys purchased on a zero- interest " teaser rate " credit card ?
How much is all that used stuff worth ?
Ten cents on the dollar ?
And what happens when the debt serf -- who bless his naive little heart , actually believes the illusion that he is " middle class " -- har har har -- is late one payment ?
Bam !
That zero - interest balance is suddenly being charged 23 % interest .
Oh , and the late fee is $ 50 .
And one other thing -- all the other credit cards he " owns " will also pop to 23 % interest because , well , they can raise the rates whenever they want -- but the official excuse is he 's now a " credit risk . "
As if he was ever not a credit risk ?
Just like the worker and the company store , the credit card debt actually rises regardless of how much the worker pays .
It 's a beautiful lifetime system for serfdom / poverty and endless rentier profits for banks .
Thus we read story after story in which a credit card balance of $ 1,500 balloons toover $ 5,000 as interest rates are jacked to 24 % and huge late fees and overdraft fees are levied .
As Merle Travis wrote about the company store :
You load sixteen tons . . . what do you get ?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter do n't you call me ' cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store Exactly what is the difference between the serf or the plantation / mine worker and today 's debt - enslaved " middle - class " peasant ?
A key con of the Company Store model circa 2001 - 2007 was that extracting money from your home equity was essentially identical to withdrawing savings .
This conceit was enabled by absurdly low interest rates and essentially qualification - free money ; if equity is like savings , then withdrawing it -- at almost no extra increase in monthly mortgage payments !-- was just like taking money out of a savings account .
Except for one little tiny feature of the equity extraction -- it was debt , not savings .
Another key con was the illusion that this debt was essentially risk - free .
With house prices rising , and loans getting ever cheaper , then only a fool would forego the chance to extract and spend the " savings " of rising equity .
As often noted here , real wages ( as measured by purchasing power or adjusted for inflation ) has been stagnant since the mid-1970s .
Like the indentured serf , the average " middle class " ( sounds so much better than debt - serf , does n't it ? ) wage earner saw a seemingly golden path out of stagnating purchasing power : borrow more for a lower monthly payment .
But alas , the teaser rates on the adjustable - rate mortgage and the credit cards expired , and now the real costs are being levied .
Many readers write to remind me that " nobody forced anyone to take out the loan , " and that is true .
We all have so - called free will .
But it is naive to focus on free will ( which does not operate in a vacuum but in a cultural and historical context ) and ignore the incredibly concentrated power of the Ministry of Propaganda .
I have illustrated the rough inter-connected structure of the Ministry in this helpful little diagram :
Most astonishingly , the Ministry has succeeded in diverting the nation 's attention from the Company store / debt - serf realities to a bogus " debate " over " socialism " and " capitalism . "
As Michael Hudson has pointed out , the rentier class which owns the mortgages , loans and credit card debt is not capitalist at all ; it is essentially medieval in structure .
It takes no risks , creates no innovations , invests no capital in new enterprises or indeed , performs any classical capitalist functions at all .
It simply indebts the serfs , convinces them via doublespeak , propagands and phony statistics that they are still gloriously " middle class " ( that is , obscuring or reifying their true nature as mere miserable debt serfs ) and then sits back and collects the interest and profits which the debt serfs will be struggling to pay until their last breath .
Nice set - up .
No criminal extortion scheme could be more effective or venal .
We should note that the Democratic members of the Powers That Be all voted for the banker - bailout , knowing full well that the bankers / company store could have been allowed to go bankrupt and the $ 700 billion could have spent -- if it was to be spent at all - - on education , rebuilding bridges , transmission lines , and other desperately needed infrastructure projects .
But this could not be allowed to happen .
Why ?
Because money spent on infrastructure flows directly into workers ' pockets , removing the intermediary debt which is the entire key to the Company Store model .
The Paulson bailout 's key feature is that it does not put a single dollar in the pocket of a mere serf / worker -- every dollar goes to save the current system , which is based on the serf borrowing money constantly at ever higher interest rates .
Correspondents Craig M. and Cheryl A. sent me this link to the inimitable Jesse , whose comments here provide a near - perfect wrapup to the company store / debt - serf model I have described : The New Deal for the Banking System as the Storm Gathers Strength :
We are seeing an enormous parody of Roosevelt 's New Deal being rolled out in a hurried fashion for the bankers and the wealthy under the cloak of dire necessity prior to the likely change in political Administrations .
If we follow the political pattern of the 1930s , we will see a minority of Republicans and a sympathetic majority at the Supreme Court attempt to maintain the disbursal of liquidity largely to the corporations and banks , and to fight any progressive tax increases and social programs designed to push that liquidity directly to the public without passing through the tollgates of the financial system .
If this happens , we may see a powerful polarization in the country between a minority that will attempt to embrace state control to halt those programs and the encroachment on ' true American principles ' and a suffering public , with a middle class pinned between them .
The corporatist appeal will be made to social conservatives , small businessmen , the banks and the corporations that spring up around them , and the lowest elements in the hatreds and prejudices and fears in the public , particularly the older middle class , to retrieve our national honor .
And if against all safeguards and probability this succeeds in gaining power , and burning the Constitution to preserve our freedom becomes a popular slogan , and a slyly articulate but otherwise inexperienced , almost mediocre , leader arises , and the corporate powers support this person in order to achieve their ends , then it will be time to leave , without looking back , before the storm breaks , and madness is unleashed , and a darkness falls over the land .
I would add only this : the middle class is an illusion , a false construct created by the Ministry of Propaganda to provide self - delusional cover for the serfs whose pride might be pricked by a realistic self - assessment of their true servitude .
The only people who can claim to be middle class are those few with virtually no debt and an income independent of the corporations who view employees as expenses to be slashed and burned as needed and the soon - to - be - bankrupt welfare state .
I would estimate that by this more realistic and rigorous definition , no more than 4 % of the nation 's households are truly middle class : independent professionals , small landlords , small business owners with no debt and agile , recession - resistant enterprises , etc .
I suggest the 4 % number based partly on the Pareto Principle of 80/20 which can be further distilled down to 4/64 : thus 1 % of the populace owns 2/3 of the assets , a thin sliver of 4 % are independent of the welfare / corporate state , 64 % labor under the illusion they are somehow " middle class " and the balance are mired in undeniable poverty , which in this nation can be defined as no access to credit .
Here is a google search of the oftwominds.com archives for " Pareto Principle " : oftwominds.com entries on Pareto Principle .
I have also documented this vast divide in wealth / asset - ownership many times .
for example : The U.S.A. : The Third World 's First Superpower ( April 16 , 2008 ) Housing Wealth Effect Shifts Into Reverse ( May 2 , 2006 )
As one last example of the pernicious genius of the company store / debt - serf model , consider the bogus " elite status " offered to those with enough income to funnel through the system to make the owners even more money .
Banks make money off the velocity of money , and the more you funnel through your checking account , the more money they can make off you .
So if you have a large income and spend virtually all of it , they love you , they love you , they love you , and to express their gratitude for your servitude they award you various " elite " status gimmicks which are parodies of true elites .
Feel puffed up when you get to stand in your frequent flyer / " elite " line ?
Sorry to burst your balloon of pride , but the real elites are boarding their private jets out on the tarmac of Kona Airport .
There is one slight advantage to banks ' " elite " accounts -- which as we noted , are awarded based on you giving them large sums of money to leverage for virtually no interest paid -- and that is you do n't get nailed with the outrageous overdraft and late fees which are routinely levied on " middle class " accounts .
Indeed , these $ 50 lates fees and overdraft fees are a major source of banks ' standard profits .
That , and all the money provided by the " elites " free of charge .
There is no shame in being poor in this system ; I am poor by " middle class " standards of income and " ownership " of stuff , and I consider it if not noble them certainly respectable .
Essayist Zeus Y. has graciously answered reader 's followup questions regarding his series of essays on credit default swaps , and provided yet more answers to " to whose benefit ? "
Toxic Liabilities Are Not Assets : Sooner or later we have to recognize a massive fraud has been perpetrated .
It needs to be revealed that major companies have trillions of dollars of junk on their books and are likely not solvent according to traditional notions of solvency .
So we have a Catch - 22 , but not one that will be solved by hiding : expose the fraud and risk likely short - term collapse and re-scaling of economic confidence and systems , or cover the symptoms , hide the toxins , and allow them to fester and rot out the economy in a prolonged sickness that may spread and gain momentum beyond attempts to assuage the problems .
I highly recommend reading the entire essay , as Zeus lists seven excellent propositions for fixing the fundamental issues .

Troops - to - Teachers Program
Purpose
The Troops to Teachers program provides funds to recruit , prepare , and support former members of the military services as teachers in high - poverty schools .
Successful program candidates obtain certification or licensing as elementary school teachers , secondary school teachers , or vocational or technical teachers and become highly qualified teachers .
The program also helps these individuals find employment in high - need local education agencies ( LEAs ) or charter schools .
Under this program , the Secretary of Education transfers funds to the Department of Defense for the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support ( DANTES ) to provide assistance , including stipends of up to $ 5,000 , to eligible members of the armed forces so that they can obtain certification or licensing as elementary school teachers , secondary school teachers , or vocational / technical teachers and become highly qualified teachers by demonstrating competency in each of the subjects they teach .
In addition , the program helps these individuals find employment in high - need local educational agencies ( LEA 's ) or charter schools .
In lieu of the $ 5,000 stipends , DANTES may pay $ 10,000 bonuses to participants who agree to teach in high - poverty schools .

The other day I had a conversation with a Beijing friend and I mentioned that Barack Obama was leading in the presidential race :
She : Obama ?
But he ’s the black man , is n’t he ?
Me : Yes , exactly .
She : But surely a black man could n’t become president of the United States ?
Me :
It looks as if he ’ll be elected .
She : But president ?
That ’s such an important job !
In America , I thought blacks were janitors and laborers .
Me : No , blacks have all kinds of jobs .
She :
What do white people think about that , about getting a black president ?
Are they upset ?
Are they angry ?
Me : No , of course not !
If Obama is elected , it ’ll be because white people voted for him .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The world ’s largest computing grid is ready to tackle mankind ’s biggest data challenge from the earth ’s most powerful accelerator .
Today , three weeks after the first particle beams were injected into the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid combines the power of more than 140 computer centers from 33 countries to analyze and manage more than 15 million gigabytes of LHC data every year .
The United States is a vital partner in the development and operation of the WLCG .
Fifteen universities and three U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) national laboratories from 11 states contribute their power to the project .
“ The U.S. has been an essential partner in the development of the vast distributed computing system that will allow 7,000 scientists around the world to analyze LHC data , complementing its crucial contributions to the construction of the LHC , ” said Glen Crawford of the High Energy Physics program in DOE ’s Office of Science .
DOE and the National Science Foundation support contributions to the LHC and to the computing and networking infrastructures that are an integral part of the project .
U.S. contributions to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid are coordinated through the Open Science Grid , a national computing infrastructure for science .
The Open Science Grid not only contributes computing power for LHC data needs , but also for projects in many other scientific fields including biology , nanotechnology , medicine and climate science .
“ Particle physics projects such as the LHC have been a driving force for the development of worldwide computing grids , ” said Ed Seidel , director of the National Science Foundation ’s Office of Cyberinfrastructure .
“ The benefits from these grids are now being reaped in areas as diverse as mathematical modeling and drug discovery . ”
“ Open Science Grid members have put an incredible amount of time and effort in developing a nationwide computing system that is already at work supporting America ’s 1,200 LHC physicists and their colleagues from other sciences , ” said Open Science Grid Executive Director Ruth Pordes from DOE ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory .
Dedicated optical fiber networks distribute LHC data from CERN in Geneva , Switzerland to eleven major “ Tier - 1 ” computer centers in Europe , North America and Asia , including those at DOE ’s Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois .
From these , data is dispatched to more than 140 “ Tier - 2 ” centers around the world , including twelve in the United States .
“ Our ability to manage data at this scale is the product of several years of intense testing , ” said Ian Bird , leader of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid project .
“ Today ’s result demonstrates the excellent and successful collaboration we have enjoyed with countries all over the world .
Without these international partnerships , such an achievement would be impossible . ”
“ When the LHC starts running at full speed , it will produce enough data to fill about six CDs per second , ” said Michael Ernst , director of Brookhaven National Laboratory ’s Tier - 1 Computing Center .
“ As the first point of contact for LHC data in the United States , the computing centers at Brookhaven and Fermilab are responsible for storing and distributing a great amount of this data for use by scientists around the country .
We ’ve spent years ramping up to this point , and now , we ’re excited to help uncover some of the numerous secrets nature is still hiding from us . ”
Physicists in the U.S. and around the world will sift through the LHC data torrent in search of tiny signals that will lead to discoveries about the nature of the physical universe .
Through their distributed computing infrastructures , these physicists also help other scientific researchers increase their use of computing and storage for broader discovery .
“ Grid computing allows university research groups at home and abroad to fully participate in the LHC project while fostering positive collaboration across different scientific departments on many campuses , ” said Ken Bloom from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , manager for seven Tier - 2 sites in the United States .

VIRGINIA BEACH , Va. , Oct. 23 ( UPI ) -- A Virginia Beach woman appears to have been killed by a pet reticulated python while she was trying to give the 13 - foot snake medication .
Amanda Ruth Black 's husband found her body Tuesday night when he came home , The Virginian - Pilot reported .
She was lying in front of the snake 's empty cage .

Police said the 25 - year - old woman died from asphyxiation .
They found the python in the bedroom and described it as agitated .
The snake was in the custody of Virginia Beach Animal Control .
The reticulated python , native to Southeast Asia , can grow to be more than 30 feet long and competes with the heavier anaconda of South America for the title of longest snake .
Pythons are not venomous and have become popular pets , but experts warn they can be dangerous if they are startled or if not fed correctly .
Lou Dobbs :
Why is there ' no legal recourse against the ACLU '?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties Union has recently been publicizing the existence of a " Constitution - free zone , " extending 100 miles from all US borders , within which the Department of Homeland Security claims the right to search and detain individuals without the " reasonable cause " required by the Fourth Amendment .
CNN 's Lou Dobbs , known as an aggressive campaigner against illegal immigration , was predictably outraged by the ACLU campaign .
Under a graphic reading " ACLU amnesty agenda , " he sneered , " The American Civil Liberties Union claims the Department of Homeland Security 's efforts to enforce immigration laws are ' unconstitutional . '
In point of fact , it is the ACLU actively trying to block enforcement of this nation 's laws .
Is that constitutional ? "
Correspondent Casey Wian briefly reviewed the issue for Dobbs , noting that the ACLU hopes to reduce the Border Patrol 's power of warrantless searches through lawsuits or legislation
The Supreme Court ruled decades ago that the Border Patrol has a right to stop and briefly question drivers at checkpoints near the border , even without having a " reasonable suspicion " of any particular car , in the effort to intercept drug smugglers or illegal aliens .
However , the number of people complaining to the ACLU about Border Patrol harassment has leaped since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and checkpoints have been observed as far as 93 miles from any border .
" What is the point of what they 're suggesting ? "
Dobbs asked .
" They want the borders wide open .
They want amnesty for illegal aliens .
And they want the drug war to continue to be decided in favor of the drug traffickers . "
" There is no legal recourse for an American citizen against the ACLU , is there ? "
Dobbs concluded , laughing .
" Is n't that unconstitutional ? "
Dobbs ' extremist views on the subject of immigration have been an issue for many years .
FAIR has noted that " Dobbs ' tone on immigration is consistently alarmist ; he warns his viewers of Mexican immigrants who see themselves as an ' army of invaders ' intent upon reannexing parts of the Southwestern U.S. to Mexico , announces that ' illegal alien smugglers and drug traffickers are on the verge of ruining some of our national treasures , ' and declares that ' the invasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans ' through ' deadly imports ' of diseases like leprosy and malaria . "
In 2006 , when a immigration bill sponsored by Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy was under consideration , Dobbs complained falsely that the bill would do " absolutely nothing for border security . "
Later in the same broadcast , according to Media Matters , " CNN correspondent Casey Wian characterized Mexican President Vicente Fox 's trip to Salt Lake City , Utah , as a ' Mexican military incursion , ' and claimed that ' [y ] ou could call '
Fox 's trip to the United States ' the Vicente Fox Aztlan tour ' -- drawing a baseless link between Fox and the reconquista movement , which maintains that portions of the American Southwest ( territory referred to by supporters of the theory as ' Aztlan ' ) belong to Mexico .
During Wian 's report , CNN featured a graphic of " Aztlan " that was sourced to the Council of Conservative Citizens ( CCC ) -- an organization linked to white supremacists . "

In Reno , NV today Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made the argument that Obama is too inexperienced to handle a foreign policy crisis .
She used Joe Biden ’s the presidency does n’t lend itself to on the job training line against Obama .
I guess Palin ’s point could also extend to inexperienced running mates of 72 year old presidential candidates .
Palin tried to split Obama and Biden , “ The real problem is that these warnings from Joe Biden are similar to his earlier assessment of Barack Obama .
It was n’t so long ago that he said Barack Obama was n’t up to the job , and that , quote , “ the presidency is not something that lends itself to on - the - job training . ”
The problem is that since this argument is coming from one of the most unqualified vice presidential candidates in history , Palin has to resort to cheerleading for John McCain ’s experience .
“ I want a president who spent 22 years in uniform defending our country .
I want a president who is n’t afraid to use the word “ victory ” when he talks about the wars we are fighting .
I want a president who ’s ready on Day One .
I want a president with the experience and the judgment and the wisdom to meet the next international crisis – or better yet to avoid it .
I want John McCain as our commander - in - chief , Palin continued .
Advertisements
Judging from the fact that the man ca n’t even adequately run a presidential campaign , I have my doubts that John McCain would be prepared on Day One to lead the country .
An example of the kind of judgment that Palin is stressing was when McCain suspended his campaign , ran back to Washington , tried to back out of a debate , then took credit for passing a bill that eventually did n’t pass .
To me this is the type of judgment and leadership that John McCain would bring to the White House .
Sarah “ I can see Russia from my back yard ” Palin has zero credibility with the American people .
She has shown herself to have no foreign policy knowledge , and I believe that putting her on stage to make the experience argument helps Obama and hurts McCain .
The experience argument has n’t worked against Obama yet , and if this is McCain ’s closing argument , Republicans better start preparing themselves for a major defeat in two weeks .
Every day that the McCain campaign spends not talking about the economy is another day that they come closer to losing this election .
Palin quotes
If you believed John McCain and the Republican Party , you ’d think that ACORN is a subversive , sinister organization specifically designed to allow Mickey Mouse ( whom they have registered to vote ) to systematically tear apart “ the fabric of our Democracy ” , strand by strand … .
Nevermind that anyone who actually went to vote while representing themselves as Mickey Mouse would doubtless get caught , and also be committing a felony .
I mean , come on …. what ’s a felony these days ?
Look at Ted Stevens !
He ’s got seven and he ’s still running for the United States Senate with the blessing and support of the Alaska Republican Party !
Also , the GOP would like you to please pay no attention to the fact that John McCain himself was the keynote speaker at a 2006 rally cosponsored by ACORN .
And do n’t listen when he looks at the crowd of people wearing red ACORN t- shirts , “ What makes America special is what ’s in this room tonight . ”
That would just confuse you , dear voter .
Today , ACORN will be releasing its first TV ad , just so you can see how scary they are , and look at all their heinous democracy - fabric - ripping .
This week , ACORN will be on the offense in the media , for a change .
With less than a week left until Election Day , they will try to dirve the media ’s focus to protecting people ’s right to vote , and exposing real cases of GOP voter suppression , while pushing forward with historic “ Get Out the Vote ” efforts .
Voter fraud is a red herring .
Voter suppression is a real threat .
Meet Vint Cerf , the ' father of the internet ' , and find out what he thinks about net neutrality , spam and how we deal with use and abuse of the web
Vinton Gray " Vint " Cerf is a very distinguished , kindly , silver - haired gentleman in a three - piece suit , so perhaps I should n't expect him to ride to our rescue with six guns blazing , but I 'd settle for a small pearl - handled silver pistol .
I want to know who is going to clean up the internet now that it 's full of scammers , spammers and criminals running zombie networks , while its connecting pipes are clogged up with porn - to - porn file swapping .
Sadly ,
Cerf does n't have a silver bullet , either .
" It 's every man for himself , " he says , grinning .
" In the end , it seems every machine has to defend itself .
The internet was designed that way . "
Aiming high
And he should know .
In the early 1970s , Cerf co-designed the TCP / IP protocol suite on which internet communications are based , and was founding president of the Internet Society .
He led the team that engineered the first email service to run over the internet ; he chaired Icann , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ; and he has been working with Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Interplanetary Internet ( bit.ly / vint2 ) .
It may be a case of " tomorrow , the stars " , but the here - and - now can seem a bit of a mess .
Cerf points out that " like every medium , the internet can be abused .
When we think about it , we can commit fraud locally and internationally using the telephone system and postal service .
We can perpetrate a variety of crimes , and in every instance where we have had a technology like that , ultimately society has said : ' There are certain constraints , certain behaviours we will consider to be antisocial .
We may not be able to prevent this happening , but we will choose to have consequences if we catch you . '
" This question comes up annually at the internet governance meetings .
So I wo n't be surprised if there are national and international agreements reached about certain unacceptable behaviours on the net , and they will be enforced to one degree or another . "
However , Cerf is also convinced that it 's the internet 's openness - in allowing people with new ideas to do their thing without getting anyone 's permission - that is the main source of its power .
" So I have this almost schizoid hope that we deal with some of the abuses in the net and , at the same time , we do n't lose this very open environment , so that information - sharing remains as open as it has been , " he says .
One example is Google , a company that Cerf - now 65 - joined three years ago as Chief Internet Evangelist .
" Google would n't exist if Larry [ Page ] and Sergey [ Brin ] had n't just built this thing and tried it out .
The same is true with Jerry [ Yang , co-founder ] at Yahoo , " says Cerf .
The internet hardly needs an evangelist now .
However , it still needs defending , and Cerf has been putting the case for " net neutrality " - a hot topic for US politicians , who are being lobbied by the phone companies .
" We 're expecting new legislation , " he says .
" I think there should be very strong measures to prevent anti-competitive actions , so I 'm actually very sanguine about the passing of legislation in the United States . "
Traffic cops
He says Google 's aim is to ensure open communications , which means equally open to different technologies and different types of traffic .
However , limiting the amount of traffic each person uses is a different matter .
" As long as you get the capacity you 're paying for , that 's a form of fairness , " says Cerf .
" It 's orthogonal to net neutrality . "
As the publicly recognised " father of the internet " and winner of a Turing and other awards , Cerf also opens doors for Google .
Last Wednesday he spent the morning talking at the British Computer Society before visiting the Guardian for a Q&A with a couple of dozen staff over a sandwich lunch .
He started out by showing us his dancing programmable Sony MP3 player , Rolly , which shows we can now put computer power wherever we need it , he says .
It 's really an ice - breaker to show he 's not stuffy .
Suffice it to say that Cerf does n't think the net will be brought to its knees either by botnets or spam .
" Spam is a problem , but we can filter it , " he says , and its demands on capacity are " small relative to the bits carrying images and video " .
As for the zombies , he points out that " the botnet herders do n't want to destroy the internet : they need it to make a living .
We may not think it 's acceptable , but that 's their motivation . "
He also does n't think the net is going to exhibit any form of consciousness .
" I do n't believe we will see grow out of the network the kind of intelligence that sounds like a Fred Hoyle science fiction novel , " he says .
However , " even if the internet is not intelligent and aware , it will feel more intelligent than it does today .
But it 's fair to say that if you want the system to do things you care about , you have to let it know what you care about .
You have to give up some information voluntarily . "
House of cards
Afterwards , over a coffee , I raise the spectre of the " two - tier internet " that some companies would like .
There could be , for example , a trusted , controlled " overnet " for commercial and business use , and an " undernet " where anything goes .
" It 's probably not wise to design systems that assume that a particular subset is trusted , " says Cerf .
" I do n't mean to say you should n't try , but every machine that can be compromised is a potential hazard .
A machine that was OK yesterday is certainly not OK today : it may have ingested an infected memory stick .
At the very least , you have to keep validating it .
My bias right now tends to be ' It 's every man for himself ' - you need to be suspicious whether you 're inside the trusted cloud or not , and when it fails , the house of cards tends to collapse . "
But the continuous validation of known sources is not something for which the internet provides much help .
" The idea of a virtual private network was not part of the original design , " says Cerf , with a grin .
" It was actually an oversight .
It did n't occur to me that it would be useful until afterwards . "
Of course , no one foresaw just how big , or how pervasive , the internet was going to become .
In the end , we should probably be grateful the designers opted not for control but for freedom .

October 3 , 2008  -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fought to protest atrocities in Sudan by dropping assets tied to the country 's brutal regime from the state 's multi-billion - dollar investment fund , she claimed during Thursday 's vice presidential debate .
Not quite , according to a review of the public record – and according to the recollections of a legislator and others who pushed a measure to divest Alaskan holdings in Sudan - linked investments .
" The [ Palin ] administration killed our bill , " said Alaska state representative Les Gara , D - Anchorage .
Gara and state Rep. Bob Lynn , R - Anchorage , co-sponsored a resolution early this year to force the Alaska Permanent Fund – a $ 40 billion investment fund , a portion of whose dividends are distributed annually to state residents – to divest millions of dollars in holdings tied to the Sudanese government .
In an e-mail later , Gara clarified that he believed opposition from the Palin administration helped kill his bill , but was not solely responsible for its death .
In Thursday 's debate , Palin said she had advocated the state divest from Sudan .
" When I and others in the legislature found out that we had some millions of dollars [ of Permanent Fund investments ] in Sudan , we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars , " Palin said .
But a search of news clips and transcripts from the first three months of this year did not turn up an instance in which Palin mentioned the Sudanese crisis or concerns about Alaska 's investments tied to the ruling regime .
Moreover , Palin 's administration openly opposed the bill , and stated its opposition in a public hearing on the measure .
" The legislation is well - intended , and the desire to make a difference is noble , but mixing moral and political agendas at the expense of our citizens ' financial security is not a good combination , " testified Brian Andrews , Palin 's deputy revenue commissioner , before a hearing on the Gara - Lynn Sudan divestment bill in February .
Minutes from the meeting are posted online by the legislature .
Gara says the lack of support from Palin 's administration helped kill the measure .
" I walked out of that hearing livid , " Gara recalled of the February meeting .
Because of the Palin administration 's opposition to the bill , " We could not get a vote in that committee , " he explained .
At no point did Palin come out in support of the effort , Gara said .
The bill 's Republican co-sponsor remembers things differently .
" I know she was very strongly behind this , " said Rep. Lynn .
Asked why , if Palin supported the bill , one of her administration 's officials would speak against it , Lynn demurred .
" We do n't all work in lockstep here , " he said .
" People have different opinions , " he added .
Lynn said he and Palin agreed to re-introduce the bill next January , and push to pass it then .
He declined to consider whether stronger support from Palin would have helped the bill survive this winter .
" I 'm not going to do this what if , what if , what if , " he said .
" These are hypotheticals . "
Gara said that after it was clear the bill had stalled , he and others pressed the administration directly on Sudan divestment .
" We were outraged , " Gara recounted .
" We went to the Commissioner of Revenue and said , ' What the hell are you guys doing ?
This is genocide .
We 're going to keep pushing this until we divest . "
Two months later , at the end of the legislative session , the administration softened its position .
Appearing before a Senate committee which was considering a companion measure to Gara 's bill , Palin 's Revenue commissioner , Patrick Galvin , stated the administration supported such a measure , though it hoped to amend the bill to allow for investments held indirectly , for example in index funds .
" We have a moral responsibility to condemn the genocide in Darfur , " Palin told a reporter in April , through a spokesperson .
" I commend the actions of the Senate State Affairs Committee and I hope the entire legislature gets a chance to weigh in on this matter . "
The Alaska Permanent Fund currently holds $ 22 million in Sudan - linked investments , according to the non-profit Sudan Divestment Task Force .
Divestment advocates say the fund does not need an act of the state legislature to divest itself of those holdings .
The McCain - Palin campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , has been a strong supporter of Sudan divestment efforts , and has urged Americans to liquidate their holdings in companies who do business there .
He was criticized for that position when it was revealed in May his wife Cindy held $ 2 million in investment funds owning shares of Sudan - linked companies .
She sold those holdings following a reporter 's inquiries .

In debate , McCain attacks on Ayers , ACORN Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Within the first half hour of Wednesday night 's debate , John McCain followed through on his promise to bring up all the nasty things his campaign had been saying about Barack Obama in advertisements and on the campaign stump for the last two weeks .
McCain prefaced his attack by playing the victim card , accusing Obama of not repudiating statements over the weekend from Georgia Rep .
John Lewis comparing the rabid fervor prevalent at McCain - Palin rallies with the atmosphere at rallies for the segregationist candidate George Wallace during the civil rights movement .
The GOP candidate went on to charge that Obama needed to fully answer the spurious charges that have been lodged regarding William Ayers and ACORN , the group facing voter fraud charges related to its campaign to register low - income voters .
McCain also whined that Obama has " spent more " on negative advertising than any presidential candidate in history .
This is true , but only because Obama has raised more money -- and hence bought more ads overall -- than any previous candidate .
As a percentage of overall spending , nearly all of McCain 's advertising dollars are funding negative ads , while Obama 's ads are split between positive and negative spots .
Obama pointed out the perception that McCain 's campaign has been negative , but said , " The American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the campaign than addressing the issues . "
Regarding Lewis 's comments , Obama pointed out that his campaign disputed the comparison on the same day it was made , and he noted that neither McCain nor his running mate Sarah Palin had been as willing to condemn their own supporters who had shouted " kill him " or " terrorist " at the mention of Obama 's name .
" When people suggest I pal around with terrorists , then we 're not talking about issues , " Obama said .
McCain insisted he was " proud " of the crowds who attended his rallies , and dismissed the threatening taunts as the product of just a few " fringe " people who said " inappropriate " things .
He noted that some Obama supporters had been less than respectful , as well , signaling out " some T - shirts that are very unacceptable . "
The apparent T - shirts in question , perhaps ironically , refer to Palin using a crude phrase McCain has been accused of launching at his own wife .
Moving on to Ayers , McCain cited Hillary Clinton to argue that voters need to know " the full extent " of Obama 's decade - old encounters with the former ' 60s radical .
The Democratic candidate responded that the two had simply served on the same board of an education charity that happened to have been founded by a former Republican ambassador .
" Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCain 's campaign these last two weeks , " Obama charged .
" Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign , he 's never been involved in this campaign , he will not advise me in the White House . "
To start the evening , moderator Bob Schiefer asked the two candidates to contrast their economic plans to kick off the night .
GOP candidate McCain started by blaming " Fannie and Freddie Mae " for causing the housing crisis by issuing subprime loans .
He went on to tout his plan to spend $ 300 billion for the federal government to buy troubled mortgages .
Obama said he agreed with the need to help middle class homeowners and said he preferred a proposal included in the $ 700 billion economic bailout proposal to allow homeowners to renegotiate their mortgages , rather than purchasing them at potentially inflated values .
" The way Sen . McCain has designed his plan , it could be a giveaway to banks , " Obama charged .
McCain pivoted to an argument on taxes , accusing Obama 's proposal to raise taxes on people earning more than $ 250,000 per year of harming small businesses .
Obama said McCain 's plan would give too many tax breaks to huge companies , such as large oil companies .
The two quibbled over the definition of small businesses , with McCain arguing that half of small business revenue came from small businesses earning more than $ 250,000 .
Obama countered that 98 percent of small businesses earn less than that amount .
The discussion centered around " Joe the plumber , " a small business owner who worried his taxes would rise .
The next question moved on to spending programs with the moderator accusing both candidates of " ignoring reality " with proposals to increase government outlays during an economic crisis .
Obama presented himself as a " supporter of pay as you go , " which would require spending cuts to make up for new programs .
McCain said he would institute an across the board spending freeze -- " that 's a hatchet and then I would get out a scalpel " -- before proposing that he could cut " billions of dollars in defense spending , " presumably by cutting waste .
The self - made maverick argued for a line - item veto before vowing to " certainly " veto every bill that contained pork - barrel spending or earmarks .
The argument carries less weight in the wake of McCain 's vote in favor of the Wall Street bailout , which itself was weighed down with $ 150 billion in earmarks to ensure passage in the House .
The two candidates went on to squabble over Obama 's attempts to depict a McCain presidency as a continuation of the past eight years .
" Senator Obama , I am not President Bush , if you wanted to run against President Bush , you should 've run four years ago , " McCain said .
McCain went on to repeat the disputed accusation that Obama would raise taxes on people making $ 42,000 per year .
Obama noted that " even Fox News " had disputed the accuracy of that accusation .

Still , many McCain supporters on college campuses say theirs is a lonely existence .
“ When I walk down the street carrying my campaign materials , people yell at me , ” said Katie Nix , 22 , the statewide co-chairwoman of Students for McCain who is a senior majoring in molecular biology and French at the University of Wisconsin .
“ I just keep hearing , ‘ Obama ! Obama ! ’ ”
The University of Florida in Gainesville is home to one of the country ’s largest McCain student groups , with more than 1,000 members .
Some of its volunteers stand for nine hours a day in a central campus plaza , pitching to students and selling T - shirts , their only source of campaign money .
The Obama group on campus , though , has hired a shuttle bus to drive Obama - supporting students to an early voting site 20 minutes away .
“ Obviously , we do n’t have the resources for that kind of thing , ” said Joshua Simmons , 20 , the chairman of Gators for McCain .
“ Right now , we ’re just making sure that students know that this organization does exist , and that there are students out there who support McCain . ”
As if to punctuate his point , Mr. Simmons was stopped midsentence while walking through campus recently and talking on his cellphone .
“ What is that , a robot ? ” he said , exhaling noisily .
“ The Obama campaign has a robot set up in the plaza .
It ’s holding a sign that says ‘ Powered by hope . ’
Which I do n’t think is entirely accurate . ”
At a campuswide tailgate affair at Penn State last spring , the Students for McCain doled out $ 100 for food for supporters , then watched as the Obama tailgaters trotted out Michael Robinson , a football player with the San Francisco 49ers , and Franco Harris , a Penn State alum who went on to the football Hall of Fame .
Mr. Natalo was in despair .

The emblem of the United States Northern Command , which was created to support local authorities with homeland security .
United States President George W. Bush deployed the 3rd Infantry Division 's 1st Brigade Combat Team to a new role on United States soil last Wednesday , training for dealing with national crises .
Critics claim that act of the Executive Branch violates the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits military participation in domestic matters .
In 2007 , the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act was introduced ; it overturned the Posse Comitatus Act by allowing the Commander in Chief to suppress ' insurrection ' and ' restore order ' .
When it was repealed in 2008 , Bush stated that he did not respect the later repeal .
The combat team , renamed CCMRF ( C- hemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive C- onsequence M- anagement R-esponse F- orces ) , has been assigned for year - long duty and training at Fort Stewart to prepare them for " civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios " such as security or natural disasters .
After a year , a new unit will take its place .
CCMRF will be under the control of the Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) , and now has the same legal authority as a unit deployed to Iraq under the direct control of the Executive Branch .
The unit will have use of engineer and medical units , the Marine Corps Chemical , Biological Initial Reaction Force , and a Navy weather team , as well as members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency .
A spokeswoman for NORTHCOM added that both wheeled and tank vehicles would be available for the CCMRF .
In July the unit was assigned a new commander , Col. Roger Cloutier .
" If we go in , " he said proudly of the deployment , " we ’re going in to help American citizens on American soil " .
CCMRF will be training in both traffic and riot control equipment , and will be the first to use the Army 's new nonlethal package , which is intended for war - zone and not domestic use .
NORTHCOM 's September 30th statement includes a quote attributed to " future operations division chief " Colonel Michael Boatner saying , “ This response force will not be called upon to help with law enforcement , civil disturbance or crowd control , but will be used to support lead agencies involved in saving lives , relieving suffering and meeting the needs of communities affected by weapons of mass destruction attacks , accidents or even natural disasters . ”
The action has raised concerns for some citizens like journalist Naomi Wolf , an author critical of the Bush administration , who referred to the deployment as a ' coup ' in a well - circulated viral video and issued Americans a call to action .

NORTHCOM is a joint command established post - 9/11 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities .
When Hurricane Katrina damaged Mississippi and Louisiana , several active - duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas , but were not assigned to NORTHCOM , but instead individual commands under provisional authorities .
Military officials have not yet responded to a request for comment .

All those Mac vs. PC ads are really starting to get tiresome .
I mean , how long has this been going on ?
Two years ?
Even Mac people can’t stand them anymore .
Like it or not , computers are computers ; they ’re tools , and each have their own unique uses .
So when I stumbled on this awesome MAC vs. PC musical this morning , I knew I could n’t let it pass .
It really gives a refreshing look at the neverending war between the two giants .
The first two minutes are a bit grating , but do n’t let that fool you .
Keep on watching until the end .
I ’m sure you ’ll enjoy it as much as I did .

The financial crack - up and the ensuing slide into economic fascism have , without a doubt , separated the wheat from the chaff .
I listen carefully to learn how people view the problem , the causes , and the cure .
I look for signs that there is a hint of skepticism , or better yet , critical thinking from those who are willing to stand solo and state their case in an intelligent manner that does n’t mimic the blarney disgorged on the orthodox news programs .
Unfortunately , I seem to run into chaff all day long , leaving me to believe that the wheat is gone with the wind .
Outside of the intelligent people on the Internet , and all the great writers and bloggers — in my daily life , I ca n’t even listen to peoples ’ opinion on this subject .
I cannot stomach their uninformed babble , milquetoast pleadings , cupcake kowtowing , and their ceaseless demands for safeguards .
All I hear is “ the government needs to do something about … ” [ drop in anything here ]
The conversations I hear , the comments I get from people — all of it centers on what the government needs to do to fix the financial mess .
There ’s gotta be a law , any law , as long as it makes someone stop doing whatever it is they do n’t want to be done .
They plead for security , and they ca n’t even define liberty .
Liberty , in this we ’re - all - equal , democratic age , has come to mean a recurring paycheck ( never mind the taxes that are never seen ) ; a doable mortgage payment ( because they have a right to a home ) ; generous , ongoing credit lines ; and enough toys — especially the plasma TV and 157 channels — to keep the kids quiet and make the adults momentarily blissful .
People , in general , are statist , parasitical , clueless , and gutless — they beg for government to do something .
Of course , “ something ” is never clarified , but it means that the government is not doing nothing , which gives them great pleasure .
My father , who was noticing the universal decline back in the 70s and 80s , always commented on the move toward high time preferences ( he called it “ screwed - up priorities ” ) , general helplessness , and passivity in terms of government intervention in our lives .
He told me that this wimpified generation — generally speaking — would not be able to withstand a severe Depression , nor would they hang onto their individual rights when they could trade those in exchange for “ government - provided security ” on the spot .
In fact , reflect on the video footage we saw from Hurricane Katrina — grown men , standing on the roofs of their house with their families , standing there and doing nothing , or cowering , just waiting and hoping for someone to come and do something to help them .
People stood there like deer in the headlights , completely helpless .
This is our times , our generation .
The current financial unrest is producing the same result : please do something , anything , so that I do n’t have to give up the Fed - induced bread and circuses that I have come to rely upon .
I need my bread and circuses , and you can have anything you want , appropriate anything that pleases you , if only I can continue on , as is , in my world of contrived prosperity .
A reader , Steve Vaughn , sent me a favorite quote from his mother Marie : “ The problem with being unique is that you have to do it all by yourself . ”
This quote reminds me that the problem with the majority of people today is that they ca n’t be unique because they do n’t know how to do much of anything by themselves .
They have been collectively brainwashed , dumbed down , and indoctrinated with feel - good claptrap that keeps them occupied and compliant , and unlikely to defy further encroachment into their lives .
They ’ll drag their re-usable grocery bags all over the place to save the earth , because it makes them feel good , and because someone told them it was the right thing to do .
But they wo n’t question why it is that they are being looted and lorded over so that wealthy Wall Street executives and 29 - year - old traders driving Maseratis can continue their ways with the aid of policy prescriptions , subsidies , and outright nationalization of the financial system .
These types of people are willing to take all kinds of time to organize or participate in an awareness event for suicide , breast cancer , autism , diversity , mental health , landmines , depression , rape , eating disorders , domestic violence , anti-racism , second - hand smoke , and even genital integrity .
Awareness of such feeble matters is trouble - free and convenient .
Being a round peg is painless , and you get to be a part of a group .
You can all feel good together , and you do n’t have to bear the painful burden of thinking .
You ’ll never see people striking up an awareness event for protesting the Federal Reserve , central planning , economic nationalization , imperial wars , police state militarism , lifestyle fascism , inflation , stock market engineering , or the security state .
Oh , these people will gently protest gas prices , but that ’s because they need cheap gas to engage their daily bread and circus regimen .
I have received hundreds of emails from people this week in response to my recent articles and blogs : so many skeptical , self - educated , critically thinking , discerning , resilient people .
It gives me hope to know that people like this exist .
However , they do not represent the majority that I deal with each day of my life .
I fear that people like us — the bold skeptics , resistors , and dissenters — are spread mighty thin , and this is why the whole move toward the nationalization of our economy and our lives is happening with only small pockets of resistance .
I had a hunch that we would end up here , in this predicament , with sweeping fascist policies domestically and world central planners meeting to discuss how they can seize every last bit of human liberty in existence .
In spite of the merciless scorn and relentless adversity , we need to continue to be square pegs in round holes .
We need to maintain our resistance to the propaganda , and indeed , refute it .
In fact , some of us would n’t know how to embrace collective thinking , even at gunpoint .
We can only hope that along the way we will open up a few minds that are taking a break from shopping or reality TV shows .
It ’s not easy , but someone has to do it .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Even before he takes command of U.S. military strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Gen. David Petraeus is reaching beyond the military sphere to encourage international support for stabilizing the region .
U.S. General David Petraeus addresses journalists after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street in London September 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andrew Winning
Petraeus , whose innovative thinking is credited with helping save Iraq from civil war , met International Monetary Fund and World Bank representatives last week in preparation for new efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan , officials said .
The move , unusual for a military commander , underscores the Pentagon ’s emphasis on unifying military , economic , political and diplomatic aid to help the two countries cope with militant violence and economic dislocation , officials said .
On October 31 , the Army general will become head of Central Command , responsible for American military interests in 20 countries across the Middle East and Central and South Asia .
“ The purpose ( of the World Bank and IMF meetings ) was to touch base and note the Central Command ’s interest in supporting comprehensive approaches in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and others , ” said a military official close to Petraeus .
His arrival at Centcom is widely expected to reinvigorate U.S. strategy in Afghanistan , where U.S. and NATO efforts face grave challenges from an increasingly confident Taliban .
The United States has 32,000 troops in Afghanistan , including 19,000 under Centcom command and 13,000 under NATO .
Petraeus will launch a 100 - day assessment of U.S. strategy for Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , Iraq and other countries in the Centcom region once he takes over , officials said .
He has already spoken publicly of the strategic value of reconciling members of the Taliban with the Afghan government as a possible way to reduce violence in areas of Afghanistan where security has deteriorated this year .
Military officials say they are studying the country ’s tribal landscape to identify leaders who might be willing to join the West against hard core insurgents .
HELP FROM WORLD BANK , IMF
Petraeus has also spoken out about the need for military strategy to be sustained by major financial and development support for the region from the international community .
“ That is one of the steps that has to be taken by our government together with other countries in the coalition and elsewhere including some of those in the Gulf states , ” Petraeus told the Heritage Foundation in Washington last week .
Officials said his recent meetings included a session with World Bank President Robert Zoellick to discuss what the bank might do for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
There was no word of any outcome .
The World Bank and IMF are already involved in talks about helping the countries .
Military officials are also looking at U.S. relations with Colombia as a possible model for Afghanistan and Pakistan , saying something like Washington ’s Plan Colombia strategy could help the two countries against militants .
U.S. officials credit the multibillion - dollar , multiyear Plan Colombia policy with helping Bogota overcome a threat from guerrillas and paramilitaries that once dominated large parts of the country and ran much of its drug trade .
The United States has funneled $ 5.5 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia since 2002 .
Colombia “ is a great overarching strategic model that I think we can look at for the way ahead , ” Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said recently .
Pentagon officials have spoken favorably about a bipartisan measure in Congress that would triple nonmilitary aid to Pakistan to $ 7.5 billion over the next five years .

For the first time in it ’s history , the Humane Society endorsed a presidential candidate , Barack Obama .
They honored Obama ’s record at the local and national level and expressed grave concern over Sarah Palin ’s record – including opposing the Bush administration ’s attempts to protect polar bears and engineering a campaign to hunt animals from helicopters and airplanes .
The Human Society concluded :
Voters who care about protecting wildlife from inhumane and unsporting abuses , enforcing the laws that combat large - scale cruelties like dogfighting and puppy mills , providing humane treatment of animals in agriculture , and addressing other challenges that face animals in our nation , must become active over the next six weeks to elect a president and vice president who share our values .
Please spread the word , and tell friends and family members that an honest assessment of the records of the two presidential tickets leads to the inescapable conclusion that Obama - Biden is the choice for humane - minded voters .
[ my emphasis ]
Obama himself said that he thinks , “ how we treat our animals reflects how we treat each other .
And it ’s very important that we have a president who is mindful of the cruelty that is perpetrated on animals . ”

At the June 3 debate in New Hampshire , for example , he was asked to defend his vote to continue financing the war in Iraq , a vote sought by the White House and criticized by fellow Democrats as an open - ended commitment to the war .
All the other Democrats on stage voted against it , including Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , the presidential nominee who has picked Mr. Biden as his running mate .
“ I love these guys who tell you they ’re going to stop the war , ” Mr. Biden said of his fellow Democrats .
“ Let me tell you straight up the truth .
The truth of the matter is , the only one that ’s emboldened the enemy has been George Bush by his policies , not us funding the war . ”
One danger for Mr. Biden on Thursday is that his habit of speaking authoritatively , of saying he possesses the truth , will come across as overbearing or condescending , particularly toward someone like Ms. Palin , who lacks his credentials .
To try to guard against sounding sexist , he is sparring in practice sessions with Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan , who is playing the role of Ms. Palin .
The only other time a woman has appeared on the debate stage as part of a major - party ticket was in 1984 , when Geraldine A. Ferraro , the Democratic vice - presidential nominee , faced Vice President George Bush .
One exchange might offer Mr. Biden a good lesson .
Mr. Bush had said , “ Let me help you with the difference , Mrs. Ferraro , between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon . ”
Ms. Ferraro instantly highlighted what she perceived as condescension : “ I almost resent , Vice President Bush , your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy . ”
Mr. Bush underscored one of the hazards of debating a woman when he later gloated into an open microphone , “ We tried to kick a little ass last night . ”
The risk may be even greater for Mr. Biden .
His innate exuberance and gusto in speaking without stopping for air can make him sound like he is clubbing his points  and his opponent .
In two weeks , I ’ll celebrate my eighth anniversary writing this column .
And if I do any ruminating during my 15 - second celebration , I ’ll recognize that one thing still has n’t changed : there ’s still no single technical level of writing that makes everybody happy .
I still get complaints from total newbies , who are bewildered by terms like “ smartphone ” and “ plasma TV . ”
And I still get bashed by the gearheads , who find the column not nearly technical enough .
I think a lot about the technical level of the column .
Over the years , I ’ve adopted a number of tricks that are designed to communicate technical points without losing the novices–and one of them is avoiding jargon .
Why tech writers use so much jargon , I do n’t know .
Maybe it ’s self - aggrandizement ; they want to lord their knowledge over everybody else .
Maybe it ’s laziness ; they ca n’t be bothered to fish for a plain - English word .
Maybe it ’s just habit ; they spend all day talking shop with other nerds , so they slip into technospeak when they write for larger audiences .
In any case , I ’m making available to all , for the first time , my list of pretentious pet - peeve words to avoid .
I used to consider plain - English writing a competitive advantage , so I ’ve never leaked this list to potential rivals .
But at this point , forget it ; any tips that might contribute to clearer writing deserve to be free .
* Content .
As in , “ Web content . ” Ugh .
If you mean “ Web pages , ” say “ Web pages . ”
If you mean “ music , ” say “ music . ”
Nobody outside the tech industry says “ content ” when they mean “ what ’s on your player ” or “ what ’s on your Web site . ”
* Device .
You know what ’s weird ?
Cellphone companies never actually use the term “ cellphone . ”
They always use the word “ device , ” as in the wince - inducing sentence , “ The user can transfer D.R.M.- protected content to their device . ”
Look , I get it : these days , cellphones do more than make phone calls .
But you do n’t need to abandon the term “ cellphone ” for that reason ; the meaning of “ cellphone ” has already expanded to accommodate its new functions .
If you say “ cellphone , ” your audience already understands that it means “ a gadget that makes calls , gets on the Internet and takes crummy pictures . ”
* Dialog .
The term “ dialog box ” is already a problem , since it does n’t really identify what it is ( a message box on the screen , forcing you to answer a question – like how many copies of a printout you want ) .
But unfortunately , there ’s absolutely no alternative .
And shortening this to “ dialog ” is definitely a step in the wrong direction .
* Display .
“ Display ” can be a noun ( “ a display of fireworks ” ) .
It can also be a verb that takes a direct object ( “ He displayed emotion ” ) .
It is not , however , a verb without a direct object , except in magazines like PC World : “ Shows filmed in high - definition end up displaying in letterbox format . ”
Displaying what in letterbox format ?
Fireworks ?
Emotions ?
The word this writer was looking for is “ appearing . ”
* D.R.M.
What ’s so nauseating about this term is that it started out as a euphemism .
It means copy protection , which most people do n’t like on their software , music files or videos .
So with doublespeak like “ digital rights management , ” the companies who favor copy protection think they ’re putting a positive spin on the concept .
And by using “ D.R.M. ” instead of “ copy protection , ” we ’re playing into their sad little manipulation .
Sorry , Charlie .
It ’s still copy protection , and we should call a spade a spade .
* Enable .
Who on earth says , “ Enable the GPS function ” ?
Only user - manual writers and computer - book authors .
Say “ Turn on GPS ” instead .
* E-mail client .
Originally , someone coined “ client ” to distinguish your computer ’s e-mail program from the computer that dishes it out ( the server ) .
But when you ’re not explicitly trying to make that differentiation , just say “ e- mail program . ”
The only people with e-mail clients are the lawyers who represent Outlook and Gmail .
* Functionality .
WOW , do I despise this pretentious word .
Five syllables–ooh , what a knowledgeable person you must be !
It means “ feature . ” Say “ feature . ”
* LCD .
What I hate about this word is that it does n’t say what it is ( “ the screen ” ) .
And even if you spell out what it means in parentheses , you still have n’t told readers what the heck you ’re talking about .
( “ Liquid crystal display ?
Ohhh , so THAT ’S what it means . ” )
* P.D.A . Here ’s another ridiculous term–ridiculous because it ’s not self - explanatory .
“ Personal digital assistant ? ”
Give me a break .
It ’s a palmtop .
* Price point .
What are you , paid by the word ?
“ Price ” alone does the job .
* URL .
This one ’s common , but I still ca n’t stand it .
“ Uniform Resource Locator ” ?
Oh , thank you –that helps .
NOT !
I use “ Web address . ”
Same number of syllables , and crystal - clear .
* RAM .
Here again , there ’s a plain - English word that does the same job without the intimidation : memory .
That ’s a word that says what it means .
* S.M.S. The ultimate pointless term .
“ Text message ” is the same number of syllables , and also says what it is .
“ SMS ” does n’t do anyone any good – but it does baffle the non-technical .
* Support .
I do n’t mean “ support ” as in “ tech support , ” although even that term is a corporate creepy cop -out ( it means “ help line ” ) .
No , I mean the verb , as in , “ The laptop supports Wi -Fi and Bluetooth . ”
In no other corner of modern discourse is “ support ” used that way .
I use “ has , ” “ offers ” or “ works with . ”
* USB .
I use this term in my writing , but only reluctantly ; there simply is n’t any other term that does the job .
But it ’s a hateful term–even knowing that it stands for “ Universal Serial Bus ” does n’t begin to help you understand what it is .
Let ’s have more clever , self - descriptive names for jacks , like FireWire or ( for Apple ’s wireless ) AirPort .
* User .
There are two industries that refer to their customers as “ users ” –technology and illegal drugs .
When you ’re writing about computers , there ’s almost never a sentence where you could n’t substitute “ you ” or , worst case , “ the customer ” as the noun and thereby improve the sentence .
Instead of saying , “ The user can , at his or her option , elect to remove this functionality , ” say , “ You can turn this feature off . ”
It ’s not only clearer , but it gets you out of the awkward “ his or her ” bit .
* Wi-Fi .
I use this one occasionally , but only with gritted teeth .
It ’s just not a good term .
It does n’t say what it means .
People think it stands for “ wireless fidelity , ” but the Wi-Fi Alliance , which hired a branding firm to create it , says it does n’t stand for anything .
I use the term “ wireless hot spot ” when I can , but only because there ’s no more comprehensible alternative .
( “ Bluetooth ” does n’t immediately convey that technology ’s function .
But at least it ’s better than “ Wi - Fi . ”
Once you hear that it ’s named for a Danish king who brought together warring factions , you never forget its meaning . )
And there you have it : Pogue ’s Anti-Jargon Dictionary .
You ’re free to use it to launch your own writing careers , with my compliments !
P.S. –Set your TiVo !

Trump : Bush impeachment would be ‘ wonderful thing ’
RAW STORY
( AFP ) – Property mogul and diehard Republican Donald Trump told CNN on Wednesday that President George W. Bush misled the US into the Iraq War and should have been impeached when the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 .
“ I was surprised that she did n’t do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush , ” Trump said in an interview with CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer , referring to Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ It … just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office , which personally I think would have been a wonderful thing . ”
Trump , 62 , said Bush misled the United States into waging war on Iraq , a much worse offense than a dalliance with a White House intern his predecessor Bill Clinton was impeached for in 1999 .
“ He lied .
He got us into the war with lies , ” Trump said about Bush .
“ And I mean — look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant .
And they tried to impeach him , which was nonsense .
“ And yet Bush got us into this horrible war with lies , by lying , by saying they had weapons of mass destruction , by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true , ” he added .
On the race for the White House , Trump said he was rooting for John McCain to win the November 4 election , and felt sure he could overtake his Democrat rival Barack Obama , whom he trails in opinion polls , in the next three weeks .
“ He ’s a very smart guy , he ’s a tough guy , ” he said .
“ I think he ’d be a great president .
But , he has to be John McCain and he could still probably pull it out .
“ But , it ’s going to be tough . ”
McCain and Obama face off in their third and final televised debate late Wednesday in New York state .
Trump inherited a real estate empire and added an airline , casino , resorts , hotels , skyscrapers in New York , around the world and named them after himself , turning his name into a sort of brand .
He also owns a television show , “ The Apprentice , ” in which he appears , as well as the Miss Universe contest .

True Temperance
To say that “ modern humans must learn how to relate to psychoactives responsibly , ” as Earth and Fire Erowid do , is not the same as “ denying or denigrating an individual ’s right to choose temperance , ” as Jonathan Caulkins suggests .
First of all , what the Erowids are preaching is temperance .
Aristotle defined that virtue this way :
The temperate man holds a mean position with regard to pleasures … .
Such pleasures as conduce to health and bodily fitness he will try to secure in moderation and in the right way ; and also all other pleasures that are not incompatible with these , or dishonorable , or beyond his means … .
The temperate man desires the right things in the right way and at the right time . [ 1 ]
This was the approach initially advocated by the American temperance movement : moderation enforced by self - discipline .
Eventually activists concerned about alcohol abuse adopted a different goal , demanding abstinence enforced by law .
That change was driven by the conviction that voluntary temperance was a dangerous illusion because alcohol was inherently addicting — the same sort of false belief that underlies the prohibition of the currently illegal intoxicants .
I realize Caulkins is merely following semantic convention when he uses temperance to mean abstinence .
But the equation of temperance with abstinence lies at the heart of the ideology behind the war on drugs , according to which all use of illegal drugs is abuse .
Recognizing the error of that view does not mean insisting that everybody must get stoned .
For some individuals , abstaining from certain drugs might be the most responsible way of relating to them .
If you do regrettable things when you drink , have bad trips when you use psychedelics , or go on binges when you snort cocaine , these drugs may not be for you .
Still , very few people consistently avoid psychoactive substances .
Even those who ostensibly do , usually for religious reasons , tend to make exceptions .
Mormons , though officially drug free , do not eschew chocolate , and they disagree about whether caffeinated beverages other than tea and coffee are permitted .
Mostly Mormon Utah leads the country in antidepressant prescriptions . [ 2 ]
The point is not to mock the Mormons for their inconsistency but to suggest that the urge to achieve altered states of consciousness ( often , but not necessarily , with the help of drugs ) is deeply rooted in human nature .
As the psychopharmacologist Ronald Siegel has shown , this is not a tendency limited to “ modern humans ” ( or even to humans ) .
For as far back as we have archeological evidence , and in cultures all over the world , there are indications of psychoactive drug use .
[ 3 ]
Nowadays the options for those seeking to satisfy what Siegel calls “ the fourth drive ” are more numerous and varied than ever before , so in a sense it is harder to be well - informed and choose wisely .
At the same time , it is easier to obtain relevant information ( from sources such as Erowid.org ) and find the drug that is right for a particular person and purpose .
Caulkins suggests it ’s unrealistic to expect people to make responsible drug choices , saying , “ A prospective user ’s ex ante claims to know he or she will not be among those whose use gets out of control should be met with the skepticism appropriate for rooms full of people all describing themselves as above average drivers . ”
But while it ’s impossible , by definition , for all drivers to be above average , Caulkins himself concedes that the vast majority of people are able to use drugs without causing serious harm to themselves or others .
This majority probably would be even bigger in the absence of prohibition , which most deters those least prone to abuse , creates additional drug hazards , and makes it harder to inculcate a culture of responsible use .
Indeed , Caulkins argues that it ’s impossible to use illegal drugs responsibly , because “ the responsible decision is to obey the law . ”
He claims it ’s wrong to disobey a prohibition approved by the majority , except through open civil disobedience .
While the illegal status of a drug creates additional risks that a prudent user must weigh , including the possibility of arrest and the unreliable quality of black - market products , I ca n’t agree that people are morally obligated to obey an unjust law .
I see the drug laws as unjust because they go beyond the proper function of government by punishing people for actions that violate no one ’s rights .
By likening drug use to speeding and to driving while intoxicated , Caulkins obscures the distinction between self - harming behavior and behavior that endangers others .
Still , he clearly believes it ’s appropriate to forcibly protect people from risks they voluntarily assume , whether by using drugs , “ riding a motorcycle without a helmet , driving without a seatbelt , or swimming when there is no lifeguard ” ( even in your own swimming pool ? ) .
I see “ laws designed to protect people from their own poor choices ” as unethical impositions and dangerous precedents , based on an open - ended rationale for government intervention that logically leads to totalitarianism .
We are not going to resolve this issue here , but it might be helpful to consider suicide :
Does the government have a right and / or duty to prevent people from deliberately killing themselves ?
If so , perhaps it also has a right to prevent them from engaging in activities that might lead to death or serious injury , or even to the more benign fate of a drug habit ( involving marijuana or legal opiates , say ) that causes little measurable harm .
But if the government does not have any business second - guessing someone ’s decision to commit suicide , it ’s hard to see how it can justifiably use force to stop him from smoking pot or snorting cocaine .
“ Just as I would not want the Erowids to denigrate someone ’s choice to pursue a drug free life , ” Caulkins writes , “ I would never deny someone who opts for a drug- related life the chance to try following the Erowids ’ Principles . ”
Yet clearly he would , because “ the responsible decision is to obey the law . ”
That injunction is inconsistent with the Erowids ’ approach to drugs , which says we should decide whether and how to use them based on a rational assessment of their risks and benefits , as opposed to blindly heeding the arbitrary distinctions enshrined in our drug laws .

ST . PAUL ( Reuters ) -
The 17 - year - old unmarried daughter of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is pregnant , Palin said on Monday in an announcement intended to knock down rumors by liberal bloggers that Palin faked her own pregnancy to cover up for her child .
Bristol Palin , one of Alaska Gov. Palin ’s five children with her husband Todd , is about five months pregnant and is going to keep the child and marry the father , according to aides of Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
Bristol Palin made the decision on her own to keep the baby , the aides said .
The Palins , in a statement released by the McCain campaign , said Bristol “ came to us with news that we as parents knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned ” and that their daughter “ has our unconditional love and support . ”
“ We ask the media to respect our daughter and Levi ’s privacy as has always been the tradition of children of candidates , ” their statement said .
Senior McCain campaign officials said McCain knew of the daughter ’s pregnancy when he selected Palin last week as his vice presidential running mate , deciding that it did not disqualify the 44 - year - old governor in any way .
McCain officials said the news of the daughter ’s pregnancy was being released to rebut what one aide called “ mud- slinging and lies ” that have circulated on liberal blog sites .
According to these rumors , Sarah Palin had faked a pregnancy and pretended to have given birth in April to her fifth child , a son named Trig who has Down syndrome .
The rumor was that Trig was actually Bristol Palin ’s child and that Sarah Palin was the grandmother .
PRO - LIFE GROUPS OFFER SUPPORT
Palin is staunchly anti-abortion , and pro-life groups welcomed the decision to keep the child .
James Dobson , an influential Christian evangelical conservative , said his Focus on the Family group had always counseled young mothers to see their pregnancies through , “ even though there will be of course challenges along the way . ”
“ That is what the Palins are doing , and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values , but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances , ” he said in a statement .
Charmaine Yoest , head of Americans United for Life , said , “ We join them in welcoming this new life . ”

The McCain campaign was outraged by the blog rumors .
“ There ’s no doubt that liberal blogs such as one called www.barackoblogger.com and some in the mainstream media were pushing a false story about Gov. Palin ’s most recent pregnancy with fervor , ” said senior McCain adviser Nicolle Wallace .
A senior McCain official said its camp had no evidence that the campaign of Democrat Barack Obama was pushing the story , but said the blog rumors circulating on websites that appeared to support Obama had the effect of being “ a real anchor around the Democratic ticket . ”

OBAMA OFFENDED
Speaking to reporters in Monroe , Michigan , Obama said he was offended by the McCain aide ’s statement and that he considered people ’s families off - limits .
“ We do n’t go after people ’s families .
We do n’t get them involved in the politics .
It ’s not appropriate and it ’s not relevant .
Our people were not involved in any way in this and they will not be .
And if I ever thought there was somebody in my campaign that was involved in something like that , they ’d be fired , ” Obama said .
Obama also said : “ This should n’t be part of our politics .
It has no relevance to Gov. Palin ’s performance as a governor or potential performance as a vice president .
So I would strongly urge people to back off these kinds of stories . ”
The news broke as Republicans gathered in St. Paul for their convention to formally nominate McCain and Palin as the party ’s candidates .
Palin is only the second woman picked as a U.S. vice presidential nominee .
In the short period since she was announced last Friday , Palin has helped to energize the Republican Party ’s conservative base , giving McCain fresh energy going into the campaign for the November 4 election against Obama and his No. 2 Sen . Joe Biden of Delaware .
( Additional reporting by Caren Bohan and Ed Stoddard )
During a weekend of Republican attacks on Senator Barack Obama ’s personal associations , Fox News Channel ran a program Sunday that made provocative assertions about similar connections , called “ Obama & Friends : The History of Radicalism . ”
Sean Hannity , the conservative radio and television host , was the host of the hourlong program , which raised , among other things , unsubstantiated accusations that Mr. Obama ’s work as a community organizer in Chicago was “ training for a radical overthrow of the government . ”
The statement came from Andy Martin , a conservative writer and frequent political candidate who is credited as being among the first  if not the first  to assert in a chain e-mail message that Mr. Obama was secretly a Muslim .
Mr. Obama is a Christian ; his campaign says he “ is not , was not and has never been ” a Muslim .
Peppering his statements with phrases like “ in my opinion ” and “ my view is , ” Mr. Martin said Mr. Obama ’s political career had been engineered by Bill Ayers , a founder and former member of the radical Weather Underground and now an education professor in Chicago .
( IAP News ) --
An Israeli professor and military historian hinted that Israel could avenge the holocaust by annihilating millions of Germans and other Europeans .
Speaking during an interview which was published in Jerusalem Friday , Professor Martin Van Crevel said Israel had the capability of hitting most European capitals with nuclear weapons .
" We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions , perhaps even at Rome .
Most European capitals are targets of our air force . "
Creveld , a professor of military history at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem , pointed out that " collective deportation " was Israel 's only meaningful strategy towards the Palestinian people .
" The Palestinians should all be deported .
The people who strive for this ( the Israeli government ) are waiting only for the right man and the right time .
Two years ago , only 7 or 8 per cent of Israelis were of the opinion that this would be the best solution , two months ago it was 33 per cent , and now , according to a Gallup poll , the figure is 44 percent . "
Creveld said he was sure that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wanted to deport the Palestinians .
" I think it 's quite possible that he wants to do that .
He wants to escalate the conflict .
He knows that nothing else we do will succeed . "
Asked if he was worried about Israel becoming a rogue state if it carried out a genocidal deportation against Palestinians , Creveld quoted former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan who said " Israel must be like a mad dog , too dangerous to bother . "
Creveld argued that Israel would n't care much about becoming a rogue state .
" Our armed forces are not the thirtieth strongest in the world , but rather the second or third .
We have the capability to take the world down with us .
And I can assure you that that this will happen before Israel goes under . "

MTV have taken censorship to new extremes , bleeping out the names of file sharing sites in a Weird Al Yankovic video on their new music video site which launched October 28 .
The clip for Weird Al Yankovic ’s 2006 viral hit “ Do n’t Download This Song ” starts with the following lyrics
Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge
To break international copyright law
By downloading MP3s from file - sharing sites
Like Morpheus or Grokster or Limewire or KaZaA
But in MTV ’s version , every named file sharing site is bleeped .
It ’s not uncommon for radio to bleep strong swearing , but this is something completely new .
Talk about being so beholden to the record companies that you go overboard in the ass - kissing stakes .
Video as follows :

File sharing service RapidShare may find itself without a viable business model if a German court ruling stands .
After getting sued by a German copyright holder , the company argued that it was doing all it could to screen out copyrighted material .
The court , however , has ruled that its efforts were insufficient , raising questions about whether doing anything that was legally sufficient could be done without incurring enough costs to sink the company .
RapidShare is one of a large number of companies that will host large files for users who need to exchange them with friends and family .
Like many of these companies , it offers a free service with limited features in the hopes of enticing users to spring for the cost of a premium service , which offers some significant perks , such as hosting larger files , unlimited download speeds , and permanent storage .
All of this occurs through a simple web interface , and does n't involve the P2P transfers that have attracted the ire of ISPs and the copyright industry .
As a result , their popularity is growing rapidly ; RapidShare accounts for five percent of all IP traffic in some regions .
Of course , the exchange of large files is what P2P was all about , so it's no surprise that copyrighted material is showing up on RapidShare , as well ; attention from copyright holders was also inevitable .
In this case , that attention came in the form of a lawsuit in Germany , where a copyright holding organization called GEMA has been seeking legal sanction and financial penalties .
As we noted in our earlier coverage , Germany lacks the " safe harbor " provisions afforded to US companies , which are exempted from liability for infringing material that their users place on servers or make accessible through their networks if they take it offline once notified of its infringing nature .
The case has been going poorly for RapidShare so far , and it appears to have taken a turn for the worse .
The P2P Blog notes that the German courts have issued a ruling ( in German , naturally ) in which their expectations for RapidShare 's antipiracy efforts are spelled out more clearly .
RapidShare argued in court that it maintained hashes of copyrighted material that had appeared on their service in the past , and used those to prescreen material that is uploaded .
In addition , it had hired six full - time staff members to go through material it was hosting and to respond to complaints about infringing material .
None of this , apparently , is good enough .
Simply twiddling a few bits could defeat the hash - based screening , the court ruled , and the six employees were insufficient to proactively examine everything posted to the company 's servers before it was made available for download .
The blog translates part of the decision as stating , " a business model that does n't use common methods of prevention cannot claim the protection of the law , " in determining that the near impossibility of screening for all copyrighted material does n't excuse RapidShare from the legal requirement to do so .
I 'm hard pressed to think of a " common method " that would suffice to enable the screening of this volume of data .
As a result , it looks as though RapidShare may be forced to manually screen every bit of uploaded content .
Closing its doors is likely to be a cheaper option should the ruling stand .

BBC News , Havana
Mr Michel said the Cuban government had agreed to resume political dialogue The EU and Cuba have formally restored ties , five years after the EU imposed diplomatic sanctions on the island following mass arrests of dissidents .
European Commissioner Louis Michel said the accord he signed with Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque was " a turning point for EU - Cuban relations " .
Mr Perez Roque welcomed its respect for the island 's political independence .
It will now receive 2 m euros ( $ 2.6 m ) of emergency hurricane recovery aid , with 30 m euros ( $ 38.9 m ) available next year .
An EU delegation will return to Cuba in November to determine the needs and priorities for the financing to be made available in 2009 .
Political dialogue
The two recent hurricanes which swept through Cuba in late August and early September - Ike and Gustav - caused billions of dollars worth of damage .
Yet Cuba 's communist authorities refused all offers of aid not just from the US but the EU as well - a sign of just how strained relations had become .
Two recent hurricanes that hit Cuba caused billions of dollars of damage Now following a signing ceremony in Havana , Cuba and the EU have agreed to resume co-operation .
A joint declaration , signed by Cuba 's foreign minister and the European commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , calls for respect for Cuba 's political independence and non-intervention in its internal affairs .
However , according to Mr Michel , the Cuban government has agreed to resume political dialogue in which " no subjects will be taboo " .
This should open the way for future talks on issues such as democracy , human rights and political prisoners .
Mr Michel also announced an aid package of up to 30 m euros for hurricane reconstruction .
How to deal with Cuba is one area where Europe and the United States have substantial differences .
Since Raul Castro took over the presidency , following his brother Fidel 's retirement due to ill health , EU policy has been to try to develop a dialogue with Cuba in the hope of influencing change .
But the Cubans demanded that the EU formally lift the diplomatic sanctions which it imposed in 2003 , following the mass arrest of dissidents .
The sanctions were suspended in 2005 , but only eliminated altogether at the EU summit in June .

The Night Watch is Rembrandt ’s largest and most famous — though not necessarily his greatest — painting .
As America continues to suffer crisis upon crisis , it has never been more important to broaden our perspectives and learn about the people and places that shape our world .
And for me , one of the great joys of travel is seeing art masterpieces in person .
Learning the stories behind great art can shed new light on our lives today .
Here ’s one of my favorites .
Created in 1642 , when he was 36 , The Night Watch came from his most important commission : a group portrait of a company of Amsterdam ’s Civic Guards to hang in their meeting hall .
It ’s an action shot .
With flags waving and drums beating , the guardsmen spill onto the street from under an arch .
It ’s “ all for one and one for all ” as they rush to Amsterdam ’s rescue .
The soldiers grab lances and load their muskets .
In the center , the commander ( in black , with a red sash ) strides forward energetically with a hand gesture that seems to say , “ What are we waiting for ?
Let ’s move out ! ”
His lieutenant focuses on his every order .
Why is The Night Watch so famous ?
Well , it ’s enormous , covering 170 square feet .
The guards are almost life - size , so it seems like they ’re marching right out of the frame and into our living room .
In its day , The Night Watch was completely different from other group portraits .
Until then , subjects were seated in an orderly group - shot pose with each face well - lit and flashbulb - perfect .
The groups commissioning the work were paying good money to have their mugs preserved for posterity , and it was ego before artistic freedom .
By contrast , Rembrandt got the Civic Guards off their duffs and showed them doing their job — protecting the city .
He added less - than - heroic elements that gave it a heightened realism , like the dwarf and the mysterious glowing girl holding a chicken ( the guards ’ symbol ) .
Rembrandt ’s trademark use of a bright spotlight to highlight the main characters made it all the more dramatic .
By adding movement and depth to an otherwise static scene , he took posers and turned them into warriors , and turned a simple portrait into high art .
OK , some Night Watch scuttlebutt : First off , the name “ Night Watch ” is a misnomer .
It ’s actually a daytime scene , but Rembrandt finished his paintings with a preserving varnish .
Eventually , as the varnish darkened and layers of dirt built up , the sun set on this painting .
During World War II , the painting was rolled up and hidden for safekeeping .
Over the years , this stirring painting has both inspired people and deranged them .
In 1911 , a madman sliced it with a knife , in 1975 , another lunatic cut the captain ’s legs , and in 1990 , it was sprayed with acid .
The Night Watch was a smashing success in its day .
Rembrandt had captured the exuberant spirit of Holland in the 1600s , when its merchant ships ruled the waves , and Amsterdam was the center of the first global economy .
These guardsmen on the move epitomized the proud , independent , and upwardly mobile Dutch .
On an epic scale , Rembrandt created the definitive “ portrait ” of that single generation of people that re-invented the world — the era we call the “ Dutch Golden Age . ”

This story is as intimate as I will get with you .
In it , I unzip my genes and give you a sneak peek at my biological destiny .
I took three DNA tests from three different DNA testing companies — one from a firm called Navigenics , one from 23andMe , and one from deCODE genetics .
I was so hyped up about getting my DNA analyzed , I did n’t really think about the consequences of having all that information at my fingertips .
Perhaps that ’s typical of a 25 - year - old .
I ’m working at my first job out of college and living in New York City .
There ’s plenty in the here and now to worry about :
The homeless man deliberately running into me on my way to work .
Living on a shoestring budget .
Finding Mr. Right .
Some of the test results from the three companies matched up with one another .
Some did n’t .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself .
Let me tell you what these tests actually test .
Our DNA is made up of 3 billion base pairs , with myriad possible sequences of the four chemicals ( represented as A , T , G , and C ) that form the “ instruction book ” for a human being , geneticist Francis Collins explains .
Sometimes a mistake gets introduced into the DNA sequence .
Collins calls these mutations “ misspellings ” ; when a large number of people share the same mutation , they ’re known as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs , pronounced “ snips ” ) .
DNA testing companies use the SNPs to calculate people ’s genetic risk of developing complex diseases .
Broadly speaking , Navigenics , 23andMe , and deCODE genetics each say that they interpret genetic research gathered from scientific papers , apply it to a customer ’s DNA sequence , and deliver the results online .
The companies expect that most people will be interested in buying the test , everyone from the average joe to a college student to a politician to me — a half - Asian , half - European girl from Florida .
Navigenics
I initially heard about Navigenics at a charity event when I spoke to William A. Haseltine , founder and former chairman and CEO of Human Genome Sciences , about genetic testing .
The next day , I called Navigenics to ask if I could get tested for free .
Normally the cost is $ 2,500 .
Product manager Christine Lin said that I could , but only if I could turn around my spit sample quickly .
The company was beta testing , and I could be part of the first group .
I ’m at risk of developing : sausagelike swelling , ? morning stiffness , inability to identify people ’s faces , fat rolls on my stomach , and bloody stools .
When the DNA kit arrived in a FedEx package November 11 , 2007 , I felt a rush .
The kit included instructions for how to collect my spit .
I harvested the necessary amount of saliva in just five minutes .
But before mailing the spit , I filled out a questionnaire .
I penned in basic information like my birthday , address , and details about my ancestry .
Interestingly , age and race do not get factored into the calculations — the formula assumes I ’m an American of European descent ( well , at least half of me is ) .
The fine print that came with the kit stated that I was n’t going to get medical advice from them and sought permission to use my sample for ( gasp ) scientific research .
Samples are sent directly back to Navigenics ’ outsourced lab , Affymetrix in West Sacramento , California .
Normally it would take three to four weeks to get your DNA results online .
I had to wait two months to get mine because Navigenics wanted to give me the results in person when I visited their headquarters in Redwood Shores , California .
Last January
I escaped the bitter bite of the New York winter and flew to California to visit Navigenics and 23andMe .
When I arrived at Navigenics ’ waterfront office , I was jet - lagged and anxious .
Regular customers have the option of calling a toll - free number to talk to a genetic counselor , but I got to speak to one in person ( the benefits of being a reporter ) .
I expected the counseling session to be therapeutic — like a scene out of The Sopranos , when Tony goes to his shrink to talk about his anxieties .
My genetic counseling session was n’t like that at all .
Instead , I sat in an office chair with one of Navigenics ’ in - house genetic counselors , Elissa Levin , ready to look at my results for the first time .
I did n’t want this test to change my life .
I just wanted some insight .
My eyes glazed over while examining the results on a computer screen : I might go blind ( macular degeneration ) .
My joints might ache ( osteoarthritis ) .
I might put on weight ( obesity ) .
I might have dry skin ( psoriasis ) .
I might have diarrhea and constipation issues ( Crohn ’s disease ) .
I took a deep breath .
Oh , no , I thought .
I have Crohn ’s disease .
I HAVE Crohn ’s disease ?
I have Crohn ’s disease .…
Out of the list of potential problems , I focused on the one illness I had a symptom of .
I used to have a sensitive stomach , but I started avoiding foods with wheat and dairy two years ago .
Since then , the recurring episodes of bloating and irritable bowel problems have virtually disappeared .
“ There ’s such a spectrum of gastrointestinal disease , ” Levin said .
“ A lot of people go a long time being batted around from specialist to specialist and get a whole battery of tests . ”
The DNA test might at least point me in the right direction , she added .
We discussed what little I knew about my family history , addressed concerns I had , and talked about the possibility of following up with my doctor .
I knew I would n’t go home and ask my doctor for a colonoscopy , especially since my intestinal problem subsided years ago .
Next I spoke to the Navigenics CEO , Mari Baker .
She , of course , had taken the test and was lucky , in the sense that hers had led to an actual diagnosis .
“ There might be a low lifetime risk of developing a disease , but if I ’m the one genetically loaded for it , maybe I ’m the person who is going to get it , ” Baker said .
Her risk for celiac disease was higher than in the average population , so she asked her doctor for follow - up testing , which showed she did have the illness .
Now she cuts gluten out of her diet to prevent uncomfortable symptoms .
Baker ’s diagnosis was just one example of how Navigenics can empower people .
The company is the brainchild of a doctor and a geneticist .
David Agus , the research director of the Louis Warschaw Prostate Cancer Center and director of the Spielberg Family Center for Applied Proteomics , both at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , spent most of his time with end - of - life cancer patients .
He told a friend how he wished there were a better system in place to screen people for genetic risks , so they could prevent cancer .
That friend introduced him to Dietrich Stephan , now the chief science officer of Navigenics , who had been studying the genetics of disorders such as autism and exercise - induced heart attacks at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Arizona .
After a few phone conversations , Stephan and Agus raised enough capital to create Navigenics .
Now I had some information about my genetic profile , but there were still two other tests to consider .
I wanted to see if everything matched up .
In the meantime , I got a little depressed when I printed out a 236 - page document — a book of Boonsri — and read about some of the symptoms of the diseases I ’m at risk of developing : sausagelike swelling , morning stiffness , inability to identify people ’s faces , fat rolls on my stomach , and bloody stools .
I felt helpless .
I did n’t know what action to take or if I should be taking any at all .
I followed up with a second Navigenics genetic counselor , Shannon Keiran .
We focused on the diseases I ’m at risk for and talked about what I should do to prevent them .
Watch out for obesity , she said .
That ’s easy , I thought .
I run every day .
While my risk for Crohn ’s was higher than most , my chance of getting it was still less than 1 percent ( I ’d say those are pretty good odds ) .
When it comes to macular degeneration , genes play a big part .
Wearing sunglasses may help , Keiran said .
For osteoarthritis , make sure you do n’t wear high heel shoes because it places strain on your knees , she said .
I asked about alcohol consumption .
Psoriasis may be affected by alcohol .
And of course , she added , “ moderation is key . ”
Would the next two tests assuage my fears — and end my occasional bouts of hypochondria ?

23andMe
DISCOVER paid 23andMe $ 999 for a DNA test ( no reporter ’s comp this time ) .
I rushed through the fine print : “ If you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned genetic information about health conditions and you do not disclose this to them , this may be considered to be fraud . …
You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate .
This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview .
You may discover things …e.g. , your father is not genetically your father . ”
No problem .
The next day , on December 12 , 2007 , a second FedEx box arrived at my office .
I opened the bright green package at my desk and prepared for spitting episode number two .
The DNA test kit included a vial and instructions .
It was easier the second time .
I mailed the sample to 23andMe ’s contracted lab , Illumina in San Diego .
( They use a different lab now . )
Four weeks later , in January , I signed on to my 23andMe online account to “ unlock the secrets of [ my ] own DNA . ”
23andMe , like Navigenics , took my markers and calculated my genetic risks for certain diseases .
I began surfing my genome , all 580,442 SNPs they had sequenced .
In addition to telling me my risk for certain diseases , 23andMe provided ancestry information , social networking functions , and more ( details below ) .
Of the 70 different conditions to choose from , let me start with the silly ones .
I have dry earwax ( true ) .
Apparently my sense of smell stinks ( true ) thanks to a genotype of TT on my 14th chromosome .
One of the most fascinating things I learned is that my blood type is made up of more than 25 blood groups .
There ’s even information available regarding histocompatibility .
( I can see if a potential date is compatible with me immunologically . )
I checked my risk for incurable diseases like lupus .
I had access to my relative risks of psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia .
I clicked on lactose intolerance .
23andMe said I should have the enzyme to digest milk .
But I know I ca n’t digest it .
Believe me , I ’ve tried .
23andMe ’s feature called 23andWe allowed me to share this milk indigestion problem with them .
On the lactose intolerance page , I took a survey about drinking milk and checked the option : “ Yes , I ’m pretty sure I am [ lactose intolerant ] .
Milk shakes are my enemy . ”
The point ?
This information “ could lead to major insights when combined with genetic information from the 23andMe database , ” the Web site read .
I wished for a moment that all this educational material had been available when I was taking genetics in high school .
I clicked on the section “ Genetics 101 ” and watched one of the animated videos : A banana has 11 pairs of chromosomes , one video said .
The side dish of ancestry information enabled me to trace my maternal line back 35,000 years .
When it comes to pinning down your risk of more complex diseases , it ’s a bit challenging for someone of mixed ethnicity .
You have the option to pick only one ethnicity .
So when I clicked on European , the results did n’t quite match up to what I saw when I clicked on Asian .
My risk for type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis was both low and high , depending on which ethnicity I chose .
So what happens when you ’re both , like me ?
I printed out the discrepancies to ask the 23andMe founders in person .
After going to Navigenics in January , I went to 23andMe .
I took a 10 - minute cab ride to 23andMe ’s office , enjoying the Silicon Valley scene : the smell of fresh air , suburban tree - lined streets , bikers in spandex on their way to work , and men in suits standing on street corners with laptop bags in hand .
I entered 23andMe ’s nondescript building and waited in the lobby , playing with the toys there : fingers flashing red lights , pins that say “ I spat , ” and stress balls on the coffee table .
Sweaty employees jogged down the stairs in their gym clothes , returning from personal training sessions and making their way to a kitchen stocked full of snacks .
One of the cofounders of 23andMe , Linda Avey , told me the company wants to create the world ’s largest database of DNA information .
Glad I helped contribute to their plans for world ( DNA ) domination , I found myself thinking .
What is halting progress is the lack of people involved in genetic studies , not the technology , Avey said .
By translating thousands of scientific discoveries and interpreting what the discoveries mean to an individual , they hope to “ break down the barriers between the general public and what is going on in academic science , ” she explained .
The idea of starting 23 andMe evolved out of cubicle chatter .
Avey had thought about collecting people ’s DNA when she was working at her former job .
She ’d sit around with coworkers and talk about how great it would be if “ we had more genetic information on more people so that we could learn more about why people get a disease . ”
At this point Anne Wojcicki , cofounder of 23andMe , entered our conversation full of energy .
Wojcicki’s interest began when she was working in the biotech investment field .
“ All this money goes into research , and very little comes out of it , ” she said .
“ One of the biggest challenges is getting enough data . ”
Getting more data means more people will have to spit .
Google has bought into this notion :
So far , the company has invested $ 3.9 million in 23andMe and an undisclosed amount in Navigenics .
( Google ’s cofounder , Sergey Brin , is married to Wojcicki . )
Frustration over mounds of genetic information never making it out of genetic research cliques is understandable , but I had my own frustration to address .
You get the best results if you are of European descent .
I told the founders I was an Asian - European mix , and when I clicked on the different options on the Web site , I got conflicting results .
I wanted to know why .
“ Research needs to go a significant step further , ” Wojcicki admitted .
“ 23and Me ’s goal is to advance genetics research in this area .
So 12 months from now , when you ’re logging on to the site every day , we hope the data is more reflective of your [ ethnic ] background . ”
Later that night in my hotel room , I logged on to my 23andMe account .
I noticed a new addition to the FAQs ; it was about mixed ethnic backgrounds .
So I clicked on it : “ Because genetic association studies are generally performed in populations of a particular ethnic background [ European , Asian , African ] , we cannot know whether the associations will also apply to those of a mixed background .…
Feel free to look at the different incidence estimates the 23andMe Odds Calculator provides for different ethnicities , but take the estimates with even more grains of salt than usual . ”
DeCODEme
Like any good medical consumer , I got a third opinion .
DeCODE genetics is known for discovering genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes , early - onset heart attack , and breast cancer , among others .
For this unscientific reason alone , I decided to use the company ’s test — named deCODEme — to validate the other two .
I bought the test for a dollar — the best dollar I ’ve ever spent .
Normally it costs $ 985 .
( I gave in to temptation and accepted the reporter ’s discount . )
A few days later , I received my “ buccal DNA collector ” in the mail .
By popping this stick in and out of my mouth for two minutes , I collected cheek cells — certainly a nice change from spitting .
I mailed my sample off to deCODE genetics ’ in - house testing lab in Reykjavík , Iceland .
There ’s something to be said for taking a test three times .
Seeing my genetic risks displayed online seemed perfectly normal now — just as normal as checking my e-mail .
When I received a message in my in - box telling me that my analysis was ready , I signed on to my deCODEme account to view my results .
First I adjusted the settings to my sex and age and even checked an option to say please contact me if there ’s a chance to participate in genetic research .
I had to pick Asian or European — again , no dual ethnic function existed .
Finally I explored the 29 diseases and traits available at my fingertips .
First I pretended to be fully Asian and saw that I was at risk of developing type 2 diabetes , colorectal cancer , and rheumatoid arthritis .
Next I was a European female .
This time I was at risk for age - related macular degeneration , atrial fibrillation , rheumatoid arthritis , and Crohn ’s disease .
Yikes .
The CEO of deCODE genetics , Kári Stefánsson , interpreted my results for me .
It is not the norm to have the CEO look at your results .
Usually you ’d receive your results online , and it would largely be up to you to interpret them for yourself .
Stefánsson is the famous gene hunter who spearheaded the effort that mapped 65 percent of Iceland ’s genome .
I printed out my two summary reports — the Asian and the European — for him to look at .
I walked from my office to meet Stefánsson in the lobby of his hotel in Manhattan .
Dressed all in black , he intimidated me .
It was n’t because at 6 foot 5 he towered over me or that he made fun of my wimpy handshake .
What intimidated me was his confidence .
If there were such a thing as a preacher for genetic testing , Stefánsson would be converting a lot of people .
But after talking to him for hours , I realized Stefánsson was a lighthearted , matter - of - fact , all - around amazing guy — someone you ’d invite to a dinner party to guarantee interesting conversation .
“ There ’s a paradigm shift from intervention to preventive medicine as we speak , ” he said .
“ It happened when people started to download information about diseases .
This did n’t happen before .
Doctors used to be omnipotent ; no one ever questioned them . ”
Knowledge is power .
I asked him to read my genetic horoscope .
He looked at the European results first .
“ You ’re at high risk for developing atrial fibrillation , so cut back on how much alcohol and coffee you drink , ” he said , ever so calmly .
A person with atrial fibrillation has irregular heartbeats that can cause blood clots and lead to strokes .
“ The biggest alarm here is the possibility of developing macular degeneration . ”
I know I ’ve mentioned this before , but seriously , I ’m at risk of going blind in , like , 35 years .
And that worries me , since I ca n’t see crap without my glasses now .
Then I asked him to look at my Asian readout .
Stefánsson did n’t know why the Asian readout was so sparse , so he called a colleague in Iceland .
Now that ’s customer service at its best .
Very little is known about the risks in Asians , the colleague said over the phone .
This , however , might change soon .
Stefánsson is establishing research collaboration in Hong Kong , with the hope of expanding deCODEme to the Far East .
Can I trust what is there now ?
“ There ’s always a risk that information is wrong , ” Stefánsson said .
“ It is at least as accurate as any medical tests are .
We are the guys who discovered most of the genes .
We are like fish in water .
This is what we ’ve been doing for more than a decade . ”
Why find out about the risks of diseases when there is no cure ?
“ If you do n’t want to look at Alzheimer 's because you ’re afraid that you would be unable to face the fact that you ’re likely to lose the little God gave you , then you just do n’t click on it , ” Stefánsson said .
Why should someone in her early twenties worry about old - people diseases ?
“ Do you want to live a life of a youngster , with the illusion of immortality ? ” he asked .
He answered my questions with questions .
Stefánsson told me to think of the tests as an instrument to learn something about myself .
Stefánsson shared his own results with me .
He ’s at higher - than - average risk of developing prostate cancer , so he should probably check with a urologist on a regular basis .
“ I was a medical doctor for 25 years , and I do n’t like doctors , ” he told me .
“ I rarely go to see them .
Most people I know who have died , have died fairly soon after seeing a doctor or have died in a hospital .
I tell the people I care about to stay away from hospitals , ” Stefánsson joked .
I left the hotel feeling pretty good about my genes for the most part .
But my eyes throbbed the rest of the day .
Perhaps I just needed to change my contacts .
Where do you draw the line between knowing risks and believing you ’ll get sick ?
The baggage of knowing my genetic outlook was taking its toll , momentarily tricking me into thinking my risk of macular degeneration was an actual medical diagnosis .
In addition to giving me varying reports about my potential risk of illness , ?
I found that each company had a totally different personality .
Like overprotective parents , Navigenics told me only the risks they thought I should know .
With enthusiasm their genetic counselors took care of me .
Once the results are available , you have the option to call .
Like a night out on the town with a popular clubbing buddy , 23andMe knew how to entertain me .
Playing on its
Web site was almost as much fun as surfing Facebook .
I even made some friends along the way ( including 23andMe director and investor Esther Dyson ) .
By the time I used deCODEme , the tests ’ novelty had worn off .
Still , deCODE genetics was authoritative .
My first impression came entirely from its CEO — idealistic , likable , and thoughtful .
The Critics
So what do the critics of these tests say ?
“ If [ the companies ] say you have a certain gene variant , can you believe the results ? ” asks Muin J. Khoury , director of the National Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Our understanding of how each gene , each cigarette , and the environment interact and how they contribute to disease is comparable to the state of computing in the 1980s .
“ Your family history reflects the shared environment and the sharing of many genes , ” Khoury says .
Family history is your best predictor , he argues .
Alan E. Guttmacher , now acting director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health , agrees with Khoury .
“ If you read the fine print carefully , these Web sites do n’t usually make false claims , but I think a lot of people will have false hopes .
The information is incomplete at best and , in some cases , very likely wrong , ” Guttmacher says .
“ The results look scientific , ” he adds , but do n’t be fooled .
“ I would have been more surprised if the results were consistent . ”
Both Khoury and Guttmacher have aired their concerns .
Khoury , coauthor of a recent ?
paper on the subject published in The New England Journal of Medicine , clearly warns that this technology is not ready for prime time .
“ The FDA is n’t currently regulating the tests , ” says Gail Javitt , the law and policy director at the Genetics & Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University .
“ Even though they have the authority to , they ’re not enforcing it . ”
Because the tests were made in - house by the labs , it ’s up to the labs to maintain standards .
“ There ’s a lack of oversight , but what ’s more troubling is there ’s no health - care intermediary , ” Javitt says .
“ It might misinform customers about their risk , and they will go on to take actions that are n’t warranted . ”
This story is a kind of consumer report on DNA testing .
In 2006 the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) did its own report , focusing on the related field of nutrigenetic testing , in which companies test your DNA and then use that information to give you diet and lifestyle recommendations .
But the GAO did not cover the broader range of DNA tests available directly to consumers .
The GAO sent two people ’s spit to different companies but made up 14 different profiles to pretend the samples represented fictitious people of various age groups , weights , and lifestyles .
“ The 14 results we received do contain predictions that a consumer may interpret as diagnoses , ” the report read .
“ Even though all of the genetic information contained in the test results based on a single source should be identical , we received disparate results for a sample from the same source . ”
Me
While the results were sometimes conflicting , the advice was basically the same : Stop smoking , lose weight , exercise more , and control blood pressure .
Something tells me I should be doing all these things anyway .
I ’m glad I took the tests .
I went on a trip into my past , present , and future .
It ’s an experience that gave me a new perspective on life .
For six months I visited uncharted genetic territory in a whole new world ( unexplored by most people ) .
To some , my DNA diary may seem like the confessions of a journalist discovering in the end that her genetic information did n’t lead to a diagnosis of any kind .
But maybe it will help me someday , when I ’m trying to piece together my medical mysteries .
For now , as I sit in my office with an iced coffee in hand and log on to Navigenics , I check out what I can do to prevent multiple conditions ( as if it ’s a luxury ) : Exercise .
I run every day .
Do n’t smoke .
Never have .
Healthy diet .
I think so .
Healthy weight .
I hope so .
Vitamins .
Um , I should start .
Lower blood pressure .
No clue what mine is .
Lower cholesterol .
Oh , man , I do n’t know that either .
Time to see my doctor .
Avoid hormones .
Can’t .
Reduce stress .
OK , after this story .
Get enough sleep .
Ditto .
Avoid alcohol .
I have , thanks to the DNA tests .
Do n’t wear high heels .
What , really ?
I click “ sign out . ”
I try to forget about the risks and live life the best I can .
Whatever my biological destiny is , at least I think I can change it a little .
An okapi , a rare giraffe - like mammal not seen for 50 years in an African wildlife park , has been captured on film .
Or , at least the striped legs of the forest - dwelling creature have been photographed .
The new image was made by a camera trap in the African Democratic Republic of Congo 's Virunga National Park .
The okapi , sometimes called a " forest giraffe , " has apparently survived in the Democratic Republic of Congo 's Virunga National Park , despite more than a decade of civil war and increased poaching , according to Wildlife Conservation Society officials .
" This is the first time this species has been captured on film in this park , " said WCS researcher Deo Kujirakwinja .
" Known to occur in the park from the early 1900s , it had not been seen here for over 50 years .
Two years ago , sightings of dung and other tracks were made in the park by a team of pygmy trackers who knew Okapi sign .
It is very encouraging to see that this animal has survived . "
Okapi are native to a rainforest in the DR Congo .
They had been sighted occasionally over the years in a different park , the Okapi Faunal Reserve , in that country , according to the WCS .
The animals can be 6 feet tall at the shoulder and up to 8 feet long .
Their stripes make them resemble a zebra , but they are relatives of larger giraffes .
The animal 's current range occurs in the Ituri Forest in northern DR Congo .
They are classified as Near Threatened by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) and are at risk primarily from habitat destruction .
Virunga Park , despite being very remote , is the hideout of a rebel group ( ADF – Allied Democratic Front ) that has been battling the government of Uganda for more than 20 years .
Last year , the WCS reported that several gorillas in the park had been shot and left to die .
Lately the area of the survey has become less hostile and therefore accessible to scientists .
Preliminary results of the broader survey in the park indicate that many antelope species are at low density but that some species such as chimpanzees have survived fairly well .
" The recent evidence that okapis still exist in the Virunga National Park is a good indication that large wildlife can rebound in areas impacted by unrest and poaching , " said Andrew Plumptre , director of WCS 's Albertine Rift Program .

Seaside へ GO !!
-- 楽々サーバサイド Web プログラミング --
第 １回 : Seaside を試す
ブループレイ ン
梅澤 真史
1. はじめに
1.1 今さら Web アプリフレームワーク ?
Happy Squeaking !!
以来、およそ 10 年ぶりの登場となります。 梅澤です。 この連載で は
Web アプリケーションフレームワーク Seaside を扱っていきます。 メジャー な
Web アプリフレームワークには Struts や Ruby on Rails などがありますが 、Seaside はそうしたものとはかなり異なる考え方で作られています。 もう Web アプリフレームワークは見飽きたという人にとっても、きっと新鮮な驚きを与えてくれるものと思います。
連載は 6 回になる予定です。 少し長丁場になりますが、おつきあい下さい 。
2. Seaside とは ?
2.1 Seaside のコンセプ ト
Seaside のオリジナルの開発者 Avi Bryant はこんな事を言っていま す ( 抄 訳 1 ) 。
長年にわたっ て Web の世界では開発のためのベストプラクティスが蓄積されてきた。 出来る限り状態を保持しない 注意深く吟味された意味のある URL を使う モデルと表示を分離するためにテンプレートを用いる 等である 。
Seaside はこうしたルールを全て破っ た
Web アプリケーションフレームワークだ 。
Web 開発でこれまで叡智とされてきたことを放棄してみると何が得られるのか?
実に多くのことが、得られたのだ。 -- Avi Bryant
つまり 、Seaside では今ま で
Web 系でお約束とされてきたことに反する以下のような特徴を持ちます。
できる限り状態を保持する
URL は一過性のものを使 う
テンプレートを利用しない
なんだかめちゃくちゃのようですが、意味もなく反逆しているわけではありません。
これにより、隅から隅まで、徹底してオブジェクト指向の
Web アプリフレームワークを実現しています。
一般的な Web アプリフレームワークは、だいぶ洗練されてきているものの、まだまだ手続き指向であるものが多いと言えます。 オブジェクト指向でプログラミングというよりは、フレームワークが用意する複雑な設定ファイルをいろいろといじるというものが大半です。
Hello , World !
と出したいだけなのに、何個も設定ファイルを書かされた経験が皆さんにもきっとあることでしょう。
また 、Web アプリフレームワークでよく言われる「 MVC アーキテクチャ」というものも、なかなかのくせ者です。
MVC などといって聞こえは良いものの、単に様々なファイルがモデルとビューとコントローラのディレクトリに分かれているのみで、それぞれの連携は今ひとつというものがほとんどだからです。
モデル・ビュー・コントローラのそれぞれが、インテリジェントな存在(オブジェクト)として相互作用するのが本来の
MVC です。 しかし Web での MVC は、手続きコード( コントローラと呼ばれています ) が、データ構造( モデルと呼ばれています)を取り出して、出力テンプレート(ビューと呼ばれています)に流し込むものというものにあふれています。
この場合アクティブな存在はコントローラという手続きコードだけです。
この Web 系の MVC で開発するには、文字列の名前を間違えないようにすることが重要です。 互いを連携させるためには、テンプレートやモデルのフィールド名や、それぞれのファイル名などを注意深く合わせる必要があります。 ちょっとした変更においても、たくさんのファイルを編集しなければならない仕組みというのは、本当に便利なのでしょうか。
Seaside は、Web でゆがめられてしまった MVC ではなく、本物のオブジェクト指向による MVC を実現しています。 開発者は通常ファイルや HTML ページといったものを意識しません。 もっと上位のコンポーネントという単位を扱います。 通常のオブジェクト指向プログラミング ( Smalltalk ) で
Web アプリの開発を行えるようになっており、当然ながら継承や委譲も行えます。 あたかもオブジェクト指向の GUI プログラミングをしているかのように、サーバサイドの
Web プログラミングができる、それが Seaside です。
3. Seaside に触れる
3.1 インストール
コンセプトの紹介はこのくらいにします。 何はともあれ、実際に入手して試してみることにしましょう。
非常に導入がしやすいということも
Seaside の長所の一つです。
Seaside の本家サイト は
http://www.seaside.st になります。 ここから入手することももちろん可能ですが、日本語パッチ適用の作業を行わなければなりません。
もっとも簡単なのは SeasideJOnePlus を使うことです。 これは、日本人有志 ( 私です ) の手で行われ た
All - in - one パッケージで、上記の対応に加え、日本語の説明資料やサンプルコードなども同梱されたものとなっています。
サイトは下記になります。
SeasideJOnePlus
執筆時点で は
2008/06/20 版が最新になっています。
Zip ファイルになっているのでダウンロードして展開しましょう。 インストールはこれで終わりです 。
SeasideJOnePlus には 、Windows 、Macintosh 、Linux 用の起動用のスクリプトがそれぞれ用意されています。
Windows であれば win_seaside .bat をダブルクリックすれば Seaside がスタートします 。
起動すると以下のような画面が立ち上がります。
右の方に出ている小さな窓が Seaside のサーバオブジェクトの 「 インスペクタ 」です。 Seaside がポート番号 9090 で動いているということがわかります。
Seaside は Smalltalk で動いています2ので、開発環境と実行環境が一体になっています。
別途 IDE などを入手・インストールしなくとも、開発のためのパワフルなツールを最初から使うことができます。
開発に使う言語は Smalltalk です。 Seaside では、ページの飾り付けなどで部分的に CSS を使うことはありますが、基本的には隅から隅まで一つの言語で書いていくことができます。
Smalltalk の解説そのものについては、本連載では行いません。 かいつまんで言う と Ruby のようなダイナミックな特徴を持つオブジェクト指向言語です。 文法は非常に簡潔で、すぐに習得することができます。 まずは 「 早わか り Smalltalk」を見てみるのが良いでしょう。
その他、より詳しい参考資料については末尾に載せておきました。
3.2 サンプルを試す
では、早速 Seaside のサンプルアプリケーションにアクセスしてみましょう。
URL は下記のようになります 。
http://localhost:9090/seaside/
アプリケーションのリストが表示されます。
examples というリンクがありますので、それをクリックし、更に counter というリンクをたどってみましょう 。
以下のような画面になります。
非常に殺風景なアプリケーションですが、Seaside の特徴をよく表したものにもなっています。 ++ のリンクを 5 回ほどクリックしてみましょう。
ここであえて -- のリンクでなく、ブラウザの
Back ボタンを使って戻ってみましょう。 3 まで戻ります 。
さて、このときに 、Web ブラウザ側とサーバ ( Seaside ) 側で何が起こっているでしょうか 。
Back ボタンで戻った場合、単にブラウザのキャッシュを見ることになるので、HTTP による通信は発生しません。 よって、サーバ側は 3 に戻されたということを知らず、カウンタの値は 5 のままのはずです。 ここでもう一度 ++ をクリックすると、はたしてカウンタはどうなるでしょう。
6 になると思いきや、問題なく 4 になります。 不思議ですね。 これが Seaside の大きな特徴の一つ 「 状態の保持 」になります 。
3.3 URLの秘密
もともと Web アプリケーションは 、CGI から始まっています。 つまりブラウザからのリクエストに応じて、何らかの小さなスクリプトを起動し、結果を
HTML にして返すという動きが基本です。 プログラムは一つのリクエストのたびに起動してすぐに終了することになるため、状態を持ちません。
検索結果を返すだけといった、一過性の処理の場合は、こうした動きでかまわないのですが、最近は
Web アプリケーションもかなり複雑になってきています。 ショッピングカートに見られるように、ユーザが複数のページを行き来することもあります。 このような場合にも、あくまでユーザからは一つのアプリケーションを立ち上げているように見えなければなりません。
こうした同一ユーザからの複数アクセスをまとめるために、セッション
ID というものがよく使われます。 プログラムの状態はリクエストの度に破棄されますが、ID をキーにして 、DB にユーザごとの状態を保存しておきます。 ID を URL や Cookie に埋め込んでおくことで、直前のリクエストの状態を
DB から復元し、バラバラのリクエストを一連のものとして扱うことができるのです。
Java の Servlet のように、サーバ側でプロセスを常時立ち上げておく形を取る場合には、DB を使わずとも、オンメモリで状態をとっておくことができます。
DB をいちいち参照するよりも、速度的に有利な方式と言えます。
Seaside もオンメモリでセッション情報を保持しています。 セッションの情報は URL に埋め込まれます3 。
もういちど 、Counter の URL を見てみましょう 。
http://localhost:9090/seaside/examples/counter?_s=dprpbMsJoWWmwokI&_k=VatUOsrJ
上記の URL のパラメータとし て _s=dprpbMsJoWWmwokI の部分がセッション ID を表しています。 これによ り Seaside はユーザを特定しているのです。 ++ や -- をクリックしてもこの ID は変わることがありません。 ブラウ ザ ( やタブ ) を閉じるなどして Counter アプリケーションを終了するまで同じ値が使われます。
ブラウザを新規に開き
、http://localhost:9090/seaside/examples/counter という具合に URL を指定すると、先ほどとは別のセッション
ID が振られるということがわかるでしょう。 ( 筆者の場合は _s=abDvKApYFhiepEyc となりました ) 。
ここまでは、極めて普通です。 Seaside でなくともこのような仕組みを持 つ
Web アプリケーションフレームワークは多くあります。
しかし URL を改めて見ると、_k=VatUOsrJ
という箇所があることに気づきます。 ++ や -- をクリックするたびにこの値は変わります。 実はこの ID は「継続 ID 」 と呼ばれ、ユーザ の 「 動作( アクション ) 」を特定するために使われています。
例えばユーザが 3 から 4 に移るために ++ を押すという動作があります。 また 4 から 5 に移るという動作もあるでしょう。 これらに ID をつけて管理しているのです。
セッション ID のみの情報では、サーバはユーザの直近のリクエストの値しか保持することができません。 このためブラウザ の
Back ボタンを押したりすると、ブラウザとサーバ側とでずれが生じることになります。
しかし Seaside ではさらに細かい単位でユーザの状態を管理できます。
Back ボタンで戻ったとしても、ユーザが 「 3 から 4 へ移る」ための ++ リンクを押せば、その ID によって 、Seaside は 3 から 4 へ移るアクションを( 直近の状態と関係なく ) 、もう一度実行することができます。 「 ブラウザ の Back ボタンで戻らないで下さい 」 「 注文ボタンは一回だけクリックしてください」などいう注意書きは、
Seaside では不要です。 アプリケーションの状態を、ユーザの動作という単位で、逐一管理できるからです。
Seaside は「継続」という仕組みによって、この優れた機能を実現しています。 継続を用いる Web アプリケーションフレームワークには 、Seaside だけでなく 、Kahua などがあります。 継続そのものの説明は、本連載の範囲を超えてしまいますので、興味のある方は末尾の参考資料をじっくり読んでみると良いでしょう。
もっとも作者の Avi Bryant さんは 、Seaside における 「継続」の利用をそれほど重要視しているわけではありません。
AJAX など、別の方法によっても、実行段階に基づいてアプリケーションの状態を管理するということは可能だからです。 むしろ Seaside で重要なのは 、Web アプリケーションにおいて も 「 できるだけ状態を保持する」というスタンスに立ったことだとしています。 これによって、Web アプリケーションならではの妙な慣例をユーザに押しつけず、普通のアプリケーションのように見せることに成功しています。
4. 開発環境を味わう
「 継続」という仕組みを使うことで 、Seaside はユーザから見て自然な姿の
Web アプリケーションを提供するということがわかりました。 それでは開発者にとってはどうなのでしょうか。
Seaside のもう一つの魅力は、開発環境が非常に充実しているということです。
Web アプリケーション開発というと、とかく細かなテキストファイルを編集するというファイルベースのものが連想されますが、Seaside の場合は 「 そこにあるオブジェクトを直接つかむ」タイプの、直感的な開発が可能です。
4.1 開発者用メニュー
Counter アプリのページを改めて見ると、下のほうに " New Session " や " Configure " などのリンクがあることがわかります。 これは開発時にのみ表示されるようになっており、Web ブラウザから、開発に便利な各種の機能を使えるようになっています。
" New Session " 新たなセッションでアプリケーションを起動するために使われます。
" Configure " アプリケーションの設定のために使用します。 アプリケーションが使うライブラリや、モードの設定( 開発モードかデプロイモードか) を行うことができます。 詳しくは後の回で扱います 。
" Toggle Halos " ハローと呼ばれる枠をコンポーネントの周りに表示します。 コンポーネントがページのどの部分を表示しているかの把握に役立ちます。 またコンポーネントをデバッグするためのツールを呼び出すことができます。(後述)
" Profiler " ページを表示するために行われた処理のプロファイリングをします。 どのメソッドが呼ばれ、どれだけの時間がかかっているかを知ることができます。
" Memory " サーバ内でどのオブジェクトがどれだけのメモリを占有しているかの確認ができます。
" Terminate " セッションを破棄し、アプリケーションを終了させます。
" XHTML " 現在表示しているアプリケーションのページが正しい
XHTML であるかどうかを検査します 。
では、この中で最もよく使う 3 番目の " Toggle Halos " で、Web ブラウザからどのような開発が行えるのかを確かめることにしましょう。
4.2 ハローを出す
ハローとは、 「 後光」のことで 、Squeak の Morphic による GUI プログラミングでおなじみの UI です。 オブジェクトの周りに、そのオブジェクトを操作するためのハンドルが取り囲むように表示されるので、このように呼ばれています。
Seaside のハローも Morphic にインスパイアされたものです。 " Toggle Halo " をクリックすると、アイコンつきの枠が表示されるようになります。
( トグルなので再びクリックすると元に戻ります ) 。
このハローにより、現在のページをどういったコンポーネントが表示しているのかが視覚的にわかります。
カウンタの例では、ハローの左上に WACounter とあります。 これは WACounter ( というクラスのインスタンス ) が表示を行っているということを示しています。
右上にあ る " R " と " S " のリンクで、コンポーネントの表示の仕方を変えることができます。 R( endering ) がデフォルトとなっており、コンポーネントをそのまま表示している状態です4。 S( tring ) をクリックすると 、XHTML を直接見ることができます 。
4.3 スタイルシートエディタ
ハローの左上部分にあるアイコンは、個々のコンポーネントの状態を見たり編集したりするものになっています。
まずは一番右のスタイルシートエディタを起動してみましょう。
下記のような画面となります。
ここに CSS を書いて " Save " することで、コンポーネントが使うスタイルを設定できます5 。
さきほど XHTML を確認したときにカウンタの数字が H1 タグで書かれていたことがわかりましたので、それに対してスタイルを適用してみることにします。
H1 { color : red ; }
などとすれば良いでしょう。 書き込んだ後 、" Save " し、左上のハローの x ( 閉じる ) ボタンでエディタを閉じます。
コンポーネントにスタイルが無事に適用されました。
4.4 インスペクタ
それでは次に真ん中のアイコンをクリックしてみることにしましょう。
今度は以下のような画面に切り替わります。
a WACounter となっているのは 、WACounter というコンポーネントクラスのインスタンスを見ているからです。 属性( インスタンス変数 ) として decoration と count を持っているということがわかります。 decoration はとりあえず無視するとして 、count の値を書き換えてみることにしましょう 。
count を選択し、下のペインに適当な値を書いて 、" do it " します 。
インスペクタを閉じるとコンポーネントの値が書き換わっていることがわかります。
このようにインスペクタを使えば、コンポーネントの値を読んだり、書き換えたりすることがブラウザ経由で可能になります。
4.5 コードブラウザ
今度は一番右のアイコンをクリックしてみます。
Web ブラウザの中に 、Smalltalk のコードブラウザが出現します 。
WACounter クラスが最初から選択されています。 下半分に表示されているコードペインを使うと、WACounter クラスの定義やメソッドの内容を書き換えることが可能です。
一番右のリストが 、WACounter のメソッド一覧になっています。 increase を選んでみましょう。コードメインを見ると 、
increase count := count + 1
となっています。 先ほどインスペクタで見た count の値を 1 だけ増やしているのです 。
これを
increase count := count + 2
のように書き換え 、" Accept " を押してみましょう 。
最初の変更なので、開発者のイニシャルを聞かれます。
自分のイニシャルを適当に入れて下さい。
イニシャルを入力すると、ブラウザに戻ります。 左上のハローの x ( 閉じる ) ボタンでブラウザを閉じると、元の
Counter の画面になります。 ++ のリンクをクリックしてみましょう。
サーバ側のコードを書き換えたので、2 ずつ値が増加するようになりました。
4.6 デバッガ
ここまでくれ ば Web ブラウザ上でデバッグといきたいものです。 残念ながら全て を
Web ブラウザからというわけにはいきませんが 、Seaside は
Web ブラウザとサーバ側のデバッガとの連携機能を持っています。
まずは先ほどと同じようにして increase を書き換えます。 今度は数字でなく nil が足されるようにしてしまいます 。
increase count := count + nil
Accept したあと で Counter に戻り ++ を押すと、当然ながらエラーが起こります。
Web ブラウザにはエラーが起こるに至ったスタックトレースが表示されます。
スタックトレース上のリンクをたどり、各段階でのオブジェクトの状態を見ることもできますが、Seaside でユニークなのは、上部に表示されている
" Debug " リンクです。 クリックしてみましょう 。
Web ブラウザ側では何の変化もないように見えますが、サーバ側ではデバッガが立ち上がります。
サーバ側のデバッガでは、スタックトレースのより細かな情報を見ることができます。
なによりこちらのほうが操作しやすいでしょう。 リストを 4 つほど下にたどると、エラーの原因となったメソッドである increase につき当たります。 コードを 1 が足されるように元に戻して、右クリックメニューで " 了 解 " を選 び6 、左上 の " 継続 " ボタンを押します 。
Web ブラウザに戻ると 、Counter のアプリケーションが復活していることがわかります。
このように Seaside では、サーバ側はもとより 、Web ブラウザも落としたり再読み込みしたりせずに、極めてインタラクティブに開発を進めていくことができます。 設定ファイルベースの開発環境では、ファイルを書き換えて、コンパイルし、デプロイし直してなどの手間がかかるのに対して、Seaside では思考を途切れさせるものが一切ありません。 ノンストップで の
Web プログラミングが可能になっています 。
5. まとめ
今回は Seaside のコンセプトの紹介がメインでした。 Web アプリにも関わらず 、 「 そこにあるオブジェクトをつかむ」タイプの開発ができそうだという感触が得られたのではないでしょうか。
次回からはコンポーネントを用いたプログラミングの仕方に入っていきます。 ご期待下さい。

Let 's " do it " !!
The brewer who dared market “ Legal Weed ” has won .
Vaune Dillmann took on federal regulators this year when they ordered his Mt. Shasta Brewing Co. in the Northern California town of Weed to stop topping beer bottles with caps bearing the play on words , “ Try Legal Weed . ”
Regulators cited federal law prohibiting drug references on alcoholic beverages .
A plain - talking 61 - year - old former cop , Dillmann refused to back down , and his high - spirited appeal drew widespread media attention as well as support from beer lovers and civil libertarians far and wide .
Advertisement
Now , facing a storm of bad publicity and the prospect of a drawn - out court battle , authorities at the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau have quietly reversed course .
The agency finalized approval of Dillmann ’s controversial cap Thursday .
At first , Dillmann thought the fight might put his brewery out of business .
“ They acted like Big Brother .
They said I was guilty of a thought crime , ” Dillmann said of his six - month battle with the authorities .
“ But it ’s over .
Weed fought the law , and Weed won ! ”
In a recent letter to Dillmann , the agency ’s assistant director conceded that the phrase refers to the brand name of the microbrew and said it does not mislead customers by alluding to a slang word for cannabis .
Advertisement
Art Resnick , an agency spokesman , said the switch in stance demonstrates the due process in the agency ’s appeal process , adding that “ the system worked as it should . ”
Federal regulators , he said , “ pride ourselves in working with industry members .
We are not in the business of putting anyone out of business . ”
In fact , sales of Dillmann ’s brews have doubled in the six months since the controversy began .
Dillmann said his small brewery -- located in the morning shadow of Mt. Shasta , just across Interstate 5 from downtown Weed -- now has to play catch - up just to fill all the orders .
But what ’s been good for business has n’t necessarily been good for the soul .
Dillmann said his fight with the feds took a toll on his family -- in particular his wife , Barbara , who retired just over a year ago as Siskiyou County ’s superintendent of schools .
Advertisement
The fight with the regulators was “ embarrassing and exhausting , ” he said .
“ It ’s been a whirlwind of ups and downs , frustration over whether we might be closed down or sanctioned . ”
Still , Dillmann conceded he took pleasure in the support his cause received .
He got 1,400 e-mails from beer aficionados and won backing from Weed ’s mayor , the city attorney and a county supervisor .
He also earned a lot more than the proverbial 15 minutes of fame , appearing on Fox News and in newspaper headlines as far away as Saudi Arabia .
Among those who saw the reports and got in touch were his old high school football coach and two old girlfriends in his hometown of Milwaukee .
Advertisement
Most of the folks back home in Weed -- population 3,000 -- could n’t understand what the fuss was about .
The little town has been marketing the double entendre of its name for years , with gas stations selling “ High on Weed ” T - shirts and a sign at the town ’s exit reading “ Temporarily Out of Weed . ”
In fact , the town ’s name refers to Abner Weed , a local lumber baron and turn - of - the - 20th - century state senator .
He ’s also the namesake of Dillmann ’s prized Abner Weed Ale , which is among those he plans to enter Sept. 13 in a brew fest in Sacramento .
Last year , his Shastafarian Porter won first place .
Each bottle he brings to the festival will bear one of those shiny gold caps with the black - stenciled words that made Dillmann ’s last six months both harrowing and hilarious .

Good beer , Løvøya , Norway
I wanted to make the 2 K series quite long , with various lists of beers selected by different criteria , but I never managed to find any selections that inspired me enough to actually write the pieces , so we 'll round off with the obvious one instead .
Picking the five best out of the ( right now ) 2149 beers is actually harder than picking the five worst , because there 's more competetion for this spot .
These all have ratings that are so close that I can't really say now , up to three years later , which ones really are the best out of the five .
And I can only get hold of two , so comparing them again is not going to be possible , either .
So the order of presentation here is basically random .
Ølfabrikken Porter
This beer has a sad story attached to it , unfortunately .
Ølfabrikken is Danish , and my favourite Scandinavian brewery , started by Christian Skovdal Andersen .
He 's a fantastic brewer , but seems to have made some business decisions that had unfortunate consequences .
He entered into a partnership with another Danish brewery , Gourmetbryggeriet , which eventually resulted in Ølfabrikken being taken over by them , and Christian being evicted .
I do n't know the ins and outs of the story , but by all accounts it 's a sad and acrimonious one .
The beer is now made by Gourmetbryggeriet , and distributed in cans instead of the original bottles .
People tell me it 's still as good as it was , and when I go to Copenhagen on Friday I intend to check this for myself .

Biggish dark brown lasting head , almost black .
Creamy with larger bubbles .
Body is pitch black , without a glimmer of light .
Deep , sweetish harmonic chocolatey coffee aroma with notes of toffee , chocolate cake , and maybe a touch of wild berries .
Deep , smooth burnt chocolate taste with notes of wild berries and pine needle hops .
Extremely harmonic , and smooth as velvet .
Dryish , chocolatey aftertaste .
Leaves coating of complex sugars on the lips .
Fantastic !

Rochefort 10
Rochefort 10 , at home
This is from one of the six breweries in the Low Countries where the brewing really is done by monks , and unlike some of the others , these guys have not sold out .
The brewery is actually inside the Abbey of Notre - Dame de Saint - Rémy .
The monastery has been brewing since 1595 , but not continually .
The French revolutionary armies closed down most of the monasteries in the region , including this one , and it was only in the late 19th century that they started brewing again .
This beer has been one of my absolute favourites since the first time I tasted it , but it seems that since then they 've started sending out the beers without giving them enough storage time .
If you subtract 5 years from the best before - date on the bottles you have the time it was brewed .
Wait until at least six months after that date before drinking the beer , so that it gets time to develop the proper mellow flavour and wear off the sharp high alcohols and grapefruit .
I 'm told that the beer will continue to improve for at least the first 10 years , but few people have the patience to wait that long .
I have put away some bottles in my cellar , so check back in 10 years , and maybe I 'll have a report for you then .
4.4 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 8/10 4/5 8/10 5/5 19/20
Medium beige coarse head over dark brown body that 's seemingly opaque black , but through which a little light brown can be spotted at the edges .
Intense , sweet licorice and anise aroma with notes of chocolate and bready yeast and a touch of vanilla .
Taste is deep , intense spiciness , mostly anise and licorice , but also pepper , cinnamon , chocolate , and some burntness , and god alone knows what else .
Toffee , sweetness .
The aftertaste is bitter chocolate anise , with lingering anise .
What can I say ?
This is an undying classic .

Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout
Photo from feaverish , by permission
I brought this one home from the US and had it at a tasting at home with friends .
My girlfriend still vividly remembers coming home to find that I 've left a bit for her , just so she could share the excitement .
As I remember it , I did n't offer it to her , but more or less forced her to taste it .
I must confess I do n't know too much about Great Divide .
They are from Denver , Colorado , and brew a number of excellent beers .
In fact , they have no less than 8 beers in the top 5 % on RateBeer , which is quite an achievement .
They also have pretty good distribution to Denmark , so chances are I 'll be able to taste more of their beers .
4.4 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 9/10 5/5 8/10 4/5 18/20
Medium dark brown creamy head with larger bubbles .
Utterly opaque black body .
Deep , sweet aroma of burnt licorice , coffee , and wild berries , with notes of bread and oil .
Very harmonic ; I could just sit and smell this for ever .
Deep , sweet , burnt taste of chocolate , hops , and roastiness .
Burnt marzipan flavours linger .
Huge amounts of hops can be detected , but they blend in nicely with the rest .
Caramel , nicely , vaguely burnt .
Velvety , oily , seductive mouthfeel .
Mellow .
Lovely !
Fantastic !
One of the best beers I 've had .
De Dolle Dulle Teve
De Dolle Brouwers is a rather unusual Belgian brewery .
The name means the mad brewers , which they are n't really , but their bottles are highly distinctive with their polka - dotted bow ties on the bottle neck .
The beers are similarly distinctive with a clear house character which I assume is imparted by the yeast strain they use .
My general advice is that if you see a bottle from this brewery , just buy it , regardless of which one it is .
4.4 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 9/10 5/5 8/10 4/5 18/20
Huge , creamy white head , which takes forever to subside makes a nice contrast with the dark - orange opaque body .
An aroma of yeasty bread hangs around it before I even lift it up to smell properly .
Up close it smells more of spicy fruit with the signature de Dolle yeast aroma profile .
Powerful , broad taste of bread , coriander , yeast with quite a bit of alcohol heat and a good deal of bitterness at the end .
The bitterness is mostly overpowered by the taste , however .
Very harmonic , yet complex .
An extraordinary beer !
Very , very good .
Has to be one of the best trippels I 've had , mad or sane .

Nøgne Ø Dark Horizon
Dark Horizon
There was considerable excitement when Nøgne Ø announced that they 'd brewed their strongest beer ever .
There 's always excitement when Nøgne Ø announces a new beer , but this was clearly something special .
Wild rumours were circulating that the head of the Tokyo Porter Lover 's Association had tasted the beer and loved it so much that by next morning he 'd written a haiku about it , titled Dark Horizons .
There is no such association , but the story is otherwise accurate , the author of the haiku tells me .
And a haiku is indeed printed on the little cardboard slip that hangs around the beer bottle :
In winter 's cold
alcohol 's heat
refreshes the spirit
And indeed it does .
The beer itself is a modified version of their imperial stout , with lots of added sugar and coffee , fermented a second time with wine yeast to take it all the way up to 16 % .
It was released a bit early , so when I tasted the first bottle I bought the taste still felt a bit raw or unblended .
However , I had the good sense to buy seven bottles , and five of those are still in my cellar .
It 's a year old now , and has improved fantastically , blending much better , and developing sherry - like notes from oxidization .
Unfortunately , this was the First Edition , which was brewed only once .
So if you do n't already have a bottle , chances are you never will .
It 's still sold in some places ( like Olutkellari , Helsinki ) , but it 's not going to last , and you 'll have to pay dearly .
Fortunately , they have already brewed the Second Edition , which is not yet released .
This time around they 've increased the alcohol a bit , and used better coffee .
When I tasted it it was still immature , but very promising .
Now I 'm told that the alcohol has taken over and become too sharp and dominating .
I still believe in the beer , though , and very much look forward to trying the released version .
4.3 Aroma Appearance Flavour Palate Overall 8/10 4/5 8/10 5/5 18/20
Small dark brown head does n't last , but shrinks into a thin ring .
Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges .
Intense sweet toffeeish chocolate liquor aroma with notes of coffee , bread , and ripe fruit .
Very harmonic and balanced , despite the clear alcohol presence .
Deep , intense sweet chocolate and toffee taste with licorice and alcohol notes .
Bready , yeasty presence , too .
Very harmonic .
Mouthfeel is initially thick and oily , then goes intensely warm from the alcohol .
Also a kind of muddy , coarse feel to it .
No real aftertaste , but bitter orange - peel and chocolate taste lingers .
The beer is still a bit sharp and edgy ; I imagine it 's likely to mellow and improve a lot with age .
It feels a bit too powerful in the first couple of sips , but then settles into a sweet chocolatey toffee character , which is intensely pleasurable .
A pity I had to share this with my girlfriend ; would have preferred to drink it all myself . :-)
Fantastic !
A king among beers , indeed .
( 0.5 l bottle from the wine monopoly . )
The end
This week I 'll be off to the European Beer Festival in Copenhagen .
The program tells me that three of these beers will be available there .
Nøgne Ø will also release Dark Horizon Second Edition , in effect making it four .
I guess you can say that I 'm looking forward to the trip .
Buried in the first quarter earnings report from Microsoft is an astounding fact .
For the first time that I can remember , Microsoft closed the quarter with less cash than Apple .
Cash , cash equivalents and short - term investments for Microsoft add up to $ 20.7 billion .
Apple , meanwhile , closed the quarter with $ 24.5 billion .
There are a lot of things that explain this .
Microsoft is still a cash machine in Windows and Office , but it has been pouring its money in recent years into shareholder dividends , stock buybacks , and acquisitions .
Apple , meanwhile , has n’t been as aggressive on those fronts .
Microsoft does n’t even have enough cash to buy Yahoo !
outright ; it would likely have to finance an acquisition with some debt .
Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple , said yesterday , “ The economic downturn may present extraordinary opportunities to companies that have cash .
Cash is king .
We are very comfortable with cash in bank and it is not burning a hole in our pocket . ”
I never thought I would see this day .

WASHINGTON - Senator John McCain raised nearly $ 90,000 from broadcast and telecommunications companies in four instances shortly before or after he interceded on their behalf with federal regulators in 1998 and 1999 , according to campaign records reviewed yesterday .
Aides released about 500 letters that McCain has written as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee since 1997 , and it appeared last night that only 15 involved contributors to his campaigns .
McCain , who has built his presidential candidacy around denunciations of special - interest money in Washington , said yesterday that his only concern was to protect consumers .
But in several cases , according to federal campaign finance records that were matched against the letters , the correspondence to the Federal Communications Commission , which McCain 's committee oversees , coincided with substantial fund - raising efforts by the companies that stood to benefit from his actions .
In one case , officials of BellSouth Corp. donated $ 16,750 to the Arizona senator at a fund - raiser on May 6 , 1998 .
Four months later , McCain asked the FCC in a letter to give '' serious consideration ' ' to allowing BellSouth to enter the long - distance market .
Although McCain has long favored the so - called Baby Bells , he also wrote to the FCC on behalf of AT&T , Sprint , and MCI Worldcom in June 1998 .
Two weeks later , Sprint officers donated $ 2,000 .
In October 1998 , McCain raised another $ 25,800 from AT&T officials at a fund - raiser .
The records show that McCain also interceded on behalf of two major satellite television companies , Echostar and DirecTV , in an effort to help them win permission to carry local broadcast signals .
Echostar 's chairman raised about $ 25,000 for McCain in a period between two McCain letters on his behalf .
McCain was put on the defensive last week , when The Boston Globe reported that he interceded last month with the FCC on behalf of Paxson Communications , which owns or operates 73 television stations .
McCain 's letter - writing began soon after the company helped him raise $ 20,000 , and while he was using Paxson 's corporate jet .
After the report last week , McCain canceled a fund - raiser that Paxson 's chairman , Lowell Paxson , was to have held for him yesterday in Florida , an event that was expected to raise $ 50,000 .
The Globe also reported last week that McCain last May rebuked the FCC for bias against two Baby Bells , SBC Communications and Ameritech , which were seeking FCC permission to merge .
Just before that May 12 letter , officials of the two companies contributed or solicited donations of about $ 120,000 to McCain 's campaign .
The letters made public yesterday also include an April 1999 letter McCain wrote to the FCC on Ameritech .
That was just after the company 's chairman at the time , Richard Notebaert , a friend of McCain's , cohosted a Chicago fund - raiser for the senator .
Dan Schnur , the McCain campaign 's communications director , said yesterday that McCain 's contributors get access to him , but not preferential treatment .
'' Big -money contributors to both parties get access that other people do n't , '' Schnur said .
But , he said , McCain '' and the people who work for him do their level best to make sure those contributors are not given different treatment . ''
McCain has often criticized the campaign finance system , saying it leaves lawmakers beholden to business interests that provide the funds .
Although McCain has said he too is a victim of the system , his rhetoric often suggests that he himself has been scrupulous in not taking actions that benefit campaign donors .
The campaign records examined yesterday include funds that McCain raised for his presidential campaign during the first three quarters of 1999 , and funds donated to his 1998 Senate reelection camapaign .
In 1998 , McCain faced only token opposition , and was able to transfer about half the $ 4 million he raised to his presidential campaign .
Officials of BellSouth are among his largest contributors .
In 1999 , officials of the regional Bell operating company , contributed nearly $ 30,000 to McCain 's campaign .
BellSouth wanted entry into the long - distance business , and petitioned the FCC to that end .
The FCC was then required to judge whether there was enough competition in the local market to warrant such a step .
McCain wrote two letters - one on March 6 , 1998 , and the other on Sept. 15 , 1998 - arguing that wireless service should be taken into account as competition .
The $ 16,750 fund - raising event was on May 6 , 1998 .
In the September letter , McCain said : '' I encourage you to give serious consideration ' ' to whether wireless service ''is providing competition to the local exchange market . ''
He said the FCC '' should be focused on implementing the Telecommunications Act to encourage competition . ''
'' He wrote to the commission to express his view as to the law , '' said Mark Buse , the Commerce Committee staff director .
'' The FCC ignored this , and denied BellSouth 's petition in 1998 . ''
Echostar Chairman Charles W. Ergen has long sought permission to broadcast the network affiliate programming into homes .
The company was stymied by a 1998 court case .
McCain wrote a letter on Aug. 19 , 1998 , to the FCC chairman , William E. Kennard , to ' ' raise our concerns . ''
McCain wrote that the case - which led to a ruling in favor of the networks and against the satellite companies - '' threatens to undermine the progress we have made in promoting competition . ''
Kennard replied that he essentially agreed .
Correspondence led to the Satellite Home Viewers
Act , passed last fall .
'' Echostar and DirecTV did both come in and meet the chairman , '' Buse said .
'' They did not ask him to do anything specific . ''
AT&T and long - distance competitors had a far different concern , according to Buse - the so - called '' Gore tax ' ' on long - distance carriers .
The money goes to install the Internet in schools and libraries .
The big three long - distance carriers wanted to be able to itemize this tax on phone bills , so customers would know this was not a rate increase by the phone companies .
The FCC wanted the companies to bury the tax in the bill .
Editor 's Note :
This story was originally published in the March 2004 issue of Scientific American .
In early November 2000 the Big Island of Hawaii experienced its largest earthquake in more than a decade .
Some 2,000 cubic kilometers of the southern slope of Kilauea volcano lurched toward the ocean , releasing the energy of a magnitude 5.7 shock .
Part of that motion took place under an area where thousands of people stop every day to catch a glimpse of one of the island ’s most spectacular lava flows .
Yet when the earthquake struck , no one noticed — not even seismologists .
How could such a notable event be overlooked ?
As it turns out , quaking is not an intrinsic part of all earthquakes .
The event on Kilauea was one of the first unambiguous records of a so - called silent earthquake , a type of massive earth movement unknown to science until just a few years ago .
Indeed , I would never have discovered this quake if my colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey ’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory had not already been using a network of sensitive instruments to monitor the volcano ’s activity .
When I finally noticed that Kilauea ’s south flank had shifted 10 centimeters along an underground fault , I also saw that this movement had taken nearly 36 hours — a turtle ’s pace for an earthquake .
In a typical tremor , opposite sides of the fault rocket past each other in a matter of seconds — quickly enough to create the seismic waves that cause the ground to rumble and shake .
But just because an earthquake happens slowly and quietly does not make it insignificant .
My co-investigators and I realized immediately that Kilauea ’s silent earthquake could be a harbinger of disaster .
If that same large body of rock and debris were to gain momentum and take the form of a gigantic landslide — separating itself from the rest of the volcano and sliding rapidly into the sea — the consequences would be devastating .
The collapsing material would push seawater into towering tsunami waves that could threaten coastal cities along the entire Pacific Rim .
Such catastrophic flank failure , as geologists call it , is a potential threat around many island volcanoes worldwide .
Unexpected Stir
FORTUNATELY , the discovery of silent earthquakes is revealing more good news than bad .
The chances of catastrophic flank failure are slim , and the instruments that record silent earthquakes might make early warnings possible .
New evidence for conditions that might trigger silent slip suggests bold strategies for preventing flank collapse .
Occurrences of silent earthquakes are also being reported in areas where flank failure is not an issue .
There silent earthquakes are inspiring ways to improve forecasts of their ground - shaking counterparts .
The discovery of silent earthquakes and their link to catastrophic flank collapse was a by - product of efforts to study other potential natural hazards .
Destructive earthquakes and volcanoes are a concern in Japan and the U.S. Pacific Northwest , where tectonic plates constantly plunge deep into the earth along what are called subduction zones .
Beginning in the early 1990s , geologists began deploying large networks of continuously recording Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receivers in these regions and along the slopes of active volcanoes , such as Kilauea .
By receiving signals from a constellation of more than 30 navigational satellites , these instruments can measure their own positions on the planet ’s surface at any given time to within a few millimeters .
The scientists who deployed these GPS receivers expected to see both the slow , relentless motion of the planet ’s shell of tectonic plates and the relatively quick movements that earthquakes and volcanoes trigger .
It came as some surprise when these instruments detected small ground movements that were not associated with any known earthquake or eruption .
When researchers plotted the ground movements on a map , the pattern that resulted very much resembled one characteristic of fault movement .
In other words , all the GPS stations on one side of a given fault moved several centimeters in the same general direction .
This pattern would have been no surprise if it had taken a year or longer to form .
In that case , scientists would have known that a slow and steady process called fault creep was responsible .
But at rates of up to centimeters a day , the mystery events were hundreds of times as fast as that .
Beyond their relative speediness , these silent earthquakes shared another attribute with their noisy counterparts that distinguished them from fault creep : they are not steady processes but instead are discrete events that begin and end suddenly .
That sudden beginning , when it takes place on the slopes of a volcanic island , creates concern about a possible catastrophic flank event .
Most typical earthquakes happen along faults that have built - in brakes : motion stops once the stress is relieved between the two chunks of earth that are trying to move past each other .
But activity may not stop if gravity becomes the primary driver .
In the worst - case scenario , the section of the volcano lying above the fault becomes so unstable that once slip starts , gravity pulls the entire mountainside downhill until it disintegrates into a pile of debris on the ocean floor .
The slopes of volcanoes such as Kilauea become steep and vulnerable to this kind of collapse when the lava from repeated eruptions builds them up more rapidly than they can erode away .
Discovering the silent earthquake on Kilauea suggests that the volcano ’s south flank is on the move — perhaps on its way to eventual obliteration .
For now , friction along the fault is acting like an emergency brake .
But gravity has won out in many other instances in the past .
Scientists have long seen evidence of ancient collapses in sonar images of giant debris fields in the shallow waters surrounding volcanic islands around the world , including Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean .
In the Hawaiian Islands , geologists have found more than 25 individual collapses that have occurred over the past five million years — the blink of an eye in geologic time .
In a typical slide , the volume of material that enters the ocean is hundreds of times as great as the section of Mount St. Helens that blew apart during the 1980 eruption — more than enough to have triggered immense tsunamis .
On the Hawaiian island of Lanai , for instance , geologists discovered evidence of wave action , including abundant marine shell fragments , at elevations of 325 meters .
Gary M. McMurtry of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and his colleagues conclude that the most likely way the shells could have reached such a lofty location was within the waves of a tsunami that attained the astonishing height of 300 meters along some Hawaiian coastlines .
Most of the tallest waves recorded in modern times were no more than one tenth that size .
Preparing for the Worst
AS FRIGHTENING AS such an event may sound , this hazard must be understood in the proper context .
Catastrophic failure of volcanic slopes is very rare on a human timescale — though far more common than the potential for a large asteroid or comet to have a damaging collision with the earth .
Collapses large enough to generate a tsunami occur somewhere in the Hawaiian Islands only about once every 100,000 years .
Some scientists estimate that such events occur worldwide once every 10,000 years .
Because the hazard is extremely destructive when it does happen , many scientists agree that it is worth preparing for .
To detect deformation within unstable volcanic islands , networks of continuous GPS receivers are beginning to be deployed on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean , on Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands , and throughout the Galápagos archipelago , among others .
Kilauea ’s network of more than 20 GPS stations , for example , has already revealed that the volcano experiences creep , silent earthquakes as well as large , destructive typical earthquakes .
Some scientists propose , however , that Kilauea may currently be protected from catastrophic collapse by several underwater piles of mud and rock — probably debris from old flank collapses — that are buttressing its south flank .
New discoveries about the way Kilauea is slipping can be easily generalized to other island volcanoes that may not have similar buttressing structures .
Whatever the specific circumstances for an island , the transition from silent slip to abrupt collapse would involve a sudden acceleration of the mobile slope .
In the worst case , this acceleration would proceed immediately to breakneck velocities , leaving no chance for early detection and warning .
In the best case , the acceleration would occur in fits and starts , in a cascade of silent earthquakes slowly escalating into regular earthquakes , and then on to catastrophe .
A continuous GPS network could easily detect this fitful acceleration , well before ground - shaking earthquakes began to occur and , with luck , in plenty of time for a useful tsunami warning .
If the collapse were big enough , however , a few hours ’ or even days ’ warning might come as little comfort because it would be so difficult at that point to evacuate everyone .
This problem raises the question of whether authorities might ever implement preventive measures .
The problem of stabilizing the teetering flanks of oceanic volcanoes is solvable — in principle .
In practice , however , the effort required would be immense .
Consider simple brute force .
If enough rock were removed from the upper reaches of an unstable volcanic flank , then the gravitational potential energy that is driving the system toward collapse would disappear for at least several hundred thousand years .
A second possible method — lowering an unstable flank slowly through a series of small earthquakes — would be much cheaper but fraught with geologic unknowns and potential dangers .
To do so , scientists could conceivably harness as a tool to prevent collapse the very thing that may be currently driving silent earthquakes on Kilauea .
Nine days before the most recent silent earthquake on Kilauea , a torrential rainstorm dropped nearly a meter of water on the volcano in less than 36 hours .
Geologists have long known that water leaking into faults can trigger earthquakes , and nine days is about the same amount of time that they estimate it takes water to work its way down through cracks and pores in Kilauea ’s fractured basaltic rock to a depth of five kilometers — where the silent earthquake occurred .
My colleagues and I suspect that the burden of the overlying rock pressurized the rainwater , forcing the sides of the fault apart and making it much easier for them to slip past each other .
This discovery lends credence to the controversial idea of forcefully injecting water or steam into faults at the base of an unstable flank to trigger the stress - relieving earthquakes needed to let it down slowly .
This kind of human - induced slip happens at very small scales all the time at geothermal plants and other locations where water is pumped into the earth .
But when it comes to volcanoes , the extreme difficulty lies in putting the right amount of fluid in the right place so as not to inadvertently generate the very collapse that is meant to be avoided .
Some geophysicists considered this strategy as a way to relieve stress along California ’s infamous San Andreas fault , but they ultimately abandoned the idea for fear that it would create more problems than it would solve .
Wedges of Water
APART FROM CALLING attention to the phenomenon of catastrophic collapse of the flank of a volcano , the discovery of silent earthquakes is forcing scientists to reconsider various aspects of fault motion — including seismic hazard assessments .
In the U.S. Pacific Northwest , investigators have observed many silent earthquakes along the enormous Cascadia fault zone between the North American plate and the subducting Juan de Fuca plate .
One curious feature of these silent earthquakes is that they happen at regular intervals — so regular , in fact , that scientists are now predicting their occurrence successfully .
This predictability most likely stems from the fact that water flowing from below subduction zones may exert significant control over when and where these faults slip silently .
As the subducting plate sinks deeper into the earth , it encounters higher and higher temperatures and pressures , which release the significant amount of water trapped in waterrich minerals that exist within the slab .
The silent earthquakes may then take place when a batch of fluid from the slab is working its way up — as the fluid passes , it will unclamp the fault zone a little bit , perhaps allowing some slow slip .
What is more , Garry Rogers and Herb Dragert of the Geological Survey of Canada reported last June that these silent tremors might even serve as precursors to some of the region ’s large , ground - shaking shocks .
Because the slow slips occur deep and at discrete intervals , they regulate the rate at which stress accumulates on the shallower part of the fault zone , which moves in fits and starts .
In this shallow , locked segment of the fault , it usually takes years or even centuries to amass the stress required to set off a major shock .
Rogers and Dragert suggest , however , that silent slip may dramatically hasten this stress buildup , thereby increasing the risk of a regular earthquake in the weeks and months after a silent one .
Silent earthquakes are forcing scientists to rethink seismic forecasts in other parts of the world as well .
Regions of Japan near several so - called seismic gaps — areas where fewer than expected regular earthquakes occur in an otherwise seismically active region — are thought to be overdue for a destructive shock .
But if silent slip has been relieving stress along these faults without scientists realizing it , then the degree of danger may actually be less than they think .
Likewise , if silent slip is discovered along faults that were considered inactive up to now , these structures will need careful evaluation to determine whether they are also capable of destructive earthquakes .
If future study reveals silent earthquakes to be a common feature of most large faults , then scientists will be forced to revisit long - held doctrines about all earthquakes .
The observation of many different speeds of fault slip poses a real challenge to theorists trying to explain the faulting process with fundamental physical laws , for example .
It is now believed that the number and sizes of observed earthquakes can be explained with a fairly simple friction law .
But can this law also account for silent earthquakes ?
So far no definitive answer has been found , but research continues .
Silent earthquakes are only just beginning to enter the public lexicon .
These subtle events portend an exponential increase in our understanding of the how and why of fault slip .
The importance of deciphering fault slip is difficult to overstate because when faults slip quickly , they can cause immense damage , sometimes at a great distance from the source .
The existence of silent earthquakes gives scientists a completely new angle on the slip process by permitting the detailed study of fault zones through every stage of their movement .
Huckabee , Others Yucks It Up Over McCain Vetting
In charity fundraiser , pols join pundits , journalists with standup routines .
Sept. 11 , 2008  --
" Does anybody know what the difference between a bulldog and a hockey mom is ? "
Bob Barr , former Republican member of Congress and now the Libertarian presidential candidate , asks .
" The bulldog gets vetted ! "
Barr 's joke elicits a roar of laughs and a couple of " oh's ! " among the audience at the 15th Annual Funniest Celebrity in Washington Contest .
The annual fundraiser is an opportunity for pols , pundits and journos to challenge Washington 's reputation as a stiff , self - serious town -- and also a good measure of what topics in the political zeitgeist are particularly ripe for ridicule at the moment .
This year , John McCain 's vetting process in his hunt for a vice presidential candidate was a repeated theme .
When Mike Huckabee , former Governor of Arkansas and Republican primary contender , took over the microphone , he joked that he was hurt by McCain 's decision not to ask him to join the GOP ticket .
" John McCain did n't even vet me , " Huckabee said .
" But he did n't vet Sara Palin either . "
Huckabee also poked fun at his onetime Republican primary rival , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
" Mitt has more positions than an underaged Chinese gymnast , " Huckabee said .
At the end of the night , Huckabee was the winner of the funniest celebrity in Washington prize .
But the producer of the event , Richard Siegel , says the aim of the evening is not the competition , but simply to bring people from all political sides together in a lighter setting .
The evening also is a charity fundraiser , this year benefitting VSA Arts , a nonprofit organization that helps people with disabilities learn and participate through artistic expression .
" Oftentimes they have to be serious , they do n't have the opportunity to be funny , " said Siegel .
" This gives them a chance to lighten up and give a humorous message . "
For a lot of the politicians and journalists , telling jokes is far from a typical part of their daily work .
Riz Khan , a news correspondent for Al - Jazeera , said he used his stand - up routine at this event to poke fun at some serious issues , like " how difficult it is for a brown man with a Muslim name to go through security . "
Khan joked about even former Secretary of State Colin Powell being " randomly selected " when he goes through security checks at airports these days .
On stage , Khan asked the crowd , " So , who put me on the billing as explosively funny ? ! "
A Sartell family is asking for the public ’s help in locating a dog that bit a 9 - year - old girl in the parking lot of Como Park Zoo on Sunday .
Finding the dog — and getting its shot records — would help doctors determine if the girl , Alyssa Knutson , needs painful rabies vaccinations .
Alyssa and some friends were leaving the Zoo around 5 p.m. Sunday after celebrating a birthday .
The girls were in costume .
Alyssa was dressed as a cat .
In the parking lot , the group noticed a family with a small dog and asked to pet it .
After getting permission , the first girl petted the dog without incident .
When Alyssa petted the dog , it nipped at her , leaving a single puncture wound on her left hand , her father , Pete Knutson , said .
The dog ’s owner told the adults in the group that the dog ’s shots were up to date , but they did n’t exchange phone numbers .
“ The owner was real nice about it .
But [ they ] just did n’t get contact information , ” Pete Knutson said .
The dog ’s owner is described as white , in his mid-30s , clean - shaven , with a medium build and brown hair .
The man , his wife and a child in a stroller left the parking lot in a blue - gray minivan .
The dog is described as black and brown in color , very small , with short hair and pointy ears , possibly a Chihuahua or a Toy Pinscher .
Alyssa is “ doing fine , ” her father said .
She is now on antibiotics .
“ She ’s an animal lover , ” Pete Knutson said .
“ We have two dogs at home . ”
The family has 10 days to find the owner of the dog and get a copy of the dog ’s shot records .
If the dog ca n’t be found , Alyssa will begin the first in a series of rabies vaccinations on Oct.
1 .
Anyone with information is asked to call 1-320-267-1598 .

Differences in vision could give rise to new species .

Inke van der Sluijs
What fish see — at least in one African lake — could be the driving force that causes them to evolve into new species .
Evolutionary science typically holds that new species are born when populations become isolated from one another , forcing them to adapt differently .
The new work is the strongest evidence yet that differences in sensory input — in this case , vision — can give rise to new species .
Biologists led by Ole Seehausen , from the University of Bern in Switzerland , studied cichlid fish in Lake Victoria in east Africa1 .
The lake contains more than 500 species of cichlids , whose extraordinary diversity provides a crucible for evolution studies .
But , says Seehausen , " the mechanism for how you could have that many species in one lake is not clear " .
Red fish , blue fish
His group thought that vision might be part of the reason .
Water clarity and ambient light vary considerably throughout the lake , and fish of many species range in colour .
In shallow parts , blue light is dominant , and the waters are populated by blue males of the species Pundamilia pundamilia .
As the water deepens , red light becomes increasingly dominant , and greater numbers of red-coloured males of the species Pundamilia nyererei are seen .

Ole Seehausen
Previous studies have shown that natural selection acts on vision to tune eyes to their environment so that individuals can see best what they eat , what eats them and which other members of their own species are around .
And the researchers had earlier identified variants in one of the genes responsible for tuning the fish 's vision to different colours2 .
In the new study , they found that some of the variants are more sensitive towards red light ; fish with these gene variants lived deeper in the lake .
The other variants are more sensitive to blue light ; fish with these variants lived in shallower water .
" We found a strong association between the visual gene and fish colour , " says Seehausen .
" Red fish have the gene that shifts vision towards picking up red light , and the blue fish have visual genes that pick up blue light . "
Boy fish , girl fish
The group also found that some females with blue - biased vision prefer to mate with blue males , and red - biased females mate with red males — suggesting how the vision differences could lead to changes in mate choice and , ultimately , to the birth of a new species .
" It is a really nice paper and has an impressive use of data , " says Jenny Boughman , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
" They show a clear segregation between what the fish see , their colour and where they live . "
But she says more work is needed , such as evidence that shows it is the difference in female vision that causes them to pick the differently coloured males .
Only that , she argues , would prove that vision is driving the speciation .
Up , and to the office , where very busy all the morning .
While I was busy at the Office , my wife sends for me to come home , and what was it but to see the pretty girl which she is taking to wait upon her : and though she seems not altogether so great a beauty as she had before told me , yet indeed she is mighty pretty ; and so pretty , that I find I shall be too much pleased with it , and therefore could be contented as to my judgement , though not to my passion , that she might not come , lest I may be found too much minding her , to the discontent of my wife .
She is to come next week .
She seems , by her discourse , to be grave beyond her bigness and age , and exceeding well bred as to her deportment , having been a scholar in a school at Bow these seven or eight years .
To the office again , my head running on this pretty girl , and there till noon , when Creed and Sheres come and dined with me ; and we had a great deal of pretty discourse of the ceremoniousness of the Spaniards , whose ceremonies are so many and so known , that , Sheres tells me , upon all occasions of joy or sorrow in a Grandee ’s family , my Lord Embassador is fain to send one with an ‘ en hora buena ’ , if it be upon a marriage , or birth of a child , or a ‘ pesa me ’ , if it be upon the death of a child , or so .
And these ceremonies are so set , and the words of the compliment , that he hath been sent from my Lord , when he hath done no more than send in word to the Grandee that one was there from the Embassador ; and he knowing what was his errand , that hath been enough , and he never spoken with him : nay , several Grandees having been to marry a daughter , have wrote letters to my Lord to give him notice , and out of the greatness of his wisdom to desire his advice , though people he never saw ; and then my Lord he answers by commending the greatness of his discretion in making so good an alliance , &c. , and so ends .
He says that it is so far from dishonour to a man to give private revenge for an affront , that the contrary is a disgrace ; they holding that he that receives an affront is not fit to appear in the sight of the world till he hath revenged himself ; and therefore , that a gentleman there that receives an affront oftentimes never appears again in the world till he hath , by some private way or other , revenged himself : and that , on this account , several have followed their enemies privately to the Indys , thence to Italy , thence to France and back again , watching for an opportunity to be revenged .
He says my Lord was fain to keep a letter from the Duke of York to the Queen of Spain a great while in his hands , before he could think fit to deliver it , till he had learnt whether the Queen would receive it , it being directed to his cozen .
He says that many ladies in Spain , after they are found to be with child , do never stir out of their beds or chambers till they are brought to bed : so ceremonious they are in that point also .
He tells me of their wooing by serenades at the window , and that their friends do always make the match ; but yet that they have opportunities to meet at masse at church , and there they make love : that the Court there hath no dancing , nor visits at night to see the King or Queen , but is always just like a cloyster , nobody stirring in it : that my Lord Sandwich wears a beard now , turned up in the Spanish manner .
But that which pleases me most indeed is , that the peace which he hath made with Spain is now printed here , and is acknowledged by all the merchants to be the best peace that ever England had with them : and it appears that the King thinks it so , for this is printed before the ratification is gone over ; whereas that with France and Holland was not in a good while after , till copys come over of it in English out of Holland and France , that it was a reproach not to have it printed here .
This I am mighty glad of ; and is the first and only piece of good news , or thing fit to be owned , that this nation hath done several years .
After dinner I to the office , and they gone , anon comes Pelling , and he and I to Gray ’s Inne Fields , thinking to have heard Mrs. Knight sing at her lodgings , by a friend ’s means of his ; but we come too late ; so must try another time .
So lost our labour , and I by coach home , and there to my chamber , and did a great deal of good business about my Tangier accounts , and so with pleasure discoursing with my wife of our journey shortly to Brampton , and of this little girle , which indeed runs in my head , and pleases me mightily , though I dare not own it , and so to supper and to bed .
Oct. 7 , 2008  --
The prosecution of an Oregon couple who allegedly tried to heal their dying son with prayer has focused attention on laws that , in some cases , allow parents to treat their children with faith .
Jeffrey Dean Beagley , 50 , and Marci Rae Beagley , 46 , pleaded not guilty on Friday to criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of their son , 16 - year - old Neil Jeffrey Beagley .
Neil died June 17 from complications of a urinary tract blockage , according to medical examiners .
The condition , which doctors say is easily treatable , caused kidney and heart failure .
The Beagleys belong to a religious sect known as the Followers of Christ Church , which rejects medical treatment and , instead , relies on prayer .
Several relatives who were with Neil Beagley at the time of his death told police that he had refused medical care , according to the Gladstone , Ore. , police .
Marci Beagley declined to comment when reached at her Oregon City home , Monday .
Attorneys for the Beagleys could not be reached for comment .
The district attorney handling the case declined to comment .
The Beagleys are among a handful of parents around the country , including their daughter and son - in - law , who are currently facing criminal charges related to spiritual healing .
Their case has focused attention on some laws that let parents rely on prayer to heal their children .
Marci Hamilton , a professor at Cardozo Law School , who writes about religious issues , said the case may test Oregon 's religious freedom laws and may prompt other states to re-examine their spiritual healing laws .
" There was a time when we were willing to permit these children to be lost , but there are increasingly more prosecutions and lawsuits , " she said .
" Children should not be permitted to be the testing ground for their parents ' faith or secular views if it 's going to result in their death . "
More than 40 states make some religious exception in child abuse laws for parents who practice spiritual healing , though the laws vary widely in scope , according to Children 's Healthcare is a Legal Duty , a nonprofit that opposes such laws .
Criminal defendants have argued that those exceptions to child abuse laws for spiritual healing should prevent the state from throwing parents in prison when a child dies from lack of medical care .
Dale and Leilani Neumann , a Wisconsin couple whose 11 - year - old daughter died from complications of untreated diabetes , argued in recent court papers that reckless homicide charges should be dismissed because they conflict with state laws on child abuse , which allow treatment through prayer .
State supreme courts that have considered the issue have reached differing conclusions .
At least one court , in Minnesota , has ruled that manslaughter charges for the death of a child whose meningitis went untreated , needed to be dismissed because the child 's parents relied on state child abuse laws that allowed spiritual healing .
Eighteen states have religious defenses to at least some felony crimes against children , according to Children 's Healthcare is a Legal Duty .
Some states , such as Iowa and Ohio , provide a defense to manslaughter and child endangerment for faith healing .
Arkansas makes spiritual healing a defense to capital murder charges .
Stephen Lyons , a Boston lawyer who has defended parents who practice faith healing , said , whether parents are prosecuted should depend on the circumstances of each individual case .
" The case comes down to what did parents know and when did they know it , " he said .
" Parents who lose a child due to illness which they do n't recongize as being serious , who do n't practice spiritual healing , are rarely , if ever , prosecuted .
The problem is that parents who honestly say they engaged in sprirtual healing are never given the benefit of the doubt . "
About 10 percent of people surveyed in 2004 said they participated in a prayer group for their own health , according to the National Center for Health Statistics , though a much smaller number rely on prayer exclusively .
A 1998 study in the journal Pediatrics found that 172 children died without receiving medical care because of religious reasons from 1975 to 1995 .
Of those , 140 children had a greater than 90 percent chance of survival if they had been treated , according to the study , conducted by Rita Swan , director of Children 's Healthcare is a Legal Duty , and Dr. Seth Asser , formerly of the pediatrics department at the Univesrsity of California , San Diego .
Asser said his research shows that more than 60 children whose parents are members of the Followers of Christ Church died between 1955 and 1998 , which he said was roughly four times the Oregon state average .
Neil Beagley 's niece , 15 - month - old Ava Worthington , died in March from an infection after her parents treated her with prayer .
Her parents face trial in January on second degree manslaughter and neglect charges .
Oregon law offers some religious defense protections for parents who try to heal their children with prayer .
In the mid-1990s , legislators created religious belief defenses to homicide and manslaughter .
The exceptions to manslaughter and criminal mistreatment charges were eliminated in 1999 , after a series of widely reported deaths involving the Followers of Christ .
Bill Melendez , considered a pioneer in animation and best known for bringing the “ Peanuts ” characters to life , died early Tuesday morning September 2nd at St. John ’s hospital in Santa Monica .
Doctors say Melendez died “ peacefully . ”
He was 91 years old preparing to celebrate his 92nd birthday in November .
With his trade mark handle bar mustache , Melendez was a phenomenal talent whose unique style and distinct sense of humor inspired a generation .
Melendez began his career at Walt Disney Studios .
As a talented young animator he worked on Pinocchio , Fantasia , Bambi , Dumbo and classic “ Mickey Mouse ” and “ Donald Duck ” cartoons .
Years later , Melendez expanded his resume when he moved to Warner Bros. to animate other famous cartoons such as “ Bugs Bunny , ” “ Daffy Duck ” and “ Porky Pig . ”
In 1948 Melendez left Warner Bros . and over the next decade and a half he served as a director and producer on more than 1,000 commercials and films for United Productions of America ( UPA ) , Playhouse Pictures and John Sutherland Productions .
It was at UPA that Melendez started doing work for New York - based J. Walter Thompson ad agency , whose clients included Ford Motor Co .
The car maker expressed interest in using “ Peanuts ” characters to sell its cars on television .
In 1959 Melendez prepared his animation work and showed it to “ Peanuts ” creator Charles M. Schulz .
A partnership and friendship followed and as a result , Melendez gave the “ Peanuts ” kids life in more than 63 half - hour specials , five one - hour specials , four feature films and more than 372 commercials .
Favorites include “ A Charlie Brown Christmas , ” “ A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving , ” “ She ’s a Good Skate Charlie Brown , ” and “ You ’re a Good Sport Charlie Brown . ”
In addition to creating the cartoons , Melendez also provided the voices for Snoopy and Woodstock .
Over the years , Melendez also animated “ Garfield on the Town , ” “ Cathy , ” “ Babar Comes to America , ” and “ the Lion , The Witch , & The Wardrobe , ” among others .
Melendez , who was the only animator allowed to work with the “ Peanuts ” characters , won numerous awards and accolades including : 17 Emmy Award nominations and eight Emmy ® Award wins , one Oscar® Award nomination , two Peabody Awards , one Clio , three National Cartoonist Society Awards , and more than 150 Advertising Awards .
Under the leadership of his son and other trusted executives , Bill Melendez Productions , Inc. , its sister studio Melendez Films in London and Sopwith Productions ( Melendezs art distribution unit ) will continue to animate , direct and produce features and commercials .
Born Jose Cuautemoc in 1916 in Sonora , Mexico , his family moved to Arizona in 1928 and then to Los Angeles in the early 1930s .
Melendez trained at the Chouinard Art Studio ( now CalArts ) and is a former faculty member of the Cinema Arts Department at USC .
Melendez is survived by his wife of 68 years Helen , two sons Steven Melendez and ( Ret. ) Navy Rear Admiral Rodrigo Melendez , six grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren .
A memorial service will take place for family only .
Donations can be made in Bill Melendezs name to Children ’s Hospital Los Angeles .

Indian chefs welcome , not IT pros : UK panel
Prasun Sonwalkar in London | September 09 , 2008 18:23 IST
Indian chefs will be allowed to work in Britain 's multi-million pound Indian restaurant industry , but Indian IT workers are no longer required in the UK , a key government committee on immigration said on Tuesday .
The Migration Advisory Committee of the the Home Office revised its list of occupations and skills that are in short supply in the UK , which enables employers to recruit skilled workers from India and other countries outside the European Union .
The revised list includes skilled chefs , secondary school teachers of maths and sciences , consultants and senior specialist nurses , some engineering occupations , including civil and chemical engineers .
The recommendations made by the committee are usually accepted by the government .
People from the Indian restaurant industry recently took to the streets in London and Glasgow to protest against new immigration measures that prevented them from recruiting chefs from the Indian sub - continent .
Several representations were also made to the government by MPs and association of restaurant owners .
The MAC report published includes ' skilled chefs ' as one of the shortage occupations , meeting the main demand of the industry .
However , it will not be easy for Indian IT workers to find job in Britain due to the surplus in the employment market in the country and the EU .
Non-EU workers will only be allowed to work in the shortage occupations listed by the MAC .
As we saw yesterday , John McCain ’s latest gambit is to juice up his and Palin ’s crowds into calling Obama a “ terrorist “ , hurling racial epithets at black reporters ( presumably , there are n’t many in attendance as supporters ) , or just random calls for murder .
This morning there was more …
In the latest instance of inflammatory outbursts at McCain - Palin rallies , a crowd member screamed “ treason ! ” during an event on Tuesday after Sarah Palin accused Barack Obama of criticizing U.S. troops .
“ [ Obama ] said , too , that our troops in Afghanistan are ‘ air raiding villages and killing civilians , ' ” Palin said , mischaracterizing a 2007 remark by Obama .
“ I hope Americans know that is not what our brave men and women in uniform are doing in Afghanistan .
The U.S. military is fighting terrorism and protecting us and protecting our freedom . ”
Shortly afterward , a male member of the crowd in Jacksonville , Florida , yelled “ treason ! ” loudly enough to be picked up by television microphones .
For the first eight months of 2020 , China imported a total of 515,000 vehicles ( including chassis ) , posting a year - on - year decrease of 26.6 % , and saw the year - to - date import value of automobiles reach 172.42 billion yuan ( $ 25.311 billion ) .
Mayo Clinic endocrinologist James Levine , M.D. , Ph.D. , has laid out some environment - changing innovations with a six - month study of a real - life office that was re-engineered to increase daily physical activity , a program called NEAT ( non-exercise activity thermogenesis ) .
The study began in late 2007 and ended in 2008 at SALO , LLC , a Minneapolis - based financial staffing firm .
Of the 45 employee volunteers involved in the scientific study , 18 were studied for weight loss and other changes .
Results :
* The 18 individuals lost a total of 156 pounds , 143 of that in body fat .
* Individuals lost an average of 8.8 pounds -- 90 percent of that was fat .
Triglycerides decreased by an average of 37 percent .
* The nine participants who had expressed a desire to lose weight lost an average of 15.4 pounds .
Re-engineering included :
* Removing chairs and traditional desk seating
* Introducing walking tracks
* Educating and encouraging staff to conduct walking meetings
* Replacing traditional phones with mobile sets
* Adding desks attached to treadmills
* Introducing games in the workplace
* Providing high - tech activity monitors
* Advising staff about nutrition
Another key finding , says Levine , was that no productivity was lost due to the new environment .
Company officials said revenue rose nearly 10 percent during the first three months of the study , and the company recorded its highest - ever monthly revenue in January 2008 -- the study ’s midpoint .
His conclusion :
This “ office of the future ” is a functional environment that can also enhance weight loss and maintain health .
Responding to a question from a girl who wants to know why her her father , a doctor , pays a higher tax rate than people who earn less :
McCain : " I think it 's to some degree because we feel , obviously , that wealthy people can afford more . "
Doctor 's daughter :
Are n't we getting closer and closer to , like , socialism and stuff ?
McCain : " Here 's what I really believe .
When you are , reach a certain level of comfort , there is nothing wrong with paying somewhat more . "
No Team Fortress 2 Updates Until Next Year
" Well , it wo n't be this year , " said Lombardi when asked about the next update .
" But we 're going to keep evolving TF2 .
Once Left 4
Dead wraps , you 'll hear us clamoring more about [ the next TF2 update ] . "
Lombardi made the statement after speaking on the impending release of Left 4 Dead ( PC , 360 ) , which saw contributions from numerous Team Fortress 2 team members as development of the cooperative zombie - killing shooter entered the final stages .
Since TF2's arrival last year , Valve has provided numerous free updates to owners of the PC version , adding new modes and maps along with class - specific achievements and unlockables for the Medic , Pyro and Heavy classes .
The studio has pledged that all of the title 's nine classes will eventually be updated with new weaponry .
The marketing VP also reiterated that bringing the existing Team Fortress 2 updates to Xbox 360 is " definitely in the plan , " though no timeline was offered as to its release .
Senate Projections
The table below shows the results of our prediction algorithm for the Senate Elections in November .
The method by which a projection is determined is complicated , using local regression , but its all explained if you 're really curious .
The algorithm outputs a projected result for each candidate ; the candidate with the highest projected percentage is declared and the associated party is credited with a Senator .
The races in Arkansas , Wyoming - A and Wyoming - B are devoid of non-partisan polling , thus making a projection impossible ; in these situations the previous Senate election results are used in place of a projection .
The polls used in the calculations can be viewed on our polls and graphs page .

What a McCain Victory Would Mean
POLITICAL COMMENTARY : What a McCain Victory Would Mean by Robert Parry
In judging the shape of a future John McCain presidency , there are already plenty of dots that are easy to connect .
They reveal an image of a war - like Empire so full of hubris that it could take the world into a cascade of crises , while extinguishing what is left of the noble American Republic .
McCain has made clear he would continue and even escalate George W. Bush ’s open - ended global war on Islamic radicals .
McCain buys into the neoconservative vision of expending U.S. treasure and troops to kill as many Muslim militants as possible .
McCain ’s tough talk – for instance , his joking about “ bomb , bomb Iran ” and his vow to pursue Osama bin Laden “ to the gates of hell ” – is indistinguishable from Bush ’s “ bring ‘ em on , ” “ smoke ‘em out , ” “ dead or alive ” rhetoric .
Beyond the words , McCain ’s global war strategy is as hawkish , if not more so , than Bush ’s .
In late 2001 and early 2002 , McCain took the lead in pushing the neocon plan of a rapid pivot from the invasion of Afghanistan toward the prospective invasion of Iraq .
Even before the Taliban had been thoroughly defeated – and as the Bush administration was failing to chase bin Laden to the gates of Tora Bora or to the gates of northwest Pakistan – McCain was advocating a diversion of U.S. intelligence and military assets toward Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein , who had nothing to do with 9/11 .
That premature pivot from Afghanistan to Iraq may go down as one of the worst national security blunders in the history of the United States .
It has bogged the U.S. military down in two indefinite wars while fueling anti-Americanism around the world and especially among the billion - plus Muslims .
Yet , McCain and his neocon allies have never acknowledged this serious error of judgment , nor has the mainstream U.S. news media demanded that McCain accept responsibility for this catastrophic mistake .
McCain instead gets away with boasting about the supposed success of the recent U.S. troop “ surge ” in Iraq .
( Meanwhile , Big Media stars – many of whom backed the Iraq invasion in 2003 – hammer Barack Obama for refusing to accept the conventional wisdom about the “ successful surge , ” as Obama tries to offer a more nuanced analysis . )
So , as the U.S. press corps again gives cover to the Iraq War , the larger failure of U.S. policy goes substantially unaddressed .
Not only did the McCain / Bush / neocon strategy allow bin Laden and other al - Qaeda leaders to survive and reestablish themselves along the Pakistani - Afghan border , the policy let the Taliban exploit instability in Afghanistan to rebuild its forces and begin going on the offensive against hard - pressed U.S. and NATO troops .
Potentially even worse , the Bush - McCain - neocon neglect of Aghanistan has contributed to worsening instability in nuclear - armed Pakistan , where the Taliban and al - Qaeda are expanding safe havens and increasing influence .
In other words , while Bush and McCain rushed off to war against Iraq over the distant possibility that Iraq might some day have the capacity to build a nuclear bomb , they allowed disorder to spread in Pakistan , a country that already possesses nuclear weapons .
Future Draft ?
Another casualty of McCain ’s endless Middle East wars , which soon could include Iran , would almost surely be America ’s volunteer army .
Though McCain officially opposes a restoration of the draft , it is nearly impossible to envision how his multiple wars could be waged without one .
And McCain also had made clear that he favors a neo -Cold War confrontation with Moscow over another part of the neocon agenda – the encircling of Russia with pro-U.S. regimes and the placement of strategic missile systems near Russia ’s borders .
The fencing in of Russia fits with the goals of the neocon Project for the New American Century that envisions an endless era of U.S. military dominance that tolerates no potential rivals , whether an emerging China or a resurgent Russia .
The recent Russian - Georgian conflict underscores the risks from this neocon concept .
Containing Russia in this way ultimately would require dangerous brinkmanship .
And the McCain / neocon belligerence – like McCain ’s melodramatic declaration “ we are all Georgians ” – would guarantee that one of these swaggering showdowns eventually would push the world to the brink of a nuclear confrontation .
From the perspective of U.S. taxpayers , the neocon strategy of permanent global dominance means funding the military - industrial complex at levels never before seen , especially when one factors in the simultaneous costs of the “ war on terror , ” the Iraq War , the Afghan War and a possible Iran War .
The combined price tag for McCain ’s military adventures , at a time when the federal government is already running about half a trillion dollars in debt , would mean that virtually every other national priority would have to be short - changed or neglected .
There will be little money left to address the energy crisis , global warming , retooling the auto industry , health care , Social Security , education , infrastructure repairs , etc. , etc. Plus , as the United States solidifies itself under President McCain as a militaristic Empire , the remnants of the old Republic would inevitably be swept away .
Already , McCain has vowed to appoint more U.S. Supreme Court justices in the style of Samuel Alito and John Roberts , open advocates of an imperial presidency .
Currently , the Supreme Court has a slim 5 - 4 majority in favor of maintaining some limits on the President ’s power .
But one more vacancy from the moderate majority – to be filled by President McCain – would mean that a right - wing Supreme Court would begin reinterpreting the U.S. Constitution to grant the President unlimited powers in wartime .
And since wartime would never end , the Founders ’ vision of a Republic – with “ checks and balances ” and all people possessing “ unalienable rights ” – would be negated by an all - powerful President who could do whatever he wished to anyone who got in the way .
In many ways , a McCain presidency would represent the logical culmination of America ’s failure to heed President Dwight Eisenhower ’s parting warning about the growing power of “ the military - industrial complex . ”
The American people also would show that they had turned their back on another warning from another aging leader , Benjamin Franklin , who cautioned at the end of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 that the Founders had created a Republic , “ if you can keep it . ”

Why Are Hedge Funds Not Blowing Up All Over the Place ?
There are many things I do not understand about the financial crisis , but the one thing that currently puzzles me the most is how there have not been dozens of huge hedge - fund failures over the last few months .
I am sure there are plenty of hedge funds that are long mortgage - backed securities .
Moreover , hedge funds are often highly leveraged .
Even if a hedge fund was just fully invested in equities — not mortgage - backed securities , but leveraged five times — it might have lost everything .
On top of this , the money in many hedge funds is “ hot money . ”
In other words , if things start to go south at a particular hedge fund , many investors pull their money out as quickly as they can .
This compounds the hedge fund ’s problems , because it means it needs to liquidate positions to pay out the investors who withdraw their money .
I suspect there are two reasons why we have not yet seen massive hedge - fund failures .
The first is that most hedge funds have “ lock up ” periods , so that investors can only get their money out with a lag of a few months or maybe up to a year .
My guess is that many hedge funds are facing huge redemptions ; they just have n’t reached the end of lock - up periods yet so they have n’t had to pay out .
A lot of lock - ups are probably timed quarterly , which means the next chance out is at the end of the calendar year .
The second reason that hedge funds might not yet be blowing up is that they are nearly unregulated , so they do n’t face “ mark to market ” rules or required capital ratios .
So these hedge funds could be in terrible shape , but might be able to hide that fact — at least until the redemptions hit .
My prediction : the next few months will see a string of huge hedge - fund failures , which will lead hedge - fund investors to pull their cash out of hedge funds en masse , triggering further hedge - fund blow ups .
I would not want to be holding the same assets that these hedge funds are holding , because they may have to liquidate at fire - sale prices .
[ Addendum from Dubner : Levitt is such a smart guy that he does n’t even have to read the newspaper .
If he did , he ’d have seen today ’s front - page article in The Times about how hedge funds are blowing up all over the place , or at least will be soon . ]
Got a problem ?
Blame oil .
If you ’re searching for a defining theme to 2008 this holiday weekend -- perhaps while filling up at the pump -- look no further than the soaring price of oil .
Every day , the impact of high oil prices pervades the news , and that news is usually bad .
Oil , with no small measure of justification , is the all - purpose fall guy of the moment .
There ...
Amid all the fallout from the financial turmoil , one group has yet to feel the accusing finger of blame : the analysts who built the computer software that drove the derivatives markets that , in turn , drove the financial collapse .
Since the Big Bang of the 1980s , large amounts of stocks and shares - and derivatives of them - have been traded automatically by computers rather than by humans .
These so - called " algotrades " accounted for as much as 40 % of all trades on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 ; on some American equity markets the figure can be as high as 80 % .
The people who write the algorithms that drive the software are called quantitative analysts , often referred to simply as " quants " .
They are generally physics and mathematics graduates working in risk management - calculating whether a given deal is a good idea - and derivatives pricing , which entails putting a figure on trades that in effect bet on other trades .
It 's enormously complex , which is why only the quants could understand it - if , that is , they did .
History now suggests they did n't .
The rise of the quants has mirrored the automation of the financial markets ; and as many of the newer markets , such as swaps ( a sort of insurance ) and derivatives , have been unregulated , the quants who have been responsible for developing the hugely complicated systems that in the end brought many of the western world 's banks to their knees .
As Richard Dooling wrote in the New York Times : " Somehow the genius quants - the best and brightest geeks Wall Street firms could buy - fed $ 1 trillion in subprime mortgage debt into their supercomputers , added some derivatives , massaged the arrangements with computer algorithms and - poof !
- created $ 62 trillion in imaginary wealth . "
Those algorithms were based on risk assessments that were seriously flawed , based only on the risk to the market at that moment , rather on cold , hard empirical data about a person 's ability to pay and what would happen if a lot , rather than a few of them , stopped .
As George Dyson ( son of the quantum physicist Freeman ) wrote in Edge last week : " The problem starts , as the current crisis demonstrates , when unregulated replication is applied to money itself .
Highly complex computer - generated financial instruments ( known as derivatives ) are being produced , not from natural factors of production or other goods , but purely from other financial instruments . "
What is also becoming clear is that the financial markets are far more automated than ever before .
There is a growing sense that much of this was made by machines , with the quants feeding the beast ever more intricate lines of code .
Dooling has a growing conviction that we are now at the mercy of a financial system based on " arrangements so complex only machines can make " .
It seems we are at the mercy of the machine .
· This article was amended on Monday October 20 2008 .
People who write algorithms for software that enables stocks and shares to be traded automatically are called quantitative analysts , not quantities analysts .
This has been corrected .
If you 've been following financial events over the last 12 months then you would have witnessed one failed financial instrument after another .
Cause and effect .
You cannot write out $ 850 billion banker - bail - out cheques without certain consequences ... we can postpone the inevitable but we can’t avoid the financial reckoning that awaits us .
The markets have come to the sobering realization that the Bush administration 's $ 850 billion rescue plan wo n't work quickly to unfreeze the credit markets , and that many banks are still having difficulty gaining access to cash .
That 's caused investors to exit stocks and move money into the relative short - term safety of government debt .
But if you had a bird ’s eye view of events since 2000 , then you will have seen a lot more than that - you will have witnessed the devaluation of the US Dollar by nearly 70 % .
During this period , the Federal Reserve Bank repeatedly printed large sums of money and pumped it into the system , further devaluing our nation 's Fiat currency beyond recognition .
Foreign dollar reserves disappearing as these devalued dollars get dumped on to the international money markets .
The ‘ Bail Out Bill ’ is not the last bail out , but it does mark a point in US history .
It essentially signals the takeover of the US by private bankers .
Congress has essentially handed over $ 850 billion in unmarked bills to the very cartel who engineered the financial crisis in the first place .
This so called rescue package was sold to the American public as a “ plan to save us ” , yet it is us the people , whose taxes have been used to run this entire façade , who will be left with nothing but an over - inflated money supply and the increasing spectre of stagflation .
So do not be surprised in about two years time , when the Central Bankers will rear their heads and say " hey , here 's a new currency .
This will solve all of our economic problems " .
The Amero : North American Common Currency ?
You can say it 's a myth , but that wo n't make it disappear .
Before it was introduced , was the EURO a " myth " too ?
We 're half way there ... like the great bail out , Americans will be manipulated to accept even more , increasingly extreme solutions to successive fiscal panic events .
America could soon gain painful first experience - the same pain it has often induced in countries like Argentina , Mexico , Germany and Brazil ... hyper-inflation .
As a part of a ' relief package ' , the “ Amero ” - the ultimate financial instrument , will be presented as a pre-packaged panacea or ' rescue ' by our saviours - the bankers .
If you 've been following the developments regarding NAFTA ( North American Free Trade Agreement ) then you would already know something about the possible nature of this new currency - i t's real and is seen by advocates as a natural extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America and it will likely be a done deal by the time it reaches the public announcement stage which means that American would have to literally accept it at face value .
The brilliant idea for a " North American Currency Union " was first proposed in 1999 by Canadian economist Herbert G. Grubel .
A senior fellow of the eminent conservative think - tank , the Fraser Institute , he published a book titled The Case for the Amero , the same year that the EURO came into circulation .
Another Canadian think - tank , the C.D. Howe Institute , advocates the creation of a shared currency between Canada and the USA .
Canada might stand to benefit - and so it has its fans up north .
But the Central Banks will be creating it and lending it out , so you can bet that their plans are being drawn as we speak .
Of course , Americans might very well be the last to know ( surprise ) and could be hurt the most ( in more ways than one ) .
We are the fat cow in this scenario .
As the US dollar continues to fail and continues to collapse in the face of massive infusion of liquidity , more talk will begin to appear about a possible North American common currency , the Amero , as a solution .
The US and Canadian dollars , along with the Mexican Peso , will be phased out and replaced by a common North American currency , which , of course , would eliminate the U.S. Constitution in the process .
This may postpone , but not stop the eventual collapse of the dollar and the worlds consumer society .
The dollar which will become basically worthless after the exchange for the Amero and will have little international value , and thus not be transferable to Swiss Francs , Pound Sterling or to the Euro .
And thanks to the garbage legislation like the Bail Out Bill and the US Patriot Acts , which included currency controls and banking and secrecy laws aimed at non existent terrorists , few Americans will be able escape the effects by opening up accounts offshore denominated in Swiss Francs or Euros before the announcement of the Amero .
But the core problem with our money begins and ends with our own , privately owned banking cartel known as the US Federal Reserve Bank .
If you understand who owns the Fed , you will know that US dollars are essentially printed by the same private banking institutions who print the Euro .
The Amero is about expanding this bank ’s operation out to Mexico and Canada , essentially allowing the European Central Banks ( and their US Federal Reserve " franchise " ) to gain complete control over the entire money supply of North America .
The Amero will simply bring us one step closer to a global currency ... and one step closer to a global government .
To a naïve globalist cheerleader , the Amero may seem like a good idea , but it will be a historic disaster for the people of the United States .
As we 've seen recently , foreign interests will continue to scoop up both state and private assets , all at rock bottom prices .
NAFTA advocates our borders becoming open with the last manufacturing jobs eventually leave the United States .
Millions of remaining jobs will scatter with the four winds .
Also realize that a Police Super - State / Tax Collection grid can easily be activated to enforce a number of new laws and collect new global taxes ( carbon taxes being one form ) .

When I saw this website , I laughed .
I could n't help it ; it 's a funny idea .
That webcam site is a joke .
It 's not real , it 's a satire on people who think the LHC would cause the end of the world .
I laughed when I saw it .
But I 'm not laughing now .
In India the other day , a young girl , distraught with fear that the world was ending when the LHC turned on , killed herself .
She died , because she did n't understand the truth .
Now that site is less funny , is n't it ?
All over the world , in all different countries , people are raised to believe in superstitious nonsense , and raised to believe with all their hearts that it 's real .
And when we do that , we do far more than remove people from reality .
We leave them vulnerable to all manners of nonsense , from believing in fairies to truly and honestly thinking the LHC will destroy the planet .
People do n't learn how to think critically , and then they drink homeopathic water instead of taking real medicine , they chelate their children , or they deny their children vaccinations .
And when that happens , people die .
Children die .
I 'm a parent .
I sometimes think the most important thing I can do for my daughter is love her , keep her healthy , protect her .
But in all of those , there is an overarching responsibility for me to teach her how to live in the real world .
And that means showing her how to think .
Not what to think , but how .
Question authority .
Be skeptical of claims .
Ask for evidence .
Apply good logic .
Avoid bad logic .
Analyze the results .
Look for bias .
And doubt .
Doubt doubtdoubt .
It 's one of the greatest strengths of the human mind , and perhaps the least used of all .
There is plenty of blame to lay for the death of one young girl .
We can blame the crackpots promulgating the LHC = death garbage .
We can blame the culture she was raised in , where superstition can be treated like natural law -- much like every culture across the planet .
We can blame the media , for choosing to focus on the nonsense instead of the tremendous and wonderful and awe - inspiring inquiry into nature the LHC is performing .
We can blame the schools , the environment , the world itself .
But the blame lies in us .
Too many people choose not to think .
But our technology , our society , our impact is vast , and now , today , in this world , that choice is one we can no longer afford .
Good thing for CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin that last night was the last of the Election ' 08 debates :
They appear to be boring him to tears .
Or at least to idle surfing .
Here he is checking up on Facebook during last night 's face - off :
And here he is checking up on the baseball playoffs on MLB.com during the Oct. 2 Palin / Biden showdown .
Jeffrey , we hear you :
We skipped last night 's event entirely , and had a really nice dinner .

7 . I quite agree that it may be several weeks or even months before I shall ask you to drench Germany with poison gas , and if we do it , let us do it one hundred per cent .
In the meanwhile , I want the matter studied in cold blood by sensible people and not by that particular set of psalm - singing uniformed defeatists which one runs across now here now there .
Pray address yourself to this .
It is a big thing and can only be discarded for a big reason .
I shall of course have to square Uncle Joe and the President ; but you need not bring this into your calculations at the present time .
Just try to find out what it is like on its merits .
6 . If the bombardment of London became a serious nuisance and great rockets with far - reaching and devastating effect fell on many centres of Government and labour , I should be prepared to do [ underline ] anything [ stop underline ] that would hit the enemy in a murderous place .
I may certainly have to ask you to support me in using poison gas .
We could drench the cities of the Ruhr and many other cities in Germany in such a way that most of the population would be requiring constant medical attention .
We could stop all work at the flying bomb starting points .
I do not see why we should have the disadvantages of being the gentleman while they have all the advantages of being the cad .
There are times when this may be so but not now .
5 . Although one sees how unpleasant it is to receive poison gas attacks , from which nearly everyone recovers , it is useless to protest that an equal amount of H. E. will not inflict greater casualties and sufferings on troops and civilians .
One really must not be bound within silly conventions of the mind whether they be those that ruled in the last war or those in reverse which rule in this .
4 . Why have the Germans not used it ?
Not certainly out of moral scruples or affection for us .
They have not used it because it does not pay them .
The greatest temptation ever offered to them was the beaches of Normandy .
This they could have drenched with gas greatly to the hindrance of the troops .
That they thought about it is certain and that they prepared against our use of gas is also certain .
But they only reason they have not used it against us is that they fear the retaliation .
What is to their detriment is to our advantage .
3 . I want a cold - blooded calculation made as to how it would pay us to use poison gas , by which I mean principally mustard .
We will want to gain more ground in Normandy so as not to be cooped up in a small area .
We could probably deliver 20 tons to their 1 and for the sake of the 1 they would bring their bomber aircraft into the area against our superiority , thus paying a heavy toll .
2 . It is absurd to consider morality on this topic when everybody used it in the last war without a word of complaint from the moralists or the Church .
On the other hand , in the last war bombing of open cities was regarded as forbidden .
Now everybody does it as a matter of course .
It is simply a question of fashion changing as she does between long and short skirts for women .
1 . I want you to think very seriously over this question of poison gas .
I would not use it unless it could be shown either that ( a ) it was life or death for us , or ( b ) that it would shorten the war by a year .
Winston S. Churchill : departmental minute ( Churchill papers : 16/16 ) 12 May 1919 War Office
I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas .
We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare .
It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas .
I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes .
The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum .
It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses : gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected .
from Companion Volume 4 , Part 1 of the official biography , WINSTON S. CHURCHILL , by Martin Gilbert ( London : Heinemann , 1976 )
Henry Gonzalez , US Congressman , referred to this in the House of Representatives on March 24 , 1992 :
" But there again , where is the moral right ?
The first one to use gas against Arabs was Winston Churchill , the British , in the early 1920's .
They were Iraq Arabs they used them against . "
http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1992/h920324g.htm
" Moral right " is of course the reason this piece of history has now been dredged up again - by people who see contradictions in the pious arguments of Messrs .
Bush , Blair et al .
And this seems only fair .
In 1998 Clinton denounced opponents to his planned attack on Iraq for " not remembering the past " .
> I remain unconvinced that the UK used chemical weapons > in the middle east in the 1920s .... > but I 'm open to correction .
Not easy .
And if you 'd rather not ...
Churchill thought of it as poison gas - and so , apparently did everyone else .
The idea of using it was his alone .
And he is also is also to have given the authorization to the RAF .
He wanted gas to be used in addition to regular bombing : " against recalcitrant Arabs as experiment " .
According to Simons , gas was not dispensed in bombs .
The intention was to quell a growing rebellion in remote villages .
He met with objections but maintained that " we cannot in any circumstances acquiesce in the non-utilisation of any weapons which are available to procure a speedy termination of the disorder which prevails on the frontier " .
It seems Churchill wanted to cause " disablement " , " discomfort or illness , but not death " .
In any case , to Churchill this was not a moral issue .
Here is part of a memo , so you can see it through his eyes .
He wrote this during WWII , when he contemplated using poison gas , but never did :
Excerpts below by www.informationwar.org
BACKGROUND : In 1917 , following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire , the British occupied Iraq and established a colonial government .
The Arab and Kurdish people of Iraq resisted the British occupation , and by 1920 this had developed into a full scale national revolt , which cost the British dearly .
As the Iraqi resistance gained strength , the British resorted to increasingly repressive measures , including the use of posion gas . ]

* IRAQ : FROM SUMER TO SUDAN *.
London : St. Martins Press , 1994 :
Winston Churchill , as colonial secretary , was sensitive to the cost of policing the Empire ; and was in consequence keen to exploit the potential of modern technology .
This strategy had particular relevance to operations in Iraq .
On 19 February , 1920 , before the start of the Arab uprising , Churchill ( then Secretary for War and Air ) wrote to Sir Hugh Trenchard , the pioneer of air warfare .
Would it be possible for Trenchard to take control of Iraq ?
This would entail * the provision of some kind of asphyxiating bombs calculated to cause disablement of some kind but not death ... for use in preliminary operations against turbulent tribes .*
Churchill was in no doubt that gas could be profitably employed against the Kurds and Iraqis ( as well as against other peoples in the Empire ) : * I do not understand this sqeamishness about the use of gas .
I am strongly in favour of using poison gas against uncivilised tribes . *
Henry Wilson shared Churchills enthusiasm for gas as an instrument of colonial control but the British cabinet was reluctant to sanction the use of a weapon that had caused such misery and revulsion in the First World War .
Churchill himself was keen to argue that gas , fired from ground - based guns or dropped from aircraft , would cause * only discomfort or illness , but not death * to dissident tribespeople ; but his optimistic view of the effects of gas were mistaken .
It was likely that the suggested gas would permanently damage eyesight and * kill children and sickly persons , more especially as the people against whom we intend to use it have no medical knowledge with which to supply antidotes . *
Churchill remained unimpressed by such considerations , arguing that the use of gas , a * scientific expedient , * should not be prevented * by the prejudices of those who do not think clearly * .
In the event , gas was used against the Iraqi rebels with excellent moral effect * though gas shells were not dropped from aircraft because of practical difficulties [.....]
Today in 1993 there are still Iraqis and Kurds who remember being bombed and machine - gunned by the RAF in the 1920s .
A Kurd from the Korak mountains commented , seventy years after the event : * They were bombing here in the Kaniya Khoran ... Sometimes they raided three times a day . *
Wing Commander Lewis , then of 30 Squadron ( RAF ) , Iraq , recalls how quite often * one would get a signal that a certain Kurdish village would have to be bombed ...* , the RAF pilots being ordered to bomb any Kurd who looked hostile .
In the same vein , Squadron - Leader Kendal of 30 Squadron recalls that if the tribespeople were doing something they ought not be doing then you shot them . *
Similarly , Wing - Commander Gale , also of 30 Squadron : * If the Kurds had n't learned by our example to behave themselves in a civilised way then we had to spank their bottoms .
This was done by bombs and guns .
Wing - Commander Sir Arthur Harris ( later Bomber Harris , head of wartime Bomber Command ) was happy to emphasise that * The Arab and Kurd now know what real bombing means in casualties and damage .
Within forty - five minutes a full - size village can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured . *
It was an easy matter to bomb and machine - gun the tribespeople , because they had no means of defence or retalitation .
Iraq and Kurdistan were also useful laboratories for new weapons ; devices specifically developed by the Air Ministry for use against tribal villages .
The ministry drew up a list of possible weapons , some of them the forerunners of napalm and air - to - ground missiles :
Phosphorus bombs , war rockets , metal crowsfeet [ to maim livestock ] man-killing shrapnel , liquid fire , delay - action bombs .
Many of these weapons were first used in Kurdistan .

Tim Cahill , so often Australia 's talisman , marked his return to national colours for the first time in eight months with a superb strike to open the scoring early in the first half and lanky frontman Josh Kennedy got justified reward for his hard work when he converted a Luke Wilkshire cross to score with a 76th - minute header .
The victory ensures Australia has an excellent platform , with six points from two games , five goals scored and none conceded , on which to build its qualifying campaign for a place in the 2010 finals in South Africa .
Not even a deluge of epic proportions and the half - hour delay it caused could dampen the Socceroos spirits as they cruised to a comfortable win .
The elements abated sufficiently to persuade Saudi referee Kalil Ibrahim Al Ghamdi that the game could kick off , although the Qataris , from a country where the rain hardly ever falls , might not have felt quite as comfortable about his decision .
Within 17 minutes they found themselves two down , effectively out of the contest and wishing , no doubt , that the man with the whistle had opted to wait for another , drier day .
Australia got off to the perfect start with Cahill 's superb ninth - minute strike .
Cahill fitted back seamlessly into the side .
As is so often the case , he was the right man in the right place to settle any Socceroo nerves .
" The tempo was high and we wanted to get out and really put them under pressure because complacency could have set in and given them a chance , " Cahill said .
Australia had monopolised possession on the sodden surface and had already set alarm bells ringing in the Qatar penalty area on a few occasions before Wilkshire , looking increasingly assured in the right - back role Verbeek has settled him in , combined with Emerton .
Wilkshire took a return pass from the Blackburn Rovers utility and flighted a cross into the penalty area , which was first headed on by David Carney then touched wide by Kennedy into space where Cahill took one touch to control the ball and a second to lash home in the far corner , giving Qatar 's stand - in goalkeeper Abdul Aziz no chance .
It was Cahill 's 14th goal in 29 appearances for his country .
" You have to finish things like that to win a game like this , " Cahill said .
Australia doubled its advantage eight minutes later and again Cahill was a central figure in winning what , replays suggested , might have been a fortuitous penalty .
Emerton 's cross was delivered to the far post and as Cahill leapt acrobatically to try and volley , Qatar centre - back Abdullah Koni made contact with the Australian midfielder .
Saudi referee Ibrahim Al Ghamdi deemed it sufficiently illegal to point to the spot .
Emerton stepped forward and drove to his left :
Aziz guessed the right way and got a hand to the ball but could only deflect it into his net .
A two - goal cushion so early was exactly what Verbeek would have wanted and a nightmare start in his new job for recently hired Qatar coach Bruno Metsu .
Australia took plenty of confidence from its position and stroked the ball about in measured style , its fluent , first - touch play — with Jason Culina orchestrating from a deep - lying midfield position — frustrated the visitors and ensured it retained sufficient possession to take the sting out of any Qatar .
Just 15 minutes after half - time Scott McDonald 's break down the left side led to a pass to Kennedy in support and the lanky striker spied Emerton closing from midfield .
The Socceroo veteran latched onto the pass from Kennedy and sent it across goal and into the left corner despite Aziz getting a touch on the ball .
With the sting out of the game it was Kennedy who added the final score in the 76th minute after a long and high Wilkshire ball into the box found the head of the boy from Yackandandah , who popped it over the oncoming Aziz and into the net .
MCCAIN CAMPAIGN CONFUSED ABOUT PAYROLL TAXES ….
For about a week now , Republicans have been trying to make the case that Barack Obama is exaggerating his tax cut proposal .
Obama has argued that his policy would give 95 % of Americans a tax cut .
Republicans have said this is impossible , since more than a third of American workers do n’t make enough money to pay any federal income taxes .
I ’d hoped the argument was so obviously dumb that it would just quickly disappear , its proponents humiliated , but no such luck .
John McCain made the claim a few days ago , the far - right editorial page of the Wall Street Journal followed suit , right - wing blogs have run with it , and today , the McCain campaign ’s Douglas Holtz - Eakin made the same argument to reporters .
The problem is , these folks seem surprisingly unfamiliar with payroll taxes .
Robert Gordon and James Kvaal set the record straight .
It is true that Obama has proposed several tax credits that include families who earn too little to owe income taxes , a group that include about half of families with children .
But many of these families work and pay thousands of dollars in other taxes .
For example , a family of four must earn about $ 25,000 before owing income taxes — but they must pay payroll taxes on the first dollar they earn .
Indeed , Obama ’s biggest refundable credit is designed to cushion the blow of payroll taxes .
Refundable credits are also often the most economically efficient way to help families , according to now - CBO director Peter Orszag .
Maybe that ’s why McCain ’s own health care plan uses refundable credits .
But McCain is echoing Phil Gramm‘s and Newt Gingrich ‘s old claim here that tax credits for low - income workers amount to welfare .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page charmingly referred to people too poor to pay income taxes as “ lucky duckies . ”
As a presidential candidate , George W. Bush “ sandbagged ” these Republicans by defending the earned income tax credit .
Now McCain is standing with Gramm and Gingrich , to the right of Bush .
Why the McCain campaign sees this as a winning argument remains a mystery .

Washington , DC – With news that a surveillance bill may be voted on in the House of Representatives as early as tomorrow , the American Civil Liberties Union sternly warned members against voting for the legislation .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) has worked closely with the White House and has led the effort to gut the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) and give the telephone companies what amounts to a pardon for breaking the law .
The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU ’s Washington Legislative Office :
" Congress is poised to once again pass disastrous surveillance legislation , now upping the ante with a thinly - veiled giveaway to some major campaign donors .
" This bill allows for mass and untargeted surveillance of Americans ’ communications .
The court review is mere window - dressing – all the court would look at is the procedures for the year - long dragnet and not at the who , what and why of the spying .
Even this superficial court review has a gaping loophole – ‘ exigent ’ circumstances can short cut even this perfunctory oversight since any delay in the onset of spying meets the test and by definition going to the court would cause at least a minimal pause .
Worse yet , if the court denies an order for any reason , the government is allowed to continue surveillance throughout the appeals process , thereby rendering the role of the judiciary meaningless .
In the end , there is no one to answer to ; a court review without power is no court review at all . "
" The Hoyer / Bush surveillance deal was clearly written with the telephone companies and internet providers at the table and for their benefit .
They wanted immunity , and this bill gives it to them .
" The telecom companies simply have to produce a piece of paper we already know exists , resulting in immediate dismissal .
That ’s not accountability .
Loopholes and judicial theater do n’t do our Fourth Amendment rights justice .
In the end , this is politics .
This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe and is a constitutional farce .
" The process by which this deal has come about has been as secretive as the warrantless wiretapping program it is seeking to legitimize .
While members and organizations who would seek to fiercely protect the civil liberties of Americans have been denied a seat at the table , one wonders how present the powerful telecom lobby has been .
" Leadership should be leading to protect the Constitution , not bowing to pressure from Republicans , the White House , and the telecommunications companies .
" The ACLU is asking Congress , as the final minutes tick by , to stand up and do the right thing . "

For the first time ever , the US military is deploying an active duty regular Army combat unit for full - time use inside the United States to deal with emergencies , including potential civil unrest .
Beginning on October 1 , the First Brigade Combat Team of the Third Division will be placed under the command of US Army North , the Army ’s component of the Pentagon ’s Northern Command ( NorthCom ) , which was created in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks with the stated mission of defending the US “ homeland ” and aiding federal , state and local authorities .
The unit — known as the “ Raiders ” — is among the Army ’s most “ blooded . ”
It has spent nearly three out of the last five years deployed in Iraq , leading the assault on Baghdad in 2003 and carrying out house - to - house combat in the suppression of resistance in the city of Ramadi .
It was the first brigade combat team to be sent to Iraq three times .
While active - duty units previously have been used in temporary assignments , such as the combat - equipped troops deployed in New Orleans , which was effectively placed under martial law in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , this marks the first time that an Army combat unit has been given a dedicated assignment in which US soil constitutes its “ battle zone . ”
The Pentagon ’s official pronouncements have stressed the role of specialized units in a potential response to terrorist attack within the US .
Gen . George Casey , the Army chief of staff , attended a training exercise last week for about 250 members of the unit at Fort Stewart , Georgia .
The focus of the exercise , according to the Army ’s public affairs office , was how troops “ might fly search and rescue missions , extract casualties and decontaminate people following a catastrophic nuclear attack in the nation ’s heartland . ”
“ We are at war with a global extremist network that is not going away , ” Casey told the soldiers .
“ I hope we do n’t have to use it , but we need the capability . ”
However , the mission assigned to the nearly 4,000 troops of the First Brigade Combat Team does not consist merely of rescuing victims of terrorist attacks .
An article that appeared earlier this month in the Army Times ( “ Brigade homeland tours start Oct. 1 ” ) , a publication that is widely read within the military , paints a different and far more ominous picture .
“ They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control , ” the paper reports .
It quotes the unit ’s commander , Col. Robert Cloutier , as saying that the 1st BCT ’s soldiers are being trained in the use of “ the first ever nonlethal package the Army has fielded . ”
The weapons , the paper reported , are “ designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them . ”
The equipment includes beanbag bullets , shields and batons and equipment for erecting roadblocks .
It appears that as part of the training for deployment within the US , the soldiers have been ordered to test some of this non-lethal equipment on each other .
“ I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , ” Cloutier told the Army Times .
He described the effects of the electroshock weapon as “ your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body . ”
The colonel ’s remark suggests that , in preparation for their “ homefront ” duties , rank - and - file troops are also being routinely Tasered .
The brutalizing effect and intent of such a macabre training exercise is to inure troops against sympathy for the pain and suffering they may be called upon to inflict on the civilian population using these same “ non-lethal ” weapons .
According to military officials quoted by the Army Times , the deployment of regular Army troops in the US begun with the First Brigade Combat Team is to become permanent , with different units rotated into the assignment on an annual basis .
In an online interview with reporters earlier this month , NorthCom officers were asked about the implications of the new deployment for the Posse Comitatus Act , the 230 - year - old legal statute that bars the use of US military forces for law enforcement purposes within the US itself .
Col .
Lou Volger , NorthCom ’s chief of future operations , tried to downplay any enforcement role , but added , “ We will integrate with law enforcement to understand the situation and make sure we ’re aware of any threats . ”
Volger acknowledged the obvious , that the Brigade Combat Team is a military force , while attempting to dismiss the likelihood that it would play any military role .
It “ has forces for security , ” he said , “ but that ’s really — they call them security forces , but that ’s really just to establish our own footprint and make sure that we can operate and run our own bases . ”
Lt. Col. James Shores , another NorthCom officer , chimed in , “ Let ’s say even if there was a scenario that developed into a branch of a civil disturbance — even at that point it would take a presidential directive to even get it close to anything that you ’re suggesting . ”
Whatever is required to trigger such an intervention , clearly Col .
Cloutier and his troops are preparing for it with their hands - on training in the use of “ non-lethal ” means of repression .
The extreme sensitivity of the military brass on this issue notwithstanding , the reality is that the intervention of the military in domestic affairs has grown sharply over the last period under conditions in which its involvement in two colonial - style wars abroad has given it a far more prominent role in American political life .
The Bush administration has worked to tear down any barriers to the use of the military in domestic repression .
Thus , in the 2007 Pentagon spending bill it inserted a measure to amend the Posse Comitatus
Act to clear the way for the domestic deployment of the military in the event of natural disaster , terrorist attack or “ other conditions in which the president determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order . ”
The provision granted the president sweeping new powers to impose martial law by declaring a “ public emergency ” for virtually any reason , allowing him to deploy troops anywhere in the US and to take control of state - based National Guard units without the consent of state governors in order to “ suppress public disorder . ”
The provision was subsequently repealed by Congress as part of the 2008 military appropriations legislation , but the intent remains .
Given the sweeping powers claimed by the White House in the name of the “ commander in chief ” in a global war on terror — powers to suspend habeas corpus , carry out wholesale domestic spying and conduct torture — there is no reason to believe it would respect legal restrictions against the use of military force at home .
It is noteworthy that the deployment of US combat troops “ as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters ” — in the words of the Army Times — coincides with the eruption of the greatest economic emergency and financial disaster since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Justified as a response to terrorist threats , the real source of the growing preparations for the use of US military force within America ’s borders lies not in the events of September 11 , 2001 or the danger that they will be repeated .
Rather , the domestic mobilization of the armed forces is a response by the US ruling establishment to the growing threat to political stability .
Under conditions of deepening economic crisis , the unprecedented social chasm separating the country ’s working people from the obscenely wealthy financial elite becomes unsustainable within the existing political framework .

US regulators have struck a body blow at two men accused of masterminding the world 's largest spam enterprise by obtaining a court order that shuts down some half - dozen companies they operated and freezing assets earned in the operation .
Lance Atkinson , a New Zealand citizen living in Australia , and Jody Smith , a businessman from McKinney , Texas , stand accused of overseeing an operation that raked in millions of dollars sending billions of spam messages .
According to a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission , the men recruited spammers from around the world to send unsolicited junk mail related to male - enhancement pills , prescription drugs , and other items .
Spam opponents cheered the FTC 's action .
" They are probably the most prolific spammers at the moment , " Richard Cox , CIO of Spamhaus.org said of Atkinson and Smith .
" This is probably the first time that an action by law enforcement will affect the level of spam in people 's inboxes . "
Attempts to contact Atkinson and Smith for comment were not successful .
Using an affiliate program called " Affking , " they were at one point believed to be responsible for one - third of the world 's spam , according to the FTC .
The men took great pains to distance themselves from the operation , creating a handful of shell companies located throughout the world to launder the large sums of money they brought in and to purchase domain names and credit card services .
According to the FTC 's complaint , Atkinson has been involved in the spam trade for years and is the sole director and shareholder of Inet Ventures Pty Ltd of Australia .
Even after the FTC obtained a $ 2.2 m judgment against Atkinson in 2005 , he continued to recruit spammers to promote his various websites , FTC attorneys said in court documents .
To bolster their claim , the attorneys included a December 2007 conversation between Atkinson and his brother Shane Atkinson shortly after he was contacted by the BBC and asked about Gencash , a spam operation allegedly maintained by the brothers .
" I had bbc world call my home , " Shane wrote in an instant message to his brother .
" i think you need to stop spamming asap . "
Shortly afterward , Atkinson sent messages to an associate in which he discounted the likelihood he'd ever be fingered in the BBC probe .
" They sort of said that shane was the one responcible [ sic ] for spamming , " Lance wrote .
" All the penis sites .
And the local cops are investigating . "
" They 'll never find you , " the associate , who was named Roland Smits , opined .
Atkinson replied : " Well they bought [ sic ] me up , but nothing linked to me , most i do is provide services for spammers . "
With so many eyes on the Atkinson brothers and their sancash.com affiliate site , Lance quickly formed a new partnership with Smith .
The two soon launched affking.com , which was in many ways identical to the Sancash website .
Credit card sales that flowed through three merchant accounts Smith set up in Cyprus and the Republic of Georgia cleared as much as $ 500,000 a month , according to the FTC .
The money was funneled through a series of companies controlled by Smith .
One of them was called TwoBucks Trading Limited and another was Tango Pay , which received $ 3.3 m from the Cyprus bank accounts in just eight months .
While many of the payments went directly to Atkinson or companies under Atkinson 's control , Smith allegedly profited handsomely as well .
Over the past year , he has withdrawn almost $ 200,000 out of automatic teller machines near his home that came from Click Fusion , another company involved in the operation .
Given cyber criminals ' growing sense of impunity , it 's easy to argue that actions like the one today do n't amount to much .
After all , if a previous FTC action and a resulting $ 2.2 m judgment did n't reform Atkinson , what 's to stop him now ?
A couple of things .
For one , the spam coming from this operation has been stopped in its tracks , according to Cox of Spamhaus .
That could make a considerable difference in the lives of those who must shoulder the weight of the spam epidemic .
And for another thing , FTC enforcers this time have made a concerted effort with their counterparts in New Zealand and Australia to cut off the spammers ' air supply by freezing the assets of the companies involved in the spamming enterprise .
And that has the potential to make things different , said Steve Wernikoff , a staff attorney with the FTC who helped bring the case .
" There 's no doubt it 's more difficult when people take efforts directly aimed at hiding and using resources in places out of the country , " he said .
" They think they can operate without being touched by law enforcement .
But we 're trying to change that . " ®
Excerpted from the book " How to Win a Fight with a Conservative " by Daniel Kurtzman
With all of the nonsensical talk about plumbers and pigs with lipstick , hockey moms and washed - up terrorists , it 's easy to lose track of what this election is really about .
To help clarify matters as Americans head to the polls , here 's a look at the core beliefs that define liberals and conservatives .
We 'll leave it to you to decide which represents the " real America . "
THE LIBERAL MANIFESTO
Liberals believe in clean air , diplomacy , stem cells , living wages , body armor for our troops , government accountability , and that exercising the right to dissent is the highest form of patriotism .
Liberals believe in reading actual books , going to war as a last resort , separating church and hate , and doing what Jesus would actually do , instead of lobbying for upper - class tax cuts and fantasizing about the apocalypse .
Liberals believe in civil rights , the right to privacy , and that evolution and global warming are n't just theories but incontrovertible scientific facts .
Liberals believe there ought to be a constitutional amendment that ( 1 ) prohibits another Bush from ever occupying the White House , and ( 2 ) prevents George W. Bush from ever becoming baseball commissioner before he does to our national pastime what he did for America .
Liberals believe in rescuing people from flooded streets and rooftops , even if they 're too poor to vote Republican .
Liberals believe that supporting our troops means treating our wounded vets like the heroes they are , and not leaving them to languish in rat - infested military hospitals under the outsourced management of incompetent cronies who think they 're running a Taco Bell franchise .
Liberals believe in the audacity of universal health care , green energy , voting paper trails , the common good , and that , no matter how fascinating a story it may be , a president should never sit around in a state of total paralysis reading " My Pet Goat " while America is under attack .
And above all , liberals believe that it 's time to come together as a country and put a collective boot in the ass of shameless conservative fear - mongers , hate merchants , and scapegoaters who are sucking the freedom out of all our souls .
THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO
Conservatives believe in faith - based wars , naked pyramids , the Confederate flag , gated communities , golden parachutes , and that what 's good for Wal - Mart and Exxon Mobil is good for America .
Conservatives believe in fear - mongering , gay - bashing , entitlement to power , patrio - fascist jingoism , more fear - mongering , neo-Puritanism , giddy apocalypticism , and in building bridges to nowhere .
Conservatives believe in beautiful Hummers befouling spacious skies , amber waves of abstinent teens , and crowning thy good with estate tax cuts .
Conservatives believe in liberating people with cluster bombs .
Conservatives believe it is great sport to hunt pen-raised , wingless quail from a car .
Conservatives believe in dodging drafts , agitating for wars , smearing Democratic war veterans as unpatriotic , turning against wars when they become unpopular , and then accusing liberals of being spineless flip - floppers .
Conservatives believe they 've just seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich .
Conservatives believe that abstinence - only education has worked so well for their pregnant unwed teenage daughters that it should be replicated all across the nation .
Conservatives believe there is a " real America , " where the flames of hatred , racism , and xenophobia can be easily stoked by linking your opponents to terrorists , and a " fake America " for everyone else .
And more than anything else , conservatives believe that no matter how big of an economic disaster you create , how badly you alienate allies , botch intelligence , or mismanage wars , it 's still liberals ' fault .

There are many typographic marks which are familiar to most , but understood by few .
Most of these glyphs have interesting histories and evolutions as they survived the beatings given to them through rushed handwriting of scribes and misuses through history .
They now mostly live on our keyboards and in our software , and a few are used often , so it seems only fitting to know where they come from and how to correctly use them .
The Pilcrow
History of the Pilcrow
As with many elements of language today , it all started with Latin .
While the pilcrow has evolved to resemble a backwards P , this is nothing more than incidental .
In its early forms , the pilcrow was a C , a shorthand used for the Latin word capitulum , meaning chapter , mostly in a religious sense , which may be why it is n’t uncommon to see it in use in Biblical texts today .
Replacing another symbol , the paragraphos , to become the new mark representing a paraph — a new line of thought or break in text — it evolved over time through the natural development of handwriting .
Initially starting as the C , a slash was drawn through it , perhaps to make it more noticeable , then a second slash was added , and through time the C went from being the vertical centre of the lines , to the top of them .
All this ended in what is often now seen as a P backwards .
The evolution of the Pilcrow
Using the Pilcrow
Initially the pilcrow was used to separate blocks of text , rather than dividing them with space .
While this is , of course , now the normal thing to do , it is n’t impossible to find modern text that do the same as what was originally intended , mostly in an effort to insert a little bit of flair or maybe to serve as a throwback to typesetting that may be seen as a little more classical .
An example that is often cited is Eric Gill ’s An Essay On Typography .
It is also used by proofreaders to denote a paragraph that should be split , and also as a mark used to reference a specific paragraph in legal documents ( an example is included in the Section Sign below ) .
While graphic designers , and especially those outside the field , would have no major need to think about using the pilcrow , it is worth noting that they can be a pleasure to design for our typographic friends .
The Ampersand
History of the Ampersand
As with the pilcrow , the ampersand has Latin roots .
Originally a shorthand mark for et , Latin for and , the ampersand has a very traceable and visible evolution .
Simply put , the & is not much more than e and t coming together .
The ampersand is a marriage of the two letters , which came about through rushed writings and abbreviation starting at its birth around 45 AD .
Through time the symbol has changed to the point where most ampersands are distant cousins of the original et .
But there are a few typefaces that have more of a distinct features relating to its ancestry .
An example of the evolution of the Ampersand .
An article with a few great shots of early ampersands can be found at the Adobe Fonts site .
Using an Ampersand
The ampersand should n’t be used as direct replacement for and .
It is best used when pairing names in titles or in a business name .
It is usable in body text when need to indicate multiple couples , such as Gilbert & Sulivan and Rodgers & Hammerstein , but this rule is more of an extension of the above .
Section Sign
History of the Section Sign
There is n’t much out there for information on the section sign .
So the easy speculation to make is that it is two S‘s that came together as a shorthand for referencing a section and that it happened at some point in time .
If you know more , let it be known in the comments and I ’ll improve the above .
Using the Section Sign
§ 15
Most commonly used in legal texts , the section sign is used for referencing .
For example , the above would refer you to section 15 .
§ 8—20
Something I love about the Section Sign is that when you need to refer to a range of sections , you use it twice , as above .
Why you do n’t use it once is beyond me , as it seems somewhat redundant , but if you know otherwise , let me know .
§ 15 , ¶4
And when you are referencing a paragraph within a section , you get to use the lovely pilcrow .
Asterisk
History of the Asterisk
Originally using six arms , it is now more commonly designed with five .
It is a mark most often used to denote a side note .
Like the section sign , not a whole lot is known about the asterisk .
The best , and practically the only , piece of historical information I could find was in my Bringhurst Bible , so I ’ll let him tell it best :
‘ It appears in the earliest Sumerian pictographic writing and has been in continuous use as a graphic symbol for at least 5,000 years . ’
Using the Asterisk
Most often used as a superscripted glyph , the asterisk is primarily used for notes , references or to mark a keyword .
It can also be used to indicate a person ’s birth when appearing with a year — with the dagger indicating death .
Hedera
History of the Hedera
Another mark for which little information is known , but that may be because it is n’t necessarily an important mark as it ’s mostly decoration .
The hedera was used in Latin texts as a punctuation mark between paragraphs in long documents , when line breaks were n’t as common , similar to the pilcrow .
When it rains , it pours .
It was hard to find any good examples of hedera marks , then I found a font that is all hedera marks .
Hedera is Latin for ivy , which is n’t surprising when you see that the hedera is an illustrated ivy leaf .
Found in early Greek texts , it makes the marks one of the oldest typographic ornaments .
Using the Hedera
A latin mark used for punctuation , it is now most often used as a
fleuron ( a typographic ornament ) that is often seen , yet not easily
found .
It is now sometimes , albeit very rarely , used by designers between paragraphs ( new lines and space included ) , for splitting very large lists , such as an index ; used between lists of entries for each letter , replacing the appropriate letter as a header .
It may also be used as an opening element of a paragraph when a text - indent is in use , sitting in the open space which would normally be left empty .
Why & When
Knowing why and when these marks came to be is n’t necessary information .
But it is useful in a number of ways — it helps us understand the context in which to use these marks , it ’s interesting for type nerds ( and who is n’t one ? ) and it will help you justify using these marks when employing them to give a piece of work a little extra flare .
At the very least , you might have a few extra terminologies you can throw around when talking to fellow type nuts .
Patios are open now in the suburbs and opening soon in the city .
Below , you ’ll find a running list of sortable outdoor dining options .
If you are a restaurant owner with a patio or rooftop , please add your information to our list here .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Influential insurance industry rating agency A.M.
Best said late Monday that it has downgraded the ratings of American International Group AIG , - 1.23 % because of a " rapid deterioration " in the insurer 's financial strength and flexibility .
" AIG 's lack of liquidity at the holding company level and management 's need to secure funding options are not representative of financial stability and not reflective of AIG 's current ratings , " A.M. Best said in a statement .
The financial strength rating of AIG 's domestic life and retirement services subsidiaries was cut to A ( Excellent ) from A+ ( Superior ) .
The issuer credit rating of that unit was downgraded to a from aa , the agency said .
AIG 's domestic property and casualty subsidiaries suffered similar downgrades from A.M. Best .

Should you cache ?
Should you use memcached ?
Should you just shard mysql more ?
Memcached 's popularity is expanding its use into some odd places .
It 's becoming an authoritative datastore for some large sites , and almost more importantly it 's sneaking into the lowly web startup .
This is some discussion .
Most of whom seem to be missing the point .
In this post I attempt to explain my point of view for how memcached should really influence your bouncing baby startups , and even give some pointers to the big guys who might have trouble seeing the forest through the trees .
Using memcached does not scale your website !
Entertain me , I 'm playing semantics here :
This thing is not for scaleout .
Mostly .
What memcached really is , is a giant floating magnifying glass .
It takes what you have already built and makes stretch ten times further .
I insist on not confusing caching with scaleout as when your little stretch - armstrong of a website hits that tenfold limit , you 're still screwed .
There 's no magic switch or configuration option in memcached that will save you from dealing with proper optimization and sharding .
You sure can get away with a hell of a lot though !
Keep it in the front of your mind ; no it will not help you batch your writes , or make them smaller , or really help you deal with them in any useful way .
If you want to write data you will need back later , you must shard .
If it 's data you do n't care about , maybe write it to memcached and make a note of it in your business plan .
Also strongly keep in mind ; memcached wo n't help your cache misses suck less .
If you 're writing awful data warehouse quality queries which you expect to run live on the site , go bust out the failboat and get - a - rowin ' .
You 're screwed .
As your dataset grows you will find new slices of hell in which your queries behave in all new ways .
What once scanned " a few extra rows " now might hit tens of thousands .
Cache misses will suck .
You will have to deal with this .
That 's not something this solves .
Sometimes memcached does let you achieve the impossible , or scale the unlikely .
Take slightly complex queries , or even template operations , which under the best of conditions might take 15 - 20 milliseconds each .
An obnoxious join , a weird subquery , a tree walk , or fancy HTML templating .
Being able to do this live could mean the difference betwen your website standing apart or having to settle with an awful workaround .
In these cases , with a high enough hit rate , you can soak those cache misses and make the feature work .
My example is n't translating a 5 second query into 0.5 ms with memcached , it 's a 15 - 20 ms query .
If you had a dozen of these in a page load , a bad load might take an extra quarter second to render , but it would n't ruin the user experience .
The issue memcached solves here is subtle .
Tacking on 0.25 seconds per page render might not make the site completely unusable , but realize these queries are using solid resources on your expensive hardware for that extra quarter second .
With a quadcore database , it 's possible under the best conditions you would only be able to render 14 - 16 pages per second off of that machine .
Throw in all the other things you have to do on a page load , writes , internal database whoosits and uneven CPU usage and you'd be lucky to get 5 pages per second .
In this case , it 's still walking the line of scalability , but it turns something mildly impossible into something highly probable .
On the cheap .
The cost equation
Now the most important factor here has reared its ugly head : Cost .
Cost .
Ugly for startups .
Ugly for established companies .
Nightmares for venture capital .
What is your cost ?
Why am I talking cash about companies who have millions of dollars in VC or sales ?
Just buy more servers !
Whatever , right ?
Well no .
The largest cost is time .
All others pale in comparison .
The best physical goods investments your company can make are more related to your people than your hardware .
Hardware has horrific depreciation .
Most of the value is lost immediately , the rest over the first year of operation .
In comparison , buying your employees really fucking nice chairs , desks , and monitors in a swanky comfortable office are much more solid investments for your company .
Aeron chairs have great resale value for that inevitable going - bumpkus dot bomb sale .
Also anything you do to make your workers happier and more productive will pay out more than any hardware investment .
Your product ships on time , you react to the market faster .
To sidestep into hardware a little ...
Always max out the RAM in your databases .
Everyone should .
I did n't realize people do n't actually do this until I read some of these arguments against memcached .
Whenever I add memcached to a website , RAM memcached gets is RAM that did n't fit into the databases , but easily fits into empty memory slots in webservers or cheaper hardware .
A good solid database might cost $ 5,000 , but a beefy memcached box will cost less than half that .
Way less than that if you just add memory to existing hardware .
So " adding that extra RAM to your databases " is n't a very fair apples - to - apples comparison unless you 're already doing something wrong .
So it should be obvious just what the hell I 'm getting at now , and what seems to be bothering everyone else about this whole stupid memcached fad .
You 're all wasting your goddamn time !
Yeesh !
How can a small site or startup benefit from memcached ?
Simple : The idea .
Caching really wedges your whole RDBMS worldview .
You do n't just CRUD anymore .
Your data is a process .
A flow between points instead of just the store and display .
At any time in this flow an idea may be injected .
Maybe it 's serializing a generated object and caching it , maybe it 's utilizing
But that 's all messy complicated .
What can you do ?
What should you do ?
Design for having cache , design for change .
... but do n't write all the code yet .
... but certainly design for change .
Think good object design .
A " user " is a class .
That user has base properties which you might find in the `user` table .
A " user " object might have a profile , which is really another object with another class representing a `profile` table .
my $user ; is an invaluable abstraction .
That user object must load and store data .
When you build this at first it 's all standard CRUD .
Straight to a database .
Where would you think to add caching to this system ?
I hope I 've made it too obvious .
At the query layer !
Use a database abstraction class and have it memcache resultset objects and ...
No no no , that 's a lie .
I 'm lying .
Do n't do that .
Do it inside that $user object .
At the highest level possible .
Take the whole object state and shovel it somewhere .
That object is its own biggest authority .
It knows when it 's been updated , when it needs to load data , and when to write to the database .
It might 've had to read from several tables or load dependent objects based on what you ask it to do .
Instead of wrangling your best and brightest into figuring out a cache invalidation algorithm which might work " okay " against your schemas , do what 's simple for the object .
If adding caching to the $ user object means the load ( ) function tries memcached first , and all write operations hit memcached with a delete operation , so be it .
You just added basic caching to one of the hottest objects in your website in , oh , half an hour .
Maybe a few days if you 're really scraping the bottom of the talent barrel .
Now we 're back where we started .
Reap the time benefits !
Abstract your data access methods properly , plan for caching .
Actually go write caching into a few objects .
Maybe turn it off when you 're done .
You do n't need it yet .
Write your objects to talk directly to your database and save time .
Same idea for sharding .
Either focus on that now , or realize you can take a $ user object and extend its load ( ) magic to find and write to users based on a sharding scheme .
You probably do n't have to rewrite all of the code to make this happen .
Refactor to win .
So now you 're ready .
You 're building your site fast and abstracting where you can .
Brace for change .
Be ready to shard , be ready to cache .
React and change to what you push out which is actually popular , vs overplanning and wasting valuable time .
Keeping it simple is gold here .
You 're building something new and you 're going to fail at it .
Your design will be wrong , you will anticipate the wrong feature to be popular .
Dealing with this quickly can set you apart .
Being able to slap memcached into a bunch of objects in a few days ( or even hours ) can mean the difference between riding a load spike or riding the walrus .
Bullet points for fun !
How can your small site benefit from memcached :
- Design for change !
Holy crap I can't say this enough .
- Do n't cache in ways that piss off your users .
- Not keeping it simple is fail .
- Cache and shard at the highest level possible relative to your data .
- Read
- The same ideas which help you prepare for cache , helps you prepare for sharding .
- Do n't waste all your time getting it right now .
Get it close , get an idea , try it out , and prepare to be wrong .
Finally :
- Keep an open mind .
Sites like grazr and fotolog do things differently .
Does n't mean they 're right , does n't mean they 're wrong .
Be inventive where it makes sense for your business .
There .

It seems the fleas kept checking for $ flea -> has_kitty , and because I was keeping the canonical state of the $ flea object in memcached , and I had a system failure on that box , I lost all the state records and killed all the $ fleas .
From : boogabee Date : August 18th , 2008 03:04 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I have to agree with the thought that memcache does not scale your website .
I 'm fighting consistently to stop the notion that a horrible sql query does n't matter because we 'll memcache the result .
Putting memcache in front of bad backend design is not a fix , it only masks the problem for a short amount of time .
An additional fight that I run into is that memcache is a data repository you can depend upon .
I run into the idea that people can stash things there and then come back at any time and get it dependably .
I 'm not sure if this is just my environment or a more widespread view .
I love memcache , but I 'm seeing it used in many ways and instances where it should n't .

Should I use memcached ?
I 'm a bit confused ...
I 'm running a PHP web application ( Moodle ) on a Windows 2003 Server machine .
It uses a MSSQL 2005 database on a separate database server .
I 've configured PHP to run with eAccelerator .
Should I also be using memcached ?
Can I run eAccelerator AND memcached ?

In a sense , I ’ve written all the other posts in this series just so you can understand what happened when Rich Hickey gave his talk .
Maybe you ’ve already read a post from a Lisp hacker that was there , so you think you already know how this ends .
Think again .
Let me break this down so you can see the full context in which he was speaking :
* We started with the Steele / Gabriel “ meta - talk . ”
As the guy on LispCast said , this talk inadvertently gave an impression of general stagnation among the Common Lisp community .
* We ’d heard much of the history of Lisp and Common Lisp … and the story seemed to indicate that the Lisp community spent too much energy fighting among themselves before they could finally realize that C and C++ were their real enemies .
* Fritza Kunze ’s idea of completing a new Lisp within 12 months pretty much tanked .
* Those of us that held out hopes for Scheme being the answer to our dreams were disappointed to hear William Clinger describe in exquisite detail all of the problems with the R6RS process .
I do n’t know when it was , but at some point a guy toward the front pleaded for just some basic libraries for GUI ’s , database access , and web services .
Someone tried to punt on that question , but a consensus emerged that it was way too hard for anyone that just wanted to build a stupid application .
Later on we would hear about some of the technical reasons behind that difficulty , but still … there was no good answer on the table .
So into that setting comes Rich Hickey .
We wanted a new Lisp .
A simpler Lisp .
A cleaned up Lisp with decent library support .
We wanted to be able to use Lisp on our day jobs and not just on “ the back forty . ”
And Rich Hickey basically says to us , “ I ’ve already got one . ” (!)
And not only that … he gave an really good presentation .
I admit , I ’m a snob .
I never really looked at Clojure myself– one mention of the word “ Java ” and my mind was closed to whatever it had to offer .
But he knew all of my objections and had clear and concise answers for them .
He also knew about the kinds of frustrations I ’ve had with Common Lisp … and he had answers for those as well .
But he also knew what makes Lisp great .
The thing that clinched it was that he knew exactly why we were so enamored with Alan Perlis .
And he could take Perlis ’s ideas and take them one step further .
It was electrifying .
This is the thing that sold me : hash tables in Common Lisp are a pain to work with .
As Hickey said , “ you ca n’t write lispy code with Lisp hash tables . ”
But take a look at how you do hash tables in Clojure :
In short , Clojure provides better ways to produce homogeneous code that operates on heterogeneous data structures .
Clojure provides more uniformity in data structure access .
Clojure provides something I ’ve wanted for months , but never fully imagined on my own .
And unlike some of the talks that were tinged with a little bitterness , a sense of loss , or a sense of nostalgia , Hickey was upbeat and forward looking .
“ Lisp as an idea is still vibrant , especially among young developers , ” he said .
“ People are excited about Lisp and the idea of Lisp . ”
At end of the talk , JonL was the first to speak , as usual .
I think even he was temporarily speechless .
While he might have had reservations about the hash table trick that I like so much , he still gave his blessing to Hicky : “ You love to go to Lisp and you understand why , ” he said with clear admiration .
The sense of relief that passed over the room at that point was palpable .
After JonL was finished responding , a young developer in the back could not contain himself .
“ This is the best thing I ’ve ever heard in any conference , ” he said .
“ Great work . ”
And that ’s what the Lisp50 conference was about .

Pope Benedict XVI has approved the new guidance The Roman Catholic Church has issued guidance for future priests to have psychological tests to weed out those unable to control their sexual urges .
A senior churchman said a series of sex scandals had contributed to the rewriting of the guidelines .
The authors said screening would help avoid " tragic situations " caused by what they termed psychological defects .
The guidance says the voluntary tests should also aim to vet for those with " deep - seated homosexual tendencies " .
Among other traits that might make a candidate unsuitable for the priesthood , the advice lists " uncertain sexual identity , " " excessive rigidity of character " and " strong affective dependencies " .
The document also makes reference to heterosexual urges .
Seminarians should be barred if testing makes it " evident the candidate has difficulty living in celibacy :
That is , if celibacy for him is lived as a burden so heavy that it compromises his affective and relational equilibrium " , it says .
Catholic officials continue to fixate on the offenders and ignore the larger problem
US - based victims group SNAP
The advice stipulates priests must have a " positive and stable sense of one 's masculine identity " .
The document , approved by Pope Benedict XVI and made public on Thursday , stresses that the screening must always have the candidate 's consent .
The Catholic Church has been rocked by a series of sex scandals in recent years involving paedophile priests , notably in the US , Latin America and Europe , triggering lawsuits that have cost hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements .
And a seminary in Austria was shut down in August 2004 after revelations that students openly indulged in homosexual conduct .
Gay rights groups have accused the Church of using homosexuals as scapegoats for abuse scandals .
The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) , a US - based group of victims of sexual abuse , said the revised guidelines did not go far enough .
" Catholic officials continue to fixate on the offenders and ignore the larger problem :
The Church 's virtually unchanged culture of secrecy and unchecked power in the hierarchy , " it said in a statement .
" These broader factors are deeply rooted in the Church and contribute heavily to extensive and ongoing clergy sex abuse and cover up . "

If you want to incubate an author who will show lifelong sympathy for children and animals , it seems best to sequester him at an early age and then subject him to a long regime of domestic torture .
This was the formula that worked so well for Kipling , as evidenced in his frightening autobiographical story , “ Baa Baa , Black Sheep , ” and it is almost uncanny to see how closely Saki ’s early life followed the same course .
Abandoned to the care of cold and neurotic aunts in England while his father performed colonial duties in India , he and his siblings had to learn how to do without affection , and how to resist and outpoint adult callousness and stupidity .
But without those terrible women — and the villains in Saki ’s gem - like tales are almost always female — we might not have had the most - fearsome aunts in fiction , outdoing even Wodehouse ’s Aunt Agatha or Wilde ’s Lady Bracknell .
Wodehouse happily admitted to being influenced by Saki , and it would be interesting to know to what extent Saki was himself influenced by Wilde .
There is a good deal of evidence to suggest that he was , because some of his epigrams ( “ Beauty is only sin deep ” ) betray an obvious indebtedness , and one ( “ To lose an hotel and a cake of soap in one afternoon suggests willful carelessness ” ) is an almost direct appropriation from The Importance of Being Earnest .
But in that epoch , Wilde ’s name lay under a ban , and Saki would have been well advised to not challenge the unstated rules that underlay that prohibition .
( I find the speculation about his own homosexuality pointless because there is nothing about which to speculate : he was self - evidently homosexual and , just as obviously , deeply repressed . )
As is by no means uncommon in such cases , Saki was of the extreme right , and even an admirer must concede that some of his witticisms were rather labored and contrived as a consequence .
Several of his less amusing stories are devoted to ridicule of the women ’s suffrage movement , which was cresting during his heyday , while a persistent subtext of his work is a satirical teasing of his contemporary and bête noire , the ponderously socialistic Bernard Shaw ( “ Sherard Blaw , the dramatist who had discovered himself , and who had given so ungrudgingly of his discovery to the world ” ) .
And , like another of his great contemporaries , Arthur Balfour , future author of a famous Declaration , Saki harbored a suspicion of Jews .
One of his feral ephebes , Reginald , tells a duchess while chatting at the theater that what she terms “ the great Anglo - Saxon empire ” is , in fact , “ rapidly becoming a suburb of Jerusalem . ”
That same empire , and its survival , was at the center of the contradictions in Saki ’s personality .
Byrne ’s insightful and sprightly book makes plain that his affectless poseurs and dandies may have reflected one half of the man , just as his repeated portrayals of lithe and lissome and amoral young men must have expressed his banked - down yearnings .
But this other hemisphere of his character also admired wildness and risk and cruelty and warfare , and associated the concepts of empire and nation with manly virtue .
Violence in NW Pakistan triggers exodus Reuters
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This By Sahibzada Bahauddin KHAR , Pakistan , Aug 15 ( Reuters ) - About 100,000 Pakistani villagers have fled clashes between security forces and militants in a northwestern region raising the danger of a big humanitarian problem , a government official said on Friday .
Security forces and militants have been fighting in the Bajaur region on the Afghan border , a known sanctuary for al Qaeda and Taliban fighters , since the militants attacked a security post last week .
About 170 people have been killed , including some civilians , officials have said .
The fighting has included strikes on militants by fighter jets and helicopter gunships .
The violence has triggered an exodus , with people streaming out of the region on packed pick - up trucks and on foot , many heading for the safety of the main northwestern city of Peshawar .
The displaced people are creating one more problem for a new coalition government pre-occupied with political wrangling while economic and security problems mount .
" We are gathering figures from various areas and it is close to 100,000 , it may be more than that , " said Sitara Imran , Minister for Social Welfare in the North West Frontier Province .
" This will create a big humanitarian problem ...
We are going to appeal to civil society and international donor agencies for help , " Imran said .
Bajaur is the most northerly of seven semi-autonomous tribal regions .
It is opposite Afghanistan 's eastern province of Kunar , where U.S. troops are battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters .
Villager Mohammad Maroof walked for many hours with his family to get out of Bajaur , where he said life had become intolerable .
" There is no such thing as life in Bajaur .
We were like a prisoners in our own homes , " said Maroof , who has taken refuge with friends in Peshawar .
Imran said the humanitarian situation was expected to deteriorate with people also leaving the northwestern valley of Swat where troops are also battling militants .
Nearly 150 people have been killed in two weeks of renewed clashes in the valley , which until last year was one of the country 's main tourist destinations .
The election of a civilian government in February brought a lull in militant violence as new leaders sought to make peace deals in various trouble spots but trouble has flared again in recent weeks .

Is there a Fatal Flaw in the Law of Attraction ?
Nothing is Perfect
Do you get suspicious when someone offers you the perfect investment , opportunity , solution , etc . ?
Everything has a limitation or flaw of some kind .
Things do n’t have to be perfect , but we need to understand where the flaws are .
When someone offers you the latest personal development method , do n’t expect perfection .
And do n’t be cynical , and assume that the method is worthless .
Seek to understand where the technique works , and what the limitations are .
There has been a lot of attention given to The Secret ( which is all about the Law of Attraction ) .
Its discussed and promoted as though it ’s the perfect answer to everything .
Is it perfect ?
The Law of Attraction tells us that we will bring into our lives what we focus on .
Our personal growth is in our own hands .
That means that you and I have to search our hearts , find out what ’s important to us , and find the right way to focus on our great desires .
And bring our dreams to life .
Sorry , though , this is not a wishing well , a lottery ticket , or a slot machine .
You have to be prepared to see opportunities that appear , and do the work necessary to leverage those opportunities into the results you want .
Help will come in totally unexpected ways , but it ’s only help .
You ’re still in the picture .
Some people might think that this is a flaw .
They want the Law of Attraction to be a magic wand .
So they can get what they want with no effort .
I do n’t think that manifesting your dreams has to be painful , and burdensome .
But you have to invest both your desire , and your action into your dreams .
When you invest your heart and your action into something , you make it yours .
And this is your life that you ’re trying to manifest !
Cause , Effect and Control
Ok , here ’s a real weakness in the way some people represent the Law of Attraction .
Do you attract everything that comes into your life ?
Some people believe that we attract everything , pleasant or unpleasant .
I ’m not denying that we sometimes attract the unpleasant through unconscious desires .
We have incredible influence over the direction of our lives .
We have so much more power to shape our lives than we ever imagine .
BUT .
The world is influenced by many people ’s desires , which often conflict with one another .
And , I believe , the world is influenced by a higher power beyond any single person ’s desires .
With this sea of influences , we will not always be able to manifest our desires .
It ’s critical that we do n’t underestimate our personal power to affect our lives .
But , do we have to pretend that we can control , or even understand , every event in our lives ?
We have this love / hate relationship with the idea of cause and effect .
Sometimes , we believe that we have power over everything that touches us , and that anything that goes wrong is our fault .
Sometimes , we believe that we are completely powerless .
There are many times when the complexity of the world is beyond us .
But we have this drive to explain everything .
When some great , unpredictable event happens we start analyzing it , and talking about the factors that contributed to it .
Understanding some of the factors does not mean that we could have predicted that it would happen , or even , that we can predict a similar future event .
But it ’s scary to live in a world where events can come and disrupt our lives .
We want to pretend that everything is predictable and under control .
We want to believe that it ’s possible to prevent all the difficulties and danger in our lives .
There ’s a fascinating book called The Black Swan , which talks about the ways in which we exaggerate our understanding of cause and effect , and pretend that unpredictable events are predictable .
The author speaks of such events as random .
I do n’t believe that the world is random .
But I do believe that the world is unpredictable , and will surprise us again and again , sometimes with difficulties , but often with wonder .
One Wish
Sometimes we get lost in wishing only for things , or pleasures , or honors .
And we all wish that the world would change according to our desires .
But the greatest wish of all is the wish to be a different sort of person , with different attitudes and thoughts .
When you wish to be a different person , and achieve that wish , your perception of the world changes .
Even if nothing changes in the world around you , you ’ll still be living in a different world .
But the world around you will also change .
When you act differently , you will influence people and the world to change .
Join me in a question and a wish .
Does each of us have the courage and honesty to live and enjoy life as a great journey through unknown territory ?
What would the world be like if each of us wished and took action to become that sort of person ?
First the bad news :
The print publishing industry as a whole is staring into a void .
Across the board , newsstand magazine sales are in a slump , subscriber numbers are down , and paper and postal costs continue to rise .
But it ’s not magazines like US Weekly or Vogue that you ’ll see disappearing from the newsstands — they have the parent companies and the resources to weather industry ill winds .
It ’s the small , independent magazines like Bitch that will disappear , because the odds are already stacked high against us .
And simply put :
We need to raise $ 40,000 by October 15th in order to print the next issue of Bitch .
Now the good news :
While it ’s true that $ 40,000 is a lot of money , we know the number of you Bitch supporters is in the hundreds of thousands .
And we ’re asking each of you who values independent , nonprofit media and intelligent feminist cultural analysis to contribute what you can to ensure that Bitch thrives .
And while we ca n’t say what form
Bitch will take in the future ( our direction will depend , in part , on your feedback ) , we can say that we ’ve been hard at work to find an innovative publishing model that will allow us to maintain the spirit and integrity of Bitch while also reflecting the changing world around us .
As a nonprofit , reader - funded media organization , our fate really is — and always will be — in your hands .
We do n’t need a parent company .
We just need you !

Feminist Response To Pop Culture
Save Bitch

Debbie :
We are coming to you from the Bitch headquarters in Portland , Oregon to share some bad news that we ’re hoping you ’ll help us out with .
We ’re holding here the current issue of Bitch that was just released a couple weeks ago , and this issue might be the last issue .
Andi :
The fact is , we need to raise $ 40,000 by October 15th .
D : And we know that sounds like a lot of money , and it is a lot of money , but that is about the cost of producing one issue of Bitch .
( music )
A : We were going to tell you about the minutia of the publishing industry and how that consistently impacts Bitch in a negative way .
( music cuts out )
D : But the important thing is that you know that in every step of the way in the magazine publishing world , Bitch , as a small publication , as an independent publication , and as a feminist publication is at a disadvantage .
And everybody probably knows by now that the magazine industry is declining .
Bitch has been lucky to fly in the face of those trends for quite some time now , but we are finally seeing those trends affecting us .
And so your support as donors is more critical than ever .
A lot of people do n’t realize that we are a non-profit and that we depend heavily on donations from our supporters , and a lot of people also do n’t realize that the bulk of those donations come in the form of $ 10 , $ 20 , and $ 30 .
So , any amount helps .
A : You know , if you have a lot to donate , that would be fantastic , we would never turn that down .
D : When we became aware of this financial crunch , we sat around in our staff meeting and brainstormed different ways to share the news with our supporters .
A : We thought about highlighting the many fine magazines that in the past year or two have folded because much like us , they are in a constant state of financial precariousness .
[ Shows magazines that have folded : Punk Planet , Clamor , No Compromise , Stay Free , LiP , Herbivore ]
We also thought about just having our staff dogs sitting here on the coach , and focusing only on the staff dogs and their sad puppy eyes to get you to give us money .
[ Picture of staff dogs , “ We needz ur dollarz 2save Bitch ” ]
D : What we decided to do instead , to keep this campaign really transparent and hopefully to motivate people to keep checking back and spread the word is to make a thermometer in the shape of a wiener dog .
A : And then of course we came up with all sorts of wiener related puns like , “ Help our wiener grow , ” “ Our wiener needs to get much bigger … ”
D : “ Feed the bitch to save Bitch ”
[ Bark bark ]
A : “ Wiener people going to realize that independent magazines need money ? ! ”
[ laughter ]
A : The wiener dog graphic is very cute though , so if you can , get to the website and check it out , you ’ll not only hear a lot more about the details of this particular situation and why we need your help , but you will get to see that very cute graphic and in fact , help the wiener dog grow .
( music plays )
A : So subscribe
D : Donate
A : Support
D : Keep Bitch alive .
A : Thank you .
D : We love you .
[ Laughter ]
D : It always goes back to the love .

I just got an interesting email . . . saying this :
OK , you all know that I almost never send out mass emails .
But I personally know this woman ; she 's a classics and Italian professor at UCSC , and I admire her greatly , and absolutely trust her integrity .
So I firmly believe that this story is true .
And it 's scary .
Pass it along .
MY HOLIDAY WITH JOHN McCAINIt was just before John McCain 's last run at the presidential nomination in 2000 that my husband and I vacationed in Turtle Island in Fiji with John McCain , Cindy , and their children , including Bridget ( their adopted Bangladeshi child ) .
It was not our intention , but it was our misfortune to be in close quarters with John McCain for almost a week , since Turtle Island has a small number of bungalows and their focus on communal meals force all vacationers who are there at the same time to get to know each other intimately .
He arrived at our first group meal and started reading quotes from a pile of William Faulkner books with a forest of Post - Its sticking out of them .
As an English Literature major myself , my first thought was " if he likes this so much , why has n't he memorized any of this yet ?
" I soon realized that McCain actually thought we had come on vacation to be a volunteer audience for his " readings " which then became a regular part of each meal .
Out of politeness , none of the vacationers initially protested at this intrusion into their blissful holiday , but people 's buttons definitely got pushed as the readings continued day after day .
Unfortunately this was not his only contribution to our mealtime entertainment .
He waxed on during one meal about how Indo - Chine women had the best figures and that our American corn - fed women just could n't meet up to this standard .
He also made it a point that all of us should stop Cindy from having dessert as her weight was too high and made a few comments to Amy , the 25 year old wife of the honeymooning couple from Nebraska that she should eat less as she needed to lose weight .
McCain 's appreciation of the beauty of Asian women was so great that David the American economist had to move his Thai wife to the other side of the table from McCain as McCain kept aggressively flirting with and touching her .
Needless to say I was irritated at his large ego and his rude behavior towards his wife and other women , but decided he must have some redeeming qualities as he had adopted a handicapped child from Bangladesh .
I asked him about this one day , and his response was shocking : " Oh , that was Cindy 's idea - I did n't have anything to do with it .
She just went and adopted this thing without even asking me .
You can't imagine how people stare when I wheel this ugly , black thing around in a shopping cart in Arizona .
No , it was n't my idea at all .
" I actively avoided McCain after that , but unfortunately one day he engaged me in a political discussion which soon got us on the topic of the active US bombing of Iraq at that time .
I was shocked when he said , " If I was in charge , I would nuke Iraq to teach them a lesson " .
Given McCain 's personal experience with the horrors of war , I had expected a more balanced point of view .
I commented on the tragic consequences of the nuclear attacks on Japan during WWII -- but no , he was not to be dissuaded .
He went on to say that if it was up to him he would have dropped many more nuclear bombs on Japan .
I rapidly extricated myself from this conversation as I could tell that his experience being tortured as a POW did n't seem to have mellowed out his perspective , but rather had made him more aggressive and vengeful towards the world .
My final encounter with McCain was on the morning that he was leaving Turtle Island .
Amy and I were happily eating pancakes when McCain arrived and told Amy that she should n't be having pancakes because she needed to lose weight .
Amy burst into tears at this abusive comment .
I felt fiercely protective of Amy and immediately turned to McCain and told him to leave her alone .
He became very angry and abusive towards me , and said , " Do n't you know who I am . "
I looked him in the face and said , " Yes , you are the biggest asshole I have ever met " and headed back to my cabin .
I am happy to say that later that day when I arrived at lunch I was given a standing ovation by all the guests for having stood up to McCain 's bullying .
Although I have shared my McCain story informally with friends , this is the first time I am making this public .
I almost did so in 2000 , when McCain first announced his bid for the Republican nomination , but it soon became apparent that George Bush was the shoo - in candidate and so I did not act then .
However , now that there is a very real possibility that McCain could be elected as our next president , I feel it is my duty as an American citizen to share this story .
I can't imagine a more scary outcome for America than that this abusive , aggressive man should lead our nation .
I have observed him in intimate surroundings as he really is , not how the media portrays him to be .
If his attitudes toward women and his treatment of his own family are even a small indicator of his real personality , then I shudder to think what will happen to America were he to be elected as our President .

ABC NEWS POLL : NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING AMERICANS IS LIPSTICK
Satire by R J Shulman
NEW YORK ( PTSD News ) -
Win the lipstick wars and win the Presidency - that seems to be what the latest polls are indicating .
A new ABC News poll shows that Americans are so concerned with this issue , that whichever Presidential ticket has the best solution to the lipstick crisis will win in November .
 I am the real candidate who can bring change and hope to the lipstick problem ,  John McCain told a crown in Flint , Michigan a key swing state .
Meanwhile , vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is trying to overcome rumors that she attempted to get her former brother - in - law , Scott Wooten fired from the Alaska State Police because he had criticized Palins sisters use of lipstick .
The McCain campaign has been heavily critical of the medias focus on the lipstick use in the Palin family .
 It is none of Americas business whether the lipstick was used by Sarah Palin or her daughter or whether Sarah Palins religious beliefs prevented her teenage daughter from taking the proper precautions before using lipstick ,  said Rick Davis , McCain campaign manager .
Barack Obama is set to rush release his new book called The Audacity of Lipstick in which he states that he has always been opposed to the excessive use of lipstick and sets forth his a plan to solve this crisis , a plan he hopes with be on the minds and lips of the American voter come November .
Meanwhile , Joe Biden is attempting to answer criticism leveled at him from the McCain camp that he is woefully out of touch with the American voter as he is the only candidate who has not even mentioned lipstick once .
Biden finally addressed the issue , telling reporters , we have to stop our dependence on foreign lipstick , especially our dependence on the French . 
Linda Connors of the National Organization for Women has weighed in on the lipstick issue saying , our society is sexist because there is no pressure for a man to wear lipstick , but a woman has either too little lipstick and doesnt get noticed or she has too much and is called a slut . 
Condoleezza
Rice just back from her trip to the Middle East said that the terrorist are planning attacks on American because ,  they hate us for our lipstick . 
President Bush commented ,  I am well in the awareness of a lipstick crisis , because whenever I try and speechicate to the American people , my lips stick on the big words , like nucular . 
The lipstick crisis has already taken its toll as Helene Curtis , a leading lipstick manufacturer on the verge of bankruptcy , has just been taken over by the federal government .
 We cannot afford to have such a venerable institution like Helene Curtis fail simply because of their high exposure to selling sub - prime lipstick ,  a government official said .
 This issue is not about lipstick ,  Ralph Nader said , it is about a pig being a pig , even if lipstick has been applied to that pig . 
Sally Fineburg of PETA agreed ,  Pigs are in danger of being mistreated to such an extent by these politicians that they are going to become an endangered species . 
Trevor Markham of the Rand Institute disagreed ,  there will always be pork in Washington . 
The ABC poll said lipstick was the most important issue for Americans by more than a five - to - one margin over the economy , the war in Iraq , healthcare , the energy crisis and global warming .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 100 points .

PARIS  A coded French diplomatic cable leaked to a French newspaper quotes the British ambassador in Afghanistan as predicting that the NATO - led military campaign against the Taliban will fail .
That was not all .
The best solution for the country , the ambassador said , would be installing an “ acceptable dictator , ” according to the newspaper .
“ The current situation is bad , the security situation is getting worse , so is corruption , and the government has lost all trust , ” the British envoy , Sherard Cowper - Coles , was quoted as saying by the author of the cable , François Fitou , the French deputy ambassador to Kabul .
The two - page cable  which was sent to the Élysée Palace and the French Foreign Ministry on Sept. 2 , and was leaked to the investigative and satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné , which printed excerpts in its Wednesday issue  said that the NATO - led military presence was making it harder to stabilize the country .
“ The presence of the coalition , in particular its military presence , is part of the problem , not part of its solution , ” Sir Sherard was quoted as saying .
“ Foreign forces are the lifeline of a regime that would rapidly collapse without them .
As such , they slow down and complicate a possible emergence from the crisis . ”
( Adds new U.S. jobs data , comment from NY governor )
NEW YORK , Sept 15 ( Reuters ) -
The imminent disappearance of major investment banks Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.
N presents a double - barreled hit to an already wounded job market and will likely depress salaries on Wall Street .
Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection after frantic attempts to find a rescuer failed on Sunday , while Merrill Lynch agreed to be taken over by Bank of America Corp BAC.N .
Headhunters and consultants said the U.S. financial services sector , already suffering from a glut of unemployed talent after shedding more than 100,000 jobs this year , must now brace for up to 50,000 more job losses .
“ The resume flow will start on Monday like there ’s no tomorrow , ” said Michael Karp , chief executive at executive search and consulting firm Options Group in New York .
“ This is seriously going to impact compensation this year , across the Street and all over the world as well , ” he said .
" The golden years of compensation in the financial services industry are over , and it does n't help with the Bear Stearns people still looking for work . "
Bear Stearns agreed in March to a takeover by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N .
Bank of America , the second - largest U.S. bank , agreed to buy Merrill in an all - stock deal worth $ 50 billion , as the world ’s largest retail brokerage sought refuge from fears that it could be the next victim .

The takeover would make Bank of America the top U.S. bank , and would likely put 40 percent , or about 24,000 , of Merrill ’s 60,000 non-broker employees worldwide out of work , said Gustavo Dolfino , president at New York - based recruiting firm WhiteRock .
That , combined with Lehman ’s approximately 26,000 workers , will send shockwaves through the job market .
Global outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas said on Monday the U.S. financial sector has shed nearly 103,000 jobs this year , and could now surpass the record 153,105 job cuts announced in 2007 .
‘ BEGGARS , NOT CHOOSERS ’
The Lehman and Merrill situations will also squeeze New York City , which relies heavily on the financial services industry .
“ Some of these professionals are not going to get what they usually get because they ’re beggars , not choosers , and they ’re competing with others , ” Dolfino said , adding that there will be “ a lot less money for the state and the federal government . ”
“ We ’re going to ride it out , but what it truly means for the tax base is that the government will have no option than to raise taxes , ” he said .
Although Wall Street is not New York ’s biggest employer , it is the city ’s economic anchor .
Each financial - sector worker is believed to create as many as four other New York jobs , due to their high salaries .
On Monday , New York State Governor David Paterson said Wall Street might lay off 30,000 workers in the worst case scenario , following the Lehman and Merrill news .
He added that the impact might not be known for years .
The credit crunch has led to deficits in both the city and state budgets .
Democratic City Comptroller William Thompson said last week he was “ very concerned ” about the resolution of the Lehman saga , and warned it would cut into New York ’s economy and tax revenues .
Lehman staffers in Europe , where the investment bank employs around 6,000 people , also feared for their jobs .
Global stock markets fell sharply on Monday , sparking concerns that other financial companies with exposure to subprime - related assets could be pushed to the brink .
The recruiters said the job losses would drive even more talent to the buy - side and abroad , despite the global economic slowdown , which was spawned by the breakdown in the U.S. subprime mortgage market last year .
Karp said “ hedge funds , money managers and family offices ” should benefit from the job losses at Lehman and Merrill .
Dolfino pointed to the Middle East and Russia as regions hungry for U.S. financial professionals : “ The demand is on the buy - side and it ’s international and it ’s opportunistic , ” he said .

Whenever I tune into CNBC , I ’m usually blown away with the raw amount of data thrown at me .
For the average person , there ’s no way to separate what ’s useful from what is n’t , so people often rely on the pundits to tell them .
I ’d prefer not to do that – I know from my experiences in following politics obsessively that pundits rarely are telling the whole truth and are often not all that well informed .
So I ’ve taken to trying to understand the basics of this data myself , and I ’ve figured out one big truth : most of what you actually need to know , you can figure out pretty quickly .
Let me show you what I mean .
Quite often on those television shows and stock analysis magazines and websites , you ’ll see complex graphs showing the ups and downs of a particular stock price or stock index .
You ’ll see something that looks sort of like this :
What ’s pictured above is a screen capture from Yahoo !
Finance ’s chart of Google ’s stock price over its history .
It ’s a nice little picture that shows it going steadily up until about the start of 2008 , then dropping a little .
Stock pundits love these kinds of graphs .
Not only do they look pretty cool , there ’s a lot of data compressed in there .
Even more important , many stock pundits believe that you can use this history to predict where the stock is going to go .
That predictive process is known as technical analysis , and people have debated for years over whether it actually works .
Technical analysis basically says that you can look at patterns in the past behavior of a stock – combined with basic tenets of human behavior – and predict where the stock is going .
Here ’s an example of one tenet of technical analysis ( if you ’re really interested , the Wikipedia article on technical analysis is a killer read ) .
According to technicians , over short periods of time , a stock often has a “ level of support ” and a “ level of resistance . ” A “ level of support ” is a price that a stock simply can’t seem to drop below , while a “ level of resistance ” is a price that a stock simply can’t seem to break through .
This will usually hold true for some period of time until an exceptional piece of information comes along pushing the stock over the resistance or under the support , at which point new lines form .
Here ’s an example on the Google stock graph from above :
Line A represents a line of resistance , Google ’s first one .
It had a hard time bursting through that line from the IPO in August 2004 to roughly April 2005 , when Google kept pumping out unbelievable growth numbers .
At that point , it broke through that resistance line and hit another resistance line ( line B ) until roughly November 2005 , at which continued amazing numbers caused that line to give way .
Interestingly , after that crossing , line B became the “ level of support ” for Google and still holds until today .
The new level of resistance seems to be line C – around 725 .
Seems simple and reasonable , right ?
And you can obviously see how people could make money from this .
If you can identify a level of resistance , just put in a long - standing order to buy that company ’s stock if it crosses that level , because you ’re likely buying it at a new level of resistance , meaning you ’re going to profit .
If the price was floating around A , for example , as it was in early 2005 , if you had put in a buy order to buy at about 210 , you would have made money when it crossed that level of resistance .
Similarly , if you put in a buy order for when it crosses line B at about 330 , you would have again made money .
It makes sense if you look at a clear - cut example like that , but let ’s throw in a line D to show why this is n’t all cut and dried :
That D line ( with a Google stock value of about 570 or so ) makes sense as a level of resistance up through October 2007 , at which it bursts through .
If you had set up a buy order – telling your broker to buy Google if it crosses 570 – you would have been very happy up until about February , when Google peaked at somewhere over 700 .
But then everything goes to disaster .
It quickly drops back below that supposed level of resistance , stays roughly there for a while , then begins to drop even more in July , finishing this chart just below 400 .
So , why did that happen ?
Obviously , the late drop was due to the ongoing economic crisis of 2008 , but that itself shows a problem with technical analysis : major events often cause such analysis to go haywire .
Also , past performance is never a guarantee of future results .
Just because a person is able to identify some sort of pattern in the historical data does n’t mean any of it ’s going to hold tomorrow .
Take , for example , the recent debacle with Apple .
A false rumor about Steve Jobs having a heart attack caused the stock price to drop to a 17 month low ( a 5.4 % drop ) very suddenly .
Imagine , if you will , if Jobs actually had passed away .
It ’s an event that no technical analysis could predict – it only deals well with long - term patterns in very stable companies .
In short , technical analysis is a great thing for a stock pundit to show off , but in many ways it ’s a lot like reading tea leaves .
You can see patterns in there , but identifying the meaning of those patterns and what they portend to the future is much more of an art than a science .
So , how can I read a stock chart in five seconds ?
Now that it ’s pretty clear why pundits like those stock charts , what can you get out of such charts in the five seconds they ’re up on the screen on CNBC ?
This is , of course , assuming you ’re following the basic idea of only owning stocks in companies you know and believe in and have a specific reason for owning that has nothing to do with the stock price – which is a very good way to invest .
It ’s the way Peter Lynch suggests in his excellent book One Up on Wall Street , for starters , and is also described in many other stock investing books .
First , look at the general trend over the last six months or so .
This is usually a clue as to the general health of the company – no major news , just little signs of good health or poor health .
If it ’s a stock you own or might be interested in , you may want to take note of a steady rise or a steady fall and find out why it ’s happening .
Second , look for recent spikes .
A big spike upwards or downwards means something significant has happened to the company .
These are usually game changers and are definitely worth noting .
Third , see if they throw up charts for similar companies .
See if the general pattern of the stock in question matches the general patterns of the competitors .
If they do , then it ’s probably a broad market effect or a sector effect and not quite as worrisome as something drastically different than a competitor , which you should look into .
What these three things point you towards are signs that something has changed in the company – something that might violate the reasons you own the stock .
As I ’ve said many times , you should only own an individual stock if you have a specific reason for doing so .
You trust the CEO .
They deliver a stellar product .
Their product has some sort of inherent advantage over the competition .
Each of those changes , which you can quickly pull out of a chart , is simply a sign that you need to investigate the stock you hold in more detail to make sure the reason you have for owning the stock is still intact .
Unless you ’re investing professionally or doing it as a serious and focused hobby , there ’s not much else you can really get out of a glance at a graph , so do n’t let yourself get overloaded with data .
Just look for the important events , the ones that would change your opinion of the company or how it does business .
Leave the rest to the people who do this eighty hours a week .
Or , better yet , do what I do : follow individual stocks for fun and learning and keep your real investments in index funds .
That ’s the route suggested by an army of experts , including Warren Buffett , and it ’s the route I ’m following .
