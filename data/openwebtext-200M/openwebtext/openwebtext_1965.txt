Artificial trees mimic one of the greatest carbon capturers on earth
In 2006 , more than 29 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was pumped into the atmosphere .
And 80 % of the world 's energy supply still relies on fossil fuels .
New York resident and geo-physicist Professor Klaus Lackner thinks he may have found a way of tackling our current excessive use of fossil fuels .
He has designed a synthetic tree , a construction that mimics the function of natural trees whereby leaves pull carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) out of the air as it flows over them .
The CO2 removed from the atmosphere in this way , he believes , could be stored deep underground both safely and permanently .
But even though Professor Lackner only advocates the use of these artificial trees as a way of giving the world some time to come up with alternative , " carbon - neutral " energy sources , how effective would they be in offsetting greenhouse emissions ?
Synthetic leaves
" Just like a real tree , an artificial tree would have a structure to hold it up - the equivalent of a trunk , probably a pillar , " explains the professor .
" You would find the equivalent of branches which hold up the leaves . "
Unlike in a real tree , he explains , where the leaves are spread out because they have to see sunshine for the purpose of photosynthesis , the leaves on an artificial tree could be packed much more tightly .
Professor Lackner estimates that every tree would remove 90,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year
It was Professor Lackner 's teenage daughter Claire who gave him the inspiration to tackle CO2 in the atmosphere , when she was looking for a school science project .
Claire showed she could actually pull carbon dioxide out of the air by blowing it through a solution of sodium hydroxide .
Overnight , she had collected half of the CO2 from the air blown through the solution .
When CO2 comes into contact with sodium hydroxide , it is absorbed , producing a liquid solution of sodium carbonate .
It is that liquid solution that the professor believes could be piped away , and the time at which the CO2 could be recovered as a concentrated gas in preparation for its final storage .
Nature , of course , has its own way of storing carbon .
Would people be happy to look at fields of artificial trees ?
Todd Forrest , vice president for horticulture at the New York Botanical Gardens , describes trees as " wonderful carbon sinks " and thinks Professor Lackner 's proposals are worth investigating , providing the technology is proven .
His vision is to have thousands of artificial trees and estimates that every single one would remove 90,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year - the equivalent emissions of 20,000 cars .
But even if this is possible , could the CO2 collected be stored away forever ?
Locked away
Using existing oil drilling technology , channels thousands of metres deep would be bored into the sea bed .
Carbon dioxide gas would be injected into the sea bed
At this depth and low temperature , the carbon dioxide is denser than water , locking it in place .
" It can not rise from there to the ocean floor , " says Professor Lackner , " so it puts it away literally for millions of years . "
It is going to take a great sea change in lifestyles to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to a manageable level .
The growing number of scientists and engineers proposing large - scale geo-engineering projects to combat these emissions say they are reluctant advocates .
Their hope is that humanity will look for and find other carbon - neutral energy sources soon , so that we do not need to resort to such dramatic and intrusive technological interventions .
Five Ways To Save The World was broadcast on Monday 19 February 2007 , at 2100 GMT on BBC Two .
ONE evening a week after the Dorm Dive , a group of about 20 freegans gathered in a sparely furnished , harshly lit basement apartment in Bushwick , Brooklyn , to hold a feast .
It was an egalitarian affair with no one officially in charge , but Mr. Weissman projected authority , his blue custodian - style work pants and fuzzy black beard giving him the air of a Latin American revolutionary as he wandered around , trailed by a Korean television crew .
Ms. Kalish stood over the sink , slicing vegetables for a stir - fry with a knife she had found in a trash bin at N.Y.U. A pot of potatoes simmered on the stove .
These , like much of the rest of the meal , had been gathered two nights earlier , when Mr. Weissman , Ms. Kalish and others had met in front of a Food Emporium in Manhattan and rummaged through the store ’s clear garbage bags .
The haul had been astonishing in its variety : sealed bags of organic vegetable medley , bagged salad , heirloom tomatoes , key limes , three packaged strawberries - and - chocolate - dip kits , carrots , asparagus , grapes , a carton of organic soy milk ( expiration date : July 9 ) , grapefruit , mushrooms and , for those willing to partake , vacuum - packed herb turkey breast .
( Some freegans who avoid meat will nevertheless eat it rather than see it go to waste . )
As operatic music played on a radio , people mingled and pitched in .
One woman diced onions , rescuing pieces that fell on floor .
Another , who goes by the name Petal , emptied bags of salad into a pan .
As rigorous and radical as the freegan world view can be , there is also something quaint about the movement , at least the version that Mr. Weissman promotes , with its embrace of hippie-ish communal activities and its household get - togethers that rely for diversion on conversation rather electronic entertainment .
Making things last is part of the ethos .
Christian Gutierrez , a 33 - year - old former model and investment banker , sat at the small kitchen table , chatting .
Mr. Gutierrez , who quit his banking job at Matthews Morris & Company in 2004 to pursue filmmaking , became a freegan last year , and opened a free workshop on West 36th Street in Manhattan to teach bicycle repair .
He plans to add lessons in fixing home computers in the near future .
Mr. Gutierrez ’s lifestyle , like Ms. Nelson ’s , became gradually more constricted in the absence of a steady income .
He lived in a Midtown loft until last year , when , he said , he got into a legal battle with his landlord over a rent increase — a relationship “ ruined by greed , ” he said .
After that , he lived in his van for a while , then found an illegal squat in SoHo , which he shares with two others .
Mr. Gutierrez had a middle - class upbringing in Dallas , and he said he initially found freeganism off - putting .
But now he is steadfastly devoted to the way of life .
As people began to load plates of food , he leaned in and offered a few words of wisdom : “ Opening that first bag of trash , ” he said , “ is the biggest step . ”
Bush Visits Top Secret National Security Agency
The president visited the NSA and pushed for a better surveillance program .
Sept. 19 , 2007  -- President Bush urged Congress to broaden surveillance activities and make the new eavesdropping law permanent after a visit to the National Security Agency .
Passed by Congress in August , the Protect America
Act was a temporary fix to the eavesdropping law and will expire in February .
" The problem is the law expires on Feb. 1 -- that 's 135 days from today .
The threat from al Qaeda is not going to expire in 135 days , " Bush said , flanked by Vice President Cheney , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend , and NSA Director Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander .
The president argued the 30 - year - old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) is " dangerously out of date " and new technologies like disposable cell phones and the Internet are n't taken into consideration within its provisions .
Bush argued for more tools in the intelligence community to protect America from another attack .
" Without these tools , it will be harder to figure out what our enemies are doing to train , recruit and infiltrate operatives into America , " Bush said .
" Without these tools our country will be much more vulnerable to attack . "
Bush put pressure on Congress saying , " The decisions Congress makes will directly affect our ability to save American lives . "
In support of updating the law , Bush said , " Unfortunately , some in Congress now want to restrict the tools .
These restrictions would impede the flow of information that helps us protect our people .
These restrictions would reopen gaps in our intelligence that we had just closed . "
However , many members of Congress and civil liberties groups do n't agree with new changes in FISA because they believe the law impedes citizens ' privacy .
The timing of the president 's visit to the NSA comes as hearings on FISA are being held on Capitol Hill with the Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell testifying Tuesday
" 9/11 should have and could have been prevented .
It was an issue of connecting information that was available , " McConnell said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday .
The plant - eater 's skeleton came complete with fossilised leaves
It would have measured at least 32 m ( 105 ft ) in length , making it one of the biggest dinosaurs ever found , Argentine and Brazilian palaeontologists say .
The skeleton showed signs that its owner had been eaten by predators .
The excavation site in Argentina has yielded a series of specimens since the first fossils were found there in 2000 .
It 's like a whole lost world for us
Alexander Kellner
National Museum
Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
The skeleton found in Patagonia appears to represent a previously unknown species because of the unique structure of its neck .
Its name derives from the Mapuche Indian words for " giant chief of the lizards " and for Duke Energy Argentina , a company which helped fund its excavation .
' Something fantastic '
" This is one of the biggest [ dinosaurs ] in the world and one of the most complete of these giants that exist , " said Jorge Calvo , director of the palaeontology centre at the National University of Comahue , Argentina .
Patagonia is rich in remains like this exposed dino spine
He is lead author of a study on the dinosaur published in the peer - reviewed Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences .
The dinosaur 's remains are thought to have washed into a river , creating a barrier that collected the remains of other now - fossilised animals , fish and even leaves found at the site .
Since the first bones were found on the banks of Lake Barreales in the Argentine province of Neuquen in 2000 , palaeontologists have dug up the dinosaur 's neck , back region , hips and the first vertebra of its tail .

" The accumulation of fish and leaf fossils , as well as other dinosaurs around the find , is just something fantastic .
Leaves and dinosaurs together is a great rarity .
It 's like a whole lost world for us . "
Researchers say the fossilised ecosystem points to a warm and humid climate in Patagonia , which had forests during the Late Cretaceous period .
The area is steppe - like now and almost bare of vegetation .
Thanks to Townhall.com and Walter Williams for this great description of the real role of modern government :
By Walter E. Williams , Feb 8 , 2006
Do people have a right to medical treatment whether or not they can pay ?
What about a right to food or decent housing ?
Would a U.S. Supreme Court justice hold that these are rights just like those enumerated in our Bill of Rights ?
In order to have any hope of coherently answering these questions , we have to decide what is a right .
The way our Constitution 's framers used the term , a right is something that exists simultaneously among people and imposes no obligation on another .
For example , the right to free speech , or freedom to travel , is something we all simultaneously possess .
My right to free speech or freedom to travel imposes no obligation upon another except that of non-interference .
In other words , my exercising my right to speech or travel requires absolutely nothing from you and in no way diminishes any of your rights .
Contrast that vision of a right to so - called rights to medical care , food or decent housing , independent of whether a person can pay .
Those are not rights in the sense that free speech and freedom of travel are rights .
If it is said that a person has rights to medical care , food and housing , and has no means of paying , how does he enjoy them ?
There 's no Santa Claus or Tooth Fairy who provides them .
You say , " The Congress provides for those rights . "
Not quite .
Congress does not have any resources of its very own .
The only way Congress can give one American something is to first , through the use of intimidation , threats and coercion , take it from another American .
So - called rights to medical care , food and decent housing impose an obligation on some other American who , through the tax code , must be denied his right to his earnings .
In other words , when Congress gives one American a right to something he did n't earn , it takes away the right of another American to something he did earn .
If this bogus concept of rights were applied to free speech rights and freedom to travel , my free speech rights would impose financial obligations on others to provide me with an auditorium and microphone .
My right to travel freely would require that the government take the earnings of others to provide me with airplane tickets and hotel accommodations .
Philosopher John Locke 's vision of natural law guided the founders of our nation .
Our Declaration of Independence expresses that vision , declaring , " We hold these Truths to be self - evident , that all Men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness . "
Government is necessary , but the only rights we can delegate to government are the ones we possess .
For example , we all have a natural right to defend ourselves against predators .
Since we possess that right , we can delegate authority to government to defend us .
By contrast , we do n't have a natural right to take the property of one person to give to another ; therefore , we cannot legitimately delegate such authority to government .
Three - fifths to two - thirds of the federal budget consists of taking property from one American and giving it to another .
Were a private person to do the same thing , we 'd call it theft .
When government does it , we euphemistically call it income redistribution , but that 's exactly what thieves do -- redistribute income .
Income redistribution not only betrays the founders ' vision , it 's a sin in the eyes of God .
I 'm guessing that when God gave Moses the Eighth Commandment , " Thou shalt not steal , " I 'm sure he did n't mean " thou shalt not steal unless there was a majority vote in Congress . "
The real tragedy for our nation is that any politician who holds the values of liberty that our founders held would be soundly defeated in today 's political arena .
Pres. Carter : US tortures prisoners , ' I know it '

Former president Jimmy Carter is n't just suspicious that the US is using torture to extract intelligence from detainees -- he 's absolutely convinced .
Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer if , by Carter 's definition of the word , the United States had used torture during the Bush administration , the Nobel Peace Prize winner was adamant :
" I do n't think it , I know it , " he said .
" Certainly . "
Pressed by Blitzer on whether that meant that President Bush was lying , Carter was equally clear .
" The president is self - defning what we have done and authorized in the torture of prisoners , " said Carter .
" Yes . "
Earlier in the interview , Carter said Bush 's denial this week that the US did not in fact torture detainees was " not an accurate statement if you use the international norms of torture as has always been honored in the last 60 years , since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated . "
" But you can make your own definition of human rights and say we do n't violate them , " he added , " and you can make your own defintion of torture and say we do n't violate them . "
Carter was equally outspoken in a Wednesday interview with the BBC , calling Vice President Dick Cheney a " disaster , " according to Reuters .
" He 's a militant who avoided any service of his own in the military , " he said of Cheney , adding that the vice president " has been most forceful in the last 10 years or more in fulfilling some of his more ancient commitments that the United States has a right to inject its power through military means in other parts of the world . "
" You know he 's been a disaster for our country , " Carter continued .
" I think he 's been overly persuasive on President George Bush and quite often he 's prevailed . "

The body 's ability to produce insulin could be enhanced through targeting a newly discovered molecule , helping to fight diabetes , according to research published today in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
The molecule , described by researchers from Imperial College London and INSERM U145 and EMI 0363 in France , is a microRNA known as miR124 .
The researchers found that miR124 inhibits the production of insulin in the pancreas .
It does this by controlling how several genes are expressed in the body ’s beta cells , which secrete insulin .
Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose and if the body produces insufficient insulin this can cause diabetes .
The researchers believe that if drugs could be developed to suppress the action of miR124 , and related microRNAs , in those with diabetes , this could enable more insulin to be produced , helping to combat the condition .
DNA encodes proteins via an intermediate messenger known as RNA , which is then ' translated ' to create different proteins .
MicroRNAs bind to and inhibit the translation of selected messenger RNAs .
They block the synthesis of the encoded proteins and this interferes with processes carried out by cells .
Synthetic molecules known as antagomirs can inactivate microRNAs and scientists are hopeful that they might one day be able to harness their properties to switch off selected microRNAs , including miR124 .
The researchers are also keen to understand whether variations , or " polymorphisms " , exist in the gene that encodes miR124 , predisposing certain individuals to diabetes .
Professor Guy Rutter , from the Division of Medicine at Imperial College London and one of the authors of the research , said : " Scientists only discovered the importance of microRNAs a few years ago .
Discovering that this particular microRNA plays a fundamental role in the control of insulin production is exciting , and may allow us to develop new tools to treat diabetes .
Such findings may be useful in the fight against a disease which affects more than 5 % of the population and whose incidence is growing yearly . "
This research was funded by The Wellcome Trust , the Medical Research Council and INSERM .

They do not believe in peace talks .
They do not want to share the land .
They are well armed and are carrying out increasingly violent attacks , even targeting innocent civilians .
They are members of Israel 's militant far right , and they are threatening to become Israel 's next big problem . ( more ) »
In " Israel 's Next War ? " FRONTLINE goes deep inside the world of militant Jewish radicals who pose a grave new threat to Israeli security and , potentially , to the region .
" The dream of these extremists " — to blow up the Temple Mount in Jerusalem , one of the most important holy sites in the Muslim world — " should give us sleepless nights , " says former Israeli Security Chief Avi Dichter .
" Jewish terror is liable to create a serious strategic threat that will turn the Israeli - Palestinian conflict into a conflict between thirteen million Jews and a billion Muslims all over the world . "
In " Israel 's Next War ? " FRONTLINE profiles two young men— Shlomo Dvir and Yarden Morag — who planned to set off a bomb at a Palestinian girls school just as hundreds of young students arrived in the morning .
The timing was carefully designed to harm as many children as possible .
" It was my idea , " says Shlomo Dvir in an exclusive interview from an Israeli prison .
" Whoever gets hurt , gets hurt . "
Most Israelis reacted with shock and horror when Dvir and Morag 's plan was revealed — but a small minority refused to condemn them .
Dvir and Morag 's bomb never went off — an Israeli policeman lucked onto their plot at the last minute — and the investigation led Israeli security officials to an underground of other radical settlers who helped with this attack and others .
These settlers are part of a much larger group of far rightists in Israel — the Kahanists , who are members of Kach , the outlawed party of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane , who rose to prominence in the 1980s with his message that nothing short of the expulsion of all Arabs from Jewish land will guarantee Israeli security .
" There are certain conditions , according to Jewish law , under which non-Jews may live here , " says Shmuel ben Yishai , an Israeli settler in Hebron .
" This does n't apply to the Arabs , they do n't fit the category .
They have to get the hell out ! "
" At a time when most in Israel are hoping for a fresh opportunity for peace with the Palestinians , a rift is developing between the extremists and the rest of the Israeli people , " says producer Dan Setton .
" And that rift will only grow if the extremists find a wider audience for their message . "
Right now , while some among the settlers might be sympathetic , relatively few are willing to act .
Still , the security services are worried .
" The phenomena that we 're talking about are not on the fringe , " says Yitzhak Dar , head of the Jewish section of the Israeli security service .
" The glue that holds them together is ideology .
It 's a very , very dangerous ideology … .
When they try to put it into action , through the murder of the prime minister , through the murder of the Arabs , through the massacre at the Hebron Mosque , it 's the beginning of the end of a system that can defend itself . "
Among the extremists , there is a feeling of persecution by the Israeli government .
" I think the government is mainly afraid of us because we represent an alternative , " says Noam Federman , a prominent Kahanist who trained some of the school bomb plotters on how to withstand interrogation from Israeli police .
" We basically explain the Arab problem as Rabbi Kahane saw it .
We say this should be a Jewish country and I think that 's what threatens them . "
Mike Guzofsky , a transplanted New Yorker and leading Kahanist , is convinced that the very people who are now painted as extremists will one day be viewed as heroes .
" I think the day will come when the secret service and the government will look for Jews who are willing to risk their lives and go into Arab villages and kick them out , kill them … and we have thousands of civilians with the military know - how to instigate a mega - attack against Arabs . "

How to Not Catch Terrorists
Data mining for terrorists :
It ’s an idea that just wo n’t die .
But it wo n’t find any terrorists , it puts us at greater risk of crimes like identity theft , and it gives the police far too much power in a free society .
The first massive government program to collect dossiers on every American for data mining purposes was called Total Information Awareness .
The public found the idea so abhorrent , and objected so forcefully , that Congress killed funding for the program in September 2003 .
But data mining is like a hydra–chop one head off , two more grow in its place .
In May 2004 , the General Accounting Office published a report that listed 122 different federal government data mining programs that used people ’s personal information .
That did n’t include classified military programs like Tangram , or state - run programs like MATRIX .
Now TIA is back with yet another name : Analysis , Dissemination , Visualization , Insight and Semantic Enhancement , or ADVISE .
“ It ’s an experiment to see how you can better analyze data that you already have , that you ’ve already legally collected , to see if you can understand it , sort it and make use of it more readily than simply doing it manually , ” Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff told the Associated Press this month .
The names change , but the basic idea remains the same : suck up as much data as possible about everyone , sift through it with massive computers , and investigate patterns that might indicate terrorist plots .
It ’s a compelling idea , but it ’s wrong .
We ’re not going to find terrorist plots through data mining , and we ’re going to waste valuable resources chasing down false alarms .
Used properly , data mining is a great tool .
As a result of data mining , AT&T reduces the costs of cell phone fraud , Amazon.com shows me books I might want to buy , and Google shows me advertising I ’m more likely to be interested in .
But it only works when there ’s ( 1 ) a reasonable percentage of attacks per year , ( 2 ) a well - defined profile to search for , and ( 3 ) and a low cost of false alarms .
Look at one of data mining ’s success stories : credit card fraud .
All credit card companies data mine their transaction databases , looking for spending patterns that indicate a stolen card .
About 1 % of cards are stolen and fraudulently used each year in the U.S. ; that ’s enough of a population to make searching for them effective .
There are also common fraud patterns that can be computed from that data , and they ’re easy to search for .
Additionally , the cost of a false alarm is only a phone call to the cardholder asking him to verify a couple of purchases .
Cardholders do n’t even resent these phone calls–as long as they ’re not too frequent–so the cost is just a few minutes of operator time .
Terrorist plots are different .
First , attacks are very rare .
This means that even very accurate systems will be so flooded with false alarms that they will be useless : millions of false alarms for every one real attack , even assuming unrealistically accurate systems .
Let ’s look at some numbers .
Assume an unrealistically optimistic system with a 1 - in - 100 false positive rate ( 99 % accurate ) , and a 1 - in - 1,000 false negative rate ( 99.9 % accurate ) .
That is , while it will mistakenly classify something innocent as a terrorist plot one in a hundred times , it will only miss a real terrorist plot one in a thousand times .
Assume one billion possible “ plots ” to sift through per year , about four per American citizen , and that there is one actual terrorist plot per year .
Even this unrealistically accurate system will generate 10 million false alarms for every real terrorist plot it uncovers .
Every day of every year , the police will have to investigate 270,000 potential plots in order to find the one real terrorist plot per month .
In statistics , it ’s called the “ base rate fallacy , ” and it applies in other domains as well .
For example , even highly accurate medical tests are useless as diagnostic tools if the incidence of the disease is rare in the general population .
Terrorist attacks are also rare , so any “ test ” is going to result in an endless stream of false alarms .
Second , there is no well defined terrorist profile .
In hindsight , it was easy to connect the Sept. 11 , 2001 dots and point to the warning signs , but it ’s much harder to do so before the fact .
Certainly , there are common warning signs that many terrorist plots share , but they share them with non-terrorist events as well .
We live in a “ six degrees of separation ” world , where everyone is connected .
Add in the problems of sleeper cells , loner terrorists like the Unabomber , and billions of perfectly innocent plots like surprise birthday parties and corporate takeovers , and you have an impossible problem .
And third , the cost of these false alarms is enormous .
It ’s not just the cost of the FBI agents running around chasing dead - end leads instead of doing things that might actually make us safer , but also the cost in civil liberties .
The fundamental freedoms that make our country the envy of the world are valuable , and not something that we should throw away lightly .
There is something un-American about a government program that uses secret criteria to collect dossiers on innocent people and shares that information with various agencies , all without any oversight .
It ’s the sort of thing you ’d have expected from the former Soviet Union or East Germany , or modern - day China .
Finding terrorism plots is not a problem that lends itself to data mining .
It ’s a needle - in - a - haystack problem , and throwing more hay on the pile does n’t make the problem any easier .
Real security comes from old - fashioned investigative work : putting people in charge of investigating potential plots and letting them direct the computers , instead of putting the computers in charge and letting them decide who should be investigated .
It ’s what caught the London liquid bombers last summer , and it ’s our best hope for our own security in the future .

Colorado Supreme Court ruled today that the ballot measure to define the " egg as person " was not deceptive in purpose .
In a terse 7 - 0 decision today , the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the state Title Board 's approval of a 2008 proposed ballot measure to bestow constitutional rights on fertilized human eggs .
Seven reproductive health advocates filed a legal challenge in August 2007 arguing that the ballot measure authored by Colorado for Equal Rights and approved by the all - male state Title Board did not meet the state 's single - subject issue rule and was deceptive in its purpose .
The Court disagreed with the plaintiffs and affirmed the Title Board 's action for proposed Initiative 36 which reads :
Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution defining the term " person " to include any human being from the moment of fertilization as " person " is used in those provisions of the Colorado constitution relating to inalienable rights , equality of justice , and due process of law ?

However , in press accounts , Colorado for Equal Rights spokesman Mark Meuser has repeatedly stated that the measure is intended to ban abortion and limit access to contraceptives in direct contradiction to the strict rules governing ballot language .
Proponents of the initiative are expected to easily collect the required 76,000 valid signatures by February 2008 to get the measure on the ballot .
Best - selling Author Will ' Prove ' God's Existence
ABC to Air LIVE Atheist Debate with Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort
Contact : Mark Spence , 562-920-8431 ext. 304 , mark@livingwaters.com
MEDIA ADVISORY , April 26 / Christian Newswire / --
After ABC ran a story in January about hundreds of atheists videotaping themselves blaspheming the Holy Spirit , best - selling author Ray Comfort contacted the network and offered to prove God 's existence , absolutely , scientifically , without mentioning the Bible or faith .
He and Kirk Cameron ( co-hosts of an award - winning Christian TV program ) challenged the two originators of the " Blasphemy Challenge " to a debate on the existence of God.
According to Comfort , he and Cameron ( an ex-atheist ) are qualified to debate on the subject .
Comfort had not only written a book titled " God Does n't Believe in Atheists " , but had spoken at Yale on the subject of atheism , and been flown by American Atheists , Inc. , to their 2001 annual convention to be a platform speaker .
ABC loved the idea , and will host a debate in New York City on May 5 , 2007 .
Moderated by Martin Bashir , the debate will be streamed LIVE on their website and will also be filmed for " Nightline . "
Cameron ( " Growing Pains " sitcom and Left Behind movies ) will speak on what he believes is a major catalyst for atheism : Darwinian evolution .
The popular actor stated , " Evolution is unscientific .
In reality , it is a blind faith that 's preached with religious zeal as the gospel truth .
I 'm embarrassed to admit that I was once a naïve believer in the theory .
The issue of intelligent design is extremely relevant at the moment .
Atheism has become very popular in universities -- where it's taught that we evolved from animals and that there are no moral absolutes .
So we should n't be surprised when there are school shootings .
Cameron will also reveal what it was that convinced him that God did exist .
" Most people equate atheism with intellectualism , " Comfort added , " but it 's actually an intellectual embarrassment .
I am amazed at how many people think that God 's existence is a matter of faith .
It 's not , and I will prove it at the debate - once and for all .
This is not a joke .
I will present undeniable scientific proof that God exists .
" But , " Comfort continued , " there is something more sinister here than a few people not believing in God .
Why would so many be so bitter against Christianity in particular ?
Why are n't they making videos that blaspheme Buddha or Mohammed or Ghandi ?
We made our own video clip and posted it on www.Hollywoodblasphemy.com to expose why . "
Comfort and Cameron co-published The Evidence Bible and they have an online Bible School with more than 8,500 students .
Both the Bible and the school train Christians on how to prove the existence of God and how to refute the theory of evolution .
According to recent polls 12 % of Americans do not have a belief in a Higher Power , up from 8 % in 1987 ( that group includes agnostics ) .
In Europe the rise of atheism and agnosticism is stunning , where according to a Zukerman study , in Sweden as many as 85 % of the population are non-believers , Japan 65 % , France 54 % and in Britain 44 % do not believe in God .

Everyone ’s heard of the stock market — but few know why it works .
Were you aware that each stock has two prices ?
That you ca n’t buy and sell for the same amount ?
That a “ stock market ” works better and is more open than a “ stock store ” ?
If you ’re like most of us , probably not .
Here ’s why stock markets rock :
They match buyers and sellers efficiently
All prices are completely transparent and you see what other people have paid / sold for
and you see what other people have paid / sold for
You pick your own price and will get that amount if there ’s a willing partner
Most explanations jump into the minor details — not here .
Today we ’ll see why the stock market works as it does .

What ’s it worth ?
You : Dude , just get the price .
Duh .
Ok hotshot , riddle me this : what is the price , exactly ?
What you can buy it for ?
( Your best bid )
? ( Your best )
What you can sell it for ?
( What you ’d ask for it )
So which price is the “ real one ” ?
Both .
You see , buyers and sellers each have prices in mind .
When prices match , whablamo , there ’s a transaction ( no match , no whablamo ) .
The idea of two prices for every item is key to understanding any market , not just stocks .
Everything has a bid and an ask , and each shopping model has a different way of handling them .
This leads to different advantages for buyers and sellers .
Shopping Time
Suppose we want to buy an iPod from Amazon .
You see the selling price of \ $ 200 ( Amazon ’s ask ) , and personally decide if it ’s “ worth it ” ( i.e. less than or equal to your bid ) :
In the store model , Amazon shows a public asking price \ $ 200 ) .
Each buyer has a secret bidding price , some more than others .
Buyers willing to bid \ $ 200 or more purchase the iPod ; the rest hold off \ $ 199 and below ) .
Amazon picks a price that attracts the most bidders yet still keeps a profit .
In the store model :
Buyer pro : Buyers know the price and can pay less than their internal value
Buyer con : Buyers have to visit multiple stores to find the best price
Seller con : Sellers do n’t know what each buyer is willing to pay ; it ’s difficult to set the pricing .
Do low sales mean a bad price or a bad product ?
Even though buyers are “ in control ” , they may have to search around to find a store that meets their bid ( if any ) .
That ’s inefficient .
Onto eBay
Now suppose we want to sell our new , unopened gadget ( you , the 18 - 35 demographic , are fickle like that ; the survey said so ) .
Sure , we could try to sell it on Amazon — now we ’re our own store and need a price we think people will pay .
We ’re in the same boat as Amazon , and could set the price too low .
That ’s no fun .
Instead , we auction off the new iPod on eBay to maximize profits :
In the eBay model , buyers have public bids and compete for the product .
The seller keeps their minimum price secret and hopes to make a profit by having someone “ overpay ” .
In the auction model :
Seller pro : Sellers have a secret ask ( reserve or minimum price ) and can get paid above this .
( reserve or minimum price ) and can get paid above this .
Seller pro : Buyers ’ demand is transparent .
They can easily see if they are pricing too high .
Buyer con : Difficult to buy a product .
e Bay is great for sellers — you have the chance of making extra profit .
For buyers , it ’s not so great : you can lose auctions by \ $ 1 ( paying 201 when 202 was the highest bid ) , even though the seller would have been happy with 201 .
You could enter multiple auctions with \ $ 201 but risk getting two iPods .
Want Ads and Hagglers
There ’s other trading approaches also :
Want ad :
Publicly announce your desire for an iPod and let sellers fight it out .
: Publicly announce your desire for an iPod and let sellers fight it out .
Haggle : Find someone with an iPod , and without knowing a selling price , make an offer .
You both haggle back and forth , trying to eke the other person out of a few bucks .
If you ’ve gone car shopping you know how fun this is .
In want ads , the asks are transparent while the bids ( your value ) are hidden .
When haggling , both prices are hidden which can lead to a stressful situation .
It ’s About Supply and Demand
Each model has similar concepts , namely :
Supply : sellers provide asks
Demand : buyers provide bids
The phrase liquidity refers to how effectively you can trade ; how easily cash can flow .
When buyers and sellers have to argue or haggle , trading freezes up .
In particular , there ’s a common problem in the market above :
There ’s secret prices and a lack of transparency
There ’s multiple vendors and a lack of consolidation
When buyers and sellers need to search to find each other , and haggle when they get there , trading slows down .
Enter the Market
But hope is not lost !
Surprisingly , the very symbol of capitalism is an “ open source ” model :
All prices are transparent
Buyers write public bids ( buying price )
( buying price ) Sellers write public asks ( selling price )
( selling price )
There ’s one location to get a particular stock ; there ’s no searching
to get a particular stock ; there ’s no searching Dealers / specialists help match buyers and sellers
And here ’s what it looks like :
Every iPod seller lists their asking price ( 210 , 205 , 201 , 200 ) .
Every iPod buyer lists their buying price ( 190 , 195 , 199 , 200 ) .
When prices match , a transaction happens : the buyer who wants to pay 200 gets matched with the seller who wants 200 .
They ’re happy .
Eventually the matches cease and we come to a standstill .
Drop and Spread ‘em .
Trades do n’t last forever : there ’s a standoff and an awkward pause .
The lowest sellers want \$ 201 , and the highest bidder wants \ $ 199 ; this \ $ 2 gap is called the spread .
The last price of a transaction was \$ 200 .
Now what happens ?
Buyers and sellers can do :
Limit order : put their bid / ask in the queue .
put their bid / ask in the queue .
Market order : buy or sell immediately .
When you place a limit order ( “ Buy an iPod for 195 ″ ) , your order gets added to the bid queue ( similar for asks ) .
If you need to trade right now ( “ buy it now ! ” or “ sell it now ! ” ) , then you use a market order .
You ’ll get the best price available :
Market order to sell :
You can unload your iPod for \ $ 199 ( the highest bid ) .
The “ last ” price is now 199 .
Market order to buy :
You can buy for \ $ 201 ( the lowest price ) .
The “ last ” price is now 201 .
Now this is interesting .
Notice how market orders take items off the queue and change the last price .
When people place market orders , the stock price fluctuates .
Yes , it ’s “ just ” supply and demand , but it ’s pretty cool to know it ’s happening real - time in the stock market .
If there ’s a lot of buyers , they ’ll “ use up ” the ask queue and the price will rise .
If there ’s a lot of sellers , they ’ll “ use up ” the bid queue and the price will fall .
This explains why it ’s hard to buy and sell for the same price .
If you buy for 201 , and no new bids come in , you ’ll only be able to sell for 199 .
In the real world , the list looks like this :
You see the bids , asks , quantities , and names .
Here the bid is 204.91 ( max someone will pay ) and the ask is 204.92 ( min someone will sell ) .
When a buyer or seller gets restless , they may decide to immediately buy / sell , which moves the price .
This detailed data is called a Level II quote .
So Who Runs This Popsicle Stand ?
The NYSE and NASDAQ are the two major American exchanges .
There are differences , but at the core they provide :
A single market to trade .
All stocks for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , are traded on the NASDAQ exchange .
All stocks for Ford ( F ) are on the NYSE .
to trade .
All stocks for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , are traded on the exchange .
All stocks for Ford ( F ) are on the A market maker or “ specialist ” ( not the kind that kills people ) .
These people make the market liquid : they help collect and match bids and asks .
The NYSE has one specialst per stock ; NASDAQ has several market makers ( dealers ) who compete on price .
How Do They Make Money ?
Well , often they do n’t .
In the NYSE , 88 % of the trades happen between the public without needing the specialist ( remember those guys waving papers and screaming at each other ?
I would n’t want to get involved with them either ) .
But sometimes they are needed .
The market makers literally “ create a market ” by providing liquidity : you can buy and sell stocks to them at the bid and ask prices .
Popular stocks have a small spread due to the demand and volume .
But how do market makers make money ?
Well , it ’s a bit like a currency exchange at a bank , where ’s there ’s a different rate for buying and selling .
Let ’s say Sue has an iPod to sell , and Bob wants to buy an iPod .
It might go like this :
Hey Sue , I ’ll take your iPod .
Here ’s 199 .
Hi Bob , I ’ll sell you an iPod .
That ’ll be 201 .
See what happened ?
The market maker bought an iPod for 199 and sold it for 201 : it pocketed the spread of \ $ 2 .
Dealers constantly change their prices based on the bids and asks ; they can even lose money depending on the trades coming in .
But usually it ’s a pretty good gig .
You , the investor , can avoid paying “ the spread ” by placing limit orders to sell or buy at a certain price .
But then you are n’t guaranteed to make a trade .
It ’s All About Timing
Bill Gates has a lot of shares of Microsoft .
People naively put this wealth as “ shares times price ” , but you know that does n’t really work .
If he tried to sell all his shares , he ’d use up the bids .
Each block of shares would be sold for a lower and lower value — and potential buyers would panic and reduce their bids , thinking something was amiss .
Sellers would fear the worst and lower their asks to compete .
Pandemonium would ensue .
So the actual liquidation value of his shares is really some fraction of the reported amount .
But it ’s still nothing to sneeze at .
Similarly , large institutions must spread their stock trades over time so they do n’t disrupt the market ( and evaporate their profits ) .
The market has built - in shock absorbers : as you sell more , the price you get is smaller and smaller , so you sell less .
As you buy more , the price you pay gets higher and higher , so you buy less .
So it makes sense to take things slow .
Nifty .

Stanford University engineering professor John Cioffi , known by some as the " father of DSL " , was one of the external experts reviewing the research , which made up Dr Papandriopoulos 's PhD thesis .
Professor Cioffi , who developed the computer chips inside the first DSL modems , was so impressed he offered the 29 - year - old a job at his Silicon Valley start - up company , ASSIA , which is developing ways to optimise the performance of DSL networks .
Dr Papandriopoulos , whose efforts also earned him the University of Melbourne 's Chancellor 's Prize for Excellence , said he would leave for the US in about two weeks .
He has already applied for two patents relating to his discovery .
Melbourne Ventures , the University of Melbourne 's commercialisation company , is now shopping the technology around to vendors of DSL equipment and modems .
The vendors would then sell the supporting equipment to internet providers worldwide for placement in their exchanges .
Richard Day , commercialisation associate at Melbourne Ventures , was optimistic about the technology 's licensing prospects but said it was too early to tell how lucrative it would be .
" That 's a question which is impossible to answer , simply because we do n't yet have a feeling for the extent to which it could be adopted ... [ but ] it has the potential to be adopted worldwide in any country that has a copper network , " he said .
Dr Papandriopoulos is in the process of assigning the intellectual property for his invention to the university , but he stands to receive significant royalties from any licensing agreements .
" Many years ago people used to pick up the phone and make a phone call and you'd be able to hear a faint or distant telephone conversation taking place , and that 's called cross - talk , " Dr Papandriopoulos said when attempting to explain how his algorithm worked .
" That is not an issue for voice calls these days but it becomes a problem when you 're trying to wring more bandwidth out of these existing copper telephone wires [ which power ADSL broadband connections ] . "
" This cross - talk in current day DSL networks effectively produces noise onto other lines , and this noise reduces the speed of your connection . "
Dr Papandriopoulos said his algorithm served to minimise that interference and thus maximise the line speed .
He said others had researched the same area but his project was attracting significant interest because it was more practical and easier to implement .
If it is successfully licensed to equipment vendors , Dr Papandriopoulos expects the technology to be implemented by internet providers around the world within two or three years .
Let ’s hope that nothing ever goes wrong while astronauts are preparing to launch on their Ares 1 rocket – the new vehicle that will replace the space shuttle .
But if there is a problem , and the astronauts need to escape right now , they ’ll have a fun ride down – on the 3rd tallest roller coaster in the world .
It ’s called the Orion Emergency Egress System , but really , it ’s a roller coaster , designed to get the astronauts away from the vehicle and into a protective bunker in moments .
Take a good look at the image that goes along with this story .
See the bright yellow rails over on the right hand side of the image , dropping straight down from the gray platform .
That ’s the escape system .
You ’ll note it goes straight down .
The purpose of the Orion Emergency Egress System is to get astronauts and support personnel away from the Ares 1 vehicle , and into a safety bunker within 4 minutes .
The solution that NASA has come up with should be perfect , carrying astronauts and workers down away from the rocket , right to the bunker ’s door .
For previous launch vehicles , NASA had cables near the door to the launch vehicle .
If there was a problem , people could enter a basket that slides down a cable to an area near the bunker .
The problem was that it was very difficult to get incapacitated people into the basket and down to the safety of the bunker .
With the new egress system , healthy workers can just put the wounded in seats and let them ride down to safety .
NASA called in the world ’s roller coaster designers to help them create the system .
In fact , from a height of 116 metres ( 380 feet ) , the Orion Emergency Egress System would be the third tallest roller coaster in the world , after the Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson , New Jersey , and the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio .

It may have once dismissed the OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) Project as a " cheap gadget , " but Intel appears to have changed its mind .
The company is now involved in talks to provide CPUs for the $ 100 ( actually ~ $ 175 ) systems .
According to the EETimes , Intel 's newfound interest in the project is just fine with the OLPC design team .
" Intel , like a lot of other people , is more than welcome to try to design great silicon for this project and this mission , and we 've been working with them to help them do exactly that , " said Walter Bender , OLPC 's president .
Up until now , OLPC has been based on the AMD Geode , and it may be the functional weakness of that architecture that has Intel interested in capturing the OLPC market .
As we mentioned earlier this year , the Geode is a less than ideal x86 architecture .
The Geode LX - 700 at the heart of the XO is a 433MHz chip whose design is based on the Cyrix MediaGX processor that debuted in 1997 .
With its 128 K of L1 and 128 K of L2 cache , support for DDR266 , and its significantly faster clock speed , the LX - 700 is obviously more powerful than the Cyrix 5x86 core on which it is based , but the heart of the CPU is still reliant on a non-superscalar architecture capable of executing only a single operation per clock cycle .
Intel 's Celeron M is inherently a more powerful CPU , though the lack of L2 cache in Intel 's reference design will obviously impact performance .
In short , the OLPC XO is currently running on a CPU core that does n't even qualify as a 5th - generation Pentium - class CPU .
Intel , in contrast , is talking about building an OLPC system based around either modified Celeron processors or the upcoming dual - core Silverthorne , built on a 45 nm process .
The company seems to think it can do this in a cost - effective manner .
As for the OLPC group , it does n't appear to be ruling out any supplier and has even tossed out the idea of building different OLPC systems for children with different needs growing up in different types of environments .
Bender was quick to point out that the Geode has n't been a limiting factor in designing the OLPC thus far and even floated the idea of using an XScale processor designed by Marvell .
No one at OLPC is screaming , " We need more power , Scotty ! "
Still , the door is open for any company that would like to pitch its CPU as capable of handling the OLPC 's unique demands — and it appears no company , not even AMD , can rest easy as having " won " the design long term .
That said , AMD is n't too worried about Intel 's new love for OLPC .
AMD sitting confident
In the wake of Intel 's decision to fork over a little cash and hop aboard the OLPC train , we had the chance to talk to Rebecca Gonzales , director of marketing communications at AMD , about how the company feels about Intel 's Johnny - come - lately move .
To put it bluntly , AMD is n't worried .
" We see nothing changing currently " with the XO , Gonzales said .
OLPC began designing the XO in 2005 , and in the early days the project planned on incorporating AMD 's GX processor line .
The XO is now powered by the Geode LX processor line , and Gonzales says that " the whole device would need to be redesigned " were OLPC to make a CPU change at this stage .
" At performance per watt , we do very well with the Geode , " Gonzales said , claiming that since the Geode does n't require a fan , it is really a superior CPU to anything Intel can offer right now .
The fanless Geode can be secured in an enclosure that will keep out dirt and water , making it a better choice than any fan - cooled CPU that would necessarily require more openings in the design .
Gonzales said that AMD can also offer better battery performance .
According to Gonzales , " the LX uses .9 watts , and no one can meet that right now . "
Total CPU and chipset power consumption is approximately 3 watts , she said .
While there may be a showdown between AMD and Intel over who gets to ride in the front seat , it appears unlikely that there will be a design change with the current iteration of XO laptops .
OLPC Project members have publicly talked about a second design only coming in late 2008 or 2009 .
Competition between AMD and Intel over the OLPC ?
Something tells us that Nicholas Negroponte has been waiting for this for quite some time .

IN THE wild , horses eat tough grass that naturally wears down their teeth .
In captivity , they are fed softer food they can eat more quickly , so their teeth grow unchecked .
Unless filed down — a process known as “ floating ” — they can grow too long and cut the horse 's cheeks .
Floating is hard work .
Carl Mitz has been doing it for 22 years .
He calms each horse before holding its mouth open and vigorously filing its teeth by hand until they are just so .
A third - generation horseman , he says he has handled 100,000 horses .
His customers are satisfied , judging by the sheaf of testimonials on his desk .
But the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners wants to shut him down .
Mr Mitz may be a skilled artisan , but he is not a vet .
And the board says that only vets may float horses ' teeth .
If Mr Mitz persists in doing his job , he will be practising veterinary medicine without a licence .
The penalty could include steep fines and even prison .
Mr Mitz is miffed .
Even if he could get into vets ' school , which he doubts , he could not possibly afford the fees .
And he does not see why he should take years off work and pay tens of thousands of dollars to pursue studies that may not help him in his work .
Vets ' schools typically teach little about equine dentistry .
“ It 's ludicrous , ” he says .
Mr Mitz is one of four horse - tooth floaters in Texas suing to be allowed to carry on earning a living .
The case attracts few headlines , but the principle is important .
Regulators should not shut down an honest business without good cause .
The vets ' board says letting non-vets file horses ' teeth endangers the horses .
Dewey Helmcamp , the executive director , says the board received half a dozen complaints in a year and a half about poor care from fly - by - night floaters .
But that label hardly applies to Mr Mitz , who says he has never botched a floating .
His customers fear that they may have to pay a vet more to do the job less well .
“ This should be my choice , not yours !!! ” reads a typical letter from one of Mr Mitz 's clients to the board .
Supporting Mr Mitz 's lawsuit is a group called the Institute for Justice , which fights affronts to economic freedom , such as licensing rules designed to protect incumbents from competition .
These typically purport to protect consumers , but often serve mainly to jack up prices by deterring newcomers from setting up shop .
In Minnesota , for example , the state board of barbers and cosmetologists barred African hair - braiders from braiding hair unless they underwent 1,500 hours of irrelevant training , until the institute took up their case and won .
For competition - shy incumbents , no risk is so trivial that government action is not required to avert it .
In four states , you need a licence to practise interior design .
In several more , you can do the job but you can't advertise yourself as an “ interior designer ” unless you pass a state - mandated test ( of fabulous taste , presumably ) .
The only people lobbying for such regulations are established interior designers .
The net result is less competition and higher prices .
But with no one organised to lobby against them , the rules often pass .
Overall , the benefits of regulation in America far outweigh its costs , says the White House 's Office of Management and Budget .
Between 1996 and 2006 , it puts the annual cost of the main federal regulations at between $ 40 billion and $ 46 billion , whereas these rules yield between $ 99 billion and $ 484 billion in annual benefits .
Yet many experts doubt these figures .
Jerry Ellig of George Mason University notes that they are based on the estimates various agencies make when they propose rules , with little attempt to measure how they work in practice .
The Competitive Enterprise Institute , a conservative think - tank , reckons that the true cost of all federal regulations is a whopping $ 1.1 trillion a year , a figure that includes the burden of price supports , barriers to entry and complying with the tax code .
For a small firm , complying with federal regulations costs $ 7,600 per employee per year , according to a report prepared for the Small Business Administration .
Hard to quantify , especially if you do n't try
Experts admit that they do n't even know whether the regulatory burden is growing or shrinking .
Since the 1970s , many rules have been revoked .
Price controls are a distant memory and several industries , from airlines to banking , have been deregulated .
But rules relating to health , safety , the environment and national security have multiplied .
Some of these are necessary , but many are not .
For example , by one estimate , American health - care regulations cost $ 169 billion a year more than they yield in benefits , and lead to 7 m Americans not being able to afford health insurance .
By another estimate , measures to keep terrorists off aeroplanes cost lives by prompting people to drive instead of fly , which is nine times more dangerous .
Many of the effects of regulation are hard to measure .
But a deeper problem is that politicians often do n't try very hard to weigh costs against benefits at all .
After an exhaustive study of American regulations , Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute , a think - tank , concluded that quite a lot of cost - benefit analysis is done , but it is sometimes shoddy and politicians often ignore it .
Politicians are reluctant to be seen opposing almost any rule aimed at thwarting terrorists , or to allow economists to put a price on a human life ( hence all the health - care rules ) or a pristine landscape .
And even the worst regulation usually heaps benefits on a small group , while its costs are widely spread .
The beneficiaries thus lobby hard to keep each rule , while its victims do nothing .
The late Mancur Olson , an economist , predicted that interest groups will grow in number until they cause their host society to slip into economic decline .
America is nowhere close to that .
But it surely needs more watchdogs ( and horse floaters ) to growl at the regulators .
A round - up of fun Linux diversions .
When people talk about computer gaming these days , they invariably mean commercial games running on a Windows platform .
Few people realize that Linux can be more than just a very good Web or file server .
Even fewer people are aware of the many open - source or otherwise freely available games available for Linux .
I 'm not really a serious gamer , but I do occasionally enjoy a good diversion .
Over the years , I 've encountered some very good games and about as many duds .
Some of the games I highlight in this article require OpenGL in order to run .
Others have multiplayer capability .
A few will run on a quite modest Linux workstation .
All of them are fun and worth installing and playing .
AstroMenace
I initially downloaded AstroMenace because I was looking for a Galaga clone for my wife and oldest son .
I did n't end up with what I was looking for , but I think I did even better .
In AstroMenace , you pilot a ship that is constrained to the lower portion of the screen while enemy ships , asteroids and weapons attack from above .
Your goal is to protect your ship while destroying as many enemy ships as you can with various weapons .
Figure 1 . AstroMenace
After each mission , players are given the opportunity to repair and upgrade their ship using currency earned by completing the mission .
Weapons and propulsion upgrades are available , as well as improved guidance and power generation systems .
The ship 's hull has multiple weapon mounts and can accept a variety of different weapons in various configurations .
For example , you could put particle weapons in the front two positions and missiles in the rear mounts , and during the battle , you could fire the two banks of weapons independently .
Eventually , you can build up a ship with considerable firepower .
Once your ship 's upgrades and repairs are complete , you are presented with a mission briefing , and the next mission begins .
The enemy ships approach in formation , and at first , it seems like they should be easy to defeat , but they just keep coming ... and shooting .
Completing the mission becomes a challenge .
The graphics in AstroMenace are absolutely stunning .
In addition to lots of rich colors , AstroMenace features multilayered graphics that give the screen the illusion of depth .
As the enemy ships move in from the top of the screen , you also can see stationary nebulae and chunks of space debris moving at various speeds .
The screen appears to be a portal looking out over the depth of space during a battle .
It 's a very unique visual effect .
The sound also is very well done .
The music tends to be more like military anthems , but the ship noises and explosions sound really good on a decent set of speakers .
Turning the volume up past a certain point allows you quickly to forget that exploding ships do n't make any sound in space .
Deadly Rooms of Death
Who would n't be intrigued by a game called Deadly Rooms of Death ?
Deadly Rooms of Death , or DroD , is a puzzle game where you have to navigate through a maze , avoid various hazards and solve a puzzle , all at the same time .
Despite its name , this game is more of a thinking game than an action game .
Figure 2 . Deadly Rooms of Death
In DroD , you are in a maze , as seen from above , that spans multiple screens and levels .
Each level is inhabited by various creatures , such as cockroaches , giant worms and blobs , which you either have to avoid or kill with your sword .
The creatures move in predictable patterns , and rather than adding an element of chance to the game , the creatures become part of the puzzle you have to solve to progress to the next level .
You have to kill all of the creatures to progress to the next level , and some creatures may be behind closed or one - way doors , which you have to figure out how to get past .
I installed DroD on my laptop and played it for hours a few years ago .
It 's a great game to play when you have only a few minutes here and there , like at the airport or right before a staff meeting .
The game 's graphics are bright , colorful and well animated .
The puzzles range from trivial to very complex .
If you are prone to frustration , this is n't the game for you .
Otherwise , DroD can be fun to play for hours without becoming repetitive .
War Zone 2100
War Zone 2100 is set in a post - apocalyptic world on a 3 - D topographical map that you can scroll around with your mouse ( Figure 3 ) .
You are in command of various military units , such as trucks , tanks and gun towers .
The game is broken down into individual missions that are outlined to you before the game starts .
Mission objectives range from establishing a viable base of operations to finding and destroying enemy encampments .
Figure 3 . War Zone 2100
The first mission objective is simply to establish a home base with a power plant , a research center and a few factories .
Of course , all the structures are nicely animated .
Then , you must find and destroy a few enemy installations .
The trucks do all of the construction , once you tell them what to build .
After you build a power plant , you can have the trucks build a factory .
Factories are where you get more trucks and tanks .
Building a research center enables your troops to research new technology , such as better weapons and new types of tactical units and structures .
Pretty soon , you 're able to build automated gun towers .
Sweet !
Once you 've built up a small army of tanks , it 's time to go looking for trouble .
Trouble comes in the form of scavengers who have built up fortresses complete with fences and gun towers .
Inside such a fortress , you 'll find barracks and various other structures .
You may even encounter a fortress perched on the top of a hill .
However , long before you find the enemy 's fortresses , you 'll probably encounter one of its patrols .
The scavenger 's patrols are composed of individual infantry men on foot and in vehicles ranging from three - wheeled all - terrain vehicles to small missile launchers .
Scavengers practice gorilla warfare tactics and constantly sneak up on your units , attack and quickly retreat .
Finding and routing the enemies while managing your ever - growing resources is quite a challenge .
The battles feature realistic sounds and animation .
You can watch the gun turrets turn to aim at a target .
The infantry men will crouch down when they fire their weapons .
Smoke bellows from damaged tanks .
While you watch the action , you hear the sound of heavy caliber machine guns and explosions .
You can hear the tanks squeaking into position .
You even can hear the occasional bullet ricochet .
For all its sophistication , War Zone 2100 is a game I almost passed up , until I witnessed my first battle scene — then I was hooked .
The Battle for Wesnoth
The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn - based fantasy strategy game where you build up an army and go on adventures , such as regaining the throne of Wesnoth or defeating a horde of undead warriors .
The game is played on a hexagonal map with various terrain types .
Once you 've selected a scenario to play , start the game by recruiting new units into your army or recalling units from previously played scenarios .
Then , as with most games of this type , you tell your units where to go and whom to attack .
Figure 4 . The Battle for Wesnoth
This game features different types of units , Bowmen , Elvish Fighters , Horsemen or even Skeleton Archers .
In addition to individual names , the units have various abilities , traits and weapons .
As the units win battles , they gain experience points and eventually progress to higher levels and correspondingly higher ability levels .
The fact that you can recall units from previous campaigns opens up the possibility of creating a band of very powerful units for use in future games .
The Battle for Wesnoth comes with six different single - player campaigns with many more user - contributed and multiplayer campaigns to play .
Each campaign starts with a brief story describing the setting and goal of the campaign .
Players might be told that to win , they must slay the Black Mage , but that they will lose if their leader is killed .
The game starts with strategic positioning but quickly becomes a multifront war .
Completing the campaign , advancing units to higher levels , withdrawing wounded units and battling enemy units , combined with compelling story lines , makes The Battle of Wesnoth a game that you can become immersed in for hours .
Torcs
Torcs has to be the best open - source driving simulation and certainly rivals commercial offerings as well .
Torcs also has the unique distinction of allowing players to build their own cars to race or race against .
I 'm not talking about selecting a body and color from a list and then upgrading it like you see in many racing games .
I 'm talking about using a program like Blender to create a new body style and a C++ API to control the vehicle .
The result is any body style you care to create and as much racing prowess as you can give it .
Figure 5 . Torcs
Although describing the process of developing a new car for use in Torcs might warrant an article of its own , describing the racing experience in Torcs is simple ; it 's everything you could ask for in a racing game .
The graphics on some of the tracks are pretty realistic .
Some of the cars are absolutely sexy , ranging anywhere from a Baja Bug to an AC Cobra .
Each car is well modeled , both in appearance and in behavior .
I expect different handling characteristics from a NASCAR than I would from a Formula One , or a car that happens to be airborne .
The cars even behave differently depending on the track and the type of surface on which they 're racing .
The main thing that makes Torcs such a big winner is the game 's attention to detail .
The cars ' brake lights work .
The cars have different acceleration curves and even get witchy when they come to the top of a hill and gain a little altitude .
When viewed from the side , the cars ' brake disks glow red when the brakes are applied heavily .
Even the engine sounds are appropriate for the type of cars in a race .
The normally aspirated V - 8s sound different from the turbocharged 4s .
Skid marks on the track are standard fare , but dust kicked up from the car in front of you is a nice touch .
Torcs includes various tracks .
You can race on a NASCAR oval , a dirt track or one of many road races .
Some of the road races can be exceedingly challenging , forcing the racer to navigate long straightaways that turn into tight hairpins .
Though Torcs does support a split - screen two - player mode , a game of this quality really begs to be network - enabled .
Even so , Torcs is both realistic and addictive .
BZFlag I remember playing BattleZone in the arcades , so I thought I had an idea about what BZFlag was all about .
Wow , was that setting the bar pretty low .
Forget about vector - based 3 - D graphics .
How about OpenGL , fully textured graphics ?
Where BattleZone had fairly brain - dead opponents , BZFlag has fairly aggressive robotic opponents as well as real , live opponents from across the Internet .
Figure 6 . BZFlag
For those of you who are young enough never to have played BattleZone , BZFlag is a 3 - D tank battle game where you have to navigate around various obstacles and shoot opponents with your cannon .
The challenge comes from the fact that everyone in the game has a radar screen , showing the location of all the other tanks .
So the game is more than simply sneaking up on your opponents and blasting them ; you have to out - maneuver and out shoot them .
Depending on how the BZFlag server is configured , the game may have flags that you can pick up to gain additional weapons , shields and so on .
Some flags are beneficial .
Others are harmful , and you do n't know which are which until you pick up the flag .
Some servers are configured to allow the tanks to jump to avoid incoming artillery fire .
Presumably , the tanks are equipped with some sort of rocket engine .
BZFlag can be played in either of two modes : Death Match , or Capture the Flag .
Thanks to BZFlag and my seven - year - old son , this article almost did n't get written on time ; the game is a lot of fun and appropriate for gamers of all ages .
Fly Mouth
This is the mouth of a sucking - type fly ( as opposed to a biting - type fly ) .
The spongy mouthparts ( green ) are used to lap up food .
If the food is dry , the fly can moisten it with either saliva or even vomit ( YUCK ! ) before sucking it up .
You can see how this would help to spread germs !
Even with " erasable " ink in the works , we 're still a ways off from risk - free tattooing .
Put needle to skin and you 're committing yourself to pain both in application and removal , not to mention a ( mostly ) permanent appliqué .
Making the decision to get inked should n't be taken lightly , and French graphic designer Loic Zimmerman really weighed his choices .
He created a 3 - D rendering of himself tatted with his design to see just how he'd look with a 3/ 4 arm piece .
To make his CG bad self , Zimmerman went to French gaming and motion - capture studio Quantic Dream to get a 3 - D scan of himself .
He then imported the patches and rebuilt his virtual self back at home .
He used an exported UV set of the section of his body to be tattooed as a guideline in Photoshop to fit and enhance his tattoo design .
Check out the comments here to see a visual step - by - step of the process .
It would be really rad if in the future tattoo shops offer this type of rendering for people thinking of getting large pieces .
It would help both the tattooee imagine themselves with the artwork and the tattooer see how the piece needs to be adjusted for body shape and angles .

Time and the Hour Running Through Rough Days
Posted August 2007 .
There is a relatively simple algorithm to calculate the lapsed time between any two dates expressed in terms of the standard European calendar and GMT ...
Bill Casselman
University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada
cass at math.ubc.ca
I was born in the state of New Jersey on November 27 , 1941 at 2:00 AM .
Right now , as I write this , I am in Vancouver , British Columbia and the time is 2:00 PM , July 17 , 2007 .
What is my exact age ?
Nasty question .
The most straightforward way to answer it is very simple if somewhat tedious - make up a table of the different time periods involved , reduced to a single unit of time in a single time zone .
For the unit of time I 'll choose the day , and for the time zone I 'll choose Greenwich Mean Time , for many years a kind of universal time on earth .
GMT is 5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and 7 ahead of Pacific Daylight Time , so I was born at 7 AM ( GMT ) and it is now 9 PM ( GMT ) .
We now add together
the number of days remaining in 1941 ,
the number of days elapsed from 0:00 January 1 , 1942 to 24:00 December 31 , 2007 ,
the number of days so far elapsed in 2007 .
The table runs
17/24 days ( rest of November 27 ) 3 ( rest of November ) 31 ( rest of 1941 ) 365 ( 1942 ) 365 ( 1943 ) 366 ( 1944 ) ... ... 366 ( 2000 ) ... ... 365 ( 2006 ) 181 ( January - June , 2007 ) 16 ( July 1 - July 16 ) 21/24 ( elapsed so far July 17 )
making a total of 23973 days and 14 hours .
The only tricky thing is how to deal with the year 2000 , as I 'll explain in a moment .
This is not only somewhat tedious , it is just complicated enough to be prone to error .
For short periods it can be done on a spreadsheet , laid out more or less as the table indicates .
There is one mildly interesting mathematical question that arises - is there a good spreadsheet formula for calculating the length of a year ?
In the Gregorian calendar , the number of days in most years is 365 , but very fourth year is a leap year with 366 - except that years which are multiples of 100 are not leap years - except that years which are divisible by 400 are leap years .
So 2000 is a leap year --- the only exceptional thing about the year 2000 is that it is not exceptional !
Another mildly annoying feature of the Gregorian calendar is that the number of days in a month varies rather erratically , so calculating the time elapsed between one day of the year and another is a bit painful .
These observations make it all the more remarkable that there is a relatively simple algorithm to calculate the lapsed time between any two dates expressed in terms of the standard European calendar and GMT .
Suppose a date is given in year , month , day format , expressed numerically .
Let these be Y , M , D in numbers , where M ranges from 1 to 12 ) and D is the number of days elapsed since midnight at the beginning of the month .
Thus noon on January 1 has D=0.5 .
The basic idea of the algorithm is to convert the date into a form more convenient for computation .
The conversion turns a date expressed in the Gregorian calendar into a single number - its Julian day number , which is the number of days elapsed since a certain fixed date .
To find the length of time ( in days ) that has passed between two distinct dates , calculate the corresponding Julian day numbers and take the difference .
The algorithm
How does one calculate the Julian Day Number ?
I give here a slight modification of the method presented in Wikipedia , which I shall then explain .
It works only for dates subsequent to 4800 B. C. , but this is hardly a serious restriction since after all no dates were recorded anywhere on the planet before then .
In Western culture since the early middle ages , there have been two calendars widely used , the Julian and the Gregorian .
The Julian calendar was in important aspects the one put into place by Julius Caesar .
It assumed a year of length 365.25 days , which was a bit longer than the true one of approximately 365.2422 days .
It was used more or less continuously for more than a millennium , but as time went on it was realized that the date on which certain events happened , such as the equinoxes , were not what they had been in Roman times .
For this reason it was replaced by the Gregorian calendar , which was much more accurate .
In much of Europe the new one was put into place at midnight on October 4 , 1582 , so that the following day was October 15 !
It took a long time before the rest of Europe accepted the new scheme .
It was n't until 1752 that England adopted the Gregorian calendar , which it called New Style as opposed to Old Style .
September 2 , 1752 ( O.S. ) was followed by September 14 ( N.S. ) .
Because the Middle Ages recorded dates in the Julian calendar , it is conventional to use the Julian calendar through October 4 , 1582 and the Gregorian one after that , although in accounts of English history through the 18th century dates are often recorded in both forms , the Julian calendar in which English contemporaries recorded them as well as the Gregorian calendar in which the French ( among others on the Continent ) did so .
Therefore , the algorithm has to deal with two separate cases , depending on whether the date is given according to the Julian or the Gregorian calendar .
Suppose the date is given as Y , M , D ( in either calendar ) .
The year for dates B. C. are expressed as negative numbers , where 1 B.C. is given as 0 , 2 B.C. as - 1 etc .
Set
a = [ ( 14 - M ) / 12 ]
y = Y + 4800 - a
m = M + 12a - 3
Here [ x ] is the floor function , the integer just below x .
Thus [ 3 ] is 3 , and so is [ 3.1 ] .
For a Gregorian date the Julian day is then
( D - 0.5 ) + [ 153 m + 2/5 ] + 365y + [ y / 4 ] - [ y / 100 ] + [ y / 400 ] - 32044
while for a Julian date it is
( D - 0.5 ) + [ 153 m +2/5 ] + 365 y + [ y / 4 ] - 32082 .
To see how it works , for my birthday we get
a = [ ( 14 - 11 ) / 12 ] = 0
y = 1941 + 4800 - 0 = 5741
m = 11 - 3 = 8
365y + [ y / 4 ] - [ y / 100 ] + [ y / 400 ] = 2462099
[ 153* m + 2/5 ] = 245
JDN = 25.7917 + 245 + 2462099 - 32044 = 2430325.7917
and similarly for today JDN = 2454299.375 , making as before a difference of 239373.5833 days .
One very good feature of the formulas is that they are not hard to put into a spreadsheet .
What the terms mean
Let 's look at each of the steps in the calculation .
(1) Set
a = [ ( 14 - M ) / 12 ]
y = Y + 4800 - a
m = M + 12a - 3
If M=1 or 2 ( the month is January or February ) this sets a=1 , y = ( Y - 1 ) +4800 , M=M+9 , otherwise ( M > 2 ) it sets a=0 , y=Y +4800 , m=M - 3 .
Adding 4800 is a somewhat arbitrary shift that guarantees that y > 0 for historical dates .
This part of the formula has historical roots .
In effect , January and February become the last months ( 10 and 11 ) of the previous year , so we are introducing a new calendar , one in which the first day of the year is March 1 instead of January 1 .
This is a good idea mathematically , since in this new calendar February , the only month with a variable number of days , is last .
Hence the number of days from the start of the year to a given date does not depend on the year , as it does in our own calendar .
This is such a great idea that you might wonder why it has n't been done before !
Now our calendar is derived from the Roman one , later amended in a first version by Julius Caesar and then in a second by Augustus .
In the original Roman calendar , the beginning of the year was indeed March 1 .
There are still traces of this in our current calendar , because the names of the months September , October , November , and December are cognate with the Latin numbers 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 .
It was Julius Caesar who made January the first month .
On the other hand , though , it was also he who decreed that the variable day occurs in February .
One never knows , do one ?
(2) If the date is October 4 , 1582 or earlier ( when the Julian calendar was in effect ) , set S = 365y + [ y / 4 ] , otherwise ( we are using Gregorian dates ) set S = 365y + [ y / 4 ] - [ y / 100 ] + [ y / 400 ] .
The ancient Roman calendar was chaotic .
Julius Caesar , acting according to Pliny the Elder with the advice of the Alexandrian mathematician Sosigenes , reformed it in about 46 B.C.
The main effect was to bring the length of the calendar year into better synchronization with the true length of a solar year .
Since the number of days in a solar year is not an integer , in order to maintain this synchronization the length of a calendar year must vary from time to time .
In the Julian calendar , three out of every four years had 365 days and the fourth year 366 .
The Julian calendar , in effect , assumes the true length of a solar year ( say from vernal equinox to vernal equinox ) to be 365.25 days .
This is not correct , and overshoots the mark a bit , since the true solar year is very close to 365.2422 days .
Even in Roman times the better estimate of 365.2467 days was known to experts , and I have not seen any explanation of why the Julian scheme was accepted when it was known not to be as accurate as it might have been .
By the year 1500 or so , it was obvious to anybody who knew his history that the date of the vernal equinox , which is a natural event to use for recording annual periodicity , was about 10 days later than it had been in Roman times .
After a great deal of discussion , Pope Gregory XIII , acting with the advice of several Jesuit mathematicians and astronomers , decreed that a change would be made official .
In Catholic Europe , the next day after October 4 , 1582 was October 15 .
In the rest of Europe this reform was apparently considered an attempt by the Roman Catholic Church to subvert the true order of things , and in effect to steal days away from people .
There seems even to have been current a common opinion that they were days removed permanently from one 's life span .
The change was , however , adopted gradually by the rest of Europe over a period of several centuries --- by England in the middle of the 18th century , by Russia only after the revolution of 1917 .
Pope Gregory 's decree arranged that the dates of the equinoxes would agree with those of ancient times , but it also modified the Julian scheme of leap years in order to maintain synchronization .
Every 100th year would not be a leap year , except that every fourth century break would be .
Thus 1600 and 2000 were leap years in the Gregorian scheme , while 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 were not .
This amounts to estimating the year at 364.2425 days long .
In our shifted calendar , these numbers must be moved back one year , so that year y normally has 366 days if y+1 is divisible by 4 .
The number S counts the number of days elapsed from midnight of March 1 in the virtual year 0 of the relevant calendar to midnight of March 1 of year y .
(3) Add T = [ 153 m + 2/5 ] to S.
This is , mathematically , the most interesting term .
The following table shows what it does :
m T Differences Month 0 0 31 March 1 31 30 April 2 61 31 May 3 92 30 June 4 122 31 July 5 153 31 August 6 184 30 September 7 214 31 October 8 245 30 November 9 275 31 December 10 306 31 January 11 337 - February
In other words , the number T( m ) counts the number of elapsed days from 0:00 on the previous March 1 of that year to 0:00 of the first day of month m .
It is not at all obvious that there exists a simple arithmetical formula for T , much less how the valid formula T= [ ( 152 m + 2 ) /5 ] was arrived at .
These matters are of genuine mathematical interest , and will be dealt with once two other parts of the formula are explained .
(4) Add D - 0.5 to the sum so far .
The Julian day starts at noon .
This number is the number of days elapsed since the beginning of the current month .
(5) Subtract either 32044 ( Gregorian ) or 32082 ( Julian ) .
These numbers differ by 1 from the Wikipedia article since I take D=0.5 to be noon on the first day of the month , whereas Wikipedia would take D=1.5 at that moment .
The point of these subtractions is to set the origin of the calendars .
The date now settled on as the origin of the Julian Day numeration was chosen for historical and religious reasons by Joseph Scaliger in the 16th century to be January 1 , 4713 B. C.
This somewhat arbitrary choice was made by the Scaliger on the basis of some arithmetic combining three cycles each of several years in length --- the Julian cycle , in which days of the week repeat every 28 Julian years , the Metonic cycle , which measures an approximate cycle of the relative positions of the sun and the moon ( which determine the occurrence of Easter in the Roman Catholic Church ) , and the indictio , a period important in Roman tax administration .
For simple arithmetical reasons , the combination of these cycles forced the starting date of the new Julian reckoning to be January 1 , 4713 B.C.
The details can be found in the book by Otto Neugebauer listed among the references .
This scheme is surely one of the first examples of " legacy code , " but it is probably still used in modern astronomy because essentially all astronomical data originated after Julian date 0 .
( The 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica asserts that Joseph Scaliger was the most famous scholar of all time !
So fickle is fame . )
Approximating sequences by formula
The number of days T elapsed from March 1 to day 1 of month m , where m varies from 0 ( March ) to 11 ( February ) is given by the formula
T = [ ( 153 m + 2 ) / 5 ] .
This is the solution in this particular case of a more general problem :
Which empirically given functions F ( n ) on a range of integers , with integral values , can be given by a formula of the type F ( n ) = [ an + b ] where a and b are real numbers ?
In this particular case , the function we are calculating is given by the table we have seen above .
I repeat the part of the table we need :
m : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 T : 0 31 61 92 122 153 184 214 245 275 306 337 T-30 m : 0 1 1 2 2 3 4 4 5 5 6 7
As the third row of this table shows , we can write T( m ) = 30 m + U( m ) where U( m ) is a function that we can manipulate more easily .
The original approximation for T( m ) becomes the approximation [ ( 3m + 2 ) / 5 ] for U ( m ) .
Here is a graph showing how this works --- the red bars show U ( m ) , the black slope line the graph of [ ( 3m + 2 ) / 5 ] .
What the graph shows is that f( m ) = [ ( 3 m + 2 ) / 5 ] is a formula for U ( m ) because for m=0 , 1 , ... 11 the value of ( 3m+ 2 ) / 5 lies between U( m ) and U( m ) +
1 . We can see this even more clearly by picturing the graphs of f(m ) and f( m ) + 1 as stairs :
So our graph must pass between lower and upper stairs .
But a line will lie above the lower stairs precisely when it lies above the lower region pictured below , and similarly it will lie below the upper stairs when it lies below the upper region in the picture .
These are known as the convex hulls of the stairs , and they are easy to construct .
So our straight line exists lying between the upper and lower stairs precisely when there is a gap between the two convex hulls , as there is here .
And any line passing from x=0 x=11 that passes through the gap will do the trick .
There is a simple procedure for finding convex hulls in two dimensions , but here it would be quite feasible to find a line with a ruler and pen .
Describing all possible lines
We do n't have to rely on the human eye to find possible values of a and b .
As the following picture shows , the line y=ax +b has to pass between each of twelve vertical segments .
Each of the intervals gives rise to a condition on a and b , giving us 12 in all :
0 ≤ b < 1 1 ≤ a+b < 2 1 ≤ 2a+b < 2 2 ≤ 3a+b < 3 2 ≤ 4a+b < 3 3 ≤ 5a+b < 4 4 ≤ 6a+b < 5 4 ≤ 7a+b < 5 5 ≤ 8a+b < 6 5 ≤ 9a+b < 6 6 ≤ 10a+b < 7 7 ≤ 11a+b < 8
Each of these describes a region in the two dimensional plane in which a and b are coordinates .
Below are the regions associated to the conditions 0 ≤ b < 1 and 1 ≤ a+b < 2 .
The figure on the left shows where both these conditions are satisfied , and the one on the right shows where in addition 1 ≤ 2a+b < 2 ...
... and here we add the conditions 2 ≤ 3a+b < 3 , 2 ≤ 4a + b < 3 :
What we see is that the final region of all allowable ( a , b ) is going to be the inside of a convex polygon .
Zooming in a couple of times on the figure taking into account all of the inequalities , we see :
In other words , the region of allowable ( a , b ) is a quadrilateral .
One can calculate without too much trouble that its vertices are the lines through the points ( 1,1 ) and ( 11,7 ) ; ( 1,1 ) and ( 9,6 ) ; ( 4,3 ) and ( 11,7 ) ; ( 4,3 ) and ( 9,6 ) .
( This is an interesting exercise that can be done in many ways . )
Explicitly , the vertices of this region are ( 3/5,2/5 ) , ( 3/5,3/5 ) , ( 5/8,3/8 ) , and ( 4/7,5/7 ) .
It is the first that is used by the algorithm in Wikipedia , but to tell the truth it 's a bit dangerous to do so .
Computers work in arithmetic of base two , and 1/5 can not be represented exactly .
The diagram on the right above suggests that ( 0.601,0.401 ) would be safer .
Convexity
Let me summarize .
We are given an integer sequence {a m } where 0 ≤ m ≤ n , and want to know whether there exist a and b such that a m = [ am+b ] , and if so find a suitable pair .
The condition on a and b is that a m ≤ am+b < a m +1 for 0 ≤ m ≤ n .
The region of possible ( a , b ) is the intersection of a collection of 2n+2 half - planes a m ≤ am+b , am+b < a m + 1 for m=0 to n .
The mathematical problem is to find whether that region is empty , and if it not to find its extremal vertices .
This is a two - dimensional example of the classic problem of linear programming --- to move back and forth between the two ways of describing a convex polyhedron , ( a ) as the convex hull of its vertices , ( b ) the region bounded by its faces .
In two dimensions there is a simple solution .
Adding one inequality after the other , one has to deal with this problem : Given a polygon with vertices P i and an inequality ax + by+c ≤ 0 , find the vertices of the subset of the polygon where the inequality is satisfied .
The solution is to traverse the vertices and record where the line is crossed .
Augustun daze
The original calendar proposed by Julius Caesar was considerably more rational than the one we now use .
The month of August ( which was called Sextilis in those days before Augustus became emperor , as July had been called Quintilis before Julius came along ) had 30 days , September had 31 , and so on in alternation .
The formula for calculating the number of days elapsed from March 1 was then very simple .
But the month of July was dedicated to Julius Caesar , and when in turn the month of August came by decree to be dedicated to his successor Augustus , it was insisted that August be as long as July .
A day was stolen from February , and then the alternation of sizes was changed to make September shorter than August , and alternating 31/30 from that month on .
It 's not very amazing that these changes took place , but rather more amazing that we still live with the minor annoyances the vanity of a Roman emperor created .

Bargain hunters queued throughout Saturday outside the new store
One man was arrested when trendy fashion retailer Clockwork Orange opened a store at the Junction One retail outlet in Antrim .
About 2,000 people arrived for the opening and tempers frayed as people tried to jump the queue .
The shop opened at 0500 BST on Saturday for a " beat the clock " sale .
Bargain hunters were lining up for the promotion , where the cost of an item is based on the time of purchase .
' Ransacked '
Product manager Will McCooke said some people had lost all sense .
" We had beautiful girls with designer handbags and designer sunglasses on their hands and knees grabbing clothes , " he said .
" It was completely primeval - it was like hunter - gatherers .
" Within half an hour of the store opening the windows had been ransacked by people coming in and ripping the clothes off the mannequins and just leaving the mannequins on the ground .
" They were literally tearing the mannequins apart to get the clothes . "
He said that if you were in at 0500 BST , everything in the store would be £ 5 - from a £ 30 T - shirt to the £ 300 leather jacket .
" We actually had to close the fitting rooms because of the volume of people coming through - people were not trying things on , they were just grabbing handfuls of clothes and running to the cash desk . "
One man was arrested for disorderly behaviour , the PSNI said .

THE CAPITALIST THREAT - by George Soros ( 1997 )
Atlantic Monthly ^ | February 1997 | George Soros
Posted on by Dan from Michigan
THE CAPITALIST THREAT
What kind of society do we want ?
" Let the free market decide ! " is the often - heard response .
That response , a prominent capitalist argues , undermines the very values on which open and democratic societies depend .
by George Soros
In The Philosophy of History , Hegel discerned a disturbing historical pattern -- the crack and fall of civilizations owing to a morbid intensification of their own first principles .
Although I have made a fortune in the financial markets , I now fear that the untrammeled intensification of laissez - faire capitalism and the spread of market values into all areas of life is endangering our open and democratic society .
The main enemy of the open society , I believe , is no longer the communist but the capitalist threat .
The term " open society " was coined by Henri Bergson , in his book The Two Sources of Morality and Religion ( 1932 ) , and given greater currency by the Austrian philosopher Karl Popper , in his book The Open Society and Its Enemies ( 1945 ) .
Popper showed that totalitarian ideologies like communism and Nazism have a common element : they claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth .
Since the ultimate truth is beyond the reach of humankind , these ideologies have to resort to oppression in order to impose their vision on society .
Popper juxtaposed with these totalitarian ideologies another view of society , which recognizes that nobody has a monopoly on the truth ; different people have different views and different interests , and there is a need for institutions that allow them to live together in peace .
These institutions protect the rights of citizens and ensure freedom of choice and freedom of speech .
Popper called this form of social organization the " open society . "
Totalitarian ideologies were its enemies .
Written during the Second World War , The Open Society and Its Enemies explained what the Western democracies stood for and fought for .
The explanation was highly abstract and philosophical , and the term " open society " never gained wide recognition .
Nevertheless , Popper 's analysis was penetrating , and when I read it as a student in the late 1940s , having experienced at first hand both Nazi and Communist rule in Hungary , it struck me with the force of revelation .
I was driven to delve deeper into Karl Popper 's philosophy , and to ask , Why does nobody have access to the ultimate truth ?
The answer became clear :
We live in the same universe that we are trying to understand , and our perceptions can influence the events in which we participate .
If our thoughts belonged to one universe and their subject matter to another , the truth might be within our grasp : we could formulate statements corresponding to the facts , and the facts would serve as reliable criteria for deciding whether the statements were true .
There is a realm where these conditions prevail : natural science .
But in other areas of human endeavor the relationship between statements and facts is less clear - cut .
In social and political affairs the participants ' perceptions help to determine reality .
In these situations facts do not necessarily constitute reliable criteria for judging the truth of statements .
There is a two - way connection -- a feedback mechanism -- between thinking and events , which I have called " reflexivity . "
I have used it to develop a theory of history .
Whether the theory is valid or not , it has turned out to be very helpful to me in the financial markets .
When I had made more money than I needed , I decided to set up a foundation .
I reflected on what it was I really cared about .
Having lived through both Nazi persecution and Communist oppression , I came to the conclusion that what was paramount for me was an open society .
So I called the foundation the Open Society Fund , and I defined its objectives as opening up closed societies , making open societies more viable , and promoting a critical mode of thinking .
That was in 1979 .
My first major undertaking was in South Africa , but it was not successful .
The apartheid system was so pervasive that whatever I tried to do made me part of the system rather than helping to change it .
Then I turned my attention to Central Europe .
Here I was much more successful .
I started supporting the Charter 77 movement in Czechoslovakia in 1980 and Solidarity in Poland in 1981 .
I established separate foundations in my native country , Hungary , in 1984 , in China in 1986 , in the Soviet Union in 1987 , and in Poland in 1988 .
My engagement accelerated with the collapse of the Soviet system .
By now I have established a network of foundations that extends across more than twenty - five countries ( not including China , where we shut down in 1989 ) .
Operating under Communist regimes , I never felt the need to explain what " open society " meant ; those who supported the objectives of the foundations understood it better than I did , even if they were not familiar with the expression .
The goal of my foundation in Hungary , for example , was to support alternative activities .
I knew that the prevailing Communist dogma was false exactly because it was a dogma , and that it would become unsustainable if it was exposed to alternatives .
The approach proved effective .
The foundation became the main source of support for civil society in Hungary , and as civil society flourished , so the Communist regime waned .
After the collapse of communism , the mission of the foundation network changed .
Recognizing that an open society is a more advanced , more sophisticated form of social organization than a closed society ( because in a closed society there is only one blueprint , which is imposed on society , whereas in an open society each citizen is not only allowed but required to think for himself ) , the foundations shifted from a subversive task to a constructive one -- not an easy thing to do when the believers in an open society are accustomed to subversive activity .
Most of my foundations did a good job , but unfortunately , they did not have much company .
The open societies of the West did not feel a strong urge to promote open societies in the former Soviet empire .
On the contrary , the prevailing view was that people ought to be left to look after their own affairs .
The end of the Cold War brought a response very different from that at the end of the Second World War .
The idea of a new Marshall Plan could not even be mooted .
When I proposed such an idea at a conference in Potsdam ( in what was then still East Germany ) , in the spring of 1989 , I was literally laughed at .
The collapse of communism laid the groundwork for a universal open society , but the Western democracies failed to rise to the occasion .
The new regimes that are emerging in the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia bear little resemblance to open societies .
The Western alliance seems to have lost its sense of purpose , because it cannot define itself in terms of a Communist menace .
It has shown little inclination to come to the aid of those who have defended the idea of an open society in Bosnia or anywhere else .
As for the people living in formerly Communist countries , they might have aspired to an open society when they suffered from repression , but now that the Communist system has collapsed , they are preoccupied with the problems of survival .
After the failure of communism there came a general disillusionment with universal concepts , and the open society is a universal concept .
These considerations have forced me to re-examine my belief in the open society .
For five or six years following the fall of the Berlin Wall , I devoted practically all of my energies to the transformation of the formerly Communist world .
More recently I have redirected my attention to our own society .
The network of foundations I created continues to do good work ; nevertheless , I felt an urgent need to reconsider the conceptual framework that had guided me in establishing them .
This reassessment has led me to the conclusion that the concept of the open society has not lost its relevance .
On the contrary , it may be even more useful in understanding the present moment in history and in providing a practical guide to political action than it was at the time Karl Popper wrote his book -- but it needs to be thoroughly rethought and reformulated .
If the open society is to serve as an ideal worth striving for , it can no longer be defined in terms of the Communist menace .
It must be given a more positive content .
THE NEW ENEMY
OPPER showed that fascism and communism had much in common , even though one constituted the extreme right and the other the extreme left , because both relied on the power of the state to repress the freedom of the individual .
I want to extend his argument .
I contend that an open society may also be threatened from the opposite direction -- from excessive individualism .
Too much competition and too little cooperation can cause intolerable inequities and instability .
Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society today , it is a belief in the magic of the marketplace .
The doctrine of laissez - faire capitalism holds that the common good is best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self - interest .
Unless it is tempered by the recognition of a common interest that ought to take precedence over particular interests , our present system -- which , however imperfect , qualifies as an open society -- is liable to break down .
I want to emphasize , however , that I am not putting laissez - faire capitalism in the same category as Nazism or communism .
Totalitarian ideologies deliberately seek to destroy the open society ; laissez - faire policies may endanger it , but only inadvertently .
Friedrich Hayek , one of the apostles of laissez - faire , was also a passionate proponent of the open society .
Nevertheless , because communism and even socialism have been thoroughly discredited , I consider the threat from the laissez - faire side more potent today than the threat from totalitarian ideologies .
We are enjoying a truly global market economy in which goods , services , capital , and even people move around quite freely , but we fail to recognize the need to sustain the values and institutions of an open society .
The present situation is comparable to that at the turn of the past century .
It was a golden age of capitalism , characterized by the principle of laissez - faire ; so is the present .
The earlier period was in some ways more stable .
There was an imperial power , England , that was prepared to dispatch gunboats to faraway places because as the main beneficiary of the system it had a vested interest in maintaining that system .
Today the United States does not want to be the policeman of the world .
The earlier period had the gold standard ; today the main currencies float and crush against each other like continental plates .
Yet the free - market regime that prevailed a hundred years ago was destroyed by the First World War .
Totalitarian ideologies came to the fore , and by the end of the Second World War there was practically no movement of capital between countries .
How much more likely the present regime is to break down unless we learn from experience !
Although laissez - faire doctrines do not contradict the principles of the open society the way Marxism - Leninism or Nazi ideas of racial purity did , all these doctrines have an important feature in common : they all try to justify their claim to ultimate truth with an appeal to science .
In the case of totalitarian doctrines , that appeal could easily be dismissed .
One of Popper 's accomplishments was to show that a theory like Marxism does not qualify as science .
In the case of laissez - faire the claim is more difficult to dispute , because it is based on economic theory , and economics is the most reputable of the social sciences .
One cannot simply equate market economics with Marxist economics .
Yet laissez - faire ideology , I contend , is just as much a perversion of supposedly scientific verities as Marxism - Leninism is .
The main scientific underpinning of the laissez - faire ideology is the theory that free and competitive markets bring supply and demand into equilibrium and thereby ensure the best allocation of resources .
This is widely accepted as an eternal verity , and in a sense it is one .
Economic theory is an axiomatic system : as long as the basic assumptions hold , the conclusions follow .
But when we examine the assumptions closely , we find that they do not apply to the real world .
As originally formulated , the theory of perfect competition -- of the natural equilibrium of supply and demand -- assumed perfect knowledge , homogeneous and easily divisible products , and a large enough number of market participants that no single participant could influence the market price .
The assumption of perfect knowledge proved unsustainable , so it was replaced by an ingenious device .
Supply and demand were taken as independently given .
This condition was presented as a methodological requirement rather than an assumption .
It was argued that economic theory studies the relationship between supply and demand ; therefore it must take both of them as given .
As I have shown elsewhere , the condition that supply and demand are independently given cannot be reconciled with reality , at least as far as the financial markets are concerned -- and financial markets play a crucial role in the allocation of resources .
Buyers and sellers in financial markets seek to discount a future that depends on their own decisions .
The shape of the supply and demand curves cannot be taken as given because both of them incorporate expectations about events that are shaped by those expectations .
There is a two - way feedback mechanism between the market participants ' thinking and the situation they think about -- " reflexivity . "
It accounts for both the imperfect understanding of the participants ( recognition of which is the basis of the concept of the open society ) and the indeterminacy of the process in which they participate .
If the supply and demand curves are not independently given , how are market prices determined ?
If we look at the behavior of financial markets , we find that instead of tending toward equilibrium , prices continue to fluctuate relative to the expectations of buyers and sellers .
There are prolonged periods when prices are moving away from any theoretical equilibrium .
Even if they eventually show a tendency to return , the equilibrium is not the same as it would have been without the intervening period .
Yet the concept of equilibrium endures .
It is easy to see why : without it , economics could not say how prices are determined .
In the absence of equilibrium , the contention that free markets lead to the optimum allocation of resources loses its justification .
The supposedly scientific theory that has been used to validate it turns out to be an axiomatic structure whose conclusions are contained in its assumptions and are not necessarily supported by the empirical evidence .
The resemblance to Marxism , which also claimed scientific status for its tenets , is too close for comfort .
I do not mean to imply that economic theory has deliberately distorted reality for political purposes .
But in trying to imitate the accomplishments ( and win for itself the prestige ) of natural science , economic theory attempted the impossible .
The theories of social science relate to their subject matter in a reflexive manner .
That is to say , they can influence events in a way that the theories of natural science cannot .
Heisenberg 's famous uncertainty principle implies that the act of observation may interfere with the behavior of quantum particles ; but it is the observation that creates the effect , not the uncertainty principle itself .
In the social sphere , theories have the capacity to alter the subject matter to which they relate .
Economic theory has deliberately excluded reflexivity from consideration .
In doing so , it has distorted its subject matter and laid itself open to exploitation by laissez - faire ideology .
What allows economic theory to be converted into an ideology hostile to the open society is the assumption of perfect knowledge -- at first openly stated and then disguised in the form of a methodological device .
There is a powerful case for the market mechanism , but it is not that markets are perfect ; it is that in a world dominated by imperfect understanding , markets provide an efficient feedback mechanism for evaluating the results of one 's decisions and correcting mistakes .
Whatever its form , the assertion of perfect knowledge stands in contradiction to the concept of the open society ( which recognizes that our understanding of our situation is inherently imperfect ) .
Since this point is abstract , I need to describe specific ways in which laissez - faire ideas can pose a threat to the open society .
I shall focus on three issues : economic stability , social justice , and international relations .
ECONOMIC STABILITY
ECONOMIC theory has managed to create an artificial world in which the participants ' preferences and the opportunities confronting participants are independent of each other , and prices tend toward an equilibrium that brings the two forces into balance .
But in financial markets prices are not merely the passive reflection of independently given demand and supply ; they also play an active role in shaping those preferences and opportunities .
This reflexive interaction renders financial markets inherently unstable .
Laissez - faire ideology denies the instability and opposes any form of government intervention aimed at preserving stability .
History has shown that financial markets do break down , causing economic depression and social unrest .
The breakdowns have led to the evolution of central banking and other forms of regulation .
Laissez - faire ideologues like to argue that the breakdowns were caused by faulty regulations , not by unstable markets .
There is some validity in their argument , because if our understanding is inherently imperfect , regulations are bound to be defective .
But their argument rings hollow , because it fails to explain why the regulations were imposed in the first place .
It sidesteps the issue by using a different argument , which goes like this : since regulations are faulty , unregulated markets are perfect .
The argument rests on the assumption of perfect knowledge : if a solution is wrong , its opposite must be right .
In the absence of perfect knowledge , however , both free markets and regulations are flawed .
Stability can be preserved only if a deliberate effort is made to preserve it .
Even then breakdowns will occur , because public policy is often faulty .
If they are severe enough , breakdowns may give rise to totalitarian regimes .
Instability extends well beyond financial markets : it affects the values that guide people in their actions .
Economic theory takes values as given .
At the time economic theory was born , in the age of Adam Smith , David Ricardo , and Alfred Marshall , this was a reasonable assumption , because people did , in fact , have firmly established values .
Adam Smith himself combined a moral philosophy with his economic theory .
Beneath the individual preferences that found expression in market behavior , people were guided by a set of moral principles that found expression in behavior outside the scope of the market mechanism .
Deeply rooted in tradition , religion , and culture , these principles were not necessarily rational in the sense of representing conscious choices among available alternatives .
Indeed , they often could not hold their own when alternatives became available .
Market values served to undermine traditional values .
There has been an ongoing conflict between market values and other , more traditional value systems , which has aroused strong passions and antagonisms .
As the market mechanism has extended its sway , the fiction that people act on the basis of a given set of nonmarket values has become progressively more difficult to maintain .
Advertising , marketing , even packaging , aim at shaping people 's preferences rather than , as laissez - faire theory holds , merely responding to them .
Unsure of what they stand for , people increasingly rely on money as the criterion of value .
What is more expensive is considered better .
The value of a work of art can be judged by the price it fetches .
People deserve respect and admiration because they are rich .
What used to be a medium of exchange has usurped the place of fundamental values , reversing the relationship postulated by economic theory .
What used to be professions have turned into businesses .
The cult of success has replaced a belief in principles .
Society has lost its anchor .
SOCIAL DARWINISM
BY taking the conditions of supply and demand as given and declaring government intervention the ultimate evil , laissez - faire ideology has effectively banished income or wealth redistribution .
I can agree that all attempts at redistribution interfere with the efficiency of the market , but it does not follow that no attempt should be made .
The laissez - faire argument relies on the same tacit appeal to perfection as does communism .
It claims that if redistribution causes inefficiencies and distortions , the problems can be solved by eliminating redistribution -- just as the Communists claimed that the duplication involved in competition is wasteful , and therefore we should have a centrally planned economy .
But perfection is unattainable .
Wealth does accumulate in the hands of its owners , and if there is no mechanism for redistribution , the inequities can become intolerable .
" Money is like muck , not good except it be spread . "
Francis Bacon was a profound economist .
The laissez - faire argument against income redistribution invokes the doctrine of the survival of the fittest .
The argument is undercut by the fact that wealth is passed on by inheritance , and the second generation is rarely as fit as the first .
In any case , there is something wrong with making the survival of the fittest a guiding principle of civilized society .
This social Darwinism is based on an outmoded theory of evolution , just as the equilibrium theory in economics is taking its cue from Newtonian physics .
The principle that guides the evolution of species is mutation , and mutation works in a much more sophisticated way .
Species and their environment are interactive , and one species serves as part of the environment for the others .
There is a feedback mechanism similar to reflexivity in history , with the difference being that in history the mechanism is driven not by mutation but by misconceptions .
I mention this because social Darwinism is one of the misconceptions driving human affairs today .
The main point I want to make is that cooperation is as much a part of the system as competition , and the slogan " survival of the fittest " distorts this fact .
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LAISSEZ -FAIRE ideology shares some of the deficiencies of another spurious science , geopolitics .
States have no principles , only interests , geopoliticians argue , and those interests are determined by geographic location and other fundamentals .
This deterministic approach is rooted in an outdated nineteenth - century view of scientific method , and it suffers from at least two glaring defects that do not apply with the same force to the economic doctrines of laissez - faire .
One is that it treats the state as the indivisible unit of analysis , just as economics treats the individual .
There is something contradictory in banishing the state from the economy while at the same time enshrining it as the ultimate source of authority in international relations .
But let that pass .
There is a more pressing practical aspect of the problem .
What happens when a state disintegrates ?
Geopolitical realists find themselves totally unprepared .
That is what happened when the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia disintegrated .
The other defect of geopolitics is that it does not recognize a common interest beyond the national interest .
With the demise of communism , the present state of affairs , however imperfect , can be described as a global open society .
It is not threatened from the outside , from some totalitarian ideology seeking world supremacy .
The threat comes from the inside , from local tyrants seeking to establish internal dominance through external conflicts .
It may also come from democratic but sovereign states pursuing their self - interest to the detriment of the common interest .
The international open society may be its own worst enemy .
The Cold War was an extremely stable arrangement .
Two power blocs , representing opposing concepts of social organization , were struggling for supremacy , but they had to respect each other 's vital interests , because each side was capable of destroying the other in an all - out war .
This put a firm limit on the extent of the conflict ; all local conflicts were , in turn , contained by the larger conflict .
This extremely stable world order has come to an end as the result of the internal disintegration of one superpower .
No new world order has taken its place .
We have entered a period of disorder .
Laissez - faire ideology does not prepare us to cope with this challenge .
It does not recognize the need for a world order .
An order is supposed to emerge from states ' pursuit of their self - interest .
But , guided by the principle of the survival of the fittest , states are increasingly preoccupied with their competitiveness and unwilling to make any sacrifices for the common good .
There is no need to make any dire predictions about the eventual breakdown of our global trading system in order to show that a laissez - faire ideology is incompatible with the concept of the open society .
It is enough to consider the free world 's failure to extend a helping hand after the collapse of communism .
The system of robber capitalism that has taken hold in Russia is so iniquitous that people may well turn to a charismatic leader promising national revival at the cost of civil liberties .
If there is any lesson to be learned , it is that the collapse of a repressive regime does not automatically lead to the establishment of an open society .
An open society is not merely the absence of government intervention and oppression .
It is a complicated , sophisticated structure , and deliberate effort is required to bring it into existence .
Since it is more sophisticated than the system it replaces , a speedy transition requires outside assistance .
But the combination of laissez - faire ideas , social Darwinism , and geopolitical realism that prevailed in the United States and the United Kingdom stood in the way of any hope for an open society in Russia .
If the leaders of these countries had had a different view of the world , they could have established firm foundations for a global open society .
At the time of the Soviet collapse there was an opportunity to make the UN function as it was originally designed to .
Mikhail Gorbachev visited the United Nations in 1988 and outlined his vision of the two superpowers cooperating to bring peace and security to the world .
Since then the opportunity has faded .
The UN has been thoroughly discredited as a peacekeeping institution .
Bosnia is doing to the UN what Abyssinia did to the League of Nations in 1936 .
Our global open society lacks the institutions and mechanisms necessary for its preservation , but there is no political will to bring them into existence .
I blame the prevailing attitude , which holds that the unhampered pursuit of self - interest will bring about an eventual international equilibrium .
I believe this confidence is misplaced .
I believe that the concept of the open society , which needs institutions to protect it , may provide a better guide to action .
As things stand , it does not take very much imagination to realize that the global open society that prevails at present is likely to prove a temporary phenomenon .
THE PROMISE OF FALLIBILITY
IT is easier to identify the enemies of the open society than to give the concept a positive meaning .
Yet without such a positive meaning the open society is bound to fall prey to its enemies .
There has to be a common interest to hold a community together , but the open society is not a community in the traditional sense of the word .
It is an abstract idea , a universal concept .
Admittedly , there is such a thing as a global community ; there are common interests on a global level , such as the preservation of the environment and the prevention of war .
But these interests are relatively weak in comparison with special interests .
They do not have much of a constituency in a world composed of sovereign states .
Moreover , the open society as a universal concept transcends all boundaries .
Societies derive their cohesion from shared values .
These values are rooted in culture , religion , history , and tradition .
When a society does not have boundaries , where are the shared values to be found ?
I believe there is only one possible source : the concept of the open society itself .
To fulfill this role , the concept of the open society needs to be redefined .
Instead of there being a dichotomy between open and closed , I see the open society as occupying a middle ground , where the rights of the individual are safeguarded but where there are some shared values that hold society together .
This middle ground is threatened from all sides .
At one extreme , communist and nationalist doctrines would lead to state domination .
At the other extreme , laissez - faire capitalism would lead to great instability and eventual breakdown .
There are other variants .
Lee Kuan Yew , of Singapore , proposes a so - called Asian model that combines a market economy with a repressive state .
In many parts of the world control of the state is so closely associated with the creation of private wealth that one might speak of robber capitalism , or the " gangster state , " as a new threat to the open society .
I envisage the open society as a society open to improvement .
We start with the recognition of our own fallibility , which extends not only to our mental constructs but also to our institutions .
What is imperfect can be improved , by a process of trial and error .
The open society not only allows this process but actually encourages it , by insisting on freedom of expression and protecting dissent .
The open society offers a vista of limitless progress .
In this respect it has an affinity with the scientific method .
But science has at its disposal objective criteria -- namely the facts by which the process may be judged .
Unfortunately , in human affairs the facts do not provide reliable criteria of truth , yet we need some generally agreed - upon standards by which the process of trial and error can be judged .
All cultures and religions offer such standards ; the open society cannot do without them .
The innovation in an open society is that whereas most cultures and religions regard their own values as absolute , an open society , which is aware of many cultures and religions , must regard its own shared values as a matter of debate and choice .
To make the debate possible , there must be general agreement on at least one point : that the open society is a desirable form of social organization .
People must be free to think and act , subject only to limits imposed by the common interests .
Where the limits are must also be determined by trial and error .
The Declaration of Independence may be taken as a pretty good approximation of the principles of an open society , but instead of claiming that those principles are self - evident , we ought to say that they are consistent with our fallibility .
Could the recognition of our imperfect understanding serve to establish the open society as a desirable form of social organization ?
I believe it could , although there are formidable difficulties in the way .
We must promote a belief in our own fallibility to the status that we normally confer on a belief in ultimate truth .
But if ultimate truth is not attainable , how can we accept our fallibility as ultimate truth ?
This is an apparent paradox , but it can be resolved .
The first proposition , that our understanding is imperfect , is consistent with a second proposition : that we must accept the first proposition as an article of faith .
The need for articles of faith arises exactly because our understanding is imperfect .
If we enjoyed perfect knowledge , there would be no need for beliefs .
But to accept this line of reasoning requires a profound change in the role that we accord our beliefs .
Historically , beliefs have served to justify specific rules of conduct .
Fallibility ought to foster a different attitude .
Beliefs ought to serve to shape our lives , not to make us abide by a given set of rules .
If we recognize that our beliefs are expressions of our choices , not of ultimate truth , we are more likely to tolerate other beliefs and to revise our own in the light of our experiences .
But that is not how most people treat their beliefs .
They tend to identify their beliefs with ultimate truth .
Indeed , that identification often serves to define their own identity .
If their experience of living in an open society obliges them to give up their claim to the ultimate truth , they feel a sense of loss .
The idea that we somehow embody the ultimate truth is deeply ingrained in our thinking .
We may be endowed with critical faculties , but we are inseparably tied to ourselves .
We may have discovered truth and morality , but , above all , we must represent our interests and our selves .
Therefore , if there are such things as truth and justice -- and we have come to believe that there are -- then we want to be in possession of them .
We demand truth from religion and , recently , from science .
A belief in our fallibility is a poor substitute .
It is a highly sophisticated concept , much more difficult to work with than more primitive beliefs , such as my country ( or my company or my family ) , right or wrong .
If the idea of our fallibility is so hard to take , what makes it appealing ?
The most powerful argument in its favor is to be found in the results it produces .
Open societies tend to be more prosperous , more innovative , more stimulating , than closed ones .
But there is a danger in proposing success as the sole basis for holding a belief , because if my theory of reflexivity is valid , being successful is not identical with being right .
In natural science , theories have to be right ( in the sense that the predictions and explanations they produce correspond to the facts ) for them to work ( in the sense of producing useful predictions and explanations ) .
But in the social sphere what is effective is not necessarily identical with what is right , because of the reflexive connection between thinking and reality .
As I hinted earlier , the cult of success can become a source of instability in an open society , because it can undermine our sense of right and wrong .
That is what is happening in our society today .
Our sense of right and wrong is endangered by our preoccupation with success , as measured by money .
Anything goes , as long as you can get away with it .
If success were the only criterion , the open society would lose out against totalitarian ideologies -- as indeed it did on many occasions .
It is much easier to argue for my own interest than to go through the whole rigmarole of abstract reasoning from fallibility to the concept of the open society .
The concept of the open society needs to be more firmly grounded .
There has to be a commitment to the open society because it is the right form of social organization .
Such a commitment is hard to come by .
I believe in the open society because it allows us to develop our potential better than a social system that claims to be in possession of ultimate truth .
Accepting the unattainable character of truth offers a better prospect for freedom and prosperity than denying it .
But I recognize a problem here : I am sufficiently committed to the pursuit of truth to find the case for the open society convincing , but I am not sure that other people will share my point of view .
Given the reflexive connection between thinking and reality , truth is not indispensable for success .
It may be possible to attain specific objectives by twisting or denying the truth , and people may be more interested in attaining their specific objectives than in attaining the truth .
Only at the highest level of abstraction , when we consider the meaning of life , does truth take on paramount importance .
Even then , deception may be preferable to the truth , because life entails death and death is difficult to accept .
Indeed , one could argue that the open society is the best form of social organization for making the most of life , whereas the closed society is the form best suited to the acceptance of death .
In the ultimate analysis a belief in the open society is a matter of choice , not of logical necessity .
That is not all .
Even if the concept of the open society were universally accepted , that would not be sufficient to ensure that freedom and prosperity would prevail .
The open society merely provides a framework within which different views about social and political issues can be reconciled ; it does not offer a firm view on social goals .
If it did , it would not be an open society .
This means that people must hold other beliefs in addition to their belief in the open society .
Only in a closed society does the concept of the open society provide a sufficient basis for political action ; in an open society it is not enough to be a democrat ; one must be a liberal democrat or a social democrat or a Christian democrat or some other kind of democrat .
A shared belief in the open society is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for freedom and prosperity and all the good things that the open society is supposed to bring .
It can be seen that the concept of the open society is a seemingly inexhaustible source of difficulties .
That is to be expected .
After all , the open society is based on the recognition of our fallibility .
Indeed , it stands to reason that our ideal of the open society is unattainable .
To have a blueprint for it would be self - contradictory .
That does not mean that we should not strive toward it .
In science also , ultimate truth is unattainable .
Yet look at the progress we have made in pursuing it .
Similarly , the open society can be approximated to a greater or lesser extent .
To derive a political and social agenda from a philosophical , epistemological argument seems like a hopeless undertaking .
Yet it can be done .
There is historical precedent .
The Enlightenment was a celebration of the power of reason , and it provided the inspiration for the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights .
The belief in reason was carried to excess in the French Revolution , with unpleasant side effects ; nevertheless , it was the beginning of modernity .
We have now had 200 years of experience with the Age of Reason , and as reasonable people we ought to recognize that reason has its limitations .
The time is ripe for developing a conceptual framework based on our fallibility .
Where reason has failed , fallibility may yet succeed

What is going on here ?
My 2 cents .
Soros and the Dem party are now gunning to make the US a wholly dependent subsidiary of the UN .
They want to ensure that the US 's hands are so tied in the future that it will be incapacitated .
Remember Gulliver tied down by a million threads by the little people .
The Democrat Party , utterly bankrupt in the field of foreign policy and realistic thinking has given up the ghost and wants to make US dance to the UN ONLY .
Watch for subterranean warfare carried out by the financial forces of Soros to weaken the US and Bush in preparation for the election next year .
The bright spot on the horizon ?
A civil war in Saudi which forces Bush to grasp the nettle and do what 's necessary , rallying the American people to his cause and re-election at the same time .

Perhaps .
But even as we speak , South America is going Communist ... and GWB is failing to ' grasp the nettle and do what 's necessary ' there .
Too many components of his own inner circle are compromised ... James Baker III , Jack Kemp , and of course , Colin Powell .
Even Dick Cheney for Pete 's sake .
What a predicament .

Soros makes his money by engaging in speculative currency trades .
His " dog in the fight " is less about the UN and more about preserving international banking secrecy , which is being threatened by the war on terrorism .
In short , he wants to be able to trash other country 's economies at his own whim , even if it means allowing al - Qaeda to kill a few thousand or more people at one time .
After all , you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs .
Currency speculators are , by their nature , shady characters without especially firm codes of ethics .
They frequently have to procure information not generally available to the public ; said information is often found in the hands of goobermint employees or elected officials .
( Can you say " bribery , " boys and girls ? " I knew you could ! )
They frequently come across other shady persons engaged in nefarious actions .
They usually do not report this stuff to the authorities , because it will engender all manner of awkward questioning re : how they happened to learn about the nefarious actions .

Interesting in light of the following piece from FT .
A new UN report , obtained by the Financial Times , reveals that despite " considerable progress " in combating terrorist financing , al - Qaeda related businesses and charities continue to operate across the globe .
It highlights the activities of Youssef Nada and Idris Nasreddin , directors of al - Taqwa , a financial group the US believes was the most important fund - raising operation for al - Qaeda .
The report says the two men continue to maintain commercial interests and property in Italy and Switzerland , despite their designation as terrorist financiers .
It says Mr Nada travelled to Liechtenstein in January and tried to re-register two al - Taqwa related companies under new names .
By doing so he violated a UN - sanctioned travel ban .

I 'd use variations of manipulation , myself to describe what Soros is up to ... speculation is , IMO , legitimate to a degree .
It implies that one SPECULATES on what might happen .
Soros is more interested in a " sure thing " on that front - ergo , I consider him to be into currency MANIPULATION .

Excellent clarification .
However , " speculation " is a necessary term of art -- actively admitting that you 're trying to manipulate national currencies is a great way to , for example , be declared an " Enemy of the Realm " by Her Majesty 's Government ( which he richly earned after crashing the pound in 1991 ) .

... laissez - faire ideology has effectively banished income or wealth redistribution .
I can agree that all attempts at redistribution interfere with the efficiency of the market , but it does not follow that no attempt should be made .
Then the hypocrit ought to redistribute HIS wealth .
I volunteer to relieve Soros of his filty lucre .
To : Poohbah
The clarification is essential , IMHO .
If I buy stock , I am betting the company is going to perform well , and thus increase the stock price .
The only active involvement a speculator has is to buy the stock .
If I were to do with stocks what Soros does to currency , I 'd sell short , and then I 'd have a bunch of my buddies talk down the company just before it 's time for me to buy back the stock I sold short .
The latter would get me some VERY long discussions with people from the Securities and Exchange Commission , and it could mean time in substandard federally subsidized housing facility .

Exactly .
How Soros has lived as long as he has - - 74 years -- is a mystery to me .
If I 'd been John Major in 1991 , I would 've invited M to lunch at my club and made a discreet inquiry about whether or not Commander Bond , RNVR , was available for assignment .

Republican Newt Gingrich is so unimpressed with his own party 's ' chaotic ' line - up of candidates to replace President Bush in the 2008 elections that he has threatened to make a dramatic late entry into the race .
The 64 - year - old former Speaker of the House spent last week making speeches attacking Bush 's handling of Iraq and the ' war on terror ' and calling for ' big ideas ' that would unite a disillusioned America behind a strong rival to Clinton .
He called General David Petraeus 's report to Congress on the military surge in Iraq ' wholly inadequate ' , adding : ' The gap between where we are and where we should be is so large it seems almost impossible to explain . '
Gingrich plans to criss - cross the country in the next few weeks holding ' workshops ' with politicians and fundraisers before assessing his chances of winning the Republican nomination over the leading candidates who have already declared : former New York mayor and narrow favourite Rudy Giuliani , film actor and former senator Fred Thompson , war veteran John McCain and millionaire Mormon Mitt Romney .
Republican sympathies are scattered , while Democrats are lining up far more clearly behind Clinton .
She has about 40 per cent of support , with Barack Obama and John Edwards trailing by a significant margin .
At a small breakfast gathering in a Washington hotel overlooking the White House , Gingrich told The Observer he will decide next month on a run for president and will jump into the race if ' there is a large enough vacuum on our side , if people get frightened enough of the prospect of President Clinton - and if I have enough money . '
Gingrich is a darling of the right who shot to fame when he spearheaded a massive mid-term electoral victory for the Republicans in 1994 .
They took control of the House of Representatives , against all odds , for the first time in 40 years and made Gingrich their star .
He spent the next four years undercutting Bill Clinton 's policies and shifting his party to the right , and became instrumental in forcing the President 's impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky affair .
He later admitted that he had cheated on both his first and second wife and was having his own affair with a younger woman - now his third wife - at the same time Clinton was romancing Lewinsky in the Oval Office .
Gingrich was forced out by his own party when his viciously negative campaign in the 1998 mid-term elections saw his party lose vital seats .
He left Congress in 1999 , but his name is burnt into the memories of both friends and enemies , and the prospect of him coming back to haunt Hillary is causing a huge buzz in Washington and beyond .
' There is a tremendous amount of goodwill towards Newt among grassroots conservatives and he still remains one of the leading thinkers and ideas people in the Republican party .
And he would be popular with swing voters .
I would like to see him in this process , ' said Saul Anuzis , chairman of the Michigan Republican Party .
Gingrich 's big ideas include more tax cuts , bringing market forces to bear even more strongly in US healthcare , and creating a military and economic blockade of Iran aimed at crippling the country and strangling its influence .
He takes an interest in environmental politics : he has written a book on green issues that comes out next month .
However , rather than taxing and regulating polluters , he wants to reduce carbon emissions and global warming with ' cash prizes ' , tax incentives and ecological entrepreneurialism .
' If you had a $ 1bn prize for inventing the first mass - produced hydrogen - powered car , it would happen pretty quickly , ' he said .
Democrats claim to be salivating at the prospect of a Gingrich candidacy .
' Hillary and the Democrats would love Newt Gingrich as the Republican nominee .
We 'd pick up all the swing voters , ' said Bob Mulholland , a member of the Democratic National Committee and a veteran Bill Clinton adviser .
' He is not presidential material .
He is a flame - thrower , but Newt 's time has gone .
And his personal life is not in shape . '
Gingrich admits he was weak when he committed adultery , but claims he was not a hypocrite because he never lied to Congress .
Anuzis said he did not think Gingrich 's multiple marriages and infidelities would bother the majority of Republicans these days : ' Bill Clinton changed the definition of politics and nowadays it 's more about policies and less about whether someone inhaled or got a divorce .
He set a new level of the bar and it would be difficult to find another politician who could wriggle below that .'
All candidates wishing to enter the Utah primary are obliged to have paid their entry fees by 15 October .
Either way , Gingrich will need to have made a decision by then .
Yet Chino ’s turn to militant Islam was neither swift nor decisive .
He felt conflicted about his criminal livelihood but unwilling to start over .
His solution , his brothers said , was to give his money away .
He dispensed with watches .
He regaled his Moroccan nieces with gold necklaces and rings .
One day , while traveling in Holland , he called his brothers and told them to set fire to his cars .
“ Life is worth nothing , ” Chino told his brother Mustafa .
“ We wo n’t live long . ” ( They ignored the instruction .
“ Mustafa likes cars , ” one brother explained . )
Chino had come to believe that Muslims who earn money illegally suffer in the afterlife — unless they put the money to good use .
He began sending cash to the mother of the man he had stabbed in Tetouan .
He continued to drink and do drugs .
But his drunken binges sometimes ended with him crying over the stabbing and the mother of the victim , one of his Madrid friends , Abdelilah el Fadwal el Akil , recalled .
“ He would say that it was his fault she had lost a son , and that the least he could do was take care of her , ” Akil wrote to me from a Spanish prison , where he was being held as a defendant in the Madrid bombing trial .
During a rare visit home to Morocco in 2000 , Chino was arrested for the man ’s murder and imprisoned in Tetouan .
But key evidence was still missing in the case , including a witness who failed to appear .
Chino ’s parents hired a local criminal attorney , Mourad Elkharraz , who told them their son stood a good chance of acquittal .
The lawyer assured them that the process would take no more than a year .
Instead , it dragged on for three .
During that time , the lawyer witnessed a startling transformation in his client .
At first , the change was merely physical .
Chino went from wearing gold necklaces and jeans to a gray , Afghan - style tunic and matching pants .
He began carrying a Koran .
Then he started fasting on Mondays and Thursdays .
He stopped swearing and began peppering his sentences with “ Allah . ”
Eventually he became a prison imam , leading prayers five times a day .
“ He said : ‘ I ’ve become someone else .
I ’m a new man , ’ ” the lawyer told me .
“ But his anger rose more and more . ”
Chino grew deeply frustrated by the delays in his case .
He yearned to see his son , an absence that “ broke his heart , ” Chino ’s mother said .
He lost his temper in meetings with his lawyer , demanding to know why his case had not been resolved .
Yet every time Chino got angry , his lawyer recalled , something odd happened : he turned to the subject of Palestine .
He seemed to conflate the personal with the political .
In one breath , he would say that “ Jews mistreat Muslims ” ; in another , that he wanted to “ do jihad ” to the Moroccan judges who kept him in prison .
By then , Chino had befriended another prisoner who belonged to a banned Islamist party , Justice and Charity .
Chino took a brief interest in the group , but he concluded it was “ too passive , ” according to documents filed in the Madrid bombing case .
Chino was finally freed from the Moroccan prison in June 2003 ; the court declared him innocent of the murder charge , Elkharraz , his lawyer , said .
But Chino returned to Spain a different man .
He had become obsessed with the war in Iraq , his brothers recalled .
He said he could n’t sleep at night knowing that women and children were dying at the hands of Americans , all in the greedy pursuit of oil .
He no longer had time for small talk .
He would walk into a room and within minutes begin the same diatribe .
“ He would say , ‘ The soldiers of bin Laden are soldiers of God , ’ ” Chino ’s brother Jaber told me .
“ Because the world was looking for them — ”
“ And could n’t find them , ” said another brother , finishing the sentence .
Chino told his brothers to cut their hair , to stop smoking , to stop going out with girls .
He scolded them for not praying and urged a sister in Holland to wear a veil .
He seemed agitated that so many of his siblings — eight in all — had moved to Europe and began pressing them to return to Morocco .
“ This is n’t paradise , ” he would tell them .
They soon tired of his campaign .
He had become unbearably serious .
He told his childhood friend Anwar that if he wanted to continue the friendship , “ you have to go to the mosque . ”
President Ahmadinejad was jeered when he addressed Columbia
" We 're not taking it too seriously , " said a White House spokeswoman .
She said Mr Bush might have considered the invitation if Iran allowed freedom of expression , did not have nuclear ambitions , and did not threaten Israel .
Columbia University 's head last week introduced Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a " petty and cruel dictator " .
The head of Ferdowsi University in Iran 's second city of Mashhad - one of the country 's oldest universities - said Mr Bush could answer students ' questions about the Holocaust , terrorism and human rights .
" This is what President Ahmadinejad did , despite the lack of respect shown towards him , " said Ferdowsi University president Alireza Afshour , according to the government daily newspaper Iran .
Columbia University president Lee Bollinger last week condemned Mr Ahmadinejad for denying the Holocaust took place , saying he was either " brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated " .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's assertion that there were no gays in Iran also drew jeers from the audience .
A White House spokeswoman responded to the invitation on behalf of Mr Bush : " If Iran was a free and democratic society that allowed its people freedom of expression , and was n't pursuing nuclear weapons , and was n't advocating to destroy the country of Israel , the president might consider that invitation . "
Protests at home
Earlier this week , on his return from New York , President Ahmadinejad was due to speak at Tehran University .
Students there wrote him a letter asking about the academic freedoms he had described to his New York audience .
They complained about arrests of students and staff members and what they said were the appalling punishments handed out to critics of the president .
They asked to be allowed to meet Mr Ahmadinejad and when they received no reply , they threatened to stage a protest outside the hall , says John Leyne , a BBC correspondent in Tehran .
Shortly afterwards President Ahmadinejad cancelled his visit , though his office said it was because of the current religious festival being celebrated in Iran , our correspondent says .
" Endism " has been a favorite neoconservative theme over the years : every once in a while the neocons announce the death of some commonly assumed idea that the rest of us take for granted  during the 1950s , for example , they wrote the obituary of ideology itself , proclaiming that their own self - satisfied complacency was the apotheosis of human achievement .
In the early 1990s , we heard all about the purported " End of History , " similar to " the end of ideology , " except extended to the four corners of the earth .
No one thought it at all unusual or alarming when Irving Kristol welcomed Hegel and his contemporary doppelgänger into the pages of The National Interest , at the time the leading neocon theoretical journal devoted to foreign policy .
More recently we have seen the implicit endism energizing the post - 9/11 ideology of the official conservative movement , which has ended its long - standing defense of the Constitution , narrowly constructed , against the modern liberal " expansionist , " or loose constructionist , view , which likens the original intent of the Framers to the primitive thoughts of Neanderthal man and avers that the Constitution and its meaning are always " evolving . "
The rise of the surveillance state , the repeal of habeas corpus , the consolidation of a police - state apparatus that spies on Americans and foreigners at will  these post - 9/11 assaults on constitutional government in America have all been adopted as holy writ by a thoroughly neoconized " conservative " movement , which these days is just an adjunct of the GOP .
The Goldwater - fusionist devotion to decentralized power , the genuine fear of Big Government , the libertarian disdain for officialdom and its inherent inefficiencies have all been thrown overboard and a state - and - leader - worshipping cult of power installed in their place .
As the favorite slogan of these post - 9/11 Bizarro - cons puts it : Everything has changed .
Including what used to be called " conservatism , " which morphed rapidly into an inverted funhouse - mirror image of itself .
The neocons have been consistently wrong in their " endism , " although this sorry record has n’t punctured their intellectual pretensions .
The Grand Consensus of the 1950s , which saw the welfare - warfare state as the culmination and endpoint of Western civilization , was soon wrecked on the rocky shores of the 1960s , which gave birth to a popular rebellion against an unpopular foreign war and a thoroughgoing exposure and rejection of the government ’s war on domestic dissent .
The termination of History , announced by Francis Fukuyama in his famous 1992 essay , proved even more problematic , what with 9/11 and the subsequent Middle Eastern wars that promise to preoccupy us for decades to come .
Instead of blending into the bureaucratic grayness of the Universal Homogenous State  as Fukuyama ’s inspiration , the philosopher Alexandre Kojève , characterized the " final form of human government "  the waters are roiled by powerful currents of nationalism and religiosity that threaten to unleash a global conflagration .
The implied end of constitutional government in America , as a matter of supposed necessity , may have been yet another case of premature burial .
There are now powerful dissents coming from conservatives , including this pledge to uphold the Bill of Rights and " restore the Constitution ’s checks and balances as enshrined by the Founders , " issued to all the GOP presidential candidates by a panel of right - wing leaders .
Add to this the excitement generated among the younger set by the Ron Paul campaign  which is to antiwar conservatives what the Eugene McCarthy effort to take the White House was to an earlier generation of antiwar activists  and we have the makings of a full - scale rebellion on the Right .
What Lew Rockwell calls " red- state fascism " is facing a significant challenge from within the conservative movement .
Having sacrificed everything  their devotion to less government , their traditionally prudent temperament , their general distrust of power  in order to follow the neocons off the Iraqi cliff , the ostensibly " conservative " wing of the Republican Party faces an electoral catastrophe .
There is , consequently , a " surge " of skepticism in GOP ranks as the administration tries to tamp down Republican voices of protest in the Senate .
The GOP caucus was supposed to be giving the White House until September , when Gen. David Petraeus is slated to give his much - vaunted progress report , but they are n’t waiting to jump ship .
First in the water is Sen.
Richard Lugar , the GOP ’s foreign policy maven :
" Mr. President , I rise today to offer observations on the continuing involvement of the United States in Iraq .
In my judgment , our course in Iraq has lost contact with our vital national security interests in the Middle East and beyond .
Our continuing absorption with military activities in Iraq is limiting our diplomatic assertiveness there and elsewhere in the world .
The prospects that the current ‘ surge ’ strategy will succeed in the way originally envisioned by the President are very limited within the short period framed by our own domestic political debate .
And the strident , polarized nature of that debate increases the risk that our involvement in Iraq will end in a poorly planned withdrawal that undercuts our vital interests in the Middle East .
Unless we recalibrate our strategy in Iraq to fit our domestic political conditions and the broader needs of U.S. national security , we risk foreign policy failures that could greatly diminish our influence in the region and the world . "
Translation :
Our neocon - driven foreign policy has lost contact with reality  it ’s time to pull up stakes , minimize our losses , and get out of town .
Senators Voinovich and Warner echo Lugar ’s dissent , with the former refuting the canard that a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq would hand the country over to al - Qaeda , as the McClatchy papers report : " ’ That ’s nonsense , ’ [ Voinovich ] said .
Iraq ’s Shi’ite majority would reject any Sunni al - Qaeda effort to set up a religious government under a supreme leader . "
Lugar , you ’ll remember , has always been a critic of the war , and he authored , in collaboration with Sen .
Joe Biden , an effort early on to attach certain conditions and benchmarks to U.S. involvement but was rebuffed .
Now he raises his objections once again , going the diplomatic route by not reminding his colleagues  and the administration of his earlier qualms .
This is not to say that Lugar ’s dissent is principled , as is , say , the position of Rep. Paul , or even Chuck Hagel .
It is , instead , remarkably cynical , addressed to policymakers in the spirit of a sympathizer advising his fellows to rein themselves in for their own good :
" The president and his team must come to grips with the shortened political timeline in this country for military operations in Iraq .
Some will argue that political timelines should always be subordinated to military necessity , but that is unrealistic in a democracy .
Many political observers contend that voter dissatisfaction in 2006 with administration policies in Iraq was the major factor in producing new Democratic Party majorities in both Houses of Congress .
Domestic politics routinely intrude on diplomatic and military decisions .
The key is to manage these intrusions so that we avoid actions that are not in our national interest . "
Yes , occasionally the American people " intrude " on the exclusive preserve of policymakers , but that ’s just one of the horrible inconveniences the elites have to put up with : it ’s really a shame , but there ’s nothing to be done about it .
What Lugar is telling his Republican compadres is what they know very well already : it ’s time to rid themselves of the neoconservative millstone before it drags them all down to defeat  and destroys the GOP , reducing it to a Southern regional party .
The political disintegration of the Republicans was preceded by a long , drawn - out intellectual decline that dates from the time of the neoconservative incursion into GOP ranks during the Reagan presidency , when the Scoop Jackson Democrats first landed on right - wing shores and carved out a beachhead in the conservative movement .
The birth of " Big Government conservatism , " and the role this oxymoronic set of ideas played in leading to the GOP ’s present debacle , sounded the death - knell of the movement as a coherent set of ideas historically rooted in American traditions .
Since 9/11 , conservatism has reverted back to European - style absolutism , as evidenced by the Right ’s embrace of the revisionist theory of the " unitary presidency , " which elevates the president in wartime to monarchical status .
That Bruce Fein , a leading conservative legal theorist of the Reagan era , is now calling for the impeachment of Dick Cheney , on the grounds that his office has been the intellectual nerve center of this administration ’s bid to rule by edict , signals the end of the GOP coalition as we know it .
Fein ’s sentiments are hardly limited to the upper intellectual reaches of Washington ’s conservative circles .
As Sally Quinn reports in the Washington Post :
" The big question right now among Republicans is how to remove Vice President Cheney from office .
Even before this week ’s blockbuster series in The Post , discontent in Republican ranks was rising .
As the reputed architect of the war in Iraq , Cheney is viewed as toxic , and as the administration ’s leading proponent of an attack on Iran , he is seen as dangerous .
As long as he remains vice president , according to this thinking , he has the potential to drag down every member of the party  including the presidential nominee  in next year ’s elections .
" Removing a sitting vice president is not easy , but this may be the moment . "
When a cancer is generated by the body , the only recourse is to cut it out  but , even then , sometimes it is too late .
I ’m afraid , in this case , the disease has progressed too far to save the patient .
The best that can be hoped for is a relatively painless death .
Neanderthals might have spoken just like humans do now , new genetic findings suggest .
Neanderthals are humanity 's closest extinct relatives .
Since their discovery more than 150 years ago , researchers have found out they could make tools just like our ancestors could , but whether Neanderthals also had advanced language , rather than mere grunts and groans , has remained hotly debated .
To learn more , scientists investigated DNA from Neanderthal bones collected from a cave in northern Spain , concentrating on a gene , FOXP2 , which is to date the only one known to play a role in speech and language .
People with an abnormal copy of this gene have speech and language problems .
Genes similar to FOXP2 are found throughout the genomes of the animal kingdom , from fish to alligators to songbirds .
The molecule that human FOXP2 generates differs from chimpanzee FOXP2's by just two amino acids , the building blocks of proteins .
Past research suggests the gene 's modern human variant evolved fewer than 200,000 years ago .
Now scientists find the Neanderthal FOXP2 gene is identical to ours .
The ancestors of Neanderthals diverged from ours roughly 300,000 years ago , according to the latest thinking .
Some studies have suggested that the two species might have intermingled after that , however .
" It is possible that Neanderthals spoke just like we do , " paleogeneticist Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , told LiveScience .
" Of course many genes are involved in language , " cautioned Krause , the new study 's lead researcher .
As scientists discover more of such genes , these will have to be examined in Neanderthals as well , he said .
Krause noted that some might suggest that interbreeding or " gene flow " ( aka sex ) between modern humans and Neanderthals led to us having FOXP2 in common .
" However , we see no evidence for gene flow in the Y chromosome sequences , " he said .
Instead , the modern human and Neanderthal Y chromosomes are substantially different genetically .
Krause and his colleagues detailed their findings online Oct. 18 in the journal Current Biology .
If there 's a sadder commentary on the state of American society , we can't think of it – we 've grown so fat we sink the boats of It 's A Small World .
According to Miceage , the boats routinely bottom out under the weight of super - sized riders , bringing the popular ride to a grinding – literally – halt .
That 's increased the wear and tear on the fiberglass boats , which have been in use since the ride opened during the 1964 World 's Fair , when Americans , on average , weighed 25 pounds less than we do today .
It 's a big problem .
Find out why after the jump ...
Other rides , including the drop in the Pirates of the Caribbean , face the same problem , Miceage says , but nowhere is it more of headache than It 's a Small World .
The ride features several twists and bends where overloaded boats easily bog down , including the " S " bend through the Scandanavian room .
Employees – Disney calls them
" cast members " – have been aware of the issue for some time now and so discretely leave empty seats in boats carrying heavy riders .
But backups persist , and in some cases no one realzes there 's a problem until boats stop emerging from the ride .
Disneyland is putting the ride in drydock for 10 months to make it ship - shape again .
The boats will be replaced with more buoyant models , and the new
flume will be one inch deeper .
Work will begin in January .

Americans had best rethink the " war on terror " while they still have the liberty to do so .
For all of President Bush ’s blah - blah talk about bringing democracy to the world , the Bush administration has proved that it is no friend of liberty at home .
The Bush administration has violated constitutional principles , US law , and the Geneva Conventions as no previous administration has done .
Here is a short list of the Bush administration ’s crimes :
Spying without court warrants on Americans in violation of both the US Constitution and the FISA statute .
The denial of habeas corpus , attorney - client privilege , due process , and Geneva Conventions protections to those , American or foreign , designated without evidence as terrorists or enemy combatants .
The justification and use of torture to coerce confessions and the kidnapping of foreign nationals who are sent to be tortured in foreign prisons .
The initiation of military aggression against states based on intentional deception by the Bush administration of the US public and the United Nations , and the intentional fabrication of " evidence " to justify unprovoked aggression against sovereign states , which is a war crime under the Nuremberg standard established by the US .
Violation of the oath of office to defend the US Constitution by practically every member of the Bush administration and Congress .
Bush has assaulted the separation of powers and the rule of law with " signing statements " and " executive orders " that President Nixon ’s White House Counsel John Dean says are commands that treat the co-equal branches of government and the electorate as subservient to executive authority .
In April 2006 , Boston Globe reporter Charlie Savage listed 750 laws " challenged " by the Bush administration .
Not even the demonized president of Iran claims to be above the law .
Genocide against the people of Iraq where one million Iraqis have died as a result of Bush ’s invasion and several million Iraqis are displaced persons .
Massive civilian casualties in Afghanistan , which is a form of genocide in which military force is routinely applied to unarmed noncombatants .
Massive corruption in which no -bid contracts are issued to Republican corporations in exchange for kickbacks to political campaigns .
The theft of two national elections as documented in books by Mark Crispin Miller and Greg Palast .
The Bush administration has even conducted Stalinist show trials against innocent Muslim charities as part of its propaganda to make the American people fearful that they are surrounded by hostile terrorists .
In December 2001 President Bush declared the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development to be a " terrorist organization " and seized the charity ’s assets .
Bush put the charities ’ officials on trial as terrorists .
Six years later on October 22 , 2007 , after years of investigations and two months of testimony by who but " Israeli intelligence agents " ( according to the New York Times ) , the US government ’s case fell apart in the courtroom .
One of the jurors said that the case " was strung together with macaroni noodles .
There was so little evidence . "
Georgetown University professor of constitutional law David D. Cole said the case " suggests the government is really pushing beyond where the law justifies them going . "
While committing these unprecedented crimes , President Bush has claimed the moral high ground despite having lied to the American people and despite devastating two countries in the name of " making the world safe from terrorists . "
When people in Iraq and Afghanistan are asked who are the terrorists , they answer that it is the Americans .
The Bush administration has not been held accountable for any of its crimes .
By failing to hold government accountable to law , the Constitution , and the American people , the opposition party and the corporate media have abandoned their responsibility to protect freedom and democracy in the United States .
There can be no democracy where there is no government accountability , and there is no government accountability in the United States — except , of course , to the Israel Lobby .
Now the Bush administration wants to take away the American people ’s freedom to travel within their own country by airplane .
Not content with an 80,000 " no fly " list , a subset of a 500,000 — 750,000 " watch list , " the Bush administration ’s Transport Security Administration has proposed new rules that will require Americans to get government permission 72 hours in advance prior to being allowed to board a domestic flight .
The TSA justifies this extraordinary violation of our constitutional rights on the grounds that 90 to 93 percent of all travel reservations are final by then .
So what ?!
And what of the 7 to 10 percent of flights that the TSA estimates are not on the books 72 hours in advance ?
These are family emergencies and critical business deals .
What does the TSA care if a member of your family dies while you await the government ’s permission to fly ?
Any agency of the government that can propose such a tyrannical regulation should be abolished .
The TSA ’s mentality shows it to be a far greater threat to Americans than are terrorists .
Even without the " permission to fly " rule , the TSA ’s practices are ridiculous and unjustified .
The confiscation of tooth paste and unopened bottles of perfume , the harassment of US military officers in uniform , the harassment of old people struggling with their walkers , of mothers struggling with small children — none of this makes any sense except in terms of getting Americans accustomed to harassment as a citizen ’s duty to government and to train a cadre to conduct warrantless searches of fellow citizens .
The no-fly list itself is absurd .
If a known terrorist were to show up at an airport , he would be arrested , not refused permission to fly .
Anyone else who can clear security like other passengers has every right to fly .
Set aside the violation of the Constitution and the Soviet - style tyranny of the loss of the freedom to travel and consider merely the practical aspect of the proposal .
What American wants his travel plans dependent on a government bureaucracy capable of putting US Senator Ted Kennedy on the " no fly " list and capable of issuing US visas to two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers six months after they allegedly died in the 9/11 events ?
If we believe the official story , 9/11 itself reveals a government totally devoid of any competence whatsoever .
The " war on terror " is fraudulent .
The cruel war and the deceptive vocabulary that protects it are a cover for expanding US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East and for constructing a functioning police state at home .
A country in which people cannot make airline reservations without the government ’s permission is not a free country .

The first alpha release of Python 3.0 was made available for download on Friday .
Python 3.0 includes syntactic and architectural changes that are incompatible with the 2.x series .
In June , we described some of the preliminary plans for Python 3.0 and examined the reasoning behind a handful of the changes .
Several of those features appear in this first alpha , but much work still remains .
Additional alpha releases will occur throughout the rest of the year .
The first beta releases are scheduled for 2008 , and the final Python 3.0 release is expected to occur one year from now .
The alpha releases are n't intended for production use , and are primarily available for testing purposes .
Developers can use the alphas to explore changes in the language and prepare to port their own applications .
Documentation is already available for Python 3.0 , including a list of changes .
I put alpha 1 to the test and experimented with several of the new features , including the new string formatting tools and the new with and as keywords .
I compiled and installed Python 3.0 alpha 1 on Ubuntu Linux 7.04 .
The process was relatively painless , but there was one minor unexpected problem that I encountered .
When I installed the Python 3.0 alpha , it placed the Python 3.0 executable at /usr / local / bin / python , which essentially made Python 3.0 the default on my system .
Since Python 3.0 is n't backwards compatible , making it the default in that manner can break other Python applications .
I had to move the executable so that the python command would go back to using Python 2.5 , which is located at / usr / bin / python .
Although many of the changes planned for Python 3.0 are very valuable and practical , other aspects are less impressive .
I took a close look at the new string interpolation mechanisms in Python 3.0 , which aim to supplement the conventional % operator .
Simple expressions using a specialized syntax can be included in strings and are signified with curly braces .
The format method is then used to provide values to replace the braces .
Inside the curly braces , one can use attribute and item selection syntax , but not normal Python expressions .
The following is an example using Python 3.0 in an interactive session :
>>> class Test :
... def __init__( self ) :
... self .foo = " bar "
...
>>> t = Test ( )
>>>
" Testing string interpolation : { 0.foo} " .format(t )
' Testing string interpolation : bar '
The number 0 specifies which format parameter should be used to provide the value , and regular attribute notation is used to access the foo property .
The new format method is a clear improvement over the % operator in several ways .
For instance , it allows you to use the same number multiple times in an expression to refer to a single parameter .
With the % operator , by comparison , you would have to use named parameters with a dict in order to use same value more than once .
Another advantage of the format method is that you can seamlessly mix positional and named references :
>>>
" Test 1 : {spam} and another test : { 0. foo} " .
format(t , spam= " eggs " )
' Test 1 : eggs and another test : bar '
The new string formatting mechanism offers a lot more flexibility than the % operator .
The format method can be overloaded in individual classes by defining the __format__ method , and developers can get even more control by mixing in subclasses of the formatter class .
Although the new formatting mechanism is an improvement in many ways , I still think it 's suboptimal .
The syntax used for the expressions is rather complex and includes a lot of confusing elements that are used for pretty - printing and spacing ( for instance , < , > , and ^ are used to specify alignment ) .
It would be far more advantageous to be able to embed normal Python syntax directly in strings , much like one can do with Ruby .
My other complaint is with the redundancy in string formatting mechanisms .
One of the underlying philosophies of Python is that there should be one obvious way for doing each thing .
There are now three completely distinct string interpolation mechanisms with a lot of overlap : the % operator , the Template library added in Python 2.4 , and now the format method .
This redundancy really goes against the grain of Python 's philosophy .
Although I 'm not entirely happy with all of the changes , I think that Python 3.0 will have a lot to offer by the time it is finished .
There are many changes that increase syntactic consistency and tangibly improve the language .
Other significant changes in Python 3.0 relate to unicode handling , the consistent use of iterators for sequence manipulation functions , function annotations , and new metaclass syntax .
We will be looking at other features in greater depth in the future .

The NRA has decided to offer all active - duty troops a complimentary year ’s membership .
The $ 35 per is not exactly monumental , but the NRA could gain thousands of lifelong members out of this dandy bit of PR .
And while the fact that the latest issue of American Rifleman may be at a soldier ’s doorstep his first day home from combat is n’t ideal , I think the NRA is on to something fundamental .
Now , of course , soldiers should be paid enough that they can pay for their own memberships , but when it comes to thanks - giving troops should get free memberships everywhere , to gyms , museums , rotary clubs , Costco .
They should get to the head of the line at movie theaters , the DMV , for Southwest flights ; we should be yielding to our troops at every turn ( not to mention ensuring they get proper medical care , and jobs ) .
Instead , we likely treat them like any other strangers ; we honk at them for cutting us off , hustle in front of them at the grocery store , and generally ignore the sacrifices , and adjustments , these men and women are making .
Of course , unless you live in a company town , you likely do n’t know who is soldier and who civilian .
And since there ’s no draft , there is a convenient majority who does n’t know anyone who is serving or has served .
So what if we treated everyone we meet as if they might have put themselves in harm ’s way to protect our right to cheap gas and bulk goods ?
I know , it ’s not gonna happen .
But the NRA , in its twisted way , has the sentiment right .
Say thanks with substance ( the go - out - and - shop , post - 9/11 GWB - inspired variety of patriotism ) , because when it comes to returning home , our troops deserve all the perks our lifestyle affords .
Not that such perks will make coming home much easier , but they just might make us feel better .

A generation is growing up playing immersive online games
A whole generation is growing up for whom video games are a key part of how they relax , whether it be fragging friends in a first person shooter or backing up the main tank in a Warcraft raid .
And it is not just youngsters .
There are plenty of older folks who shake off the dust of the working day in many different virtual worlds .
Statistics from the the US Entertainment Software Association ( ESA ) back this up .
It claims that the average player is 33 and has more than a decade of gaming under their belt .
All of a sudden , say academics and researchers , companies have realised that all the time employees spend gaming in virtual worlds is changing them .
Ian Hughes , IBM 's metaverse evangelist , said many organisations were considering ways of harnessing the skills and familiarity their employees have with virtual environments .
This familiarity has driven many organisations to consider virtual worlds as places where employees can meet , mix and get on with the job .
" A lot of people are more accepting of that way of working just because of games , " he said .
" It 's about harnessing that ability to play to get work done . "
The formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild , organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game 's strongest foes are all relevant to work , said Mr Hughes .
Game gear
But it is not just the skills that gamers hone in futuristic or fantasy worlds that businesses want to co-opt .
Some are taking their inspiration directly from the way that online games are structured .
Skills learned on raids in games could apply to work too
" The problems associated with distributed teams , collaboration and information overload right now are so severe , and the opportunities so good , that they are willing to look at anything , " he said .
Dr Reeves has founded a company called Seriosity that applies game elements to workplaces .
It was working with five or six unnamed Fortune 500 companies to harness the efficiencies of those game mechanics , said Dr Reeve .
One of the programs developed by Seriosity adds a virtual currency element to e-mail in a bid to help people cope with information overload .
Anyone sending a message adds some of their limited supply of virtual coins , called Serios , to show how important they consider that e-mail to be .
It was a more finely grained grading system than the low , medium or high importance flags found in most e-mail programs , said Dr Reeves .
It had other benefits too , he said .
It revealed not just the flow of messages but also started to show who people pay attention to and who did a good job of getting responses .
Some companies were starting to adopt even more of the elements familiar from games .
" There are people right now trying to map it one - to - one , " said Dr Reeves .
Level playing field
Convinced that games can help them thrive some companies have turned work groups into guilds , rewarded staff with experience points when they complete tasks , giving out titles and badges when a guild finished a project and portraying objectives as quests .
Virtual worlds could become key to future business life
None , so far , he said , were tying wages to how people performed in the quests and against other guilds .
" Mapping levels and points on to wages is the most extreme application , " he said .
Companies were adopting game mechanics for several reasons , said Dr Reeves .
Partly because workers were so familiar with this structure , he said , and because people become powerfully motivated when they know how they compare to their contemporaries .
The main reason was for the transparency it gave to the way workplaces were organised and for revealing who got things done .
" It exposes those that do and do not play well , " said Dr Reeves .
" There is a leader board and you know the rules . "
It had the potential to turn workplaces into meritocracies where the most accomplished are easy to spot because they have racked up all rewards , achievements and levels required for a particular post .
While it may not sweep away systems of privilege or end nepotism it had the potential to make workplaces fairer and take some of the grind out of the day job , he said .
" The whole idea here is to get the objectives of the individual players aligned with the objectives of the organisation , " said Dr Reeves .
" Do that and you have something good . "
Angela Barron , an advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development , said games had long been used in training to expose personal preferences and prejudices .
Many organisations also used courses that revolve around games to help make teams work together better or expose power structures among workers .
She said this was the first time she had heard of elements of online games being used in a similar way .
" I would not have thought enough people play games for it to be a great motivator , " she said .
But , she said , anything that helped staff develop a better working relationship and promote team work was likely to be a good thing .
JUST because you 're paranoid , does n't mean they 're not out to get you .
In addition to the very worrying quality - of - care concerns which have been highlighted by the recent cancer scandals , concerns which have caused agonies for thousands of women , another troubling issue is emerging in relation to these events , namely the official reaction to them .
In particular , there is a frightening willingness and enthusiasm on the part of the Government and Department of Health to resort to blatant intimidation of those health professionals who dare to go off message , and to bring sincerely held concerns into the public domain .
An early warning of things to come came when questions about aspects of cancer care at Barrington 's Hospital were aired .
It emerged that Dr Raj Gupta had alerted the Department of Health two years before .
They did nothing , and their reaction to subsequent reports of their inaction was to suggest darkly that Dr Gupta himself had a case to answer , because he had not notified the Medical Council .
Infuriatingly , the same self - exculpatory Pontius Pilatism was used to answer the recent revelation that concerns about equipment in Portlaoise had been relayed to the minister in 2005 .
A similar excuse was offered when the sad details of Suzie Long 's delayed diagnosis of cancer , due to a seven - month wait for a colonoscopy ( bowel test ) , came to light .
It was suggested to me by a Department of Health doctor that the fault lay , not with the system , which allowed seven - month delays , but with the doctors who did n't move her up the queue ahead of other patients , patients who themselves might have had undiagnosed cancers .
He wondered if the doctors should n't face some censure .
Incidentally , a leading gastroenterologist from the Midlands told me this week that his waiting list for the same test is still seven months .
In my own hospital , it is approximately five months .
Every patient waiting for a colonoscopy potentially has bowel cancer .
Waiting lists of five or seven months are unacceptable , and attempts by those , who have the power to resource the system appropriately , to shift the blame are reprehensible .
The ultimate example came last week -- a week in which the organisation which runs the health service announced that it did n't know which of its constituent hospitals were safe venues for cancer treatment , a week when it was revealed that all of the mammograms in an entire medium - sized hospital were being recalled and it again emerged that a concerned doctor had previously notified the minister about his worries .
When challenged in the Dail about the health service by Labour leader Eamonn Gilmore , who used quotes from Maurice Neligan and myself , the Taoiseach elected to play the men and not the ball , making outrageous comments about Mr Neligan and suggesting that my right to have an opinion on the health service was somehow questionable , given my large private practice .
Well , despite my best efforts ( I only do private practice on my own hospital campus ) , I do have a large private practice .
I also have a large public practice .
That is what happens when you have very few doctors in your country -- they see lots of patients .
When nearly two - thirds of the population indicate their level of trust in the public system by taking out private insurance , your doctors will have large incomes .
What came next chilled me to the bone .
When Mr Gilmore suggested that the Taoiseach 's replies were casting aspersions on the reputations of doctors , Mr Ahern replied that he was very careful not to cast aspersions on anyone , and that , furthermore , he had n't even used his briefing notes .
I , for one , would like to know what was in these briefing notes .
Who were they about ?
Was it about doctors who have been caught up in the quality - of - care scandals , or was it about those who spoke up ?
Was public money spent compiling McCarthy - esque dossiers for his privileged use in the Dail chamber ?
I intended to discuss this on the Late Late Show , when I was invited to participate in a discussion on the health service .
I was then informed that a high - level decision had been made by RTE management to remove me from the programme in the interest of balance , as the HSE and the department had refused to participate .
In effect , they were able to censor me by proxy .
This is an increasingly used and highly anti-democratic tactic , but one which can be fought effectively .
If the government attempts to sabotage debate by preventing the formation of balanced panels , then proceed with all the unbalanced ones .
They 'll soon come round and start sending spokespeople .
Younger readers may not remember the bad old Haughey days , when internal opponents of his corrupt and intimidatory rule faced mysterious late night calls and threats on the nights before leadership challenges .
Is n't it sad and ironic to think that one of the brave , principled young politicians who refused to cave in to intimidation then was Mary Harney .
She was actually a heroine of mine .

Facebook Natalie Ferrell - Albright was a bank teller when her daughter had a severe asthma attack .
When she called work to say her daughter had to go to the hospital , the Cincinnati woman was told her sick days applied only to her , not her children .
The single mom did what she had to do and took her daughter to the hospital , but the incident still rankles her five years later .
" I know too many people who are forced to choose between their health or their family and a paycheck , " says Ferrell - Albright , 53 , who has since left her bank job .
Ferrell - Albright is on one side of an emerging debate as an effort to make paid sick leave a right for every worker gains ground in state legislatures and Congress .
Proposals have been introduced in Ohio and at least 12 other states , and work is underway to put the issue on the ballot in several states next November .
Congress has started holding hearings on the issue .
Democratic presidential front - runners Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have spoken out in favor of the idea .
On the other side of the issue is Mike Kovach , 52 , of Youngstown , Ohio , who has built a successful 80 - employee business repairing heavy industrial equipment in a shrinking regional economy .
He was n't happy when he heard about a proposed state law that would force him to provide paid sick leave to his workers .
For every $ 1 spent on wages , he already pays another 43 cents for vacation , health care and other benefits .
" Customers are squeezing us for more productivity , " says Kovach , who founded City Machine Technologies in 1985 .
" We 're investing in technology to stay competitive .
Our prices are going down .
There are only so many dollars here . "
Currently , 43 % of the nation 's private workforce — about 50 million employees — do n't get paid when they call in sick , the Bureau of Labor Statistics says .
" This issue is gaining momentum because paid sick leave seems as American as apple pie and baseball , " says Debra Ness , president of the National Partnership for Women & Families , a group that promotes added benefits for workers .
No state has passed a mandatory sick leave law yet .
Business groups worry that the idea will become a new hot - button issue — like raising the minimum wage — that has popular appeal but hidden costs .
" It has great emotional appeal , " says Karen Kerrigan , president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council .
" There is a movement getting behind this , and we think it 's going to pass in certain states . "
Legislatures weighing paid sick leave include Connecticut , Florida , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Missouri , Montana , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Vermont and Virginia , Ness ' group says .
So far , early support for mandatory paid sick leave laws has come in liberal jurisdictions .
Last November , San Francisco voters approved the nation 's first mandatory paid sick leave law .
The law — providing about eight paid sick days a year for full - time workers — took effect in February .
The Washington , D.C. , city council is considering a similar law .
Massachusetts legislators held a hearing on a proposal last week .
Connecticut 's state Senate approved paid sick leave in May , but the measure died in the House .
" We have a great chance next year because it's an election year , " says state Sen. Edith Prague , a Democrat .
Business groups say mandatory paid sick leave could force cuts in other benefits such as health care or vacation .
" Paid sick leave is n't free , " says Ty Pine , legislative director of the National Federation of Independent Business in Ohio .
" Show me where the law guarantees the business owner extra revenue to cover the costs . "
The proposed laws generally require five to seven sick days annually for full - time workers at firms that employ 25 or more people .
" Paid sick leave would actually save business money , not cost them money , " says Dale Butland of the Coalition for Healthy Families , a group of labor and other organizations gathering signatures to put the issue on the Ohio ballot .
He says paid sick leave would reduce the spread of illness caused by workers who can't afford to miss a paycheck .
" If every other industrialized country can do it and remain competitive , there 's no reason America can 't , " he says .
Workers who do n't have paid sick leave often work part time or at restaurants , retail stores and construction sites .
At Kovach 's Youngstown firm , sick leave would make it hard to quickly repair equipment in factories , he says .
" We need people on a moment 's notice , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , " he says .
" If you offer paid sick leave , people are going to take it . "
His company offers vacation — one week after a year , then an additional day for every year at the company — and handles health problems on a case - by - case basis .
" It does n't sound like much to add sick leave , but , in reality , it means paying overtime and double time to other workers , " he says .

8時半起き。今朝も雨。こんなに雨続きだと、気分もあまり盛り上がらない。余計なことばかり考えてしまって、仕事、イマイチ進まず。〈青猫書房〉の目録着。この店としては珍しいことに、前号の重複注文を発表している。ぼくが入手した本は5人注文、旬公がハズレた本は4人注文。先着順だから、最初に注文した人以外はぜんぶハズレだ。ネットで注文した、イトウサチ［台風一過］（ホルモンタンク・レコード）が届く。東京ローカルホンクのライブのときに、魚雷さんから紹介された女性のデビュー作。ローカルホンク（このときはまだ「うずまき」だった）のメンバーがサポートしている。ジャケットもレーベルもなんだかCD-Rっぽいが、ちゃんとしたＣＤなのだった。
3時半に出かけ、神保町へ。久しぶり（ひょっとしてＵＢＣ以来かも）の古書会館。今日は趣味展で、オヨちゃんが帳場の台にダランともたれかかっている。ちょっとは見せろよ、やる気を。時間がないので急いでひとめぐり。出口のところで、服部鉦太郎『写真図説
明治・名古屋の顔』（ろっぽう）1000円を手に取ったら、「燐寸考」という小文があったので、買っておく。
〈書肆アクセス〉でミニコミを一冊買う。すでに持っているものなのだが、原稿を書くのに参照しようと思ったら、出てこなかった。いつものコトなので、早々に諦めて、アクセスに電話して確保してもらっておいたのだ。〈ディスクユニオン〉で、シネマ［ゴールデン・ベスト］を買う。松尾清憲、鈴木さえ子、一色進らがやっていたバンド。アルバム［Motion

神保町から三田線に乗る。志村坂上駅で出口を間違え、ちょっと迷って、国書刊行会に到着。ビル全体に同社が入っている（塩山さん、「版元様の御殿拝見」の立ちション取材、いつでもどうぞとのことでした）。海野弘展に本を提供してくれた竹中さんと、浅倉久志『ぼくがカンガルーに出会ったころ』の担当者・樽本くんと雑談しつつ、２本ばかり企画を提出。樽本くんが「こういう本が出るとイイんですけどね。ちくま文庫が出してくれないかな」とやたら云うのがオカシイ。でも、各社の編集者で「ちくまなら出してくれそう」という企画を持っているヒトは多いだろう。じっさいに筑摩で企画が通るかどうかはべつにして、そういうイメージを持たれているワケだ。竹中さんと巣鴨に出て、駅前の居酒屋でちょっと飲む。ウチに帰ったら、テレビで《ハウルの動く城》をやっていた。途中から見たせいもあるが、なんだかさっぱりワカラナイ。金の掛かった自主映画を見せられた気分。
そうだ、竹中さんとのハナシでびっくりしたこと。「はてな」取締役で『ウェブ進化論』の著者である梅田望夫氏は、雑学や趣味本を多く書いた梅田晴夫の息子なのだそうだ。ぼくは梅田晴夫の多面体ぶりが好きで、著書は何冊も持っており、『ねがい
梅田晴夫追悼文集』という小冊子まで持っているが、まったく知らなかった。慌ててその冊子を引っ張り出すと、冒頭に「父から息子へ」という書簡があり、その宛先が「梅田望夫」だった。あとがきは望夫さんが書いており、そこには、父から「自分と同じ仕事は絶対にするな」と言い聞かされていたとある。その教えが、息子を今の道に進ませたのだろう。ちなみに、検索して知ったのだが、いま放映中の『CAとお呼びっ！』（日本テレビ系）の脚本家・梅田みかさんは長女だという。うーん、お二人に梅田晴夫についてインタビューしたくなった。どこかでやらせてくれないものか。
A diagram illustrating the null - null line observed by Cluster ’s four spacecraft in the Earth ’s magnetotail on 1 October 2001 .
Credits : Inset : Chinese Academy of Sciences ( C. Xiao ) , background : NASA
Scientists have obtained the first - ever 3D picture of interconnected magnetic ‘ dances ’ in near - Earth space , known as magnetic reconnection events .
The data from ESA ’s Cluster satellites will help to understand better magnetic reconnection , a process related to star formation , solar explosions and the entry of solar wind energy into the near - Earth environment .
Magnetic reconnection is the process whereby magnetic field lines from different magnetic domains collide and reconnect , mixing previously separated plasma .
Plasma is a gas composed of ions and electrons but is electrically neutral , spread over large distances in space and guided by the action of magnetic and electric fields .
Magnetic reconnection converts the energy of the magnetic field into particle energy , generating jets and heating the plasma .
This affects us here on Earth because it can possibly affect telecom satellites and prevent the efficient production of electricity in controlled fusion reactors .
On Earth , we can also see the effect in more intense displays of the Northern lights .
On 1 October 2001 , the four Cluster spacecraft were flying in formation at approximately 110 000 km from Earth in the magnetotail , a long - tail - like structure on the night - side of Earth ’s magnetic field .
The satellites meandered around a reconnection region over a period of nearly 15 minutes .
During reconnection , the geometry of the magnetic field forms an X - shape , also called a ‘ magnetic null ’ .
Analysed in 2D , the magnetic field , plasma density and flow velocity data collected during this event showed that only one reconnection region with an X - shape , or a magnetic null , was seen by the satellites .
An international team of scientists led by Chinese researchers challenged this result , suggesting that it could be seen in 3D .
The researchers tested theoretical results published 20 years ago , which predicted that any small perturbation to such a reconnection site would produce not one , but two magnetically linked reconnection sites , a pair of magnetic nulls and magnetically linked reconnection geometry .
By analysing a subset of the same data in 3D with a higher temporal resolution , they found what they were looking for .
Two magnetic reconnection sites jumped out , along with the null - null line which connects two magnetic nulls , a previously unobserved phenomenon .
The situation can be compared to viewing a cross section of a 3D volume in space .
It is not possible , when looking into only one plane , to tell whether or not something is going on in another plane , in the same volume of space .
Only when seen in 3D , with Cluster ’s multi-satellite viewpoints , could scientists determine that there actually were two , interlinked events occurring simultaneously .
When reduced to two dimensions , this complex 3D magnetic geometry is still consistent with past results obtained under the 2D assumption where the null - null line is seen as one X - point .
It is also in agreement with past results found in the laboratory and by Cluster in space .
" For the first time , the link between two sites of magnetic reconnection has been observed in - situ , in 3 - D .
This result is another major scientific achievement of Cluster obtained owing to fruitful scientific collaborations between Chinese , American and European scientists " , said Philippe Escoubet , Cluster and Double Star project scientist of the European Space Agency .

There ’s good news and bad news about Blackwater .
Which would you like first ?
Well , let ’s start with the good news .
Reliable witnesses have been found who saw the debacle of September 17th when Blackwater guards opened fire on unarmed civilians without provocation – Kurdish spectators to the event were on a rooftop looking down at the scene .
Their testimony is valuable for its likely credibility , as The New York Times notes :
The Kurdish witnesses are important because they had the advantage of an unobstructed view and because , collectively , they observed the shooting at Nisour Square from start to finish , free from the terror and confusion that might have clouded accounts of witnesses at street level .
Moreover , because they are pro-American , their accounts have a credibility not always extended to Iraqi Arabs , who have been more hostile to the American presence .
There is now other evidence provided by perhaps an even more damning source – the US military .
Soldiers who arrived at the scene only moments after the shooting had occurred and who helped aid the wounded and restore order to the scene were “ appalled ” as reported originally in The Washington Post :
While Blackwater has said its guards were attacked by automatic gunfire , the soldiers did not find any casings from the sort of guns typically used by insurgents or by Iraqi security forces , according to an American military official briefed on the findings of the unit that arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the Blackwater convoy left .
The NYT goes on to report the following :
… soldiers … found clear evidence that the Blackwater guards were not been threatened and also opened fire on civilians who had tried to flee .
â€œThe cartridges and casings we found were all associated with coalition forces and contractors , â€ [ an ] official said , reporting on condition of anonymity .
â€œThe only brass we found where somebody fired weapons were ones from contractors.â€ 
Maybe , then , this will motivate Congress to take action to regulate , not only Blackwater but all contractors working in Iraq .
( Stop your derisive laughter , you doubters of the democratic republic …. )
************************************************************************
But then there ’s the bad news .
Erik Prince , billionaire former Navy Seal , evangelical dominionist , and founder and CEO of Blackwater , USA , is doing the rounds of talk shows and interview programs on MSM to portray his highly paid soldiers of fortune security personnel as patriotic , God fearing , hard working Americans dedicated to providing a vital and heroic service for the State Department and the military .
Prince is saying all the right things .
About the FBI investigation into the behavior of Blackwater and other contractors in Iraq , he offers this :
I ’m glad they can be a neutral party .
And if there ’s further investigation or prosecution even needed , if someone really did wrong and meant badly , I ’m all supportive .
– Erik Prince on 60 Minutes ( italics mine , and I do n’t mean the program title )
Whether the MSM will be charmed by Prince or kowtow to him at the bidding of their corporate masters remains to be seen .
His family has already shown that it ’s willing to use its enormous financial muscle to try to silence the blogosphere .
Meanwhile , Blackwater , USA continues with its plans to build bases all over this country .
And the Pentagon has shown no signs that it will discontinue its relationship with Blackwater unless forced to .
Then again , maybe Blackwater will just move its operations into the domestic sphere through Homeland Security .
And the money continues to roll in .
As the old saying goes , somebody ought to do something …..
( I know , I know , I ’ve made you laugh again …. )
SYDNEY , Australia ( Reuters ) -- Australian scientists have discovered a giant underwater current that is one of the last missing links of a system that connects the world 's oceans and helps govern global climate .
The newly discovered current sweeps past the island of Tasmania ( pictured ) towards the Southern Atlantic .
New research shows that a current sweeping past Australia 's southern island of Tasmania toward the South Atlantic is a previously undetected part of the world climate system 's engine - room , said scientist Ken Ridgway .
The Southern Ocean , which swirls around Antarctica , has been identified in recent years as the main lung of global climate , absorbing a third of all carbon dioxide taken in by the world 's oceans .
" We knew that they ( deep ocean pathway currents ) could move from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean through Indonesia .
Now we can see that they move south of Tasmania as well , another important link , " Ridgway , of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation , told Reuters .
In each ocean , water flows around anticlockwise pathways , or gyres , the size of ocean basins .
The newly discovered Tasman Outflow , which sweeps past Tasmania at an average depth of 800 - 1,000 meters ( 2,600 to 3,300 feet ) , is classed as a " supergyre " that links the Indian , Pacific and Atlantic southern hemisphere ocean basins , the government - backed CSIRO said in a statement on Wednesday .
The CSIRO team analyzed thousands of temperature and salinity data samples collected between 1950 and 2002 by research ships , robotic ocean monitors and satellites between 60 degrees south , just north of the Antarctic Circle , and the Equator .
" They identified linkages between these gyres to form a global - scale ' supergyre ' that transfers water to all three ocean basins , " the CSIRO said .
Ridgway and co-author Jeff Dunn said identification of the supergyre improves the ability of researchers to more accurately explain how the ocean governs global climate .
" Recognizing the scales and patterns of these subsurface water masses means they can be incorporated into the powerful models used by scientists to project how climate may change , " Ridgway said in a statement .
The best known of the global ocean currents is the North Atlantic loop of the Great Ocean Conveyer , which brings warm water from the Equator to waters off northern Europe , ensuring relatively mild weather there .
Scientists say if the conveyor collapsed , northern Europe would be plunged into an ice age .
Earlier this year , another CSIRO scientist said global warming was already having an impact on the vast Southern Ocean , posing a threat to myriad ocean currents that distribute heat around the world .
Melting ice - sheets and glaciers in Antarctica are releasing fresh water , interfering with the formation of dense " bottom water " , which sinks 4 - 5 kilometers to the ocean floor and helps drive the world 's ocean circulation system .
A slowdown in the system known as " overturning circulation " would affect the way the ocean , which absorbs 85 percent of atmospheric heat , carries heat around the globe , Steve Rintoul , a senior scientist at the CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research , said in March .

PyGPU - Python for the GPU
Have n't you ever dreamt of writing code in a very high level language and have that code execute at speeds rivaling that of lower - level languages ?
PyGPU is a compiler that lets you write image processing programs in Python that execute on the graphics processing unit ( GPU ) present in modern graphics cards .
This enables image processing algorithms to take advantage of the performance of the GPU .
In some applications , performance increases approach an order of magnitude , compared to CPUs .
Existing methods for programming the GPU uses either specialised languages ( such as Cg , HLSL , or GLSL ) or an embedded language in C++ ( Sh ) or C# ( Accelerator ) .
The specialised languages are generally very low - level ( on the level of C with some simple C++ constructs ) .
Furthermore , they require intimate knowledge of advanced graphics programming concepts , as well as quite a bit of glue - code to handle parameter passing and render pipeline setup .
The embedded approaches admit a higher level of abstraction ( being embedded in somewhat higher level languages ) and also does away with a lot of the glue code necessary with using specialised languages .
However , neither C++ or C# come close to the simple , direct flexibility and expressive power of more dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby .
PyGPU is an embedded language in Python , that allow most of Python features ( list - comprehensions , higher - order functions , iterators ) to be used for constructing GPU algorithms .
It uses a image abstraction to abstract away implementation details of the GPU , while still allowing translation to very efficient GPU native - code .

PyGPU is a research project for exploring the possibilities of using very high level languages for writing GPU programs .
Examples
Sobel edge - detection
def sobelEdgeDetect ( im=DImage , p=Position ) :
wX = outerproduct ( [ 1,2,1 ] , [ - 1,0,1 ] )
wY = transpose ( wX )
Gx = convolve ( wX , im , p )
Gy = convolve ( wY , im , p )
return sqrt( Gx **2 + Gy * * 2 ) Seamless cloning Seamless cloning works by solving a Laplace equation to optimally match the edges of two images allowing seamless pasting of one image into another .
The multigrid Laplace solver and pasting operations are implemented in PyGPU and run exclusively on the GPU .
The example is based on the SIGGRAPH 2003 paper Poisson Image Editing by Pérez , Gangnet , and Blake .
The test images are from http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tommer/adv-graphics/ex1.htm.
2D Fluid simulator
This example implements a PyGPU program that solves Navier - Stokes equations for incompressible flow .
It executes on the GPU and the solver runs at interactive rates .
The example is based on the GPU Gems article available here ( PDF ) .

From that year forward , instead of increasing fuel economy , what began to increase was both weight and horsepower .
In 1984 , the average light vehicle sold in America had less than 100 horsepower .
By 1995 , the average vehicle weight had gone up by a third and the average horsepower had gone up more than 50 % .
And the speed limit Congress had reduced to 55 in 1974 was rolled back to 65 in 1987 .
If that rate had continued , by now we'd be driving around in bloated vehicles that average more then 200 horsepower on highways where the speed limit is 70 or more .
Oh , wait a second – we are .
So , if you 're waiting for the day where people say " Saddam who ? " and " Did there used to be some towers there ? " you only have four more years to go .
I 'd like to suggest that there is at least going to come a day in 2018 when people have trouble recalling George W. Bush , but some bruises take longer to fade .
Not only is the average family mobile packing ponies that were once the domain of only a " performance car , " we often justify this on the grounds of safety .
As in " by having more power , I can accelerate out of danger . "
Here 's a tip : stomping on the gas pedal and outracing the fireball from a tumbling fuel tanker or crashing airliner only happens in the movies .
People getting smashed to jelly because they drive their giganto - box too fast for them to control happens every damn day .
As for that " I need to go 0 - 60 in 4 seconds to merge into traffic " argument , I drove a 3 - cylinder Geo Metro for years in an area with a 70MPH speed limit and drivers that never bothered to read the signs .
I have no sympathy .
While we 're at it , we might as well deal with the whole " big = safe " proposition .
Proponents of delivering 1.0 people to the office in a vehicle designed to carry 1.8 basketball teams often get in a hurry to present the idea that bigger cars are safer than smaller cars .
They point at indicators that show fewer deaths per million miles traveled in large vehicles than in smaller ones .
But what those charts do n't show is another important figure : dollars .
In America , small cars are almost uniformly cheap small cars .
Many of these cars carry over older designs and pack in less safety gear than more expensive larger vehicles .
When price is factored into the equation , the supposed advantage of large vehicles more than disappears .
For example , a Mini Cooper has a curb weight of about 2,700 pounds .
A Ford Excursion has a curb weight above 7,000 pounds .
But the rate of deaths per million miles is 68 in the Cooper , 115 in the Excursion .
For a more extreme example , you only have to watch a Formula 1 car , weighing less than 1500 pounds , smash into a wall or go flying through the air , only to have the driver climb out of the wreck unharmed .
Engineering matters more than weight .
So long as small cars are considered " starter cars , " they get poor engineering .
When they get good engineering , they 're as safe as larger vehicles .
One place where driving an SUV or truck does consistently come in handy is if you want to kill someone .
75 % of deaths in multi-vehicle accidents involve a truck , and about half of them come when a truck strikes another vehicle on the side .
In a two vehicle accident , risk to the driver of the other vehicle is about two and a half times greater when a truck or SUV is involved .
So if you really want to do someone in , go ahead , live large .
To see the results of our national amnesia , in which we forgot that fuel standards and the national speed limit did not exist merely to cause irritation , you have only to glance out the window .
To see where we might be if we 'd made other choices , you have to look a little harder .
Plenty of high mileage vehicles made it to the highway – my rattletrap Metro among them .
There were better cars , too , including high mileage versions of the Honda Civic .
Unfortunately , those cars were coming in as American drivers were opting for larger and larger vehicles .
But I want to zip right on past the good cars we actually saw on the roads and look at the kind of cars we should have had by now , and which we still might see in the near future .
While all the media attention may be going to the will - they - or - wo n't - they Chevy Volt -- and I certainly hope they will -- , it 's far from the only game in town or the most imaginative of the creations coming soon to a road near year .
The half - hearted race between Toyota and GM to be first major automaker to crank out a plug - in hybrid is certainly significant , if only because when one of them finally does get a product to market , the big label imprimatur will make such a car acceptable to millions .
Still , if we had continued down that other road ( pun intended ) , either the Volt or a plug - in Prius might seem rather pedestrian today ( pun also intended , if painful ) .
If rather than beginning to suffer a plague of automotive obesity , we had continued on our diet of light , more efficient , and smarter , there might very well be cars on the road today that were not too different from the " hypercar " that Avory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute have been pitching for over a decade .
If you wait for GM , or Ford , or Toyota , or any other recognizable nameplate to give you a car like that , you might be waiting a long time , but fortunately there are other options that may soon bring these cars closer than your imagination .
It 's been a long time since a new American automobile company was launched but there are several outfits out there trying to give it a shot ( and do n't worry , even though I 've purposely not included links in these articles so far , I 'll be sticking in some " foot notes " this time so you can see what these guys are about ) .
In fact , I 'm even going to skip over Tesla Motors and their lovely , oh - so - desirable electric sports car .
I 'm going to highlight two would be hypercars , because these vehicles strike me as imaginative , desirable , and even beautiful .
Actually , it 's a bit of a misnomer to call either one of these companies an auto company , as both of them might as well have the motto " four wheels bad , three wheels good . "
The absence of that fourth wheel is all it takes in most states to make these guys motorcycle companies .
However they 're classified , these are the vehicles I want to see in my drive in the next five years .
I 'll warn you , you might as well skip the descriptions and go straight to the web sites , because if a picture is worth a thousand words , how much would I have to write to keep up with Youtube ?
First up is a vehicle that not only gets classified as a motorcycle , it tilts like one .
Venture Vehicles ' VentureOne uses technology from Dutch company Carver Engineering .
Carvers are already on sale in Europe , but those vehicles are both pricey and a bit ungainly .
Even so , watching a video of a Carber in action is like seeing fun boiled down to its essence .
Venture has given the Carver a slick redesign and paired it with a plug - in hybrid or all - electric power train that promises snappy performance along with better than 100 mpg .
They 've recently gotten an infusion of cash -- $ 6 million – which sounds like ( and is ) a very small down payment on forming a auto company .
However , Venture is hoping to take advantage of the upside of the kind of corporate structure that Robert Reich describes in Supercapitalism .
They do n't want to design every nut and bolt , in fact they do n't want to design the whole car .
They hope to hire someone to design it , someone else to build motors , someone else to create the frame , and so one .
It 's an auto company that works the same way that most computer companies -- they assemble the final product .
I have great hopes that they 'll make it work , not only because their vehicle is insanely cool , but because their business model might open up this market to smaller more agile companies .
The second hypercar I want to hype is Aptera 's Type One.
Aptera mean " wingless , " and if you 've spent any time around experimental aircraft , one glimpse at the Type One is enough to tell you why .
It looks very much like a small aircraft , minus the wings .
Like the VentureOne , the Type One has three wheels , but the arrangement is reversed – the Type One pairs the wheels at the front and leaves a solo wheel in the rear .
The essence of the Type One is to take those super mileage vehicles that win marathon races under track conditions , and make it practical for the road .
Aerodynamics and weight are the key , and Aptera has set lofty goals for each – aiming at a vehicle that weighs less than 900 pounds and has the drag coefficient of a fighter jet .
As a result , the prototype Aptera gets 230 mpg .
They 're really like to get 300 .
How much do I like this vehicle ?
Enough that I have a downpayment in for one .
If you want an Aptera , the line forms after me .
Skeptics are sure to point out that both these vehicles hold only two ( or three in the case of the Aptera ) passengers .
You 've got me there .
We 'll hang onto my wife 's fat and gas - guzzling Prius for those times when we need to haul a crowd .
But for my daily commute , I 'm going to be flying past – in one of the cars that should have been here already .
Now those promised links :
Venture Vehicle ' site at Fly The Road .
Aptera 's heavily flashed based site and more informative Myspace page .
The Rocky Mountain Institute 's description of a hypercar .
It took months for Washington to clear obstacles preventing the money ’s return , a move that hawks in the administration had argued was deeply mistaken .
Now Mr. Hill can pursue the next items on his agenda : Persuading North Korea to fulfill a commitment it made in February to slow down its main nuclear reactor , whose spent fuel has enabled the country to manufacture plutonium and gain the fuel for eight or more nuclear weapons , according to public American intelligence estimates .
In the next step , the North is supposed to provide the United States and the other participants in the six - party negotiations on the issue — Japan , South Korea , Russia and China — with a detailed list of all of its nuclear programs and facilities .
The Bush administration is also considering authorizing Mr. Hill to offer to buy from the North Koreans nuclear equipment that they are believed to have purchased several years ago from Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani nuclear engineer .
That equipment could conceivably give the North a second path to building a bomb , by enriching uranium .
But American officials do not know whether the North ever learned the secrets of enrichment , or where enrichment facilities might be .
So far , the North has denied that it possesses the equipment .
“ This is critical to the administration ’s plan , ” one senior official involved in the North Korea strategy said , “ because unless they get their hands on this stuff , there is no way we can argue that we ’ve stopped the North from making more nukes . ”
But it was unclear whether Mr. Hill was prepared to make the offer to the North now , or what form it would take .
While Washington or its allies could offer cash for the equipment , they might also promise future deliveries of nuclear fuel to power the civilian nuclear reactors the North insists it needs .
CNN : TSA knew ' dry run ' terror alerts were bogus David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 27 , 2007
Print This Email This The Transportation Security Agency 's national security bulletin issued was based on bogus examples that were combined to give the impression of ominous terrorist plotting , CNN reports .
" That bulletin for law enforcement eyes only told of suspicious items recently found in passenger 's bags at airport checkpoints , warned that they may signify dry runs for terrorist attacks , " CNN's Brian Todd reported Friday afternoon .
" Well it turns out none of that is true . "
Todd highlights the case of Sara Weiss , who was detained in San Diego after two ice packs covered in tape were found in her baggage .
Weiss , who works for a faith - based organization , also was carrying a survey about Muslim Americans , which CNN says also raised law enforcement provisions .
" The FBI now says there were valid explanations for all four incidents in that bulletin , and a US government official says no charges will be brought in any of these cases , " Todd reported .
Weiss says she was held for three hours and questioned by San Diego Harbor Police and two other men who did not identify themselves .
She told CNN one of the men asked her if she knew Osama bin Laden , which she described as " a ridiculous question . "
The FBI maintained " they were right " putting the bogus reports on the TSA bulletin , which is distributed to law enforcement agencies nationwide , Todd reported .
Airport security officers must be trained in identifying suspicious packages , even when those packages turn out to be innocuous .
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on July 28 .
Bash scripting Tutorial
Hello World Bash Shell Script
Attention :
For more verbose and beginner style Bash scripting tutorial visit our Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners
First you need to find out where is your bash interpreter located .
Enter the following into your command line :
$ which bash
Open up you favorite text editor and create file called hello_world .sh .
Insert the following lines to a file :
NOTE : Every bash shell script in this tutorial starts with shebang : " # ! " which is not read as a comment .
First line is also a place where you put your interpreter which is in this case : / bin / bash .
Here is our first bash shell script example :
#!/bin/bash
# declare STRING variable
STRING =" Hello World "
# print variable on a screen
echo $ STRING
Navigate to a directory where your hello_world.sh is located and make the file executable :
$ chmod +x hello_world.sh
Now you are ready to execute your first bash script :
./hello_world.sh

Control bash loop with
Here is a example of while loop controlled by standard input .
Until the redirection chain from STDOUT to STDIN to the read command exists the while loop continues .
#!/bin/bash
# This bash script will locate and replace spaces
# in the filenames
DIR= " . "
# Controlling a loop with bash read command by redirecting STDOUT as
# a STDIN to while loop
# find will not truncate filenames containing spaces
find $ DIR - type f | while read file ; do
# using POSIX class [ : space : ] to find space in the filename
if [ [ " $ file " = *[ [ : space : ] ]* ] ] ; then
# substitute space with " _ " character and consequently rename the file
mv " $ file " `echo $ file | tr ' ' '_ '`
fi ;
# end of while loop

Bash quotes and quotations
Quotations and quotes are important part of bash and bash scripting .
Here are some bash quotes and quotations basics .
Escaping Meta characters
Before we start with quotes and quotations we should know something about escaping meta characters .
Escaping will suppress a special meaning of meta characters and therefore meta characters will be read by bash literally .
To do this we need to use backslash " \ " character .
Example :
#!/bin/bash
# Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR =" Bash Script "
# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $ BASH_VAR
# when meta character such us " $ " is escaped with " \ " it will be read literally
echo $ BASH_VAR
# backslash has also special meaning and it can be suppressed with yet another " \ "
echo " \ "
Single quotes
Single quotes in bash will suppress special meaning of every meta characters .
Therefore meta characters will be read literally .
It is not possible to use another single quote within two single quotes not even if the single quote is escaped by backslash .
#!/bin/bash
# Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR =" Bash Script "
# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $ BASH_VAR
# meta characters special meaning in bash is suppressed when using single quotes
echo '$ BASH_VAR " $ BASH_VAR " '
Double Quotes
Double quotes in bash will suppress special meaning of every meta characters except " $ " , " \ " and " ` " .
Any other meta characters will be read literally .
It is also possible to use single quote within double quotes .
If we need to use double quotes within double quotes bash can read them literally when escaping them with " \ " .
Example :
#!/bin/bash
# Declare bash string variable
BASH_VAR =" Bash Script "
# echo variable BASH_VAR
echo $ BASH_VAR
# meta characters and its special meaning in bash is
# suppressed when using double quotes except " $ " , " \ " and " ` "
echo " It 's $ BASH_VAR and \ " $ BASH_VAR \ " using backticks : `date` "
Bash quoting with ANSI - C style
There is also another type of quoting and that is ANSI -C .
In this type of quoting characters escaped with " \ " will gain special meaning according to the ANSI -C standard .
\ a alert ( bell ) \b backspace \e an escape character \f form feed
newline \r carriage return \t horizontal tab \v vertical tab \\ backslash \` single quote
nn octal value of characters ( see [ http://www.asciitable.com/
ASCII table ] ) \xnn hexadecimal value of characters ( see [ http://www.asciitable.com/
ASCII table ] )
The syntax fo ansi-c bash quoting is : $ '' .
Here is an example :
#!/bin/bash
# as a example we have used
as a new line , \x40 is hex value for @
# and is octal value for .
echo $ 'web : www.linuxconfig.org
email : web\x40linuxconfigorg '

Redirections
STDOUT from bash script to STDERR
#!/bin/bash
echo " Redirect this STDOUT to STDERR " 1>&2
To prove that STDOUT is redirected to STDERR we can redirect script 's output to file :
STDERR from bash script to STDOUT
#!/bin/bash
cat $ 1 2>&1
To prove that STDERR is redirected to STDOUT we can redirect script 's output to file :
stdout to screen
The simple way to redirect a standard output ( stdout ) is to simply use any command , because by default stdout is automatically redirected to screen .
First create a file " file1 " :
$ touch file1 $ ls file1 file1
As you can see from the example above execution of ls command produces STDOUT which by default is redirected to screen .
stdout to file
The override the default behavior of STDOUT we can use " > " to redirect this output to file :
$ ls file1 > STDOUT $ cat STDOUT file1
stderr to file
By default STDERR is displayed on the screen :
$ ls file1 STDOUT $ ls file2 ls : cannot access file2 :
No such file or directory
In the following example we will redirect the standard error ( stderr ) to a file and stdout to a screen as default .
Please note that STDOUT is displayed on the screen , however STDERR is redirected to a file called STDERR :
$ ls file1 STDOUT $ ls file1 file2 2 > STDERR file1 $ cat STDERR ls : cannot access file2 :
No such file or directory
stdout to stderr
It is also possible to redirect STDOUT and STDERR to the same file .
In the next example we will redirect STDOUT to the same descriptor as STDERR .
Both STDOUT and STDERR will be redirected to file " STDERR_STDOUT " .
$ ls file1 STDERR STDOUT $ ls file1 file2 2 > STDERR_STDOUT 1>&2 $ cat STDERR_STDOUT
ls : cannot access file2 : No such file or directory file1
File STDERR_STDOUT
now contains STDOUT and STDERR .
stderr to stdout
The above example can be reversed by redirecting STDERR to the same descriptor as SDTOUT :
$ ls file1 STDERR STDOUT $ ls file1 file2 > STDERR_STDOUT
2>&1 $ cat STDERR_STDOUT
ls : cannot access file2 : No such file or directory file1
stderr and stdout to file
Previous two examples redirected both STDOUT and STDERR to a file .
Another way to achieve the same effect is illustrated below :
$ ls file1 STDERR STDOUT $ ls file1 file2 &> STDERR_STDOUT
$ cat STDERR_STDOUT ls : cannot access file2 : No such file or directory file1
or
ls file1 file2 >& STDERR_STDOUT
$ cat STDERR_STDOUT ls : cannot access file2 : No such file or directory file1
Anyone with a computer science background is familiar with the concept of algorithms for tasks such as the searching or sorting of data .
However , what about algorithms that specify a sequence of steps to make money in the capital markets ?
That 's exactly what the latest excitement around " algorithmic trading " is all about .
In the algorithmic trading space , an " algorithm " describes a sequence of steps by which patterns in real - time market data can be recognized and responded to in order to detect trading opportunities and place and manage orders in the market .
The term " algorithmic trading " has only become commonly used within the financial sector over the past few years although trading algorithms have been around for longer .
Historically , large investment banks have deployed armies of Ph.D.s to custom build trading algorithms .
Now , an advanced technology approach called " Complex Event Processing " ( CEP ) is making it much quicker and easier to build , deploy , and manage trading algorithms , with fewer personnel necessary .
What Do Algorithms Replace ?
Before the days of automated algorithms within the financial markets , traders manually carried out the process of building and managing a trading strategy .
Sitting at specialized trading stations , with four or eight screens , traders watched as real - time market data changed .
By manually tracking analytics and patterns , possibly in a spreadsheet , traders worked out when and where to place orders into the market and then managed these orders to see if they were fulfilled .
The trader understood the workings of the algorithm , but each step was a manual process .
Now , apart from initiating a particular algorithm , the trader does not have to be involved at all .
In most cases , the trader will monitor the algorithms using a graphical dashboard .
In fact , a trader can now initiate and manage hundreds , or even thousands , of independent algorithms as opposed to doing one thing at a time manually .
This way , the trader is scaled to become much more productive .
However , as will be discussed later in this article , the algorithm does n't replace the trader .
It is the trader and his or her team of quantitative analysts who devise new algorithms and tailor existing ones .

Florida is receiving 6.4 million rapid coronavirus tests from the federal government , Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday .
DeSantis said the tests will come from the approximately 150 million that were acquired by the federal government and in addition to the tests that were already being sent to nursing homes and long - term care facilities .

The world 's largest diamond has been denounced as a fake .
A British property developer reportedly claims it is all part of a scam and the gem is actually a lump of plastic .
Brett Jolly says he will go to police about the alleged hoax in South Africa .
He claims he is the victim of a fraud aimed at persuading him to buy the land in South Africa 's North West province on which the so - called diamond was found .
The uncut stone was said to be about seven - thousand carats , but Jolly says he has been duped .
The discs containing the data were unencrypted
The National Audit Office ( NAO ) gave the CDs - similar to the ones lost by HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) officials - to accountants KPMG for auditing .
It said the discs - with bank account details on them - were delivered " by hand " to KPMG and returned safely .
The Information Commissioner is probing whether data laws were broken .
A spokesman said the commissioner would be looking at " all aspects " of data protection surrounding the missing Child Benefit records as part of its investigation .
Meanwhile , police looking for the missing discs say they expect to finish their search at the HM Revenue and Customs office in Tyne and Wear on Friday night .
The focus will then turn to premises run by the couriers , TNT .
' Treated securely '
An NAO spokesman said it had not asked for sensitive information to be included in the material sent to it by HMRC - but it was confident it had taken steps to ensure its security .
" We feel we treated this data securely but at the same time we will look at any lessons that may have to be learned , " he added .
I also confirm that I have asked KPMG to provide me with assurances that they have deleted or erased the data
Letter from NAO director
The data given to KPMG was for the 2006 / 07 audit and was sent to the NAO offices in March this year .
The missing data was produced for the 2007/08 audit .
The details were revealed in a letter sent by the NAO , which was released on Thursday .
The letter from an NAO director , whose name is blanked out , says : " I also confirm that I have asked KPMG to provide me with assurances that they have deleted or erased the data that they analysed as part of our 2006 - 07 Resource Accounts audit . "
Returned safely
The letter was dated 9 November - the day after senior management at HMRC was told about the missing discs .
The NAO told the BBC the data was delivered to KPMG 's offices by hand and had now been returned safely .
A KPMG spokesman agreed with this statement and said any trace of the data contained on the discs had been erased from the company 's computer system .
The Child Benefit details had originally been put on to disc and forwarded to the NAO by HMRC officials at its Tyne and Wear offices in March .
Request declined
Just 1,500 Child Benefit records needed to be examined as part of the auditing process - but all 25 million records were handed to KPMG , as the NAO wanted to be able to select individual records at random .
The NAO asked if HMRC would remove bank accounts and other details from the data before it was sent to them , but this was declined .
An NAO spokesman said discs containing the Child Benefit records had been delivered by a member of its audit team to KPMG .
The spokesman said there was nothing unusual about this , as KPMG was a " long - standing strategic partner " .
Internal mail
He said the NAO needed to use KPMG's " mainframe IT capacity " to analyse the Child Benefit data .
Asked if it had considered removing the bank details of individuals from the discs on security grounds before handing them to a third party , the NAO spokesman said the data belonged to HMRC .
" It is HMRC 's data to manage , " he told the BBC News website .
In March officials at HMRC 's offices in Tyne and Wear began the practice of downloading the entire Child Benefit database - including bank account details and National Insurance numbers - on CDs and sending them through the internal mail to the NAO for auditing .
The practice only came to light on Tuesday when it was revealed two discs had been lost - raising fears data protection laws had been broken .

There are tons of books , websites , and other resources out there that take pages and pages to tell you the fourteen step process to having a happy marriage .
They are making something very simple and making it complex .
Yes , there are a ton of different issues that can make a marriage better or worse , like arguing over finances .
But , assuming that you picked someone you are actually compatible with as your spouse , the core of what you need for a happy marriage is much simpler .
I ’ve been married nearly four years .
I know that ’s not a terribly long time , as marriages go , but it ’s enough for me to have learned what the difference is between when things are great and when there is the occasional friction .
That friction does n’t happen very often , but when it does , I can look back and see the same thing , every time .
So , without further ado , the very simple secret to a happy marriage is to remember these three things :
Spend Quality Time Alone Together Quality time , not quantity time … spending time together of low quality can actually make things worse , causing you to feel like your relationship is going sour ( “ We ’re not as close as we used to be ” ) , possibly resentful , and eventually even sick of each other .
Put the emphasis on quality … and then put the emphasis on alone .
You can get some medium quality time with your spouse when the kids are around , but the kind of quality time you need to have a great marriage only comes when you are alone , and do n’t have to worry about being interrupted .
This one is not so hard when you do n’t have children , unless one spouse is absent a lot or you work different shifts .
Once you have children , though , it can really be difficult to get away together .
Whether you have children or not , though , do n’t forget to go on dates with each other … after all , you were dating when you fell in love , right ?
Make the dates quality time together … dinner out , a movie , flowers , whatever you both enjoy .
Put Your Spouse At The Top Of Your Priority List
This one can be very hard to notice when it ’s you doing it to your spouse , but it usually is n’t hard at all to identify when they are doing it to you , though there is some natural tendency to not address it directly .
That is , you get hurt by , and sometimes resentful of , your spouse because you feel like you ’re not important to them , but you do n’t want to admit that “ weakness ” , so you displace it onto some other , smaller issue , like not taking out the garbage , or not keeping up with the laundry , or whatever else … anything that does n’t show that you are “ weak ” because not getting enough attention hurts you .
This particular issue seems , in my experience , to come up the most when you find a new project that you are passionate about doing .
For instance , I know that when I started this site , I was investing so much of my passion and attention into it that I was taking it away from my wife .
She did n’t complain , but after a little while I noticed what I was doing .
So if you ’re starting something new that you are passionate about doing , make sure you step away from it every once in a while to make sure you ’re not letting your spouse slip down the priority list .
Take Care Of Each Other “ Take care of each other ” can mean a ton of different things to different people , but the essence of it can be boiled down to this :
Spend the time and effort to do little things for your partner to show them how much they mean to you .
You can buy your wife ( or husband , if they ’re into it ) flowers for no reason .
You can stop what you ’re doing , drop everything , and go spend a couple minutes hugging and kissing , even if you then go back to what you were doing .
You can give them a spontaneous foot rub , assuming you ’re in private , and they are n’t TOO ticklish .
You can even simply call them from work for no other purpose than to tell them that you were thinking about them and you love them .
The specifics are n’t important … what ’s important is that your spouse sees that you feel that they are worthy of your time and effort .
One of the most effective things that I ’ve seen is to make them something .
I made my wife a jewelry box , and a charm link bracelet , and they are some of her favorite things she has ever received .
She made me a card and a plaque ( she burned ( woodburning ) her wedding vows onto it …
I read it any time I feel negative emotions , almost always fixes it ) that are two of the very few things I ’d run into a burning building to retrieve .
These things did n’t take much money , or even a whole lot of time , to make … but they DID require that we REALLY invest our SELVES into the creation , which is what makes it so special .
If you remember those three things you will very seldom have any serious problems .
It ’s when you forget one , and let your partner slip down your priority list , or just get quantity time together instead of quality ( or you do n’t do it alone … ie you bring the kids ) , that ’s when you ’ll see problems start to creep into your marriage .
And do you want to know the really annoying thing about it ?
It ’s usually quite hard to trace the problems that come up back to those three things … unless you are already aware that they cause , or more accurately the lack of them causes , the vast majority of relationship problems .
You just use smaller issues to poke around the edges of those bigger issues .
It can be really difficult to admit that you have n’t been doing one of the things above … it means admitting that you ’ve been neglecting your spouse , that you ’ve been taking the attention you should be giving them and spending it elsewhere .
It means admitting that you ’ve been doing something , or not doing something , that hurts your spouse and your relationship .
That hurts when you truly love each other .
So … any time you notice that your marriage , your relationship , is starting to have friction , look back and see if one of you has been neglecting one of the three points above , and dow what you can to remedy the situation .
Production of food crops to make biofuels will also tend to favor growers with plenty of capital and large land holdings , they say , rather than small - scale , impoverished farmers lacking modern grain storage facilities in poor countries .
“ The policies put in place are going to be crucial to whether the small producer and the people who live where hunger is concentrated can benefit , ” Mr. Senauer said .
But for now food aid is suffering , as are poor people in poor countries , economists say .
And their situation may get even tougher next year , relief agencies warn .
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is projecting that low - income countries reliant on food imports , including most of sub -Saharan Africa , will see the amount they pay to import cereals rise 14 percent .
The world ’s ability to absorb fresh price shocks has shrunk along with food stocks .
“ We ’re very worried , ” said Henri Josserand , who heads the organization ’s global information and early warning system .
“ World food stocks are much smaller than they used to be . ”
The food aid declines may also continue .
Catholic Relief Services , a major distributor of American food aid , has projected substantial increases in what the federal government pays for food aid next year , based on an analysis of the futures market for the wheat , corn and soybean products that are mainstays of aid .
“ It ’s bad news and it ’s not just going to affect U.S. food aid , but food aid from every source , ” said Frank Orzechowski , a retired commodity trader who now advises Catholic Relief Services .
This year ’s decline in food aid follows a period when the sharply escalating costs of shipping American - grown food aid to Africa and Asia already reduced the tonnage supplied .
The United States Government Accountability Officementnd this year that the number of people being fed by American food aid had declined to 70 million in 2006 from 105 million in 2002 , mainly because of rising transportation and logistical costs .
Now food prices are also playing a role .
New data from the Department of Agriculture show that the cost of food for the federal government ’s main food aid program , Food for Peace , rose 35 percent over the past two years .
The amount of food bought for American food aid programs has fallen to 2.4 million metric tons this year from 4 million metric tons in 2005 and 5.3 million metric tons in 2000 .
Thomas Melito , who supervised the Government Accountability Office ’s food aid investigation this year , called the escalating costs of food aid “ frightening . ”

などと書いてあるのはすべて，なぜなのか徹底的に考えなくてはいけません．「本に書いてあるから」とか「先生がそう言うから」などの理由で，なんとなく分かったような気になるのは絶対にアウトです．そういうところは「なぜですか」と聞かれるに決まっているんですから，どうきかれてもすぐに答えられるように準備をしておく必要があります．また自分の知らない定理や定義を使っているところがあれば当然，調べたり聞いたりしなくてはいけません．定義や定理を知らなければそこの部分が理解できないに決まっているんですから，そういうところを素通りするのは数学の本の読み方として根本的に誤っています．そして「全部完全にわかった」という状態になるまで，考えたり，調べたり，人に聞いたりするのをやめてはいけません．「自分は本当にわかっているのか」と言うことを徹底的に自問して「絶対にこれで大丈夫だ」と思えるようになる必要があります．「だいたいこうみたいですけど，これでいいんでしょうか」などというのは(たとえ結果的に正しいことを言っていたとしても)何もわかっていないのと同じです．「完全に正しいと断言できる」ということと「自分にはわかっていない」ということの違いが自分ではっきりとつけられるようにならなくては何も始まりません．あいまいな状態のまま，セミナー本番に臨むようなことは論外です．
さてそうして，ちゃんとわかったという確信が持てたとしましょう．まだ準備は終わりではなく，始まったばかりです．本を閉じてノートに，定義，定理，証明などを書き出してみます．すらすら書ければO.K.ですが，ふつうなかなかそうはいきません．それでも断片的に何をしていたのかくらいは，おぼえているでしょう．そうしたら残りの部分については，思い出そうとするのではなく，自分で新たに考えてみるのです．「どのような定義をするべきか」，「定理の仮定は何が適当か」，「証明の方針は何か」，「本当にこの仮定がないとだめなのか」，「どのような順序でlemmaが並んでいるべきか」などです．そうして，筋道が通るように自分で再構成する事を試みるんです．これもなかなかすぐにはできないでしょう．そこで十分考えたあとで，本を開いてみます．するといろいろな定義，操作，論法の意味が見えて来ます．これを何度も，自然にすらすらと書き出せるようになるまで繰り返します．普通，2回や3回の繰り返しではできるようにならないでしょう．
さらにそれができるようになったとしましょう．今度は，紙に書き出すかわりに頭の中だけで考えてみます．「定義は何か」，「定理の仮定は何か」，「証明のポイントはどこか」，といったことを考えてみます．複雑な式変形などは頭の中だけではできないでしょうが，全体の流れや方針，ポイントは頭の中だけで再現できるものです．できなければ，それはよくわかっていないということですから，本やノートを見て復習し，ちゃんとできるようになるまで繰り返します．
このようにして，何も見ないでセミナーで発表できるようになるんです．(私のセミナーでは，本，ノート，メモ等を見ることは一切禁止です．)
これは丸暗記するということとは全く違います．数学の論理は有機的につながっていて，定義でも，仮定でも，補題の順番でも，何か理由があってそうなっているんですから，全体の構造を理解していれば，正しく再現できるようになります．
これでもまだ準備は終わりではありません．セミナーの時間配分も考える必要があります．授業でも，学会発表でも，やるべき内容が先にあり，時間が決まっているんですから，ちゃんとそれに合わせて話ができなくてはいけません．セミナーはその練習でもあります．(日本では，教員でもそういうことのできない人が少なからずいますが，プロとして恥ずかしいことです．そういうのをまねしてはいけません．)自分で，「今回の発表内容はこれだ」という計画を立て，時間をどういうふうに使うか決めなくてはいけません．
「 この証明に20分，ここの説明に15分」というふうに自分できちんと計画を立てます．そして途中で時計を見ながら，早すぎる／遅すぎるなどの調整をしていって，最後にぴったり終わるように持っていきます．何も計画なしにだらだらと進んで行って時間が来たところでおしまい，というようなことでは，時間を無駄にしているだけです．このためにももちろん，完全に理解しておくことが前提となります．「何を聞いても即答できる」という状態ならば，いくら派手にとばしてもO.K.です．
以上のような準備をきちんとするには当然，膨大な時間がかかります．1回の発表のために50時間くらいかかるのは，何も不思議ではないし，100時間かかっても驚きはしません．実験系統の院生は，朝から晩まで(あるいは晩から朝まで)実験しているんですから，数学だってたっぷり時間をかけないと身につかないのは当然です．
以上のようなことを心掛けて，十分な準備の下でセミナーに臨んでください．

・ 50〜100時間というのの根拠は何か？
まず，勉強の量を時間で計ることにはたいして意味がなく，だらだらと長い時間するより，集中して短時間にやるほうが効果がある，ということは(あたりまえですが)はっきり最初に言っておきます．その上で，めどとして一応数字を挙げたわけですが，私が想定しているのは，院生が2〜3人でセミナーをする，というような状況です．(一人で毎週する，というような状況であれば当然話は違ってきます．)普通のサラリーマンの勤務時間は週40時間くらいですから，2.5週に1回発表するとすれば，100時間分あります．そのうち半分セミナーのために使うというのは，まあもっともなことではないかと思います．また，慣れていないとか，特に難しいところとか，何か理由があれば，2倍くらいのファクターがかかることがあっても当然な気がします．今，週40時間と書きましたが，アルバイトなどがなければ，院生がその2倍くらい勉強する(こともある)のは何もおかしくないのではないでしょうか．そういうことを苦痛だと思う人は，数学には向いていないと思います．
・こういうことが文字どおりにできると思っているのか？また実際にセミナーでこのようなことが実現されているのか？
厳しいことを書いて学生をおどしておけば，少しはびしっとすると思って極端なことを書いているのではないか，とも言われたことがありますが，そういうつもりではありません．文字どおり，こういう調子でやるべきだし，そうできると思っています．毎回100％とまでは言いませんが，かなりの程度実際にできていると思います．こういうことができない人が大学院(特に博士課程)にいるのはおかしいことでしょう．
・数学者になるつもりのない人にもこういうことを要求するのか？
私は，一応 ( 狭い意味での純粋 ) 数学者になりたいという人を想定して書きました．しかし，たいていの学生は広い意味で研究に関連した職業につくわけだし，自分が調べたり考えたりしたことを人の前できちんと話す，という訓練は重要ですから，同じことを要求してよいと思います．「なぜですか」と聞かれて，準備不足で全然まともに答えられない，というようなことについては会社などの方が気が短くて厳しいように思います．
・プライベートを無視したブラック企業のような長時間の勉強を強制しているのではないか？
様々な障害のない理想的な状況での想定を書きました．勉強，研究に使える時間について実際にはいろいろな個人の事情はあるでしょう．私は22歳で結婚していますし，睡眠時間を削って勉強することは大嫌いなので，院生の頃は毎日9時間以上寝ていました．非人間的な生活を強制，推奨するつもりはありません．

Analyst Opening Statement :
This article is written from a pure U.S. national security preservation perspective .
The Analyst neither endorses nor condones any of President Musharraf 's recent actions as respects the implementation of Emergency Rule , suspension of the constitution and the harsh governmental actions against the populace and / or public servants ( i.e. judges , lawyers , etc , ) .
In fact , the Analyst considers these breaches in democratic protocol disturbing and entirely unacceptable .
Acknowledging the many differences between the U.S. and Pakistan however , and factoring in the many difficult and complex realities of the situation , an optimal crisis solution for consideration and / or debate is offered in the following article .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today , President Pervez Musharraf stepped down as Pakistan 's Military Leader , clearing the way to being sworn in tomorrow as President of Pakistan for a new 5 year term .
This article is timed accordingly to inject some key and unique insights into what is going on behind the scenes and what might be coming next .
Analyst Note on the Musharraf / Bhutto / Sharif Dynamic :
In addition to other reasons cited below , a few brief thoughts on why Bhutto and Sharif will not succeed in terms of securing critical mass popular support , much less necessary military support to legitimately oust Musharraf in either the near or longer term .
In short , they do n't realize they are part of a simple , yet clever strategy to dethrone themselves within their own camps .
While Bhutto and Sharif are wallowing in their hero - like exile returns , that euphoria will fade as fast as it emerged .
That is if they remain steadfast in their ego - driven " ca n't work , wo n't work with Musharraf " rhetoric .
One can predict however they will not deviate and instead continue to barrel down that path , based upon their ever hardening public positions in that regard .
The result being they will be left with nothing tangible as respects power for themselves and their loyalists .
Evident this arrogant self defeating attitude , a Nov. 26 , 2007 CNN article noted that before departing Saudi Arabia on Sunday , Sharif said ( to CNN ) he has refused to discuss a power - sharing agreement with Musharraf despite overtures from the Pakistani leader .
Specifically quoting Mr. Sharif as saying " Mr. Musharraf , the President of Pakistan , tried to meet me over the last two months ever since I was deported from Pakistan ..... I said there is no point in talking because it would not serve any purpose because he is heading into a different direction . "
Bhutto has made very similar " non-compromising " statements .
Musharraf 's clever plan therefore is to leverage that " non-compromising " attitude from both opponents against them vis-à - vis what this Analyst will coin as his " Time and ( Perceived ) Cooperation ( i.e. Niceness ) " strategy .
Interestingly , neither Bhutto nor Sharif sees it , both seduced and wound up in their own glory of the return moment .
As for " time " , it is on Musharraf 's side .
Each opponent 's followers have big expectations in terms of substantive near term power gains .
If they do n't achieve that , the euphoria will shift quickly to disappointment and lost momentum .
Musharraf astutely realizes the " hero window " for each is brief and will close quickly if they achieve nothing substantive .
His strategy for them to achieve nothing and close that window , for good , is not to resist ( as they strategized he would ) but rather to reach out in " work together " ( cooperation ) fashion .
Sharif 's own ( one might therefore argue as a thoughtless blunder comment under the circumstances ) admission in the interview above , publicly confirming that Musharraf has done just that .
Indeed , Musharraf could not ask for a better endorsement , from anyone .
That outward or public " Niceness " strategy achieves two Musharraf objectives – very well :
1 ) Catches Bhutto and Sharif completely off - guard .
They planned and strategized for staunch power sharing resistance from Musharraf , resistance to leverage / fuel their own public campaign that Musharraf refuses to work together .
Musharraf instead gave them just the opposite .
Knowing the personalities and histories , he shrewdly knew neither would ever work with him even under the best of circumstances so at no risk to sharing his power , why not then publicly offer them what clearly he knew they would never accept – power sharing .
Not much different than saying to someone " let 's do lunch sometime " .
In doing so , Musharraf turns the tables , himself now publicly looking as taking the high road as the benevolent , compromising conciliator , with Bhutto / Sharif the low road as the demanding , non-compromising obstructionists .

Artist 's Statement
Apologies for the late posting of last week 's cartoon , " The Empire Lounge . "
Webmaster Dave was in Athens , Greece .
THE walking , talking , sneaker - wearing honeybees in Jerry Seinfeld ’s animated film certainly are cute .
But if a beekeeper like me had been in the director ’s chair , “ Bee Movie ” would have looked quite a bit different .
In Hollywood ’s version , there are more than three times the number of male roles than female ones , but a cartoon of my own hive would have thousands of leading ladies and only a handful of male extras .
The nurses that tend the young and the workers that forage for pollen ; the guards that keep predators like skunks away and the undertaker bees that unceremoniously haul out the dead : they ’re all female .
And whereas the movie ’s protagonist is repeatedly told he must choose just one job and stick with it , my honeybees rotate through all of the available duties .
Image Credit ... Chip Wass
“ Bee Movie ” makes only passing mention of the queen .
But she ’s the life of the hive , too busy producing perhaps a million eggs during her two - to - three - year existence even to feed herself ( she has attendants for that ) .
Were my Russian queen drawn for the big screen ( think Natasha from “ Rocky & Bullwinkle ” ) , she would make quick work of the macho pollen jocks in “ Bee Movie . ”
BANGKOK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
He may be old , flabby , and far from handsome , but a Western husband can bring a lifetime of happiness , according to a new book advising Thai women on how to meet and marry foreign men .
“ Foreign Boyfriend , Foreign Husband ” , with chapters written by Thai women already married to “ farang ” , or foreigners , sells a Cinderella - style dream to young Thai women hoping for a passport to a better life .
The book is packed with tips on dating , kissing , sexual positions , weddings , living abroad and bringing up children .
An early chapter gives basic advice on how to meet your foreign man : hang out in a bar , hotel or department store , be alone , wear a sexy dress , make eye contact , and , if you get the chance , tell a funny story .
Once you ’ve found your boyfriend , follow these rules to make him fall in love and marry you : always look good , have sex with him whenever he asks , do n’t be jealous of other women , do n’t be too demanding and do all the housework .
A certain stigma has always been attached to poor Thai women marrying foreigners .
At worst it is seen as an extension of a red - light transaction , an exchange of youth and beauty for money and security .
But the book portrays a more romantic vision .
Western men , it enthuses , are kind and respectful and less likely to have the bad habits sometimes associated with Thai men which include drinking , adultery and violence .
“ Thai men may have sweet words , ” it says , “ but they want to sleep with your sister too . ”
While your foreign man may be years -- even decades -- older than you , see that as a good thing .
“ An old man is very kind .
An old man has more money .
An old man is faithful , ” the guide says .
And foreigners are much more likely to accept a divorcee or widow , it claims , women not considered ideal wives in traditional Thai society .
Written in simple Thai , and available at bookstore chains across Thailand , the slim tome is aimed at impressionable , uneducated women and would be seen as a joke by many Thai women , said Aomjai Sarkhampee , a 27 - year - old teacher in Bangkok .
“ We do n’t believe that marrying a farang can make our dreams come true , ” she said .
“ We want more in life . ”
But in rural Thailand , finding a foreign husband is a common aspiration for young women .
In the poor northeast , an influx of more than 15,000 foreign men has brought an economic windfall and a welcome alternative to back - breaking work in the paddy fields .
“ Foreign men are not handsome , but they have more money , ” sums up the book .
The price tag attached to the government 's ID card scheme has been announced today by the Home Office , refueling criticism of the scheme .
Over the next decade £ 5.6 billion will be spent introducing the cards , which have been routinely criticised for their excessive cost and for the threat some believe they will pose to civil liberties .
Starting from next year , all foreign nationals coming to live in the UK will be issued with an identity card , and from 2010 all UK passport applicants will be forced to own one .
The government claims they will improve security , guard against terrorism and reduce crime rates .
The Identity Cards Act was passed in 2006 and requires the government to issues biannual cost projections for the scheme .
Polls taken last year gauge public support as being widely divided over the issue .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg has said he would refuse to comply with the scheme when it rolls out to all Britons .
Speaking today on the attending operational costs , Mr Clegg said : " It is becoming more and more clear that ID cards are going to be a vast waste of taxpayers ' money .
" The fact that the cost keeps changing shows how loose a grip the government has got on the finances of this ill - judged scheme .
" It is time to scrap ID cards and spend the money on something that will actually cut crime - [ like placing ] more police on the street . "
In 2006 , Lord Carlile - appointed to independently review the Terrorism Act - questioned the efficacy of the cards , saying they would have little value in the fight against terrorism .
Former home secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke - both architects of the 2006 legislation - have admitted in the past that the cards will not stop terrorism , but maintained it may assist with identifying perpetrators .
Human rights lawyers have also opposed the initiative on the grounds that it conflicts with article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights .

U.S. Army : Five million acres needed for training facilities by 2011 Adam Doster
Published : Saturday November 3 , 2007

As the U.S. military budget balloons , so does the Armed Services need to train its soldiers .
In fact , some military planners foresee a need for 5 million more acres for training facilities by 2011 .
In September , Sen. Wayne Allard ( R - Colo . ) told his fellow Congressmen that  the Army believes it has a current deficit of 2 million acres needed for training , a figure expected to grow by 2011 to 5 million acres . 
Five million acres is comprable to 7,812 square miles -- an area about the size of New Jersey .
Now , Colorado is the site of a contested fight between the U.S. Army and longtime ranchers .
The military wants to expand the Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site , a 1,000 - square - mile facility near the New Mexico border , by 418,000 acres , thus tripling its size .
This would require land owned by private ranchers .
The government is appealing to the patriotism of the community , but the landowners are skeptical of the appeals to national security .
" It 's rude .
It ai n't right .
It 's not American , " said Stan White , a rancher who could lose more than 6,000 acres in Walsenburg .
" We take our military and our country very seriously , but we 're up against something we can't get ahold of .
If they get this done , it 's a national disgrace . "
According to the Washington Post ,  Several dozen ranchers and members of 15 county commissions that voted to oppose the project find themselves pitted against the Pentagon and Colorado business interests in a struggle over property rights , personal heritage and the contested priorities of national security .
Businesses have joined the military in advocating for the base expansion .
Brian A. Binn , president of the military affairs committee of the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce , said  the benefits to the state economy and national defense are clear .
If the ranchers triumph and the training site is not created , he added , other states would be all too willing to accept the troops and the business . 

You know there ’s trouble ahead when Iraq , in its present state , is the good news story for Bush administration policy .
While various civilian and military officials from the president on down have been talking up “ success ” in Iraq and beating the rhetorical war drums vis-à - vis Iran , much of the remainder of the administration ’s foreign policy in what the neocons used to call “ the arc of instability ” began to thoroughly unravel .
In the Horn of Africa , U.S. - backed Ethiopian troops are bogged down in a disastrous occupation of Somalia ’s capital , harried by a growing Islamist insurgency .
Despite endless shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the administration ’s Middle East peace conference , to be held at Annapolis , is already being dismissed as a failure before the first official invitations are issued .
Meanwhile , the Turks are driving the administration to distraction by threatening to invade and destabilize the only moderately successful part of the new Iraq , its Kurdish region ( while the Iraqi government in Baghdad calls on Iran for help in the crisis ) .
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently landed in Tehran and brazenly indicated that any U.S. attack on Iran would be considered an attack on Russia .
He then convened a local “ mini- summit ” and formed a regional Caspian Sea - based alliance with Iran and three energy - rich former SSRs of the departed Soviet Union implicitly directed against the United States and its local allies .
On the day Secretary of State Rice announced new , tough sanctions against the Iranians , Putin commented pointedly : “ Why worsen the situation by threatening sanctions and bring it to a dead end ?
It ’s not the best way to resolve the situation by running around like a madman with a razor blade in his hand . ”
Meanwhile , one country to the east , the resurgent Taliban has , against all predictions , just captured a third district in Western Afghanistan near the Iranian border  and , as the most recent devastating suicide bomb indicates , attacks are spreading north .
And then , of course , there ’s the president ’s greatest ally in the Muslim world , Pakistan ’s ruler , Pervez Musharraf .
Remember Bush ’s nightmare scenario , the one that guaranteed a surefire “ preventive ” attack from his administration : an autocratic and oppressive ruler with weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear ones , presiding over a country that functionally offers a safe haven for terrorists ?
Well , that ’s now Pakistan , whose security forces are busily jailing hundreds of lawyers , while the Taliban , al - Qaeda , and extremist Islamists , well armed and backed by their own radio stations broadcasting calls for jihad , are moving out of safe havens in the tribal areas along the Afghan border and into Pakistan proper to fight .
And there ’s essentially nothing the administration can do , except mouth platitudes and look the other way .
As Paul Woodward of the War in Context Web site has pointed out :
When it comes to nuclear Iran and nuclear Pakistan , we have been living in “ a Through - the - Looking - Glass world where nuclear weapons that do exist are less dangerous than those that can be imagined . ”
Now , not much imagination is needed at all .
Strangely , from Ethiopia to Pakistan , despite all the signs , all the predictions , the Bush administration , as far as we can tell , expected none of the above .
How often can it be caught off guard by the consequences of its own decisions and actions ?
Eternally , it seems .
The possible collapse of the president ’s foreign policy across the entire arc of instability was first written about by the always prescient Juan Cole at Salon.com .
He commented that , “ like a drunken millionaire gambling away a fortune at a Las Vegas casino , the Bush administration squandered all the assets it began with by invading Iraq and unleashing chaos in the Gulf . ”
And he ventured a prediction : “ The thunder of the bomb [ that blew up as former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned home ] in Karachi and the Turkish shells in Iraqi Kurdistan may well be the sound of Bush losing his ‘ war on terror . ' ”
Over at TPM Café , Todd Gitlin was the first to offer a wry , if grim , suggestion , as he considered Bush ’s “ failure to crush the Taliban & Co. ” from Tora Bora 2001 on .
“ Talk about dominos , ” he wrote .
“ How about this for a Democratic slogan : Who Lost Pakistan ? ”
With the price of crude oil threatening to hit $ 100 a barrel and prices at the pump surging over $ 3 a gallon domestically  while , on the nightly news , experts mutter about oil at $ 150 a barrel and gas at $ 4 a gallon by next summer  a meltdown might be in the works .
Invaded and occupied Iraq , like some festering sore , remains at the heart of this spreading disaster , the end of which is nowhere in sight .
The U.S. military , the sole instrument with which Bush ’s top officials and his neocon followers imagined they could launch their “ expeditionary ” sorties around the globe , as if they were so many 19th - century British imperialists , has proved incapable of responding to such an essentially political situation .
The president might as well be using a hammer to ward off gnats .
No wonder , as retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and historian of early 20th - century Germany William Astore makes clear , the military and right - wing politicians are already preparing their own exit strategies in the form of stab - in - the - back explanations of what happened .

The Enemy Within
Finding American backs to stab
by William J. Astore
The world ’s finest military launches a highly coordinated shock - and - awe attack that shows enormous initial progress .
There ’s talk of the victorious troops being home for Christmas .
But the war unexpectedly drags on .
As fighting persists into a third , and then a fourth year , voices are heard calling for negotiations , even “ peace without victory . ”
Dismissing such peaceniks and critics as defeatists , a conservative and expansionist regime  led by a figurehead who often resorts to simplistic slogans and his Machiavellian sidekick , who is considered the brains behind the throne  calls for one last surge to victory .
Unbeknownst to the people on the home front , however , this duo has already prepared a seductive and self - exculpatory myth in case the surge fails .
The United States in 2007 ?
No , Wilhelmine Germany in 1917 and 1918 , as its military dictators , Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his loyal second , Gen. Erich Ludendorff , pushed Germany toward defeat and revolution in a relentless pursuit of victory in World War I .
Having failed with their surge strategy on the Western Front in 1918 , they nevertheless succeeded in deploying a stab - in - the - back myth , or Dolchstoßlegende , that shifted blame for defeat from themselves and Rightist politicians to Social Democrats and others allegedly responsible for losing the war by their failure to support the troops at home .
The German Army knew it was militarily defeated in 1918 .
But this was an inconvenient truth for Hindenburg and the Right , so they crafted a new “ truth ” : that the troops were “ unvanquished in the field . ”
So powerful did these words become that they would be engraved in stone on many a German war memorial .
It ’s a myth we ourselves are familiar with .
As South Vietnam was collapsing in 1975 , Army Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. , speaking to a North Vietnamese counterpart , claimed the U.S. military had never lost a battle in Vietnam .
Perhaps so , the NVA colonel replied , “ but it is also irrelevant . ”
Summers recounts his conversation approvingly , without irony , in his book On Strategy : A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War .
For him , even if we lost the war , our Army proved itself “ unbeatable . ”
Though Summers ’ premise was  and remains  dangerously misleading , it reassured the true believers who ran , and continue to run , our military .
Those military men who were less convinced of our “ unbeatable ” stature tended to keep their own counsel .
Their self - censorship , coupled with wider institutional self - deception , effectively opened the door to exculpatory myths .
A New American Stab - in - the - Back ?
Warnings about a new stab - in - the - back myth may seem premature or overheated at this moment in the Iraq War .
Yet , if the history of the original version of this myth is any guide , the opposite is true .
They are timely precisely because the Dolchstoßlegende was not a postwar concoction , but an explanation cunningly , even cynically , hatched by Rightists in Germany before the failure of the desperate , final “ victory offensive ” of 1918 became fully apparent .
Although Hindenburg ’s dramatic testimony in November 1919  a full year after the armistice that ended the war  popularized the myth in Germany , it caught fire precisely because the tinder had been laid to dry two years earlier .
It may seem farfetched to compare a Prussian military dictatorship and its self - serving lies to the current Bush administration .
Yet I ’m not the first person to express concern about the emergence of our very own Iraqi Dolchstoßlegende .
Back in 2004 , Matthew Yglesias first brought up the possibility .
Last year , in Harper ’s Magazine , Kevin Baker detailed the history of the stab - in - the - back , suggesting that Bush ’s Iraqi version was already beginning to germinate early in 2005 , when news from Iraq turned definitively sour .
And this October , in The Nation , Eric Alterman warned that the Bush administration was already busily sowing the seeds of this myth .
Other Iraqi myth - trackers have included Gary Kamiya at Salon.com and Jeremy Brecher and Brendan Smith at CommonDreams.org .
Just this August , Thomas Ricks , Washington
Post columnist and author of the best - selling book Fiasco , worried publicly about whether the military itself was n’t already embracing elements of the myth whose specific betrayers would include “ weaselly politicians ” ( are there any other kind ? ) and a “ media who undercut us by focusing on the negative . ”
Is an American version of this myth really emerging then ?
Let ’s listen in on a recent Jim Lehrer interview with Sen .
John McCain , who , while officially convinced that the president ’s surge plan in Iraq was working , could n’t seem to help talking about how we might yet lose .
His remarks quickly took a disturbing turn as he pointed out that our Achilles ’ heel in Iraq is well , we the people of the United States and our growing impatience with the war .
And the historical analogy he employed was Vietnam , the catalyst for the deployment of the previous American Dolchstoßlegende .
While the Vietnam War was disastrous , McCain conceded , our military had  he argued  turned the tide after the enemy ’s Tet Offensive in 1968 and the replacement of Gen. William Westmoreland with Gen. Creighton Abrams as commander of our forces there .
Precisely at that tipping - point moment , he insisted , the American people , their patience exhausted , had lost their will to win .
For McCain , there really was a light at the end of that Vietnamese tunnel  the military saw it , yet the American people , blinded by bad news , never did .
In today ’s Iraq  again the McCain version  Gen. David Petraeus is the new Abrams , finally the right general for the job .
And his new tactic of protecting the Iraqi people , thereby winning their hearts and minds , is working .
Victory beckons at the end of the “ long , hard path ” ( that evidently has replaced the Vietnamese tunnel ) , unless the American people run out of patience , as they did back in the late 1960s .
McCain is no Hindenburg .
Yet his almost automatic displacement of ultimate responsibility from the Bush administration and the military to the American people indicates the traction the stab - in - the - back myth has already gained in mainstream politics .
For the moment , with hope for some kind of victory , however defined , not quite vanquished in official circles , our latest dagger - myth remains sheathed , its murderous power as yet unwielded .
Then again , perhaps that ’s not quite the case , even now .
In The Empire Strikes Back , young Luke Skywalker asks Yoda , his wizened Jedi Master , whether the dark side of the Force is stronger than the good .
No , Yoda replies , just “ easier , quicker , more seductive ”  an accurate description of the dark power of the stab - in - the - back myth .
Politicians sense its future power and alter their positions accordingly .
For example , no leading presidential candidate , Republican or Democrat , dares to be labeled “ defeatist ” by calling for a major withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2008 .
Exceptions like Ron Paul , Dennis Kucinich , or even Bill Richardson only prove the rule  with support in the low single - digits , they risk little in bucking the odds .
Fear of being labeled “ the enemy within ” is already silently reshaping our politics as even decorated combat veterans like Congressman ( and retired Marine Corps colonel ) John Murtha are not immune from being smeared for criticizing the president ’s war .
Politicians recognize that , in a campaign , it ’s well - nigh impossible to overcome charges of weakness and pusillanimity .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton senses that she may be unelectable unless she argues for us to continue to fight the good fight in Iraq , albeit more intelligently .
In fact , if you ’re looking for significant changes in troop levels or strategy there , better hunker in for Inauguration Day 2009  and then prepare to wait some more .
Of Myths and Accountability
McCain ’s comments did echo a Clausewitzian truth .
In warfare , the people ’s will is an indispensable component of a nation ’s war - fighting ” trinity ” ( that also includes the government and the military ) .
It ’s exceedingly difficult to prevail in a major war , if a leg of this triad is hobbled .
By choosing not to mobilize the people ’s will , by telling us to go about our normal lives as others were fighting and dying in our name , the Bush administration actually hobbled its own long - term efforts .
Now , they are getting ready to claim that it was all our fault .
We were the ones who lost our patience and will to victory .
This is rather like the boy who killed his father and mother , only to throw himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan .
Back in 2002 - 2003 , with an all - volunteer military , a new Blitzkrieg strategy , and believing God to be on their side , it appears Bush and Company initially assumed that broader calls for support and sacrifice were militarily unnecessary  and unnecessarily perilous politically .
Now , despite dramatic setbacks over the last four years , they still refuse to mobilize our national will .
Their refusal reminds me of the tagline of those old Miller Lite beer commercials :
Everything you always wanted in a war , and less  as in less ( or even no ) sacrifices .
So let me be clear :
If we lose in Iraq , the American people will not be to blame .
We can not be accused of lacking a will that was never wanted or called upon to begin with .
Yet the stab - in - the - back myth gains credibility precisely because so few high - level people either in government or the military are being held accountable for failures in Iraq .
In World War II , Thomas Ricks reminds us , our military relieved 17 division commanders and four corps commanders of duty .
With the possible exception of Brig .
Gen. Janice Karpinski of Abu Ghraib infamy , has any senior officer been relieved for cause in Iraq ?
Since none apparently has , does this mean that , unlike the spineless American people , they have all performed well ?
To cite just one typical case , Maj. Gen. Kenneth Hunzeker served as the commanding general , Civilian Police Assistance Training Team , from October 2006 to July 2007 in Iraq .
Surely , this was a tough job , especially for a man with no proficiency in Arabic .
Yet , by all accounts , Iraqi police units to this day remain remarkably corrupt , militia - ridden , and undependable .
Does this mean Hunzeker failed ?
Apparently not , since he was promoted to lieutenant general and given a coveted corps command .
Interestingly , his most recent official biography fails to mention his time in Iraq leading the police assistance team .
Even if Hunzeker was indeed the best man for the job , what kind of progress could have been possible in a 10 - month tour of duty ?
By the time Hunzeker learned a few painful lessons , he was already jetting to Germany and command of V Corps .
If no one is held accountable for failed policies , if , in fact , those closest to the failures are showered with honors  as was , for instance , L. Paul Bremer III , who headed the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad for the President from May 2003 to June 2004  it becomes easier to shift blame to anyone ( or everyone ) .
Here , German precedents are again compelling .
Because the German people were never told they were losing World War I , even as their Army was collapsing in July and August 1918 , they were unprepared for the psychological blow of defeat  and so , all - too - willing to accept the lie that the collapse was due to the enemy within .
This is not to say that today ’s military has been silent .
To cite three examples , retired Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez recently criticized the surge strategy and called the Iraq war “ a nightmare with no end in sight . ”
Another perspective came from 12 Army captains formerly stationed in Iraq , who , writing in the Washington Post , also rejected the surge and called for rapid withdrawal as the best of a series of bad options .
Finally , seven NCOs in the elite 82d Airborne Division ( and then still in Iraq ) offered graphic illustrations ( on the op - ed page of the New York Times ) of the one - step - forward , two - steps - back nature of “ progress ” on the ground in Iraq .
Think of these as three military perspectives on a disastrous war .
But even they can serve as only a partial antidote to the myth that some kind of victory is inevitable as long as we , the American people , remain supinely supportive of administration policy .
Blaming You
Given the right postwar conditions , the myth of the stab - in - the - back can facilitate the rise of reactionary regimes and score - settling via long knives  just ask Germans under Hitler in 1934 .
It also serves to exonerate a military of its blunders and blind spots , empowering it and its commanders to launch redemptive , expansionist adventures that turn disastrous precisely because previous lessons of defeat were never faced , let alone absorbed or embraced .
Thus , the German military ’s collapse in World War I and the Dolchstoß myth that followed enabled the even greater disaster of World War II .
Is it possible that our own version of this , associated with Vietnam , enabled an even greater disaster in Iraq ?
And , if so , what could the next version of the stab - in - the - back bring in its wake ?
Only time will tell .
But consider yourself warned .
If we lose Iraq , you ’re to blame .

This is for anyone interested in understanding what American foreign policy has done to people in Iran .
( For simplicity ’s sake , I have combined the roles of the USA and the UK , as the USA was assuming control of the former British Empire at this time . )
1953 : Coup in America
Dwight D. Eisenhower is elected President of the United States , a country that receives most of its income from oilfields in Pennsylvania and Texas .
The oil is pumped and distributed by the Persian - American Oil Company , owned by Iran .
Fulfilling a major campaign promise , Eisenhower reviews the oil production - sharing agreements between Iran and the USA .
As Iran is taking more than 90 % of American oil revenues , Eisenhower attempts to renegotiate this arrangement on more even terms for his country .
Prime Minister Mossadegh of Iran is outraged at this show of “ American greed . ”
Instead of negotiating , Iran sends its intelligence agents to carry out a policy of regime change .
They hire an assortment of American street gangs to do the grunt work .
Bombs destroy churches and community centers across the United States .
Fliers and pamphlets appear everywhere , claiming that Eisenhower is a member of Communist Party USA .
The Communists , according to the fliers , are destroying churches for Eisenhower to help liberate Americans from the “ opiate of the masses . ”
Local newspapers , covertly funded by Iran , echo these ideas .
American public opinion is inflamed against President Eisenhower .
The Iranians bribe unpatriotic generals like L.L. Limnitzer to lead the coup against Eisenhower .
The Iranians want an authoritarian , fiercely anti-Communist dictator who will never attempt anything resembling nationalization of the American oilfields .
After carefully weighing the options , Iran installs Senator Joseph McCarthy as their puppet king to rule the USA .
1953 –1979 : The McCarthy Era
King Joe McCarthy rules with an iron fist for 26 years .
Though initially reluctant to obey a foreign government , King Joe soon embraces his sweeping new powers , as well as the constant flow of Iranian aid and weapons that makes it all possible .
Iranian intelligence agents create , for McCarthy ’s regime , the Department to Surveil and Vet Americans for the King ( SAVAK ) .
Hundreds of thousands of “ suspected Communists ” disappear from American society , in a general purge of teachers , newspaper reporters , and numerous government officials .
It is rumored they are vanishing into a gulag of secret prisons in northern Alaska built by Brown & Root .
1978 –1979 : The Christianist Revolution
Under SAVAK rules , large groups of Americans can only congregate in two places : pre-arranged , pro-McCarthy rallies , and houses of worship .
As a result , revolutionary tendencies sprout and grow in churches , led by radical clerics Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson , and Jim Bakker .
With other evangelical leaders , they form the Supreme Council for the Christian Revolution in America ( SCCRA ) , or the “ Christian Coalition . ”
American Raj : America ... Eric Margolis Best Price : $ 9.95 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Anger at King Joe McCarthy , and the Iranians who control him , reaches a fever pitch in 1979 .
Millions of young Americans throw their support behind the SCCRA .
The young people may not agree with all of the radical clerics ’ goals , but they cannot abide the brutal McCarthy era any longer .
They overthrow the oppressive dictatorship of King Joe .
In the course of this , American revolutionaries seize control of the Iranian embassy in Washington , from which the puppet McCarthy government was controlled .
Iranian TV manages to feature this “ American hostage crisis ” night after night for 444 days without mentioning that America had suffered for decades under a puppet regime installed by Iran .
Eventually , a secret deal is reached between the Christian Coalition — now the rulers of America — and Iran , and the hostages are released .
1980 –1988 : The America - Mexico War
The Iranians have previously maneuvered one of their long - time Mexican intelligence assets , whom we ’ll call “ José Husseino , ” into the position of dictator of Mexico .
Now they provide their pet dictator with arms , aid and intelligence , and launch Mexico into an invasion of the United States .
Ideally , this policy will topple the revolutionary Christianist government in Washington .
Failing that , the Iranian leadership hopes Mexico will seize the oil - rich province of Texas , denying revenue to the new Washington government , while keeping Texas oil within the Iranian “ sphere of influence . ”
1988 : Oops
As it turns out , Americans are not about to surrender their country to the Mexican army .
They fight hard to repel the foreign invader .
Millions die on in each country , and infrastructure along both sides of the border is bombed into rubble .
Iran provides the Mexican regime with chemical and biological weapons , which the Mexican dictator Husseino wields against American soldiers and civilians alike .
The war wounded and maimed number in the millions .
Long trenches are dug to bury the American dead .
The USA must cope with a generation of chemically - burned war orphans .
Husseino also uses these chemical weapons to crush an uprising in Chihuahua , earning himself the nickname ‘ Murderer of Mexico City . ’
The Iranian regime shows no concern about this humanitarian catastrophe , and continues supplying weapons of mass destruction to Husseino .
The war is fought to a draw .
Husseino claims victory while his soldiers beat a hasty retreat back to Mexico .
1991 : Oops again
Iranian politicians realize they have inadvertently built Mexico into one of the world ’s most powerful militaries .
Mexico now threatens Iranian interests in the Caribbean , as well as Central and South America .
When Husseino shows interest in invading the small neighboring country of Guatemala , the Iranian government decides to encourage him .
The Iranian ambassador allegedly told Husseino :
We have no opinion on your American - American conflicts , such as your dispute with Guatemala .
Secretary of State Mohammed Mossadegh III has directed me to emphasize the instruction , first given to Mexico in the 1960s , that the Guatemala issue is not associated with Iran .
The Rendon Group is hired to cook up anti-Mexican propaganda .
A teenage girl relates a sobbing story of the brutality of Mexican soldiers against innocent Guatemalan babies .
The story is reported and repeated through every news outlet in Iran .
( Years later , it will be revealed as propaganda .
This , however , is never widely reported to the Iranian public , nor referenced by major journalists when the next round of wartime propaganda rolls out . )
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Iran invades Guatemala and Mexico , destroying most of Husseino ’s military .
They leave their formerly - favored dictator in power , however .
The Iranian State Department advises that removing Husseino will lead to turmoil and civil war in Mexico , bogging down Iranian troops for an unknown number of years .
Also , the removal of Husseino could only empower the hated Americans .
Tehran decides not to go there .
Guatemala is now home to several new Iranian bases , which keep a close eye on events in Mexico , the United States , and other Iranian interests in the region .
1991 –2001 : The Interbellum Years
The destitute people of the United States struggle to recover from the massive loss of life and property during the America - Mexico War of the 1980s .
We watch as Iran enforces a “ no - fly ” zone over Mexico , and we hope our troubles with those two countries are over .
Perhaps they will finally leave us alone .
Still , Iran wields its enormous international influence to impose economic sanctions on both Mexico and the United States .
Half a million children die from malnutrition , while depleted uranium left over from the “ Gulf Coast War ” of 1991 sows an epidemic of cancer throughout Mexico and the southern half of the United States .
Iran covertly funnels millions of dollars to any and every dissatisfied group in America .
The KKK , the Black Panthers , the John Birch Society , and even the Vermont Secessionists experience a surge in anonymous foreign donations .
9/11/2001 : 23 Jumada al - Akhar
An airplane crashes into Azadi Tower ( or , interestingly , “ Freedom Tower ” ) in Iran .
Within minutes , “ counterterrorism experts ” emerge from the woodwork to blame a relatively obscure terrorist group in Cuba .
No other suspects , not even obvious contenders like Russian intelligence , are ever mentioned .
A Latin American passport is found in the rubble of Azadi Square , and this apparently proves the first guessers correct .
Iranians are stunned to learn , via their news media , that the West is full of murderous killers driven by an extreme , violent religion .
Apparently , these “ Christofascists ” are everywhere , and they hate Muslims for their way of life , especially Iranians .
Iranians learn the West is full of groups that would kill and die for the chance to remake the Middle East in their own image .
( Hold on , I lost track of which was the real timeline and which was imaginary … OK , I ’m back . )
October 2001 : Iran Invades Cuba
Iran invades Cuba and topples the Castro regime , in spite of their previously close alliance .
The United States offers its help to Iran , an attempt at friendship and solidarity against a common enemy after the horrific 23 Jumada attack , but Iran rebuffs America .
1/29/2002 : Axis of Evil
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( we ’ll say ) pronounces that the United States , Mexico and Venezuela constitute an “ Axis of Evil ” that threatens the world .
He cites America ’s history of genocide , slavery , and segregation , its wars against the Philippines and Vietnam .
American citizens are puzzled .
Our president and Venezuela ’s have been threatening each other for some time .
And did n’t we just fight a bloody , protracted eight - year war against the invading Mexicans ?
How can anyone believe we are three allied nations ?
Iran accuses all three countries of developing nuclear weapons .
This , too , puzzles the Americans .
Iran has tens of thousands of nukes , and is the only country that ever actually used them .
( Through baroque circumstances too complex to describe here , Iran obliterated two Argentinean cities in the 1940s ) .
America is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , which allows us to create nuclear power plants for peaceful energy .
America needs nuclear power – the Pennsylvania oil is long gone , and even the rich Texas fields are playing out .
We will need alternative sources of energy to survive as a civilization .
However , this sort of logic is denounced as “ pro-American propaganda ” in the halls of Tehran .
March 2003
After endless harassment , Mexico ’s José Husseino fails to divest himself of the weapons of mass destruction he does not possess .
Iran invades and occupies Mexico .
No WMD are found , though it takes the Iranian government a year or two to gradually acknowledge this .
No matter .
Mexicans suffered horrendously under the Husseino dictatorship .
Remember how he gassed the poor Chihuahuans ?
( Forget the context , or where he got the weapons , just remember that it happened . )
They should welcome Iranian occupation , even if the number of violent deaths soars !
2003 –2005
After a quick victory over the Husseino government , Iran begins hurling threats at America and Venezuela , the other “ Axis ” members .
However , Iran fails to neutralize the fierce Mexican resistance , and the situation devolves into factional fighting as various interests compete for power .
Iran responds by stepping up the threats against America .
August 6 , 2005 : America Radicalizes
In response to the drumbeat of threats from Iran , Americans vote out the somewhat - less - hawkish Bill Clinton ( serving his , er , third term ) and we elect a new , “ tougher ” prime minister to protect us : militant religious fanatic George W. Bush .
Iranian newspapers tell the world that “ W , ” as his brainwashed followers call him , believes in a crazed End Times cult that expects
God to destroy the world at any moment .
Iranian politicians argue that such a fanatical extremist , with a head full of Armageddon and the Second Coming , can never be trusted with even one nuclear weapon .
The new Bush regime immediately cracks down on dissent and any sign of “ Easternization ” among Americans .
Body piercings , tattoos , and belly shirts are immediately outlawed .
Websites , from LewRockwell.com , to the American Conservative , to the Huffington Post , plus thousands of others , vanish without explanation overnight .

( It is . )
October 9 , 2006 : Boom .
The world is stunned when Hugo Chavez of Venezuela detonates a small nuclear bomb .
Now that Venezuela is a nuclear power , Iranian leaders no longer speak of an “ Axis of Evil . ”
Iran dispatches ambassadors to Caracas to find a “ reasonable solution ” to Venezuela ’s entrance into the nuclear club .
This sets off high - level discussion between Ayatollahs Robertson and Dobson .
( Ayatollah Bakker has been disgraced and removed from power , while Ayatollah Falwell is away having frosted - doughnut - related surgery , and is not long for this world . )
Maybe , their thinking goes , America should develop a nuclear bomb to deter Iran , considering Iran ’s long history of aggression and subterfuge against America .
They recognize the difference between Iran ’s treatment of nuclear Venezuela versus non-nuclear Mexico .
2007
Some level of trade across the USA - Mexico border continues , as it always has .
However , Mexican society has disintegrated into endless conflict , and tens of millions of war refugees pour into the United States .
The American government sends agents to monitor the situation in Mexico and search for solutions to the instability along the southern border .
Iran cites this involvement as proof that the USA is secretly behind the Mexican insurgency .
The idea that the Mexicans themselves want to resist the foreign , Iranian occupation is still not allowed on Iranian television .
Iran steps up its threats against the United States , claiming that America is “ very close ” to building a nuclear weapon .
( Iranian intelligence disagrees , but this is not exactly emphasized by Iranian media . )
Iranian aircraft carriers and warships appear in the Gulf of Mexico and along the coast of New England .
American children stand on piers in Maine and Florida to watch the Iranian war games .
The Iranian people , meanwhile , are weary of the prolonged , apparently endless wars in Cuba and Mexico .
They have no desire for war with America , but neither do they control their government .
Ahmadinejad claims
Bush is threatening to “ wipe Canada off the map , ” though this has long been revealed as an inaccurate translation .
( Bush ’s actual words : “ Where the heck is Canada ?
I ca n’t find it on the map . ” )
The world holds its breath , wondering if Iran will hit America with bombs , or even a pre-emptive nuclear strike , and ignite World War III , which will likely engulf the Americas .
The future of civilization depends on the restraint and rationality of a foreign power whose leadership , so far , has displayed no evidence of possessing either trait .
July 5 , 2007
The Best of J. L. Bryan
A French judge has ordered the France 2 television network to screen in court previously withheld footage of the shooting of Muhammad al - Dura , the Palestinian boy shot dead in his father 's arms in Netzarim in 2000 during a battle between Palestinian gunmen and IDF soldiers .
The army was blamed around the world for the boy 's fatal shooting although an IDF investigation in January 2001 into the incident failed to find conclusive evidence as to whether it was an IDF or Palestinian bullet that killed the child .
The screening has been tentatively set for November 14 , Ynetnews has learned , though it is not yet clear whether members of the public will be allowed to view the film .
Wednesday 's landmark ruling is set to reignite the explosive debate surrounding the footage .
After the images of the young boy 's death were first aired seven years ago , the video ignited widespread rage across the Muslim world , and several failed suicide bombers cited the incident as their motivation to carry out a terrorist attack .
Since then , sources in Israel and a number of independent analysts have maintained that Palestinian forces were likely responsible for the killing , and a German documentary aired in 2002 suggested that a Palestinian bullet was the cause of al - Dura 's death .
Recently , the IDF submitted a formal request to have the footage made available for analysis .
Phillipe Karsenty , head of the French media watchdog Media Ratings , is behind the legal petition calling on France 2 to release the raw footage from that day .
' I hope that this will end smear campaign '
Speaking to Ynetnews , Karsenty said the ruling was " a first step towards a final victory which will lead French authorities to admit they broadcast a huge , anti-Semitic lie , used to justify the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl .
" This film has been seen all over the Arab world .
Schools carry the name of al - Dura , and children are taught that Israelis kill for no reason .
So while you cannot resurrect people who died because of this lie , you can avoid more people dying , " Karesenty said .
The media analyst added , however , that " judges and myself will not change this story , " and called on French President Nicholas Sarkozy to order a full - scale investigation into the footage .
" France 2 is owned by the French state , which is headed by Sarkozy .
He has the power to ask for those images , and have them scrutinized by experts around the world .
I now call on Sarkozy to ask for the footage ... it 's time for French president to tell the truth , " Karsenty declared .
Charles Enderlin , Jerusalem bureau chief of France 2 , provided rolling commentary on the footage back in 2000 .
" Here Jamal and his son Muhammad are the targets of gunshots that have come from the Israeli position ....
A new burst of gunfire , Muhammad is dead and his father seriously wounded , " he said during a broadcast of the footage .
Reacting to Wednesday 's court ruling Enderlin told Ynetnews he welcomed the decision .
" I am very happy about this decision .
From the start , our position has been that we will not release raw footage except through a judicial process .
We will not release the footage to militants or private individuals , " he said .
" I 'm very happy that it will be seen in court .
I hope that this is the end of a smear campaign which has gone on for seven years , and which has been difficult for me and my family , " he added .
" People have accused us of staging an event which is an absolute lie .
I am very happy at last to have the possibility ( to show it ) , " Enderlin said .
Raw footage ' contains clear hoaxes '
At the center of the court battle are several minutes of footage shot by Palestinian cameraman Talal Abu Rahma .
During testimony before the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in 2000 , Rahma said : " I spent about 27 minutes photographing the incident which took place for 45 minutes ....
I can confirm that the child was intentionally and in cold blood shot dead , and his father injured , by the Israeli army . "
According to Karsenty , however , the cameraman 's sole purpose is to further Palestinian propaganda causes .
" This guy told an American newspaper that he chose to be a journalist so to serve the Palestinian cause , " Karsenty said .
According to Professor Richard Landes , who told Ynetnews he had seen the full raw footage , the film contains damning evidence of faked scenes staged for the purpose of making Israel look bad .
Landes has become heavily involved in the battle to make the film available , and produced a film , " Pallywood , " based on the shooting .
He has expressed concern that France 2 will attempt to tamper with the original footage , and cut out embarrassing scenes , resulting in a screening of an edited version of the film .
" I saw the tapes three times with Enderlin in Jerusalem , " Landes told Ynetnews .
" One scene in particular stands out , in which a guy grabs his leg as if he 's been shot , but blood can not be seen .
He starts to limp really seriously .
He is picked up by young kids and taken to an ambulance .
He looks around and sees no one is looking , and then walks away without a limp , " Landes said .
Describing the court ruling as " spectacular , " Landes said he hoped it would draw attention to what he described as " an industry " of anti-Israel media propaganda .
" The western media , instead of saying this is n't journalism , says , what can I use ? "
Landes said .
He added that another scene in the withheld footage shows a Palestinian child with makeup made to resemble a gunshot injury in the head running into a crowd of Palestinians , who proceed to rush the uninjured child into an ambulance .
" Yes , terrible damage has been done , " Landes said , adding , however , that the world has become " much more receptive " to acknowledging hoaxes " like Kfar Qanna and Gaza beach . "
" This can also potentially play a critical role in Muslim world , by providing a weapon to Muslims who realize that the global jihad is a catastrophe for them , " Landes added .
" If this image is proven fake , it will be a blow against the jihad , " he said .

If you share my view that technology drives history more than any other factor , then you will probably agree that the 21st century is going to be significantly shaped by the outcome of a single question :
Will synthetic biology achieve radical success or not ?
In this column I ’ll describe an early warning sign to watch for that will give us a clue about which way this important new field is headed .
Synthetic biology is the current term for the outer reaches of ambition in biotechnology .
More often than not , the notion includes making artificial biology more like digital computation .
It could hardly be otherwise , for computers are central to most of the prior art we have for building highly complicated structures from scratch .
Computers also symbolize the ultimate in freedom through technology .
You can hypothetically program a computer to do virtually anything with its input and output devices .
If we could only find the right computer program to operate robotic medical devices , for instance , we could create a robot surgeon to cure any disease .
If we could do the same with DNA and the other chemicals of life , we could create a huge variety of novel creatures or transform ourselves into astonishing new forms .
But if we entertain the idea that biotechnology is going to become more like computation , we are n’t being very specific , because there is more than one kind of computation .
In particular , it might be more revealing to ask if synthetic biology is more likely to turn out like digital hardware or software .
That ’s an excellent candidate to be the most important question of the century .
From a mathematician ’s point of view , hardware and software are practically interchangeable .
You can almost always emulate a chip in software or implement a program as a chip .
In practice , though , the two things could hardly be more different .
Chips get faster and cheaper at a predictable , accelerating rate that is so reliable it is known as a law — the famous Moore ’s law .
Software typically gets worse over time .
It ’s true that faster computers enable new software algorithms that were n’t possible before , like ones for machine vision ( see Jaron ’s World : Computer Evolution ) , but old programs do n’t necessarily get better as hardware improves .
In fact , they often lose efficiency at such a breathtaking rate that they effectively cancel out Moore ’s law when they are adapted to run on new , faster machines .
Try opening a similar word - processor document on old and new computers :
The performance is often similar , even if the hardware has improved a thousandfold .
How can this be ?
Software is so difficult to work with that in practice it almost never achieves its theoretical potential .
If synthetic biology turns out to improve in the accelerating way that computer hardware does , we will be in for quite a ride .
It ’s hard to predict how weird things could get , so one is tempted to max out deliriously as a futurist .
Imagine an artfully designed fungus that looks like a hat ; when you put it on , it digests your head and turns it into a still - conscious , rubbery Super Ball an inch across , suitable for easy launch into space .
Once there , another fungus might then reconstitute your head and form a protective life - sustaining bubble around it .
( This prediction may go too far , but the point is that it ’s hard to say by what margin . )
If synthetic biology instead turns out to be more like software , it will still be amazing but in a more incremental , less predictable way .
We will witness a succession of plateaus of achievement in areas like medicine and bioenergy .
After a decade or two , we might have engineered bacteria that make fuel out of old garbage dumps , or maybe even a substantially artificial cell that acts like a doctor , swimming through the body and fixing our own aging human cells .
Then again , reality often violates our preconceived notions , and synthetic biology could turn out to have a character that does n’t resemble hardware or software .
Natural biology is certainly unlike either of those !
It is flexible , as software ought to be from a naive point of view , but it is not as fragile as software .
Synthetic biology may very well introduce a fourth kind of design complexity that has some of the qualities of all three precedents .
Lately I ’ve had the good fortune to be able to investigate this possibility as a visitor at a remarkable lab in Berkeley called the Molecular Sciences Institute , or MolSci , headed by Roger Brent .
He and his team are describing biological phenomena at a minute level of detail , which could pave the way for synthetic biologists to come .
One of MolSci ’s innovations is a “ tadpole , ” a human - designed molecule with a protein head and a DNA tail that can precisely count the number of rare molecules inside a cell .
The kinds of data that can be gathered at labs like MolSci are exactly what ’s needed if we are ever to understand what is going on inside a cell from a computational point of view .
The key to understanding complicated things like synthetic biology is being able to break them into simpler things .
Let ’s call this modularity .
Going back to the difference between hardware and software :
The problem a chip designer has to solve is modularized completely within a tight conceptual box .
The logic design of a chip is perfectly specified , and the parameters of the physical environment in which it will operate , such as the temperature , can be carefully constrained .
Software , in contrast , makes contact with the wild world outside the limits of comfortable abstractions .
Even when you think you ’ve considered every condition that a piece of software will encounter , the rebellious nature of reality ( including the foibles of human users ) will come up with something to violate your assumptions .
E-mail programs were originally written without foreseeing that some people would want to write viruses to pierce them .
If you completely understand your problem , as chip designers do , you ’re not only halfway to solving it , you can also draw on lessons you ’ve learned in the past .
Your knowledge compounds , and I think that ’s part of why chip engineering gets better and better .
If you are instead facing the wilds of nature , you have to adapt constantly , and old knowledge is not necessarily relevant to new challenges .
There ’s a subtle philosophical point that needs to be made about modularity .
If you look at a complicated thing , like a big computer program , there might be more than one way of interpreting how it can be broken into modules .
In the case of biology , it ’s most likely there are layers of biological modularity staring us in the face that we have n’t noticed yet .
The reason I suspect this is true is because of the amazing resilience of biological systems .
If you make an alphabetized list of all the possible large computer programs ( up to a given size ) without regard to how they might be broken into modules , the distribution of the ones that crash will be random .
Not only that , you can never even be sure that you ’ve found all the ones that might eventually crash .
In general , you ca n’t do experiments ( using evolutionary experimental method ) with large - scale computer code to learn about the code because the results will be random .
Dismal indeed !
If biology were equally dismal , the results of evolutionary experiments would also be random , and evolution would be impossible .
But there are special cases in which it ’s possible to evade the curse .
If the code is encapsulated into modules that can work together in a multitude of possible combinations , then a lot of similar large programs might be expected to operate in similar ways because they are just different combinations of those modules .
That means there might be areas in that long alphabetized list where a bunch of “ good ” large programs are clumped together .
Conversely , if you find a bunch of “ good ” programs in close proximity to one another , you have evidence that there ’s an underlying modularity helping you avoid the curse of randomness .
Natural biology does n’t have just one scheme for modularity but a multitude of examples we know about .
If you make random changes to a gene , you ’ll still be able to get a protein out of the result about a third of the time ( though for any specific gene the ratio might be much higher or lower ) .
Brent thinks of that as a perilous rate of failure , but biologists are inured to luxury .
If computer science could generate a system in which a third of the guesses yielded programs worth testing , we could probably keep up with Moore ’s law !
No such luck .
When computer scientists look for ways to make software suck less , we do it by trying out new kinds of modularity .
But the sad truth is that computer science still has n’t found a form of modularity that helps us clump “ good ” programs so that we can efficiently use experimental method ( the way regular scientists do ) to explore the meanings of small program tweaks .
Instead , we have to slog through all the random results to make progress .
So , finally , the promised early warning sign to watch for :
If biologists start reporting the discoveries of new levels of modularity — and in particular , if synthetic biologists can modify those encapsulation schemes — then watch out .
The fungus hat will start to sound just a touch less crazy .
If , on the other hand , what you hear about is experiments in which previously known modules like genes are swapped around , then expect a more dismal , softwarelike biotechnology .
It will get better , but on software ’s grudging schedule instead of hardware ’s soaring trajectory .

Washington , D.C .
Former Bush press secretary Scott McClellan accused George W. Bush and Dick Cheney of deceiving the public about a devastating blow to the national security and safety of United States .
The revelation concerns the leak of Valerie Plame 's identity as one of the government 's top intelligence agents .
Revealed in the Chicago Sun Times on July 14 , 2003 , this breach of national security was the topic of intense coverage in the mainstream print and television news media .
This deliberate leak abruptly ended Plame 's intelligence activities , her career , and placed Plame and her contacts in serious jeopardy .
The charge appeared in an excerpt from McClellan 's upcoming book " Inside the Bush White House and What 's Wrong with Washington . "
Publication is set for April 2008 .
The critical passage was released on Tuesday Nov. 20 .
It described a conspiracy to deceive the public by Bush and Cheney , which included White House chief of staff Andrew Card , Scooter Libby , and Karl Rove .
Valerie Plame was a top CIA agent , one of just a few to hold the distinction as an agent with non-official cover ( NOC ) .
These advanced intelligence professionals operate with assumed identities .
Plame was cloaked as an energy consultant with the firm of Brewster Jennings and Associates .
Her role in the CIA 's Counterproliferation Division was to identify and track the international black market of nuclear weapons intended for use against citizens of the United States .
In a brief passage from the upcoming book , McClellan comments on his 2003 denial of charges that Karl Rove and " Scooter " Libby were involved in the leak of Plame 's identity :
" The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
So I stood at the White house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
" There was one problem .
It was not true .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice President , the President 's chief of staff , and the President himself . "
Public Affairs ( McClellan 's Publisher ) Web Site
Where are the Headlines ?
White House involvement in compromising a top intelligence agent was a matter of great concern in 2003 .
Why the indifference in 2007 ?
The response of the mainstream media has been barely noticeable .
The following searches of Google and Yahoo " news " make this perfectly clear .
A Yahoo News search for " top story " using " McClellan " produced just nine articles .
Three were from the Boston Globe , four from local television web sites , two from AlterNet , an alternative , left leaning web site , and one from " Real Time Traders , " a Dow Jones financial news service .
Of the mainstream media , just one newspaper , the Boston Globe , and only four television stations saw this as ' top story " from 12:00 p.m. Tuesday , Nov. 20 through 3:00 a.m. EST Friday , the 23rd ( the timing for all the searches mentioned in this article ) .
A " News " search for " McClellan " anywhere in any article on both Google and Yahoo produced similar totals but a different frequency for web hits .
The meta - search engine called " Dogpile " was used as a basis to determine the actual number of unduplicated stories .
How astounding that these searches produced so few hits .
Did n't the press secretary just accuse Bush , Cheney , Card , Rove , and Libby of collective action to conceal the truth , i.e. , a conspiracy ?
Did n't the concealed truth concern a major intelligence operation designed to keep us from getting nuked ?
If this does n't rate intensive coverage and comment , what does ?
Google and Yahoo searches by media type .
" Dogpile " is a meta search service that provides unduplicated results .
It is closest to a true total for stories .
News sites on the web had the most consistent reporting and commentary on this story .
The Huffington Post had at least eight articles .
BuzzFlash and OpEdNews also made their presence known .
The ideologically androgynous Slate was cautions , however .
John Dickerson parsed McClellan 's words too tightly in " The Press Dog that Didn't Bark . "
He said , " Scott McClellan has offered no bombshells – yet . "
What would count as bombshell ?
Maybe McClellan needed audio or video tapes to satisfy Slate .
Of all the stories , mainstream or alternative , the Associated Press was right on target with " Former press secretary accuses Bush , Cheney of deceiving public about CIA leak case . "
The story of the McClellan bombshell is that there is no story being told by the mainstream media .
Here 's a partial explanation .
Jack McElroy , editor of the Knoxville News Sentinel , shared his response to a reader inquiry .
The reader wanted to know why the paper was n't covering McClellan 's revelation .
McElroy quoted his response in an editorial entitled " Did We Bury a Bush Expose ? "
A local newspaper can rarely provide national information that interested readers have not already received from other sources .
The news you mention was widely disseminated by the national media .
In fact , your complaint is not that you did not receive the information , but rather that we did not use enough of our space to reiterate the information you received elsewhere .
Knoxville News Sentinel Nov. 21 , 2007
Had editor McElroy used the meta search service Dogpile , he would have seen this 1 - 20 of 30 from All Search Engines .
Dogpile uses Google , Yahoo , and other major search engines to produce comprehensive unduplicated results – 30 primary sources , period .
McElroy was wrong .
The story was not " widely disseminated by the national media . "
It was barely covered .
With editor McElroy 's inaccurate statement about national coverage and the indifference of his paper to a huge story , it 's no wonder citizens distrust the press .
Should n't Protecting Against This Generate a More than a Few Headlines ?
Valerie Plame 's mission was to track the illegal market in nuclear weapons .
The goal was to prevent the use of any of those weapons against the people of the United States .
The mission was disrupted when Plame 's true role as a CIA NOC agent was revealed .
The leak came from the White House .
Then , when fingers were pointed at Rove and Libby , the president and vice president swung into action .
They told their press secretary to lie to the press and the people .
By McClellan 's account , they conspired with the group to deceive the public and perhaps the special prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald .
Failure to grasp its meaning of this story requires an exceptional act of will .
We expect much more out of those charged with protecting the nation and its citizens ?
Is n't the mainstream media , the so called " fourth estate , " a self anointed protector of the public well being ?
We 've been told that this is done by vigorous coverage and investigation of major stories involving presidential cover-ups ; particularly those dealing with critical national security threats .
But here 's what we got .
The supposed " paper of record , " The New York Times was the first , or one of the first , news organizations to break the story on Tuesday at 1:29 p.m .
The internet news sites battled back and forth with some on the left taking the lead in exposing the gravity of this accusation .
But where is the New York Times ?
Is this story simply going to die like so many others that show the outright danger posed to the people by their so called leaders ?
Democratic presidential candidates have jumped on this revelation .
Will leaders in the House and Senate hold hearings to determine the accuracy of McClellan 's devastating revelation ?
If hearings happen at all , will they lead to a Bush - Cheney impeachment in the House and a trial in the Senate ?
We 've just seen how the mainstream media reacted to the disruption of a very high level operation to prevent the use of nuclear weapons against the populace .
Why would we expect the same media to pay much attention to the process of holding the president and vice president accountable for this travesty ?
Here 's a much more helpful attitude by the press .
Note the question mark at the end of the headline .
They report , we decide … but first they must report .

' National embarrassment , ' says Cafferty : 1.8 million veterans without healthcare Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This CNN's Jack Cafferty says it 's a " national embarrassment " that US military veterans are among the 47 million Americans that do not have health insurance .
Cafferty cited new research conducted at Harvard Medical School indicating that 1.8 million veterans were uninsured in 2004 , a number that 's climbed by 290,000 since 2000 estimates .
The same study found an additional 3.8 million people , all members of veteran households , also lacked coverage .
" Turns out most uninsured veterans are in the middle class and thus are ineligible for VA care because of their incomes , " said Cafferty .
" They 're too high .
Others can't afford to make the co-payments , and some just simply lack veterans facilities in their communities . "
The lead researcher on the study , Dr. David Himmelstein , of Cambridge Health Alliance , said in a press release that the problem was on the rise -- and pointed to universal health care as a possible fix .
" The number of uninsured vets has skyrocketed since 2000 , and eligibility has been cut , barring hundreds of thousands of veterans from care ,  said Himmelstein .
 We need a solution that works for veterans , their families , and all Americans -- single payer national health insurance . "
Cafferty said that even one uninsured American veteran was nothing short of a disgrace .
" That , in this humble fellow 's opinion , is a national embarrassment , " he said .
" That we have any veterans in this country unable to get health care because they do n't have the money , that 's wrong . "
At the end of the segment , Cafferty read an email from one North Carolina veteran denied coverage .
" I am a Vietnam era vet and I tried to get VA medical and was told that my income was too high .
I then asked to be covered if I took the co-pay and was told that they were not accepting any new candidates , " said the ex-military man .
" That 's about as close to ' get lost , vet ' as you can get . "
" That 's pretty sad stuff , " Cafferty concluded .

ran is the new Nazi Germany and its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the new Hitler .
Or so Israeli officials have been declaring for months as they and their American allies try to persuade the doubters in Washington that an attack on Tehran is essential .
And if the latest media reports are to be trusted , it looks like they may again be winning the battle for hearts and minds : Vice President Dick Cheney is said to be diverting the White House back on track to launch a military strike .
Earlier this year Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel ’s opposition leader and the man who appears to be styling himself scaremonger - in - chief , told us : " It ’s 1938 and Iran is Germany .
And Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs . "
Of Ahmadinejad , he said : " He is preparing another Holocaust for the Jewish state .
" A few weeks ago , as Israel ’s military intelligence claimed  as it has been doing regularly since the early 1990s  that Iran is only a year or so away from the " point of no return " on developing a nuclear warhead , Netanyahu was at it again .
" Iran could be the first undeterrable nuclear power , " he warned , adding : " This is a Jewish problem like Hitler was a Jewish problem
The future of the Jewish people depends on the future of Israel . "
But Netanyahu has been far from alone in making extravagant claims about a looming genocide from Iran .
Israel ’s new president , Shimon Peres , has compared an Iranian nuclear bomb to a " flying concentration camp . "
And the prime minister , Ehud Olmert , told a German newspaper last year : " [ Ahmadinejad ] speaks as Hitler did in his time of the extermination of the entire Jewish nation . "
There is an interesting problem with selling the " Iran as Nazi Germany " line .
If Ahmadinejad really is Hitler , ready to commit genocide against Israel ’s Jews as soon as he can get his hands on a nuclear weapon , why are some 25,000 Jews living peacefully in Iran and more than reluctant to leave despite repeated enticements from Israel and American Jews ?
What is the basis for Israel ’s dire forecasts  the ideological scaffolding being erected , presumably , to justify an attack on Iran ?
Helpfully , as George Bush defended his Iraq policies last month , he reminded us yet again of the menace Iran supposedly poses : it is " threatening to wipe Israel off the map . "
This myth has been endlessly recycled since a translating error was made of a speech Ahmadinejad delivered nearly two years ago .
Farsi experts have verified that the Iranian president , far from threatening to destroy Israel , was quoting from an earlier speech by the late Ayatollah Khomeini in which he reassured supporters of the Palestinians that " the Zionist regime in Jerusalem " would " vanish from the page of time . "
He was not threatening to exterminate Jews or even Israel .
He was comparing Israel ’s occupation of the Palestinians with other illegitimate systems of rule whose time had passed , including the Shahs who once ruled Iran , apartheid South Africa and the Soviet empire .
Nonetheless , this erroneous translation has survived and prospered because Israel and her supporters have exploited it for their own crude propaganda purposes .
In the meantime , the 25,000 - strong Iranian Jewish community is the largest in the Middle East outside Israel and traces its roots back 3,000 years .
As one of several non-Muslim minorities in Iran , Jews there suffer discrimination , but they are certainly no worse off than the one million Palestinian citizens of Israel  and far better off than Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza .
Iranian Jews have little influence on decision - making and are not allowed to hold senior posts in the army or bureaucracy .
But they enjoy many freedoms .
They have an elected representative in parliament , they practice their religion openly in synagogues , their charities are funded by the Jewish diaspora , and they can travel freely , including to Israel .
In Tehran there are six kosher butchers and about 30 synagogues .
Ahmadinejad ’s office recently made a donation to a Jewish hospital in Tehran .
As Ciamak Moresadegh , an Iranian Jewish leader , observed : " If you think Judaism and Zionism are one , it is like thinking Islam and the Taliban are the same , and they are not . "
Iran ’s leaders denounce Zionism , which they blame for fueling discrimination against the Palestinians , but they have also repeatedly avowed that they have no problem with Jews , Judaism or even the state of Israel .
Ahmadinejad , caricatured as a merchant of genocide , has in fact called for " regime change "  and then only in the sense that he believes a referendum should be held of all inhabitants of Israel and the occupied territories , including refugees from war , on the nature of the government .
Despite the absence of any threat to Iran ’s Jews , the Israeli media recently reported that the Israeli government has been trying to find new ways to entice Iranian Jews to Israel .
The Ma’ariv newspaper pointed out that previous schemes had found few takers .
There was , noted the report , " a lack of desire on the part of thousands of Iranian Jews to leave . "
According to the New York - based Forward newspaper , a campaign to convince Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel caused only 152 out of these 25,000 Jews to leave Iran between October 2005 and September 2006 , and most of them were said to have emigrated for economic reasons , not political ones .
To step up these efforts  and presumably to avoid the embarrassing incongruence of claiming an imminent second Holocaust while thousands of Jews live happily in Tehran 
Israel is now backing a move by Jewish donors to guarantee every Iranian Jewish family $ 60,000 to settle in Israel , in addition to a host of existing financial incentives that are offered to Jewish immigrants , including loans and cheap mortgages .
The announcement was met with scorn by the Society of Iranian Jews , which issued a statement that their national identity was not for sale .
" The identity of Iranian Jews is not tradeable for any amount of money .
Iranian Jews are among the most ancient Iranians .
Iran ’s Jews love their Iranian identity and their culture , so threats and this immature political enticement will not achieve their aim of wiping out the identity of Iranian Jews . "
However , this financial gesture may not only be unwelcome but self - fulfilling too , if past experience is the yardstick .
Israel introduced a similar scheme a few years ago , when Argentina ’s economy plunged into deep recession , broadcasting an offer of $ 20,000 to every Jew who settled in Israel .
Months later the Israeli media reported a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Argentina , only adding to the pressure on Jews there to leave .
Of course , there was no mention of a possible causal connection between the attacks and Israel ’s generous offer to Jews to abandon their homeland as other Argentinians sank into poverty .
But if financial enticements  and a possible popular backlash  fail to move Iranian Jews , there is good reason to fear that Israel may resort to other , more dubious ways of encouraging them to emigrate .
That is certainly a path Israel has chosen before with other communities of Arab Jews , whom it has regarded either as a pool of potential spies and agents provocateurs to be used when needed or as " human dust , " in the words of Israel ’s first prime minister , David Ben Gurion , to be recruited to Israel ’s " demographic battle " against the Palestinians .
In " Operation Susannah " of 1954 , for example , Israel recklessly recruited a group of Egyptian Jews to stage a series of explosions in Egypt in a bid to discourage Britain from withdrawing from the Suez Canal zone .
When the plot came to light , it naturally cast a shadow of disloyalty over Egypt ’s wider Jewish community .
Following Israel ’s invasion and occupation of Sinai two years later , the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser expelled some 25,000 Egyptian Jews and , after others were imprisoned on suspicion of spying , the rest soon left .
Even more notoriously , Israel went to greater lengths to ensure the exit of the Arab world ’s largest Jewish population , in Iraq .
In 1950 a series of bombs targeted on Jews in Baghdad forced a rapid exodus of some 130,000 Iraqi Jews to Israel , convinced that Arab extremists were behind the attacks .
Only later did it emerge that the bombs had been planted by members of the Zionist underground , supported by the Israeli government .
Now , Iran ’s Jews may find themselves treated in much the same manner  as simple human fodder .
Stories are growing of Israel exploiting the free movement between Iran and Israel enjoyed by Iranian Jews and their Israeli relatives to carry out spying operations on Iran ’s nuclear program .
Such reports have come from reliable sources such as the American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh , citing US government officials .
The fallout from such actions is not difficult to predict .
Besieged by the US and the international community , Tehran is cracking down on dissent and minority groups , fearful that its own grip on power is shaky and that the well - publicized subversion being carried out by US and Israeli agents is likely only to be stepped up .
So far most officials in Tehran have been careful to avoid suggesting that Iran ’s Jews have double loyalties , as has the local Jewish community itself , both of them aware of Israel ’s interests in provoking such a confrontation .
But as the strains increase , and Israel ’s need to prove Tehran ’s genocidal intent grows ever stronger , that policy may end up being forfeited  and with it the future of Iran ’s Jews .
More important than the welfare of Iranian Jewish families , it seems , is the value of Iranian Jews as a propaganda tool in Israel ’s battle to persuade the world that coexistence with the Muslim world is impossible .
For those who want to engineer a clash of civilizations , the 3,000 - year - old Jewish legacy in Iran is not something to be treasured , only another obstacle to war .
A reader writes :
I was utterly disillusioned regarding Iraq ’s chances until very recently , and have been highly skeptical that any of the recent good news signaled any real progress .
In the last couple of weeks , however , I ’ve started to see cause for hope that I have been wrong .
Some of it is the precipitous decline in violence , some the increasing willingness of ordinary Iraqis outside of Al Anbar to come forward and help us make things safer .
The joint Shia - Sunni fatwa against violence is a part , as is the reopening of roads closed by the security deficit .
The real reasons , however , that I ’m able to muster some cautious optimism are my positive conversations with my girl , currently on her second deployment in Baghdad .
The significance of this is only evident if I back up and provide some perspective .
We are both military intelligence , filling somewhat similar roles for different units .
Our first deployments overlapped significantly , and we were able to compare my experience in northern Iraq with hers in Baghdad , and the contrast was a source of despair for her : despite Baghdad ’s great resources , it became evident that our kind of intelligence was neglected and accomplishing nothing there .
( I can't elaborate on our kind of intelligence , except to say its exercise is expensive , somewhat arcane and does not involve anything like torture .
Perhaps that explains its neglect in the Rumsfeld era . )
For me , this fact elicited rage : many units were essentially reduced to driving around until something blew up  including convoys of which my fiancée was a part !
Meanwhile , attempts to share with Baghdad leadership the techniques that had worked so well in the north ran into excuses and disinterest .
2006 ’s promise to be the year that paid for all the mistakes faltered , then reversed .
This time around , it ’s all different .
He ’s not doing much “ whooping ” now .
A Manhattan hedge - fund manager whose loud grunting and cheering during an Upper East Side spin class allegedly led a fed - up broker on the bike nearby to nearly break his neck is furious that prosecutors are n’t treating the assault as a felony .
“ This was n’t just a playground fall where Stewy fell down and went boo hoo , ” angry victim Stuart Sugarman said when told that his alleged attacker was charged yesterday with a mere misdemeanor .
“ The reality is I spent two weeks in Lenox Hill [ Hospital ] , including a week in ICU and six hours in surgery , ” Sugarman complained .
“ My life has been altered , possibly permanently .
This is not a misdemeanor . ”
Sugarman , 48 , a fund manager and investment banker at Sunrise Financial Group , admits that he noisily war - whooped , groaned and shouted , “ You go , girl ! ” during his last spin workout Aug. 15 at an Equinox gym on East 85th Street .
That , he says , did n’t give broker Christopher Carter , who was three bikes over , the right to repeatedly yell , “ Shut the f- – – up ! ” and then leap off his Schwinn and come charging at him .
The grunting Sugarman is accusing the allegedly berserk broker – both men top 200 pounds – of tilting Sugarman ’s stationary bike ’s front wheel up a yard off the floor and flipping the bike and Sugarman into a wall .
Sugarman suffered a concussion from the bike ’s falling on top of him , along with damage to six discs in the vertebrae of his neck .
His surgeon , he said , tells him he was “ one click away from a wheelchair . ”
“ The guy had a spinal - cord contusion with major surgery to his neck involving the use of cadaver tissue and multiple metal plates and screws , ” said Sugarman ’s lawyer , Samuel Davis .
The criminal complaint lodged yesterday against Carter , 44 , of Maxim Investments Group , only accuses him of causing “ sustained lower - back pain ” and “ substantial pain ” but makes no mention of the serious physical injury needed to characterize an assault as a felony .
Prosecutors declined to comment on the case .
Carter ’s lawyer , Michael Farkas , said only that his client “ did not commit any criminal acts . ”
“ Mr. Sugarman is clearly taking advantage of the criminal - justice system to build some civil lawsuit , ” he said .
Sugarman has yet to file a suit .

For more than a century , the luxury fashion business was made up of small family companies that produced beautiful items of the finest materials .
It was a niche business for a niche clientele .
But in the late 1980s , business tycoons began to buy up these companies and turn them into billion - dollar global brands producing millions of logo - covered items for the middle market .
The executives labeled this rollout the “ democratization ” of luxury , which is now a $ 157 - billion - a - year industry .
Image Credit ... Jillian Tamaki
To help these newly titanic brands retain an air of old - world luxury , marketing executives played up the companies ’ heritage and claimed that the items were still made in Europe by hand — like Geppetto hammering in his workshop by candlelight .
But this sort of labor is wildly expensive , the executives routinely explain , which is why the retail prices for luxury goods keep going up and up .
In fact , many luxury - brand items today are made on assembly lines in developing nations , where labor is vastly cheaper .
I saw this firsthand when I visited a leather - goods factory in China , where women 18 to 26 years old earn $ 120 a month sewing and gluing together luxury - brand leather handbags , knapsacks , wallets and toiletry cases .
One bag I watched them put together — for a brand whose owners insist is manufactured only in Italy — cost $ 120 apiece to produce .
That evening , I saw the same bag at a Hong Kong department store with a price tag of $ 1,200 — a typical markup .
How do the brands get away with this ?
Some hide the “ Made in China ” label in the bottom of an inside pocket or stamped black on black on the back side of a tiny logo flap .
Some bypass the “ provenance ” laws requiring labels that tell where goods are produced by having 90 percent of the bag , sweater , suit or shoes made in China and then attaching the final bits — the handle , the buttons , the lifts — in Italy , thus earning a “ Made in Italy ” label .
Or some simply replace the original label with one stating it was made in Western Europe .
Not all luxury brands do the bait and switch .
The chief executive of the French luxury brand Hermès readily told me that some of its silk scarves are hemmed by hand in Mauritius , where labor costs less .
And Louis Vuitton , which boasts that it churns out its $ 3 billion worth of leather goods each year in its company - owned factories in France , Spain and Southern California , announced in September that it plans to build a factory in India to produce shoes .
Spending time with your kids can be fun and rewarding , bringing you closer together as you build shared experiences , memories to look back on in the future .
It can also be expensive , depending on what you do .
Amusement parks , last time I looked , generally cost $ 50 or more per person .
You can , however , have fun without spending too much .
That ’s what this article is all about , fun and inexpensive things to do with your kids when you spend a day together :
Fishing Fishing can be expensive the first time you go , since you have to buy the equipment , but it does n’t cost much at all after that , and can provide an entire day ’s worth of enjoyment .
I have fond memories of fishing with my Grandpa when I was young … we ’d go to a creek and sit there all morning fishing , and Grandma would cook whatever we caught ( or something else if we did n’t get any fish ) for dinner that night .
I wish I could do that again .
Wienie Roast Wienie roasts are another one of those cool things I remember from when I was a kid .
You build up a little fire , cut a few long , sturdy sticks , trim the ends to a point ( this also has the beneficial effect of removing any bark and dirt ) , and you ’re ready to go .
Of course , you have to bring along the hot dogs , buns , condiments , and other necessities ( you know , chocolate , marshmallows , and graham crackers … ca n’t do a wienie roast without making smores ! ) , but it ’s easy and does n’t cost much .
You do have to find a place where it ’s okay to build a fire , though … no wienie roasts in the front yard !
New Family Game
Another cheap way to have fun with your kids is to buy a new family game .
You can usually pick one up for $ 20 or less … some of my favorites are Do n’t Break The Ice , Operation , Jenga , Sorry , and Trivial Pursuit for kids .
Natural History Museum
Most larger cities have a natural history museum that is fun to visit and usually less than $ 10 per person .
Virtually all kids like to look at the fossils , be disgusted by the bugs , and see the other exhibits .
This is definitely not one that you can do often , but it is fun every once in a while for something different .
The Zoo Okay , so this one is n’t as cheap as the rest , but it ’s still usually not too bad … maybe $ 20 or so per person .
You ca n’t really go wrong with the zoo , unless your kids are surly teenagers who feel it is n’t “ cool ” to go … even most adults I know love the zoo !
How can you not love looking at big , dangerous , creepy , or just plain weird animals ?
The Beach
This is , of course , not an option for everyone , but if you live within driving distance , a day at the beach is always good , and usually costs nothing more than parking plus drinks and snacks .
You can swim , build sand castles , pick up shells … it ’s easy to have a great day at the beach .
And the ocean is just soothing , too… seems to take away a lot of the every day stress a parent builds up .
The Park
The park is definitely one of the easiest , and cheapest , ways to have fun while spending time with your kids .
It costs nothing but the gas to drive there , and maybe the cost of a few toys , such as a frisbee , football , or basketball .
Little kids can go on the jungle gym or swings , and big kids can play with the frisbee or ball .
You can make it even better by bringing a picnic , even if your “ picnic ” is just picking up something from the grocery store to eat when you get to the park .
Color Me Mine
This may be a local thing , I ’m not sure … but you can probably find something in a similar vein near you .
Color Me Mine is a store that has unfinished pottery that you paint at the store , and then they fire it for you .
This can easily leave you with a keepsake , something you keep for the rest of your life because of the memories you associate with it .
It does cost a bit more than some of the other things , but if you choose their small items , it should n’t be more than $ 10 – $ 15 per person … and there will be no doubt in your mind that it was worth it .
Make Dinner Together Making dinner together can be a fun way to have some family time , plus you end up with good ( hopefully ! ) food to eat … how can you go wrong ?
Bonus points on this one if you make something you ’ve either never made before , or even better , never eaten before .
The causes of global warming show strikingly well that our energy policy has been inadequate to put it mildly .
For years we have been emitting much too much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels , i.e. coal , gas and oil .
All well meant appeals to mitigate the consumption have failed miserably .
Oil is not only used for heating or fuelling a car 's engine , however .
It is a very valuable raw material for many everyday products , like e.g. all sorts of plastics , paints and lacquers , drugs , washing powders , detergents , fertilizers , and many more .
It would be irresponsible to future human generations if our generations used up this limited resources within a short time .
Which alternative fuels can replace fossil fuels ?
In search for global warming solutions , people are suddenly asking for alternative energies .
However , more than 80 % of our energy is currently taken from the fossil sources oil , gas or coal .
It is absolutely impossible to supply this much of energy from alternative sources within the next 10 to 20 years .
Therefore , we should ask how much energy is really required to have a good quality of life , instead of taking our current energy consumption for granted or even indispensable .
In a second step , we can then look for potential energy sources to fulfil this need .
As a lesson from history , we should at the same time strive to maximize the share of renewable energies ( wind power , water power , solar power , wood , biomass , etc. ) and on the other hand minimize over time the share of non-renewable energy sources like oil , gas , coal and nuclear power .
Otherwise our global warming solution will be just a pretentious one .
How much energy is required for a good life ?
Scientific researches have shown that the quality of life is depending of the energy consumption up to a yearly energy consumption of 9'000 kWh per capita .
This value equals the energy contained in about 1'000 litres of oil .
If a person uses less energy per year , life gets more laborious .
Above this limit however , life quality is in essence independent of the energy consumption .
For a good quality of life according to our current standards in industrialised nations , a minimum yearly energy requirement of 10'000 kWh seems therefore to be a realistic assumption .
The following table shows the energy consumption per capita for the year 2003 for some areas of the world .
The values for 2006 are 12 to 15 % higher .
Area Energy consumption per capita 2003 North America 91'000 kWh Europe 43'000 kWh China 13'000 kWh India 6'000 kWh
Global warming solution : Mitigation of energy consumption Demand for energy has to follow availability of renewables
Switzerland is one of the countries with the highest quality of life world - wide , according to most investigations .
Researches from ETH Zurich showed that Switzerland could reduce its energy usage from currently 43'000 kWh to 17'500 kWh per capita without compromising on the quality of life .
Moreover , this reduction would be possible with technologies already developed and available !
A similar reduction of the yearly energy consumption to values in the order of 17'500 to 20'000 kWh per capita should therefore be possible for most countries of the world without really decreasing the quality of life .
The following graph displays the energy consumption per capita for some industrialised countries for the year 2003 .
For the year 2006 , the values would be about 12 to 15 % higher on average .
Chart 1 : Current energy consumption per capita by country for the year 2003 .
The target value of 18'000 kWh is the energy consumption for a good quality of life according to our current standards .

Demand has to follow available supply of ( renewable ) energy
Up to now , any demand of energy has been satisfied .
Anyone who has been willing to pay accordingly could and still can get any amount of energy .
In this system , nobody has any interest in a mitigated energy consumption :
By contrary , all commercial interests clearly speak for an increasing energy consumption .
This has led to an ever increasing energy consumption and it has also led to ignoring or denying the problem of global warming for more than 20 years .
Now , a change is urgently required in our energy policy :
We must manage the natural resources on earth based on criteria of sustainability .
The demand of energy has to follow the supply of renewable energy .
This is the only way to implement a sustainable living , which is the base for a survival of human beings in the long run .
Mitigation of the demand for energy
A reduction of the energy consumption per capita to less than 20'000 kWh per year as a global warming solution is a challenge for all industrialised countries ( see chart above ) .
Basically , there are two potential ways to achieve this goal :
Reduction of the personal energy consumption by free will on account of a higher consciousness of the population .
Establishing appropriate commercial basic conditions within each country and between the countries .
The first suggestion would be simple and fast to implement .
However , for this to take place , many more people needed to seriously think about the meaning of life and about our relation to nature .
Otherwise , decisions of mankind will continue to be guided by money and power instead of rationality or a higher consciousness .
Therefore , in the short and medium term , it will most likely be indispensable to establish the above mentioned basic conditions to force the required change .
Suggestions for concrete implementations have been available already for a long time .
' Blank check ' seen headed Bush 's way , despite Democratic promises to change course in Iraq Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Democratic leaders in Congress are quietly preparing to give President Bush essentially everything he wants to keep the Iraq war going for at least another six months without forcing any change in course .
Swept into power on the votes of war - weary Americans last year , Congressional Democrats have so far failed in all their attempts to curtail Bush 's war efforts .
As they consider the president 's latest request for $ 200 billion in supplementary war funding party leaders have pledged not to hand over another " blank check . "
But , as Roll Call reports , a " blank check " is exactly what appears headed for the Pentagon .
" Democratic leaders continue to fear GOP attacks that cutting off or slowing funds would hurt the troops , despite anger among the Democratic base over the partys failure to use Congress power of the purse to end the war , " reports the Capitol Hill newspaper 's Steven T. Dennis .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey ( D - WI ) have said they wo n't consider a supplemental funding bill that does n't include timelines for troop withdrawals .
But , Dennis reports , " Democrats are quietly preparing to give the president enough spending flexibility to keep the war going anyway , " for as long as six more months .
As adamant as they say they are about tying war funding to deescalation timetables , Democratic leaders appear even more firmly against an overall cut - off of war funds , which critics say may be their only recourse to actually effect a draw - down of troops from Iraq .
" Sure we have the power on anything to stop the money ... but the thing we have to do is make sure we do it the right way , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on a liberal radio show last month .
" It 's not a question of all or nothing ; it 's a question of making sure we do the right thing . "
Congress approved billions in extra funding and stopgap spending resolutions after Gen. David Petraeus ' testimony on Capitol Hill in September .
Next up is the regular Defense spending bill , which Democrats are crafting to allow funding to be diverted from regular Pentagon accounts to fund the war , according to Roll Call .
Appropriations Chairman John Murtha ( D - PA ) told the paper that the Defense Department would be able to maintain the war " until May or June " with the extra flexibility .
In the Senate , an aide told the paper that leaders are considering " short bursts " of war funding as Democrats continue to try to persuade war - weary Republicans to break with the president and support course - changing legislation .
Democrats acknowledge frustration among voters , especially the party 's liberal base that has long been calling for an end to America 's adventure in Iraq .
Pelosi acknowledged the frustration and said she too was frustrated at the lack of progress toward ending the war .
Whether Democrats will be able to reverse the tide depends on their ability to re-frame the debate and stand firm against funding for anything except redeployment , an aide to a Democratic member of the Out of Iraq Caucus told the paper .
" As long as leadership is not willing to challenge the way the president is hiding behind the troops , " the aide said , " they 're going to continue to get rolled . "
Genes of a tiny , single - celled green alga called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii may contain scores more data about the common ancestry of plants and animals than the richest paleontological dig .
This work is described in an article in Science .
A group of researchers * , including Arthur Grossman of the Carnegie Institution , report on the results of a major effort to obtain the full library of genes , or the genome sequence , of Chamydomonas and to compare its ~ 15,000 genes to those of plants and animals , including humans .
The research shows that this alga has maintained many genes that were lost during the evolution of land plants , has others that are associated with functions in humans , and has numerous genes of unknown function , but which are associated with critical metabolic processes .
" Although Chlamydomonas is certainly more plant than animal , there are clear similarities between this photosynthetic organism and animals that would surprise the average person on the street , " comments Grossman .
" Just twenty years ago no one would have guessed that an alga would have retained many of the functions we associate with humans and would be useful for developing a basic understanding of certain human diseases . "
Chlamydomonas , affectionately called Chlamy , is an alga of 10 micrometres in size that is present in soil and freshwater environments .
It performs photosynthesis like plants , but it diverged evolutionarily from flowering land plants about 1 billion years ago .
It is even more distantly related to animals ( the split between animals and plants was ~ 1.6 billion years ago ) .
Chlamy moves using two anterior , hair - like flagella that were lost by its cousins , the flowering land plants , after the evolutionary split of the two lineages .
The flagella are equivalent to the cilia and centrioles in animal cells .
Centrioles are structures involved in cell division ; they form a spindle apparatus , which helps separate genetic material into two new cells during mitosis .
Cilia are important to many animal functions .
The study identified many new proteins that are likely associated with the flagella , and has distinguished those proteins of the flagella that are critical for movement and those that are associated with sensory functions ( feeling the conditions in the environment ) .
The analysis has also generated new insights about human diseases associated with ciliary dysfunction in humans , including those of the kidney and the eye .
The researchers also performed a comparative gene analysis across species to explore the evolutionary history of Chlamy , and the relationship of this alga to other organisms .
Of the 6,968 protein families that have so - called homologs -- proteins that have similar amino acid sequences , often reflecting a similar or related function among the species -- they found that Chlamy shared 35 % ( 2,489/6,968 ) with both flowering plants and humans , and an additional 10 % ( 706/6,968 ) with humans but not with flowering plants .
In addition , there are numerous proteins in Chlamy that make it suited to live in soil environments , including large families of specific transporters -- proteins that help move material across cell membranes -- that enable it to scavenge nutrients from the soil .
While some of these transporters have an affiliation with transporters in plants , others are more closely related to those in animals .
Moreover , the Chlamy genome encodes many families of regulatory elements , including one that contains over 50 guanylyl / adenylyl cyclases -- enzymes probably involved in distinct developmental processes including mating and sexual signaling .
There are also numerous genes and gene families that relate to making sugars and polysaccharides , to use the sugars and polysaccharides to produce energy and to build a highly structured and efficient chloroplast , the factory where the cell harnesses the energy of sunlight .
Indeed , many great insights from the genome analysis have come in the area of photosynthesis , the process of the chloroplast by which plants convert carbon dioxide , water and the energy of sunlight into oxygen and sugars .
In a comparative genomic analysis , the scientists identified protein families that are shared by Chlamy , flowering plants , other algae , but are not present in nonphotosynthetic organisms .
This exercise led them to identify photosynthesis - related proteins conserved across the plant kingdom , with many even conserved in the ancient cyanobacteria .
( Cyanobacteria have been on the planet for ~ 3 billion years . )
The majority of the identified proteins have unknown functions , but are probably critical since they have been exclusively maintained in photosynthetic organisms over nearly the entire period that life has inhabited the Earth .
As Grossman states , " The work has generated a clear roadmap for exploring the roles of numerous genes in photosynthetic function , for defining the structure and dynamic aspects of flagellar function and for understanding how the soil environment , with its large fluctuations in nutrients , has molded the functionality of organisms through evolutionary time . "
The Science article is published October 12 .

Creativity is vitally important to crafting effective copy and content .
But mention the word “ creative ” around direct response copywriters , and their blood will begin to boil .
Outside of Madison Avenue , advertising is supposed to sell something , not win industry creative awards .
Likewise , content should be useful and valuable to the reader , not an indulgent exercise in self expression .
Still , creativity is key when it comes to copy and content that works .
While creativity for its own sake is a smart way to strengthen your lateral thinking skills and to align your work with what you love to do , it ’s when you create something useful to others that you add value to the world .
Advertising legend David Ogilvy hated the word creative .
In Confessions of an Advertising Man he wrote , “ I tell new recruits that I will not allow them to use the word creative to describe the functions they are to perform in the agency . ”
Ogilvy instead preferred the word remarkable .
So now you know where ol ’ what ’s his name got his inspiration .
Creative Adaptation for Remarkable Content
Inspiration from other sources is what creativity is all about .
It seems that many people believe creativity involves pulling a completely brand new idea out of thin air .
In truth , creativity is an adaptive process that consists of looking at the same existing thing everyone else is and thinking about it differently .
Even Michelangelo believed that “ the best of artists has no conception that the marble alone does not contain within itself . ”
He saw his sculptures within the mass of marble , and simply removed the parts that did n’t belong in order to “ free the figures slumbering in the stone . ”
Look in unlikely places for connections and angles that can enhance your content .
If only one aspect of another subject area meets your needs , roll like Michelangelo and get rid of the parts that do n’t belong .
Where Do We Find Inspiration ?
So , where do you discover your own creative angles for content ?
Carl Ally , another advertising legend , offered this insight :
The creative person wants to be a know - it - all .
He wants to know about all kinds of things — ancient history , nineteenth century mathematics , current manufacturing techniques , hog futures .
Because he never knows when these ideas might come together to form a new idea .
It may happen six minutes later , or six months , or six years .
But he has faith that it will happen .
In other words , what you learn outside of your niche may well be more important than your substantive expertise .
Read everything you can across diverse topic areas , and live life to the fullest for inspiration at every turn .
For solid tips in this area , read Tony Clark ’s excellent 4 - part Creative Adaptation series .
You may just start seeing things differently than everyone else does when it comes to creating content .

Tens of thousands of people died at Sachsenhausen
Nathan Gasch said when Martin Hartmann moved into the retirement complex four years ago he noticed a picture of his neighbour in an SS uniform on the wall .
Mr Gasch says he was shocked but that he never reported the incident .
However , investigators from the justice department were on Mr Hartmann 's trail and this week the US expelled him .
Romanian - born Mr Hartmann , 88 , was forced to move back to Germany last month and stripped of his US citizenship .
The truth about his past was uncovered in a two - year investigation by the Department of Justice 's Office of Special Investigations ( OSI ) , a department created in 1979 to pursue war criminals .
' Must have known '
During World War II Mr Hartmann worked as a member of the SS Death 's Head Guard Battalion at Germany 's Sachsenhausen concentration camp .
Tens of thousands of prisoners died at the camp where inmates were used for forced labour and subjected to medical experiments and torture .
Mr Hartmann concealed his past when he moved to the US in 1955 and later applied for US citizenship in 1961 .
Even now his wife Ellen claims that he could not have known the true nature of the camp at Sachsenhausen .
However , OSI officials say it is impossible that he did not know .
" Martin Hartmann and other members of the SS Death 's Head Guard Battalion were indispensable accomplices in the brutal crimes committed in the Nazi concentration camp system , " Eli Rosenbaum , head of the OSI , was quoted by Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz as saying .
OSI officials told the Arizona Republic newspaper that Mr Hartmann volunteered for the role in 1943 , rather than being sent into combat , and that at no time did he apply for a transfer as camp guards were allowed to do .
Tattoo
Last month , Mr Hartmann admitted to having served as an armed SS guard and having personally assisted in Nazi persecution , and agreed to leave the US and never return .
His sudden departure has stunned fellow residents at the Leisure World retirement complex in Mesa , Arizona , none more so than Mr Gasch who even spent time as a prisoner in the Sachsenhausen camp - though not at the same time Mr Hartmann was there .
Speaking of the incident with the picture Mr Gasch , who comes from Poland , told the Associated Press news agency that at the time he simply " walked out of the room " .
" Maybe I was too childish , " he said .
" I figured we were living in a community here .
I just let it go . "
Mr Gasch still bears the tattooed number on his left arm which marked him out as a concentration camp prisoner six decades before .
" They must have seen I had my number , " Mr Gasch said , adding that though he was shocked about Mr Hartmann being forced to leave he is not sorry .
" He was one of them , " he said .
US interceptors in Europe fast enough to hit Russian ICBMs : researcher
by Staff Writers
Washington ( AFP ) Sept 27 , 2007
Interceptor missiles deployed in Poland as part of a US missile defense shield would be fast enough to target Russian intercontinental missiles , contrary to US assurances , a US researcher said Thursday .
Ted Postol , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a long time critic of the US missile defense system , said the US Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) is understating the speed of the interceptor and overstating the speed of Russian long range missiles .
MDA spokesman Rick Lehner said Postol had no access to missile test data and his assertions were " totally false . "
The United States is negotiating to station 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a high powered targeting radar in the Czech Republic to counter what it says is a growing missile threat from Iran .
Russia has objected vehemently to the plan on grounds that the European site could be used against its missiles , despite repeated denials from Washington .
Postol said the Americans " were probably concerned the Europeans would n't accept ( the plan ) so they came up with the false argument that the interceptors wo n't be fast enough to engage Russians ' ICBMs . "
He argued that the interceptor missiles would have to be faster than acknowleged by the Missile Defense Agency to be effective against missiles from Iran .
" The MDA claims the interceptors have a rather slow burnout speed , because you have to have a low burnout speed in order to not overtake Russian ICBMs , " he said at a press conference .
" They claim a 6.3 kilometers per second speed .
At this speed , the interceptor would n't be able to engage an ICBM from Russia , " he said .
" But in fact , the burnout speed of this interceptor is closer to nine kilometers per second , which tends to fit to claims of the MDA that the system can protect from an Iran attack , " he said .
" If the speed is inferior , then they can't defend places that they said they could defend earlier , " he said .
Lehner insisted , however , that the US interceptors are not fast enough to catch a Russian ICBM .
" These missiles are more like six kilometers per second or a little more and it is certainly not sufficient to intercept a Russian missile , even coming out of a western part of Russia , " he said .
The Frrrozen Haute Chocolate is unveiled at the Serendipity - 3 restaurant in New York November 7 , 2007 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Manhattan restaurant that unveiled a record - breaking $ 25,000 dessert last week has been forced to shut its doors temporarily due to an infestation of mice and cockroaches .
Serendipity 3 on the Upper East Side failed its second consecutive health inspection in a month on Wednesday night after health officials found a live mouse , mouse droppings in multiple places , flies and dozens of live cockroaches , the Heath Department said .
“ We ’re rectifying it as quickly as we can , ” said owner Steven Bruce , adding the restaurant would then be allowed to reopen .
Serendipity 3 set a Guinness world record on November 7 for the most expensive dessert when it partnered with luxury jeweler Euphoria New York to create “ Frrozen Haute Chocolate , ” a blend of 28 cocoas fused with 0.2 ounces of edible 23 - karat gold .
It comes with an 18 - karat gold bracelet with 1 carat of white diamonds at the base of the goblet .
The sundae is topped with whipped cream covered with more gold and a side of La Madeline au Truffle from Knipschildt Chocolatier , which sells for $ 2,600 a pound .
The desert is a more decadent take on Serendipity ’s $ 8.50 “ Frrrozen Hot Chocolate , ” which the talk show host Oprah Winfrey once endorsed by saying it made her want to “ dance on the chandeliers . ”
Bruce also has a $ 1,000 ice cream sundae on the menu called Golden Opulence .

About 50 million people are affected in Bangladesh
Speaking at the Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) annual meeting in London , scientists said this will lead to higher rates of cancer in the future .
South and East Asia account for more than half of the known cases globally .
Eating large amounts of rice grown in affected areas could also be a health risk , scientists said .
" It 's a global problem , present in 70 countries , probably more , " said Peter Ravenscroft , a research associate in geography with Cambridge University .
" If you work on drinking water standards used in Europe and North America , then you see that about 140 million people around the world are above those levels and at risk . "
Testing time
Arsenic consumption leads to higher rates of some cancers , including tumours of the lung , bladder and skin , and other lung conditions .
Some of these effects show up decades after the first exposure .
I do n't know of one government agency which has given this the priority it deserves
Allan Smith
" This is the highest known increase in mortality from any environmental exposure . "
The international response , he said , is not what the scale of the problem merits .
" I do n't know of one government agency which has given this the priority it deserves , " he commented .
The first signs that arsenic - contaminated water might be a major health issue emerged in the 1980s , with the documentation of poisoned communities in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal .
Rice plants absorb arsenic from the soil as they grow
The metal is present naturally in soil , and leaches into groundwater , with bacteria thought to play a role .
Since then , large - scale contamination has been found in other Asian countries such as China , Cambodia and Vietnam , in South America and Africa .
It is less of a problem in North America and Europe where most water is provided by utilities .
However , some private wells in the UK may not be tested and could present a problem , Mr Ravenscroft said .
Problems abroad
Once the threat has been identified , there are remedies , such as as digging deeper wells , purification , and identifying safe surface water supplies .
As a matter of priority , scientists at the RGS meeting said , governments should test all wells in order to assess the threat to communities .
" Africa , for example , is probably affected less than other continents , but so little is known that we would recommend widespread testing , " said Peter Ravenscroft .
His Cambridge team has developed computer models aimed at predicting which regions might have the highest risks , taking into account factors such as geology and climate .
Arsenic contamination can be a problem in parts of the US
" There are similar areas in Indonesia and the Philippines , and very little evidence of tests ; yet where there has been some testing , in ( the Indonesian province of ) Aceh for example , signs of arsenic turned up . "
Asian countries use water for agriculture as well as drinking , and this too can be a source of arsenic poisoning .
Rice is usually grown in paddy fields , often flooded with water from the same wells .
Arsenic is drawn up into the grains which are used for food .
Andrew Meharg from Aberdeen University has shown that arsenic transfers from soil to rice about 10 times more efficiently than to other grain crops .
This is clearly a problem in countries such as Bangladesh where rice is the staple food , and Professor Meharg believes it could be an issue even in the UK among communities which eat rice frequently .
" The average ( British ) person eats about 10g to 16g of rice per day , but members of the UK Bangladeshi community for example might eat 300g per day , " he said .
The UK's Food Standards Agency is currently assessing whether this level of consumption carries any risk .

I was under investigation earlier this year for a crime I did not commit .
My attorney had me take a polygraph test with a private individual who is very well respected in the field .
He was the head of a large police departments polygraph dept and trains many people throughout the country .
He now has his own private practice .
My attorney sends his clients there before he sends them to the sherrifs dept for the real one .
If his clients fail the private one he does n't send them to the real one .
Anyway , I passed the private one .
My attorney has never had someone pass the private one and fail the sherriff .
In fact the private polygrapher trained the current county sherriff polygrapher .
So when i took the polygraph test with the sherriff my attorney did not have me take the post test .
He never has his clients do this and said it is common .
The county polygrapher said this was unusual and said the prosecution really wanted me to take the post test .
He told me I could walk out after the actual testing was done but he would n't sign anything that pre-approved me not taking the post test .
So that is what i did .
I took the test and when that part was done I said " Is this when I should leave ? " and he said " yes . "
He told me he would be out in a minute to tell my attny and myself the results .
He came out about 45 mins later and said " I know the results of your private test and these were a little different .
There were indicators that showed signs of deception .
I 'd really like to get you back in for the post test . "
To which my attorney said , no way and asked for specifics .
" Well there were just some indicators that showed deception . "
And he would not give specifics .
He then told us he would have the results to us the next day or the day after .
that was in April and we have not been shown the results and have not been able to get a hold of them .
It was understood that if I pass that polygraph the criminal charges that had not been brought forth yet would be dropped .
If I failed they were going to go after me with 1st degree in my case .
About three weeks after the test I was offered a plea for 4th degree , which is a misdimeanor .
We actually had a third party , " impartial party " hired by a judge to investigate some of the background of my whole case and they have access to all documents .
They have a legal right to everything under the sun .
The third party tried through the prosecution and the sherriffs department to get the results and could not get them .
She told us she has never had this problem before .
The prosecution throughout the discussions would say that I failed the polygraph test , but when we asked for results they would not give them to us .
What are my rights to seeing my results of that test ?
I mean all the detail .
This has been one small piece of the nightmare my family and myself have been going through and would really like to get the raw data from that test .
Does anyone know where I would start ?
Thanks a lot .
On this morning 's " Fox News Sunday " , host Chris Wallace interviewed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and actually hammered him about putting his dog , Seamus , in a kennel on the roof of his car on a long family vacation .
Wallace , who says he 's a dog lover , points out that Massachusetts law prohibits endangering animals in this way and asks , " what were you thinking ? "

After a chuckle , Romney jovially explains how Seamus jumped up there on his own and how much he loved being on the roof of the car .
He also assures Wallace that the kennel was airtight and safe , but admits that he had no idea that he was breaking the law .
People compete to see who can spot the most Eddie Stobart trucks
The move follows after the firm announced plans to join with property and logistics group Westbury Property Fund in a complex reverse takeover .
While Westbury is paying £ 138 m to buy Eddie Stobart , Stobart 's owners are buying Westbury 's property portfolio for £ 142m .
The merged group will be called Stobart and take up Westbury 's share listing .
Fans can now invest and own a part of the business
Eddie Stobart
It will combine Eddie Stobart 's road transport , warehouse and rail freight operations , with Westbury 's own rail freight business and port at Runcorn in Cheshire .
Eddie Stobart 's current owners , William Stobart and Andrew Tinkler will run the merged company , taking up the roles of chief executive and chief operating officer respectively .
Westbury 's property portfolio is being bought for £ 142 m by Mr Stobart and Mr Tinker through their separate business WADI Properties , which will operate independently from the merged Stobart group .
Cult following
Founded in 1970 , Eddie Stobart has a cult following among members of the public .
William Stobart and Andrew Tinkler will run the merged business
Its distinctive lorries , each sporting a unique female name , have inspired a fan club , members of whom compete for the most sightings of Eddie Stobart trucks .
A range of toys and T - shirts are also available , and there has even been an animated TV series centred on a truck called Steady Eddie .
" Eddie Stobart has a large and loyal fan base , " the firm said in a statement .
" There are thousands of fans who collect memorabilia and attend events , and a large number who compete in the ' Spotters League Table ' .
" For many , the metamorphosis of Eddie Stobart to a publicly - listed company will mean that they can now invest and own a part of the business . "
Based in Carlisle , with sister sites in Warrington and Daventry in Northamptonshire , Eddie Stobart operates from 27 sites across the UK .
Mr Tinkler and Mr Stobart will hold 28.5 % of the new company following the merger .
Westbury has also announced the acquisition of Widnes - based freight handling firm O'Connor for £ 23 m , alongside the Eddie Stobart merger .
The merger of Westbury and Eddie Stobart still requires the approval of Westbury shareholders , but this is expected to be successful .
Are you a " Stobart spotter " ?

California group launches campaign to put Gore 's name on primary ballots Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday October 3 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Al Gore still has n't definitively ruled out a bid for the 2008 Democratic nomination for president -- and until he does , one hopeful California group is assuming no news is good news .
California Draft Gore , a grassroots political action committee , has hatched a plan to get their reluctant candidate off of theoretical fantasy polls and onto a real - life primary ballot .
Capitalizing on a provision of the state election law which allows for any name to be placed on a ballot provided enough signatures in favor of that candidate are secured , volunteers will begin scrambling next week to get 26,500 registered Democrats -- 500 from each of California 's 53 congressional districts -- to sign off on the former vice president before a Dec. 4 deadline .
If all goes well , Gore 's name will appear on ballots throughout the state when California 's presidential primary is held in February of next year .
" We now have volunteers in all 53 districts , " group spokesman and organizer Roy Gayhart told RAW STORY .
In some districts , Gayhart says , the initiative has as many as 50 people on call , ready to gather signatures .
" Some places it will be a situation where each person can just go get 10 signatures , and then they can move on to help elsewhere , " he said , adding that should Gore enter the race , " we 'll turn over our volunteers to the campaign . "
The group has n't received any word from the Gore camp regarding their plan , but among die - hard fans desperate for a positive reading from the political tea leaves , that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
" In 2003 , Gore asked us to stand down , " Gayhart pointed out , but after contacting the Gore camp with their plans this year , the initiative has received no such suggestion this time around .
" Everything he 's doing appears to be leaving open the possibility . "
In a May interview with Time , Gore did n't categorically deny he would consider a run , but did say he had " fallen out of love with politics , " and that he was n't " convinced the presidency is the highest and best role I could play . "
Asked later in the same interview about what it would take to get him to declare , he responded " I can't say because I 'm not looking for it .
But I guess I would know it if I saw it . "
California volunteers believe their ballot initiative may be the thing to make Gore think twice .
" Until he gives a Sherman , we 'll keep going " promised Gayhart , referring to the famous pledge from Civl War General William Tecumseh Sherman who vowed , amid rumors of his own presidential candidacy , that " If drafted , I will not run ; if nominated , I will not accept ; if elected , I will not serve . "
" We 're not trying to pressure him to run .
We 're planning to inspire him , " Ben Cooper , a coordinator for the effort in San Diego said in a press release from the group .
If Gore does get inspired to join the Democratic field , an announcement could come soon .
" It 's logical he would decide in October , " Gayhart said , citing next week 's planned announcement of the 2008 Nobel Prize winner , for which Gore has been nominated in recognition of his work in raising awareness of global warming .
Some believe he 's likely to win .
" If we get to November and he has n't announced , we 're going to have a momentum issue , " the organizer conceded , although he made clear that even if the candidate himself continues to tarry , his name at the very least will be in play .
" Gore has the right to say ' take my name off , " Gayhart acknowledged , " But until he does , he 's on the ballot . "
Washington Post :
President Bush is a competitive guy .
But this is one contest he would rather lose .
With 18 months left in office , he is in the running for most unpopular president in the history of modern polling .
The latest Washington Post - ABC
News survey shows that 65 percent of Americans disapprove of Bush 's job performance , matching his all - time low .
In polls conducted by The Post or Gallup going back to 1938 , only twice has a president exceeded that level of public animosity -- Harry S. Truman , who hit 67 percent during the Korean War , and Richard M. Nixon , who hit 66 percent four days before resigning .
The historic depth of Bush 's public standing has whipsawed his White House , sapped his clout , drained his advisers , encouraged his enemies and jeopardized his legacy .
Around the White House , aides make gallows - humor jokes about how they can alienate their remaining supporters -- at least those aides not heading for the door .
Outside the White House , many former aides privately express anger and bitterness at their erstwhile colleagues , Bush and the fate of his presidency .
WALL STREET JOURNAL
--- With the Canadian dollar surging against the U.S. greenback , Robert Katzman is dealing with situations they do n't teach in Economics 101 .
The owner of five strip clubs in Detroit and Windsor , Ontario , says American dancers are heading to Canada to earn the strengthened Canadian currency , and Canadian customers are heading to Detroit because their dollars go further there .
He 's fighting back by advertising more in the U.S. and offering free limo service to get Detroit men to visit his Windsor clubs .
The rise is a boon for Canadians looking to buy American real estate , stocks or just about anything for sale at the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn. , which has seen a 15 % uptick in the number of Canadian customers this year .
But it is n't good news for Canadian hotels or tourist destinations , or exporters of everything from beer and maple syrup to lumber and wheat .
The result has injected a touch of national giddiness into Canada 's traditional reserve as a slew of opportunities present themselves , from real - estate deals south of the border to substantial breaks on college tuition for parents sending their kids to school in the States .
UPDATE FROM NY TIMES :
On either side of the border , a buck is now a buck , or as Canadians call it on their side , a loonie .
Coupled with high prices and high taxes for many things in Canada , the strength of the Canadian dollar is driving Canadians into the United States to shop for shoes , school supplies , gasoline , used cars and second homes .
MP : Compared to January of 2002 , when the exchange rate was 1.6143 Canadian dollars per USD , everything in the U.S. is now on sale at a 38 % discount for Canadians .
The U.S. economy is now like a giant Wal - Mart for Canadians , with " everyday low prices . "
Japan ’s legions of individual investors like Mr. Okudaira have emerged as a global financial force to be reckoned with , directing almost half a trillion dollars of their nation ’s $ 14 trillion in personal savings overseas in search of higher returns .
Until recently , much of this huge outflow of cash , known as the yen - carry trade , had gone into United States stocks , bonds or currency , propping up the dollar ’s value .
Now , however , Japanese individuals are diverting more and more of that money away from the United States and the dollar and into higher - yielding global investments , ranging from high - interest Australian government bonds to shares in fast - growing Indian construction companies .
Partly this “ quitting America ” — called beikoku banare in Japanese — reflects an increasing sophistication of Japan ’s investors , who embraced mutual funds only a decade ago and are still learning to diversify .
But it also offers one more sign that the world does not depend as much on the American economy as it once did .
Recent figures on mutual fund purchases suggest this trend has accelerated since August , when subprime problems shook Wall Street — and along with it , faith in the United States economy .
Since early August , the dollar has fallen almost 8 percent against the yen , a decline many analysts here say offers another indication of Japan ’s waning appetite for dollar - denominated investments .
“ One lesson of August was the failure of American markets to recover , ” said Akiyoshi Hirose , head of research at Daiwa Fund Consulting , a research company based in Tokyo specializing in mutual funds .
“ On the other hand , Asia ’s emerging countries did recover quickly .
So money is flowing out of the United States and Europe and into these newer markets . ”
In October alone , Japanese individuals pulled 33.9 billion yen , or about $ 300 million , out of mutual funds that invested solely in North American stocks and bonds , according to Daiwa Fund .
In the same month , it said , Japanese individuals put 175.2 billion yen , or $ 1.6 billion , into funds investing in stocks and bonds in emerging countries .
Hopes for e-books began to revive last year with the introduction of the widely marketed Sony Reader .
Sony ’s $ 300 gadget , the size of a trade paperback , has a six - inch screen , enough memory to hold 80 books and a battery that lasts for 7,500 page turns , according to the company .
It uses screen display technology from E Ink , a company based in Cambridge , Mass. , that emerged from the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and creates power - efficient digital screens that uncannily mimic the appearance of paper .
Sony will not say how many it has sold , but the Reader has apparently done well enough that Sony recently increased its advertising for the device in several major American cities .
“ Digital readers are not a replacement for a print book ; they are a replacement for a stack of print books , ” said Ron Hawkins , vice president for portable reader systems at Sony .
“ That is where we see people , on the go , in the subway and in airports , with our device . ”

Book publishers also seem to be preparing for the kind of disruption that hit the music business when Apple introduced the symbiotic combination of the iPod and its iTunes online service .
This year , with Sony ’s Reader drawing some attention and Amazon ’s imminent e-book device on their radar , most major publishers have accelerated the conversion of their titles into electronic formats .
“ There has been an awful lot of energy around e-books in the last six to 12 months , and we are now making a lot more titles available , ” said Matt Shatz , vice president for digital at Random House , which plans to have around 6,500 e-books available by 2008 .
It has had about 3,500 available for the last few years .
Amazon has been showing the Kindle to book publishers for the last year and has delayed its introduction several times .
Last fall , a photograph of the device , and some of its specifications , leaked onto the Web when the company filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to get approval for its wireless modem , which will operate over a high - speed EVDO network .

TheAstrologer.com — Equinox Chart : Tendencies for the rest of this year
In the Equinox chart for Washington DC , the first thing we see is that the nation wants to actively debate current issues .
The planet Mercury rules the Ascendant and the Midheaven ( top of chart ) pointing to a highly mental and analytical period .
The country is seeking exchange of ideas , balance and compromise ( Mercury in Libra ) .
There is a drive to understand , investigate and disseminate information ( Mercury trines Mars and Neptune in the air signs ) .
The media , represented by Mercury as the messenger , have been in the forefront of the debate for a long time ( it was prominent in the 2006 Spring Equinox and 2007 Summer solstice charts ) .
During the past few years , many worthwhile documentaries such as “ Iraq for Sale ”  and “ Why We Fight ”  have looked under the covers at some of the abusive profits and business interests at work in perpetuating our wars .
The debates will continue as long as Mercury keeps reappearing predominantly in current mundane charts .
This may explain why impeachment is still very much alive in people ’s mind , despite the assurance of the congressional leadership that there is n’t enough support for it .

Seven - year - old Saud Bugti's father was picked up by secret police on a street corner in Karachi last November .
No one has heard from him since .
He has joined the ranks of Pakistan 's ' disappeared ' - victims of the country 's brutal attempts to wage war on both al - Qaida and those who fail to support the government .
But how many innocent people are being caught up in this ?
And what is America 's connection to the barbaric torture of suspects ?
Declan Walsh reports
They vanish quietly and quickly .
Some are dragged from their beds in front of their terrified families .
Others are hustled off the streets into a waiting van , or yanked from a bus at a lonely desert junction .
A windowless world of sweat and fear awaits .
In dark cells , nameless men bark questions .
The men brandish rubber whips , clenched fists , whirring electric drills , pictures of Osama bin Laden .
The ordeal can last weeks , months or years .
These are Pakistan 's disappeared - men and women who have been abducted , imprisoned and in some cases tortured by the country 's all - powerful intelligence agencies .
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has counted 400 cases since 2002 ; it estimates hundreds more people may have been snatched .
The phenomenon started with the great sweeps for al - Qaida suspects after September 11 , but has dramatically increased in recent years , and now those who disappear include homegrown " enemies of the state " - poets , doctors , housewives and nuclear scientists , accused of terrorism , treason and murder .
Guilty or innocent , it 's hard to know , because not one has appeared before a court .
An angry Pakistani public wants to know why .
The disappearances are increasingly perceived as Pakistan 's Guantánamo Bay - a malignant outgrowth of the " war on terror " .
This week , the issue moved centre stage with the showdown between President Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan 's chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
Many believe the judge is being victimised for championing the cases of the disappeared .
" These are Gestapo tactics , " says Iqbal Haider , a former minister .
" The more we protest , the more innocent people are being hurt .
And what frightening stories they tell . "
For Abid Zaidi it started with a phone call one afternoon last April .
The softly spoken 26 - year - old was at work at Karachi University 's department of zoology in a cavernous room of stuffed animals , sagging skeletons and yellowing name tags .
The voice on the phone instructed him to report to Sadder police station in the city centre .
There , a handful of men were waiting for him : he believes they belonged to Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , the army 's powerful spy agency .
They clapped cuffs on his wrists , wrapped a band around his eyes and drove him to a cell .
Then , he says , the torture started .
The men beat him , he says , with a chain , until he collapsed .
He was brought to a military hospital ; there doctors brushed off his pleas for help .
Then he was flown to another detention centre , where he was shown graphic images of torture .
" People 's skin was being removed with knives and blades and they were being drilled , " he says .
" It was really terrible . "
Then they hung him upside down from a butcher 's hook , his face dipping into a pool of sewage water .
The interrogators wanted Zaidi to admit his supposed part in the Nishtar Park bombings .
In early April , a suicide bomber had killed 50 people at a Sunni religious gathering in central Karachi .
The officials accused Zaidi , a prominent young Shia , of orchestrating the massacre .
Zaidi tried to explain he was more interested in zoology than zealotry .
They did not believe him .
In July , an official told him he had been sentenced to hang .
Zaidi wrote a will .
" I felt at peace because I knew God was with me , " he says .
But it was a ruse .
At 4 am on the morning of the " execution " , having refused to admit his guilt , a dramatic reprieve was announced .
Shortly afterwards , he underwent a lie detector test and on August 18 he was flown to Karachi .
The blindfold was lifted .
Zaidi was driven through the city .
The car stopped , a man handed him 200 rupees ( £ 1.80 ) and pushed the car door open .
" He said , ' Do n't open your eyes , ' " says Zaidi .
When the engine noise had receded , he found himself standing at a bus stop near Karachi University .
He got down on his knees and prayed .
Then he phoned his brother to take him home .
Zaidi's account cannot be verified because , officially speaking , he was never in government custody .
However a senior police officer familiar with the case describes it as a major embarrassment .
" That boy was picked up by a young officer , " says the official , who asks not to be named .
" [ The police ] knew it was the wrong guy .
But they refused to listen . "
The ISI is the most powerful arm of Pakistan 's intelligence establishment , commonly referred to as " the agencies " .
Founded by a British army officer in 1948 and headquartered at an anonymous concrete block in Islamabad , the ISI is famed and feared in equal part .
Its influence soared during the 1980s , when it smuggled vast amounts of American - funded weapons to mujahideen guerrillas fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan .
More recently , it has organised guerrilla groups fighting Indian troops in Indian - controlled Kashmir .
The other major agencies in Pakistan are Military Intelligence and the civilian Intelligence Bureau , and all three of these major agencies have variously been accused of rigging elections , extra-judicial assassinations and other dirty tricks .
But until 9/11 , disappearances were rare .
Then , in late 2001 , as al - Qaida fugitives fled from Afghanistan into Pakistan , Musharraf ordered that the agencies show full cooperation to the FBI , CIA and other US security agencies .
In return , the Americans would give them equipment , expertise and money .
Suddenly , Pakistan 's agencies had sophisticated devices to trace mobile phones , bug houses and telephone calls , and monitor large volumes of email traffic .
" Whatever it took to improve the Pakistanis ' technical ability to find al - Qaida fighters , we were there to help them , " says Michael Scheuer , a former head of the CIA 's Osama bin Laden unit .
An official with an American organisation says he once received a startling demonstration of the ISI 's new capabilities .
Driving down a street inside a van with ISI operatives , he could monitor phone conversations taking place in every house they passed .
" It was very impressive , and really quite spooky , " he says .
The al - Qaida hunt became a matter of considerable pride for President Bush 's close friend , the president of Pakistan .
" We have captured 672 and handed over 369 to the United States .
We have earned bounties totalling millions of dollars , " wrote Musharraf in his autobiography last year .
( The boast sparked outrage at home in Pakistan and was scrubbed from later Urdu- language versions of his book . )
Prize captures included the alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammed , who has apparently confessed to a string of terror plots after four years as a captive , and Abu Faraj al Libbi , another alleged bin Laden lieutenant .
But certain innocents were also swept up in the dragnet .
Brothers Zain and Kashan Afzal , for example , were detained and beaten many times over eight months by Pakistani agents convinced they belonged to al - Qaida .
Zain , now 25 , remembers that , in between the thrashings , the " FBI wallahs " - a woman and two men - would come to visit .
" They showed me a picture of Osama and asked if I knew him , " he says at his home in Karachi .
" I told them I had only seen him on television . "
As American citizens - the brothers were born in the US , where their father lives - they might have expected better treatment .
Instead , they got threats .
" The Americans said if we did not tell them everything , they would send us to Guantánamo Bay , " says Zain .
Like many of the disappeared , the Afzals had a colourful past that drew the attention of the agencies .
According to a well - informed source , their names appeared on a list of potential recruits found on a laptop belonging to Naeem Noor Khan , an al - Qaida computer expert arrested weeks earlier , in July 2004 .
They were also questioned about a visit they had made to the lawless tribal belt of Waziristan .
But whatever they had done , it was clearly not enough to warrant prosecution by either Pakistan or the US .
In April 2005 , they were brought to Lahore airport , handed a pair of airplane tickets in other people 's names , and set free .
The physical damage has healed - Zain suffered a burst eardrum - but the mental scars remain .
" He hears voices in the night coming to take him away again , " says his wife Sara .
The couple agreed to meet the Guardian and give their first newspaper interview in an attempt to press their case for a new American passport .
Despite numerous entreaties , the US consulate in Karachi has stonewalled requests to re-issue their passports , which were confiscated during their arrest .
" I am scared because of what has happened , " says Sara .
" Pakistan is not a reliable country , you know . "
A US embassy spokeswoman in Islamabad declines to comment on their case .
The truth is that the American government still quietly supports the disappearances of al - Qaida suspects , says Ali Dayan Hasan of Human Rights Watch , which has documented many cases .
" The abuse has become even more brazen because of US complicity , " he says .
He claims that American officials are regular visitors to ISI safehouses in Islamabad , Lahore and Rawalpindi where torture has occurred .
They have supervised interrogations from behind one - way mirrors , he says .
In FBI internal documents , he says , torture is referred to as " locally acceptable forms of interrogation " .
For some detainees the safehouses are the back door to the mysterious world of CIA " black sites " - secret prisons in Afghanistan , eastern Europe and across the Arab world where torture is allegedly rife .
Marwan Jabour , a Palestinian who was picked up in 2004 , recently gave an extraordinarily detailed account of life in this system .
After being tortured by ISI agents in Lahore - they strapped a rubber band around his penis - he said he was moved to a " villa " in Islamabad where he was questioned by US officials .
" It seemed to me that this place was controlled by Americans .
They were in charge , " he told Human Rights Watch .
" They would say : ' If you cooperate , we 'll let you sleep . ' "
A female official told him in Arabic , " Fuck Allah in the ass . "
One of four fellow Pakistani detainees bore the marks of severe torture .
" You can't imagine how much they were hurting him , " said Jabour , who was released last summer .
In its annual human rights report published last Tuesday , the US State Department acknowledged the disappearances but skated around the US 's own role .
" The country experienced an increase in disappearances of provincial activists and political opponents , " it noted .
In fact , most recent disappearances have nothing to do with al - Qaida .
To quell an insurgency in Baluchistan - a vast western province with massive oil and gas reserves - the agencies , in particular Military Intelligence , have rounded up hundreds of suspected rebels in the past two years .
Of the 99 abductions registered by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan last year , 73 were from Baluchistan .
Officials believe many more have gone unreported .
Shamsa Toon , a 70 - year - old woman , crouches on the pavement outside Karachi's Press Club clutching a giant photograph of her son , Gohram Saleh .
He has been missing since August 8 2004 , she says ; this was the 166th day of her vigil .
Her 13 - year - old granddaughter is threatening to commit suicide if there was no news .
" He 's just a cab driver , not any rebel , " she says , tears streaming down her face .
" His only crime is that he is a Baluch . "
Musharraf 's officials swat the issue away with blunt denials .
" I can say with authority that these people are not with any agency or government department , " says Brigadier Iqbal Cheema , head of the " crisis management cell " , which spearheads anti-terror operations , at the Interior Ministry .
" Most of these people creating a hue and cry belong to the militant organisations and have jihadi backgrounds .
They are involved in these activities themselves . "
But the current confrontation with the chief justice has brought a renewed focus .
Western diplomats are queasy about such obvious abuses from an ally they claim is " moving towards democracy " .
And the death of Hayatullah Khan , a tribal journalist who was found dead last June after seven months apparently in the custody of the agencies , has further fuelled the outrage .
Last November , Chaudhry , the chief justice , ordered the agencies to " find " 41 people who had gone missing .
Subsequently , half were quietly released .
But the court actions have mostly just underlined the impotence of the civilian institutions in the face of a powerful military machine .
When ISI lawyers plead that they " cannot locate " certain detainees , the judges can only fume and bang their benches .
Meanwhile , tearful relatives are left grasping for even a shred of news .
Qazim Bugti , the mayor of Dera Bugti , a small town in Baluchistan , was picked up last November .
His wife Asmat , left behind to look after their five children , weeps when she talks of her husband 's disappearance .
" Does President Musharraf not have children of his own ?
Would he like to see them treated like this ? " she says in the family 's Karachi apartment .
She agrees to speak despite whispered phone warnings to keep quiet : the agencies do not appreciate publicity .
Several relatives say they have been instructed not to contact the media or human rights groups .
Khalid Khawaja , who led a pressure group on behalf of some detainees , himself went missing last month .
He was reportedly taken to Attock Fort , a notorious military prison .
But the most audacious disappearance , perhaps , is that of Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost .
During his three years of captivity in Guantánamo Bay , Dost , 37 , became known as the " poet of Guantánamo " for his sharp verse .
After his release , he wrote The Broken Shackles of Guantánamo , and it was published in the Pashto language last September ; it became an instant hit in Peshawar 's bookstalls , selling more than 10,000 copies .
It also contained stinging criticism of the ISI .
Weeks later , policemen in a van abducted Dost as he walked from his local mosque after Friday prayers .
His brother , Badruzzaman Badr - also a former Guantánamo detainee - says , " The book is the reason behind this .
They are angry about what we have written .
They claim to have democracy and freedom of expression in this country , but it is not real . "
When Dost 's case came before a local court for the third time in January , the judges again asked the ISI to produce the missing man .
Again there was no answer .
Now Badruzzaman , who has abandoned his gemstone business and no longer sleeps at home , fears he will be next .
" I do not feel safe , they could arrest me any time .
But where can I go ? " he says .
Abid Zaidi , the zoology student from Karachi , has also learned the price of going public .
In late October , he travelled to Islamabad to describe his ordeal before a press conference organised by Amnesty International .
Shortly afterwards he was picked up again , this time by men in uniform .
Zaidi says they were flushed with anger .
" They told me : ' Next time , we will not pick you up .
We will kill you ' " .

Eine richtige Herausforderung wird es für den Arbeitslosen Full - Time - Geek sich Abwechlunsgreich zu ernähren .
Sicher ist die Teifkühlpizza ein Genuss , nur wird einem spätestens nach der 20 ' tn spei übel und auch der Körper reagiert nicht besonders wohlwollend auf zu einseitige Ernährung .
Aldi ( Feinkost Albrecht ) ist ds mit seiner billigen aber trotzdem abwechlungsreichen Qualitätsware durchaus ein bevorzugtes Einkaufsziel .
Zudem sind die Riffel Chips ungeschlagen .
Als Getränk können die drei verschiedenen Sorten von Instant Tea herhalten , Wildfrucht bevorzugt .
Vom Chinesen in der Stadt lässt sich dann noch eine größere Menge an Ramen Packungen ergattern , die sich ideal mit einem Wasserkocher zubereiten lassen .
Somit bleiben dann auch die 30 Euro für die T - Rechung über .
Das wichigste aber ist - gegessen wird am Rechner !

Zumindest bei uns im Köln - Bonner Raum kann man sich einen

Leider ist das Getränk recht schwehr zu ergattern aber da behilft man sich mit Massenbestellungen .
So kommt es , dass überall dort wo Geeks sich sammeln , meisst auch Mate zu finden ist .

Persönlich trinke ich lieber Kakao und Tee ( eher nicht " Earl Grey - heiß " , sondern Pfefferminze ) als Cola und Kaffee .

Ein Saarbrücker Informatik - Professor ist da anderer Meinung und wettet z.B. gerne mit seinen Studenten , daß er ihnen innerhalb eines Wochenendes Kochen beibringen kann , denn Kochen ist ja nicht viel anders als Programmieren Kochen bietet auch ein in RL hackbares System zum damit experimentieren .
Ist daher nicht nur lernbar und einfach , sondern auch Spass .
Von der Wahl des Grundnahrungsmittels ( z.B. welche Fleisch oder Fisch Sorte ) , ueber Wuerzen ( von scharf ueber Kraeuter bis suess ) , Kochmethode ( Pfanne braten oder sieden , Ofen ) , Verfahren ( heiss und kurz oder kuehler und lange ) , bis hin zu Wahl der Beilage , und deren Zubereitung ( disk / duenn geschnitten fuer durchgekocht oder Oberflaeche angekocht ) gibt es endlos viele Kombinationen zu erforschen , und dann der momentanen Stimmung und Vorliebe nach auszuwaehlen .
Heute hatte ich z.B. nichts aufgetaut , weil ich weg war und nicht wusste wie vollgegessen ich zurueckkomme .
Also musste es etwas sein das man direkt gefroren in die Pfanne geben kann ( ich mag Mikrowelle auftauen nicht besonders ) .
Die Wahl fiel auf Hamburger , weil ich Fisch schon an Freitag hatte , und nix anderes geeignetes da war ( erm ... ) .
Gewuerzt wuerde heute absichtlich pfefferlos , weil ich letzte Woche ein paar mal mit viel Pfeffer gemacht hatte .
Statt dessen wurde es Knoblauch dominiert , da ich nach dem Geschmack Lust hatte .
Weil ziemlich Muede ( eine Nacht ausgefallen ) wollte ich es simpel halten , also gabs Roesti in die selbige Pfanne ( sonst haett ich gebratene Kartoffelscheiben gemacht ) .
Passend ohne Pfeffer aber mit Zwiebel drin .
Das ganze noch mit nem Schwarztee mit Milch und Zucker drin serviert .
Und jetzt bin ich bums voll .
Da ewige Problem mit kochen und essen , der beschraenkte Platz zum das Resultat hinzutun .

Auf dem Elektroherd hingegen besteht das Problem , dass die Dose keinen guten Kontakt zur Herdplatte hat , und das ist schlecht für die Platte : Sie kann stellenweise überhitzen und sich dabei verziehen .

Nach dem Essen ein Espresso ! ( Score : 2 ) Von NoSuchGuy ( symlink@trap.no-spam.ebuzz.de ) am Sunday 23 .
November , 22:53 MET ( # 11 )
( User # 97 Info ) Egal was es zu Essen gab , nach dem Essen muss es einen Espresso geben .
Ich liebe guten Espresso über alles !
Espresso gibt es inzwischen in jedem Restaurant / Kneipe / Bar .
Guter Espresso ist aber leider sehr schwer zu bekommen .
Was viele als Espresso verkaufen ist nämlich oft ein normaler Kaffee in einer kleinen Tasse .
Zu einem guten Espresso gehören mehrere wichtige Dinge : Bohne :
Aus einer schlechten Bohne kann man in einer guten Maschine keinen guten Espresso zaubern .
Wichtigste Regel : Immer nur Bohnen kaufen , NIE Pulver .
Die frischgemahlene Bohne hat den besseren Geschmack .
Es gibt folgende Bohnen : Arabica und Robusta .
Arabica .
Genauere Infos zu Bohnen , Röstung und Mischung gibt es hier oder hier .
Gute Bohne müssen nicht teuer sein .
Die Espressobohnen vom Aldi ( 500g / 5 ) kann ich nur empfehlen .
Auch Bohnen von Fair - Trade ( 500g / ca.8,50  ) kann ich empfehlen .
Wer sich den Maybach unter den Bohnen gönnen möchte , und sich nicht vor 42,90  für 250g fürchtet , ist mit dem Jamaika Blue Mountain gut bedient .
Laut Experten ist dies die weltweit beste Bohne für Kaffee und Espresso .
Espressomaschine :
Für viele Espressotrinker ist die richtige Maschine eine Glaubensfrage .
Die einen schwören auf Siebträgermodelle z.B. hier , die anderen auf Vollautomaten wie z.B. hier .
Wichtig für die Maschine ist , das eine schöne Crema gebildet wird und das sie einfach zu reinigen ist .
Wasser :
Der Härtegrad des Wasser hat einen Einfluß auf den Geschmack .
Durch den Kalk in hartem Wasser werden die Kaffeesäuren neutralisiert , die zum vollen Geschmack eines Espresso beitragen .
Tasse :
Das Auge ißt / trinkt mit .
Deshalb sollte die Tasse natürlich dem Betrachter gefallen .
Außerdem sollte die Tasse immer vorgewärmt werden , da die geringe Menge in der Tasse sonst zu schnell abkühlt .
Absoluter Tabubruch ist ein Pappbecher wie er aus Kaffeautomaten kommt .
Merke : Kaffee wird gegen die Müdigkeit getrunken , Espresso nur zum Genuß !
Ich trinke jetzt erst mal einen Espresso :-)

Als Form des hacking habe ich mir Kochen bisher noch nicht vorgestellt , aber in gewisser Weise stimmt die Analogie .
Ich nehme gerne Rezepte , die ich mal irgendwo gelesen habe , und adaptiere sie je nachdem , was mein Kuehlschrank und Essensfach so zu bieten haben .
Besonders nett ist es , im Ghana House , beim arabischen Bazar oder ( besonders in Duesseldorf ) beim Japaner neue Zutaten einzukaufen und sie irgendwie in Mahlzeiten zu integrieren .
Experimentieren hat hier sicherlich noch keine /n umgebracht .
Es kommt schlimmstenfalls mal zu einem nicht 100 % - ig geniessbaren Abendessen .
Aber in dem Fall ist man ja ein selbstreferenziell - lernfaehiges Wesen und weiss in Zukunft , worauf zu achten ist .

" The more prohibitions there are , The poorer the people will be " -- Lao Tse
Six months in office , and Nicolas Sarkozy has not ceased being an embarrassment on the world stage .
From his first appearance at the G8 summit in Germany , where he foolishly called for more delay on Kosovo - a move that courtesy forced his new partners to support - to his fawning visit to Washington this week , France 's president is making waves for the wrong reasons .
Headstrong and unreflective , Sarkozy risks making an ass of himself .
Take his sudden descent last Sunday on Chad , where a group of French charity workers have been charged with kidnapping scores of children , describing them as orphans , putting fake bandages on some , and seeking to remove all of them from their families for ever .
Here is a case that clearly deserves to be tried where the crime was committed .
Yet President Sarkozy flies into N'djamena , brightly declaring that he wants the defendants taken to justice in France .
Besides the implication in Sarkozy 's conduct that the alleged kidnappers are as much victims as the abducted children , it is hardly surprising that Chadians see his actions as insufferable imperial presumption .
Yet the following day Sarkozy says his trip shows that France wants a " new " relationship with its former colonies in Africa , one in which they would be treated as " equals " .
Mon Dieu .
Of course , Sarkozy and his then wife , Cécilia , had already intervened in Libya to rescue five Bulgarian nurses accused of spreading Aids .
But the nurses had already spent several years in jail on evidence that was vague and deeply flawed .
There is no comparison with the Chadian allegations - and if Sarkozy thinks he sees a chance for a second " success " in extracting Europeans from the horrors of Africa , more 's the pity .
The visit to Washington - from where he returned yesterday - is of a different dimension , though here the Americans are as much to blame as Sarkozy and his entourage for the phoney mood music .
They are hyping the alleged shift in French policy as falsely as Sarkozy 's people .
Some US and French commentators are even saying that Sarkozy is Bush 's staunchest European friend , the new Tony Blair .
What is the substance ?
Sarkozy 's predecessor , Chirac , was a lifelong admirer of America , spending a gap year there , working in a bar and collecting a bevy of American girlfriends .
Sarkozy , by contrast , first visited the US at the age of 31 as the guest of a US government " young leaders " programme - the classic case of an ambitious man who was willing to be wooed .
Chirac 's cooling towards America was not based on prejudice but a principled difference in policy over Iraq - a stance that Sarkozy ( to his democratic credit , since few French people would support a turnaround ) is not reversing .
All that has happened is a shift in symbolism in the war on terror , pushed partly by France 's foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , who did agree with the attack on Iraq .
France will send 50 military trainers , not to Iraq but southern Afghanistan , as well as letting its Mirage fighter - bombers go into action there .
Not much change there .
The main US excitement came from a stray Sarkozy comment that he might rejoin Nato 's integrated compound almost 50 years after De Gaulle walked out .
Washington saw an opening , and hopes this reconciliation will happen at the alliance 's next summit in April .
Since then , however , the Gaullists around the president have taken the issue back from the Atlanticists , and policy is likely to remain unchanged - though , with his impetuosity and a dose of Bush flattery this week , who knows what Sarkozy will do ?
On some " Islamic " issues he is certainly closer to Bush than Chirac was .
Sarkozy speaks more fiercely against Iran and more warmly towards Israel .
On Turkey there is a difference .
While Bush sees a western interest in wooing Ankara , Sarkozy feels no such imperative .
He wants Turkey kept out of the EU .
At home , Sarkozy 's rush to act first and think afterwards is as notable as on foreign policy .
So are his arrogance and bad temper .
He demeaned his friend and jogging partner , the prime minister François Fillon , by calling him an " aide " .
He shouted at his press secretary , publicly accusing him of being a " child " and an " imbecile " .
Where is the dignity of the office ?
Where is a sense of the responsibilities a president carries ?
Where is the subtlety needed by anyone who wants to negotiate a new deal with France 's public service workers ?
Foreign policy was almost absent from the presidential campaign .
So why race around like a bull in an international china shop when you were elected to implement a domestic agenda ?
The glamour of foreign summits is seductive .
But even in a global television age European leaders are still judged by what they do at home rather than abroad .
Stick to that , Sarkozy .
Ground yourself for a while .
Otherwise , you may do worse than Tony Blair .
You could become the gaffe - prone European whom your colleagues roll their eyes at when you turn your back - the new Berlusconi , the clown they grimly have to grin and bear .

I pulled into my mom ’s driveway last night and tried to go straight to sleep .
But sleep at 10 pm just does n’t happen for me .
I woke up at six in the morning .
It was cold .
Really cold .
All my water froze solid all the way through .
I started the van and let it warm up and run for a while , just so it stays happy , before we went to school .
School is walking distance .
Actually , everything is walking distance here : the town is only about six blocks .
At school , my mom introduced me to everyone and told them to feel free to hand me any projects or tasks .
When we got to the secretary she said , “ actually , we need a sub for the morning . ”
In the state of Alaska you only need a bachelors degree to be a substitute teacher .
Background checks and child abuse clearances are , apparently , not required .
Next thing I knew I was wrangling a bunch of 4th , 5th , and 6th graders in an earth science class .
I ’m all about the earth science .
I thought I was all about the 4 - 6th graders too , but wow .
They are , like men , a lot different in groups .
The instructions left for me were simply , “ label maps . ”
When I got to the classroom I discovered that there were several maps - in - progress , and they had numbered lists of places and landmarks to be labelled .
When the kids came in they sat in groups around the maps .
Suddenly it was all clear .
But one group had already finished their map , several groups were halfway through , and two groups were just hopeless .
I redistributed the people from the succesfull groups to the hopeless groups .
This did not have the immediate effect that I ’d hoped , because 4 - 6th graders are apparently lacking in motivational social skills .
So I interjected some organization and motivation and structure .
Meanwhile some of the finished kids started pushing each other around on wheely chairs , and some other kids started tattling on them .
Holy wow .
We proved my rudimentary version of chaos theory by watching them and then I told them to knock it off .
They played chess and poked each other with pencils for the rest of the period , while I tried to motivate other kids to stop coloring in little dips in the mountains and label rivers .
Later , in high school chemistry , sex work came up .
Luckily I did n’t have to actually teach chemistry or we would have all been in trouble .
Instead I just kind of helped them read a section in their book , answer some questions , and make flashcards of the periodic table .
Fortunately I am somewhat acquainted with the periodic table .
So we were peacefully and craftfully making flashcards , when some boy called some girl a whore .
“ Hey , ” I said , “ no whore - calling in chemistry .
Focus on the Boron . ”
“ Okay , ” the alleged whore said , “ I ’ll leave if you do n’t want whores . ”
“ But she really is a whore , ” the boy said .
The alleged whore smiled .
“ I am , Ms. R , I ’m playing one in the play . ”
“ Oh , are you Abby ? ” I asked .
It is that book about the Salem witch burnings where Abby is the evil slut to blame for it all .
“ Yep , see , I told you .
I ’m a whore . ”
“ Well , ” I mused , “ Abby was a harlot and an adulteress , not a whore .
A whore is a person who has sex for money , and I do n’t think they even had that word back then . ”
“ No at the end of the book Abby goes to Boston and she ’s a prostitute , and a PROSTITUTE is a WHORE , ” the alleged whore announced proudly .
“ Do ya know what the oldest profession is ?
Huh ?
Do ya ? ” the whore - calling boy asked .
Holy fuck .
I was a total sub -failure .
Kids get around me and they start talking sex work .
This is n’t good .
“ Yeah , ” another boy ( a potential whore - caller ? ) piped up , “ they even had prostitutes in Jesus ’ time , Mary whatsername was a prostitute . ”
“ They had prostitutes way before they had Jesus .
But this is chemistry class and it is not an appropriate place to discuss the history of prostitution .
Now .
Who knows the abbreviation for boron ? ”
Ha .
I won .
It ’s only been one day , but so far I think that the school system is not something I want to participate in .
So far , it ’s mostly been trying to make kids do work they do n’t want to do , and it makes me really glad I did n’t go to a “ real ” high school .
6 reasons why Hillary will lose if Al Gore gets in the race …
Al Gore has officially lost 25 - 30 lbs .
Call it maybe a mid-summer diet or maybe call it a meeting with destiny .
OK OK , for all the skeptics let ’s put this in perspective .
Al Gore as a non-candidate is among the top 3 front runners , depending on which poll you read .
“ Gore receives 18 % of the vote when included in the list of possible Democratic candidates , however Clinton maintains a sizable lead , and Gore runs neck and neck with Obama for second place . ”
- Gallup Poll , Aug. 3 2007
If Al ran , he would open with a pair of aces .
To Democrats , Gore was right on the war when almost everyone else was wrong , which gives him the inside track to the antiwar vote that will be as crucial in the Democratic primaries of 2008 as it was in 1968 and 1972 .
1 . Gore opposed the war from the outset .
And his endorsement of Howard Dean , much ridiculed when Dean disintegrated weeks later , looks less like a political gaffe now than an act of principle .
Clearly , Hillary has a hellish problem with her stand on the war and only Al Gore can look at her in debate and utter the very words : “ Mrs. Clinton the most important vote of your political career , and you got it wrong . ”
2 . Gore has taken out the patent on the global warming issue , and the environmental movement remains a powerful engine of cash and campaign labor inside the Democratic Party .
3. Hillary has slipped in the polls of Democrats as to whom they wish to see nominated .
Gore has moved into second in many polls ( states like California ) , and in crucial battle ground states like New Hampshire and Michigan has moved into first place ahead of Hillary .
4. Hillary is too programmed .
She has made all the right moves in the Senate to erase her image as a militant feminist , but lacks the platform skills of Bill .
She cannot bring to a debate the passion of Gore , who believes deeply in what he stands for , on the war , global warming and the state of democracy , which is very authentic to voters .
5 . Her position as front - runner makes her the natural target for the other candidates , while her loss of 11 points and slippage makes her vulnerable .
In a head - to - head race , Gore runs stronger than Hillary against republicans .
And while Gore has been damaged by his close defeat to Bush and some of his shrill speeches in that campaign , he does not carry as much scar tissue as Hillary .
6 . There is a sense among some Democrats that Hillary in her six years in the Senate have not removed the indelible impression of her eight White House years , when Americans concluded she was too polarizing and divisive a figure to lead the nation .
That sentiment surfaces in polls .
“ As is the case nationally , Clinton gains from being seen as the strongest leader and the most electable contender ( among current candidates ) .
But in a state where retail politics can be crucial , she lags far behind her main rivals in voters ’ rankings of the most likable candidate . ”
- Washington
Post survey results of likely caucus participants to capture attitudes among a small fraction of Iowa ’s population of the active democratic candidates .
Once the general elections begin Al Gore holds a more leverage with swing voters and independents , and you ca n’t discount that the man got more votes than any presidential nominee in election history … who matches up against such a globally loved personality ?
Giuliani…?
The former mayor of New York vs. The Former Vice President of the United States .
Non-issue .
Gore will be the next president , if we work together to convince him to run !
Conservative Americans felt the eight - year soap opera had just gone on for too long with Bill Clinton , and a Hillary nomination would revive that sentiment and polarize the conservative swing votes .
Ultimately , Al Gore would defeat Hillary in the primary - though it is debatable with her current lead - you have to factor 2 criteria .
( a) Al is n’t campaigning , not spending a dime on running for president .
Yet , he is a front runner .
What happens when he finally steps up to the podium and speaks about the leadership he intends to bring to the white house ?
( b ) Al Gore spoke out against the war ( most divisive issue in the party ) , and Hillary still stands by her vote .
The Democratic primary candidates is more of a qualifying match – winner faces Al Gore , the champion of the party .

Security researcher Petko Petkov has revealed a cross -site request forgery vulnerability in Gmail that makes it possible for a malicious web site to surreptitiously add a filter to a user 's Gmail account that forwards e-mail to a third - party address .
Petkov 's proof - of - concept exploit for this vulnerability , which has been independently verified but not publicly released , uses a multipart / form - data POST to send instructions to Gmail 's internal API .
The vulnerability can only be exploited when the user is currently logged in to the Gmail service .
This is the second major Google security vulnerability to be revealed this week .
On Monday , security researcher Fernando Bedford provided a proof - of - concept exploit for a Google cross -site scripting vulnerability in Google 's Blogspot polls API that facilitated e-mail hijacking and address book sniffing .
That vulnerability was fixed by Google shortly after it was reported , but it is presently unclear whether or not the vulnerability discovered by Petkov has been fixed yet .
Petkov has also recently disclosed serious vulnerabilities in Adobe 's PDF reader and in Quicktime .
In a blog entry about the latest Gmail vulnerability , Petkov points out that web - based cross - site scripting attacks can potentially pose a more serious threat to users than conventional viruses .
" [ V ] irtualized browsers will never protect you from these types of attacks .
In an age where all the data is in the cloud , it makes no sense for the attackers to go after your box , " wrote Petkov .
" [ I ] t is a lot simpler to install one of these persistent backdoor / spyware filters .
game over !
they don ' ??t own your box , but they have you , which is a lot better . "
Many companies are rapidly shifting their applications from the desktop to the web .
Unfortunately , the security implications of this transition are not always fully considered .
Widely used Ajax web application development techniques can expose web services to the risk of being compromised .
Security vulnerabilities like the one revealed by Petkov add fuel to the debate that is presently raging between privacy advocates and companies that collect and store a lot of personal information on the Internet .
Google has not responded to the situation by press time .
ErlOCaml , a " tight bridge between Erlang and OCaml " .
Found this mentioned in the " Erlang and OCaml " talk in the proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop 2007 .
As the talk - slides say , there is " No particular progress yet " , but it is an interesting idea .
Here is the first slide :
A lot of us use SEO software these days .
People pay hundreds of dollars for the software that helps them get the most exposure and achieve top rankings on Google .
A lot of companies use SEO software as a marketing tool .
It is an easy way to get your website visible in the search engines .
One of the best things about SEO software is that it does n’t take much to set up .
You do n’t have to learn anything complex like programming or know any secrets that only the company that sells you the software knows .
If you are in the market for SEO software , here are some things that you need to consider .
You should be sure that you can easily use the program and make the most of its features .
First , check to see if the product has a support option .
This will save you from dealing with the problem yourself .
Make sure that you are able to contact someone to help you troubleshoot your problems or questions about the software .
Second , look for a proper user interface .
Most of the times , SEO software comes with a wizard - type interface .
Make sure that you get a design that is easy to understand and use .
Third , find out how many programs you will be able to download from the website .
These are just the software ’s core functions .
The rest of the package may consist of some other applications .
Programs should also be compatible with each other .
The software should provide a means to download the codes from one program to another .
Next , look for technical support .
If the product does not offer technical support , you may want to go somewhere else .
Technical support should be available to help you solve any questions you may have .
It is also a good idea to check the customer feedbacks about the product .
It is a way to understand what other people think about the product and its users .
Finally , look for testimonials for the product .
There may be people who have bought the product who are willing to talk about their experiences .
Using SEO software may take some time and effort .
You should never expect instant results .
Still , it is not impossible to achieve top rankings in the search engines .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 1 ( AP ) 
A program to employ spy satellites for certain domestic uses has been postponed because of privacy concerns .
Congress had already provided money for the program , which was to begin this month .
But some lawmakers demanded more information about its legal basis and what protections there were to ensure that the government was not peering into the homes of Americans .
As a result , the Homeland Security Department is not formally moving ahead with the program until it answers those questions , a department spokesman said .
The program would have expanded access to material gathered by satellites that monitor American territory to agencies involved in emergency response , border control and law enforcement .
A new office within the Homeland Security Department , called the National Applications Office , would coordinate requests from civilian agencies for satellite information .
Currently , civilian use of the material has generally been limited to monitoring weather and climate changes and to making maps .
Representative Bennie Thompson , Democrat of Mississippi , an opponent of the program , commended the department on Monday for its decision to “ go back to the drawing board and get it right . ”
Margin Debt Grows ; Risk Grows Too
Over the years , we have repeatedly commented on Margin Debt .
Its has been our well considered position that that Margin Debt is a normal part of Bull market expansion .
Indeed , in the early and middle parts of any bull cycle , margin contributes to rising stock prices .
As we have previously written :
" During healthy bull markets , increases in margin debt is not a bad thing :
It provides fuel for further market gains .
Its only when debt reaches excessive speculative levels that it is potentially problematic .
Our prior looks at Margin Debt saw the debt rise , but not to levels that reflected excessive levels ( see NYSE Member Firms ’ Client Margin and NASD Firm Margin Levels Spikes to Record Levels as examples ) .
We also noted that NASD margin is relatively small when compared to NYSE margin .
When margin worries first started popping up in the press , we observed the total margin was relatively low , both in real terms and relative to total market capitalization .
As we noted at the time , " We do not read this uptick in margin as a warning sign for the broader market . "
More recently , however , the margin situation is getting more worrisome .
This time , the borrowed money situation is more serious .
Its not just the total amount of margin , but rather , its percentage as a share of total market cap : Margin lending , as a percentage of stock - market capitalization , is nearing levels last seen in the midst of the Internet bubble :
>
Barron 's adds :
" The Federal Reserve is empowered to set the maximum loan - to - value rate ( last changed in 1974 to 50 % from 65 % ) for stock loans , an overlooked policy tool .
Kaufman suggests that the Fed use its power more often " as a symbolic gesture " that speculation is overdone .
If stocks rise much further , he thinks such a gesture would be warranted .
September 's margin numbers should be out shortly .
Steve Levine , a former NYSE margin regulator who now consults , expects a $ 30 billion drop .
" Brokers , " he notes , have been " reducing leverage through additional margin calls . "
But rest assured :
Your broker 's not necessarily your friend when it comes to debt ...
This will be worth watching in the coming months -- especially if this past week 's sell off accelrates , and we begin to see margin calls .
THATS where things really get ugly . . .

Perhaps that recent decline in margin debt shown on the Ned Davis chart will lead the market down ...
The margin debt chart looks awfully like the " double - top " that appears to be unfolding on the longterm charts of the S+P 500 ...

Pregnancy deaths increase after abortion ban in Nicaragua

Under Nicaragua 's no-exception abortion ban implemented last year , researchers say that at least three women have died because of complications during pregnancy , while 12 reported cases have yet been analyzed .
The Associated Press detailed the story of one victim , 22 - year old Olga Reyes .
In her case , the fetus grew outside of her uterus and was unable to survive , prompting excessive bleeding that eventually endangered the mother .
Reyes ' husband expressed concern over the limitations Nicaraguan doctors face .
" Doctors feel if they interrupt a pregnancy , their liscenses can be revoked , " he said through a translator .
" They are threatened . "
The law was passed last year with support from institutions like the Roman Catholic Church , which asserts that medical advances , not abortion , can alleviate complications of pregnancy .
Read the whole report HERE .
The following video is from The Associated Press , broadcast on November 6 , 2007 .
Recent research has revealed that by feeding spiders to their chicks , birds can manipulate the personality and learning ability of their young .
In a report recently published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , University of Glasgow researchers reveal that birds preferentially feed their young spiders containing taurine .
Taurine is an amino acid which is also found in breast milk and energy drinks .
The beneficial qualities of taurine include aiding the development of premature babies and reducing blood pressure in human adults , but it has not previously been known how taurine influences the development of birds .
By comparing the behaviour of wild blue tits that were fed a taurine supplement , mimicking a diet rich in spiders , with blue tits that were not , researchers were able to observe the long term impacts of this vital nutrient .
Lead researcher Dr Kate Arnold said : “ We found that taurine has a significant impact on the personality and memory of the birds .
Those who were fed taurine as chicks were on average much bolder and better at learning in adulthood , than their counterparts who were not fed the extra taurine .
This is the first time that we have been able to fully explain why birds feed their young spiders at a particular stage in their development and how parents can permanently alter the behaviour of their offspring via the food that they select . ”

AQUEBOGUE , N.Y. , July 3 —
In the 35 years since vines began sprouting out of its sandy soil , the North Fork of Long Island has fought to be recognized as a bona fide wine region , and now more than a million visitors a year visit the tasting rooms at its 30 vineyards to sample award - winning merlots and cabernet francs .
But this season , small signs bearing stern messages —
“ No Buses , ” “ No Limos , ” “ Appointment Only ” — have sprouted outside many of the wineries .
There also are reports of tastings gone wild involving intoxicated visitors who have tossed back full glasses of wine without regard to nose or body until they grabbed the brass spittoon for baser purposes .
The latest additions to local lore include a story about members of an inebriated group at the Palmer Vineyards here who hopped off a hayride and began gallivanting naked through the vines .
Then there were the drunken customers at the Pugliese Vineyards in Cutchogue who jumped into the shimmering lake next to the elegant outdoor tasting area .
And the bachelorette parties that often culminate in tabletop dances , to the horror of nearby oenophiles sniffing or sipping the local chardonnays .
“ All of a sudden it ’s five deep at the bar with people knocking into each other and pushing each other out of the way to get to the tasting , ” said Kristen Venasky , 27 , who has been pouring for two years at Palmer .
“ Saturdays , ” she said , “ are for people who want to get sloshed . ”
If the Beatles list did n’t get you going , this one is sure to !
Here is a list of the top 15 rock riffs of all time , as compiled by Total Guitar magazine .
15 . Van Halen Ain’t Talkin ’ ’bout Love
“ Ai n’t Talkin ’ ‘ Bout Love ” is one of the best known songs from Van Halen .
Appearing on their 1978 eponymous debut , it is considered one of the rawest songs the band has ever recorded .
The song almost has a “ punk ” feel , yet the solo and guitar virtuosity of Eddie Van Halen shines throughout the record .
It has a distinct and raw sounding intro , structured around a palm - muted and arpeggiated chord progression of I , IV , VII in the key of A minor with harmonics .
14 . Led Zeppelin Black Dog
Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones , who is credited with writing the main riff , got the idea for “ Black Dog ” after hearing Muddy Waters ’ experimental psychedelic - blues album , Electric Mud .
He wanted to try “ electric blues with a rolling bass part . ”
Jones also wanted to write a song that people could n’t “ groove ” or dance to .
13 . Muse Plug in Baby
This song is widely praised for its intro riff , almost instantly recognizable for use of a rising triad motif to move through a distinctively classical minor scale .
It made it to # 5 in Kerrang ! ’s Top 50 Riffs .
12 . Free All Right Now
“ All Right Now ” is a rock single by the English band Free .
The song , released in the summer of 1970 , hit # 1 on the UK rock music charts and # 4 on the U.S. charts .
“ All Right Now ” originally appeared on the album Fire And Water , which Free recorded on the Island Records label , formed by Chris Blackwell .
11 . Ozzy Osbourne Crazy Train
The riff is used by many baseball players as their walk - up music , including Chipper Jones , Ryan Church , Hanley Ramirez and Troy Glaus .
It is also the introduction song for the New England Patriots of the NFL .
Ozzy Osbourne sang the song live on national television during the Patriots ’ opening game in 2005 .
As well , to this day it is played in the NHL , usually at the onset of a powerplay .
10 . Black Sabbath ‘ Paranoid ’
“ Paranoid ” is a song by Black Sabbath that appears on the band ’s breakthrough album Paranoid .
Supposedly , the members of Black Sabbath put together this song in 15 minutes based on a solo by Tony Iommi .
This song was only meant to be a “ filler ” , but became one of Black Sabbath ’s most well known songs .
9. Jimi Hendrix Voodoo Chile ( slight return )
“ Voodoo Chile ” is a song by The Jimi Hendrix Experience from the album Electric Ladyland .
Recorded on May 2 , 1968 at the Record Plant Studios in New York City , the recording session included Mitch Mitchell , drummer of The Jimi Hendrix Experience , Steve Winwood of Traffic on B3 organ , and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane on bass duties .
The song , basically a 15 - minute blues jam , evolved into the final product over the course of an hour .
8. AC/DC
Back in Black
“ Back in Black ” is a song by AC / DC best known for its distinctive , powerful opening guitar riff , appearing as the sixth track on their 1980 album of the same title , Back in Black .
Two live versions of the song later appeared on both versions of the album Live , as well as the Australian tour edition of Stiff Upper Lip .
It has been covered by bands such as The Hives , Steriogram , Foo Fighters with Jack Black , Travis and Colombian pop singer Shakira .
The band ’s unstated tribute to Bon Scott , it was a worldwide success , and peaked in the U.S. at # 37 on Billboard ’s Hot 100 chart in 1981 and # 51 on Billboard ’s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart .
7. Metallica Master of Puppets
This song features a chromatic introduction riff and a change into a Spanish phrygian interlude .
Before the second solo of the song , bassist Cliff Burton , can be vaguely heard in the background reciting the verse , in a deep gruff voice .
6. Derek & The Dominoes / Clapton Layla
“ Layla ” is the title track on the Derek and the Dominos album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , released in December 1970 .
It is considered one of rock music ’s definitive love songs , featuring an unmistakable guitar figure , played by Eric Clapton and Duane Allman , as lead - in .
Its famously contrasting movements were composed separately by Clapton and Jim Gordon .
5. Metallica Enter Sandman
After releasing a musically complex album in … And Justice for All , Metallica wanted to write simpler songs for their self - titled album , therefore “ Enter Sandman ” is a departure from their previous works .
It is , as Lars Ulrich has stated , a “ one - riff song ” : all sections derive from main riff that Kirk Hammett wrote .
The main riff utilizes variations of the E/B tritone , often referred to as the “ devil ’s interval ” in medieval church music .
4. Deep Purple Smoke on the Water
This song is known for and recognizable by its central theme , a crunching four - note “ blues scale ” melody harmonized in parallel fourths that is one of the most famous riffs in hard rock history .
The riff , played on a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar by Ritchie Blackmore , is immediately joined by hi-hat and drums and electric bass parts before the start of Ian Gillan ’s vocal .
3. Led Zeppelin Whole Lotta Love
The song begins with a trademark Page riff and moves into the first chorus .
Then , beginning at 1:24 ( and lasting until 3:02 ) the song dissolves to a free jazz - like break involving a theremin solo and the moans of Robert Plant ( sometimes called the “ orgasm section ” ) .
2. Nirvana Smells like Teen Spirit
“ Smells Like Teen Spirit ” is a song by the American rock band Nirvana , and the opening track and lead single from the band ’s 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind .
Written by Kurt Cobain , Krist Novoselic , and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig , the song uses a verse - chorus form where the main four - chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic .
1. Guns ‘ N’ Roses Sweet Child o’ Mine
This song is credited as being written by Guns N’ Roses as a band ; more specifically it contains Slash ’s riff , Izzy ’s chords , Axl ’s lyrics , and McKagan ’s bass line .
The subject of the song is generally thought to be lead singer Axl Rose ’s then - girlfriend and eventual wife , Erin Everly .
In a VH1 special , it was stated that Slash played the riff in a jam session as a joke .
Drummer Steven Adler and Slash were warming up and Slash began to play a “ circus ” melody while making faces at Steven .
Adler asked him to play the riff again , and Izzy Stradlin came in with the chords .
Axl became intrigued and started singing the poem he had written .

In case you ’ve been hiding for the past year or two , I ’ll let you in on a secret : being small is a huge advantage .
Big businesses no longer hold the power - you do .
I ’ll let Seth Godin back me up on this :
“ Small is the new big .
Recent changes in the way that things are made and talked about mean that big is no longer an advantage .
In fact , it ’s the opposite . ”
Here ’s the thing though - knowing that small businesses hold the power is n’t enough .
You need to act on that knowledge .
You need to do something with your tremendous advantage .
In this article we ’ll give you several very specific and concrete ways that you can act now ; and get more customers that prefer your company - because it ’s smaller .
Your advantage from being small comes in three main parts .
1. Personal service
When you are a small business , your customer will know you .
Your customers will probably meet every single one of your employees ( which , may end up being you ) .
And they will get to know you , your company , your values , your style , etc …
This is a huge benefit .
People like to feel comfortable .
They do n’t like to talk to eight different people .
Notice how bigger companies tout the advantage of things like a “ personal account manager ” or a “ dedicated support professional ” .
Well , just for the record , as a small company my customers get that by default .
Your ’s can too .
2. Knowledge of your customer
The better a company knows it ’s customers , the better it can serve them , and the more it will profit because of it .
If you know your customers well , you can predict their ever - changing needs and wants .
From that prediction , you can adapt your business so it will be more successful .
As a small business owner , you probably do a little bit of everything .
This leads to you dealing directly with your customers .
Direct customer contact builds a much better understanding than , say , working as a product manager at a big company .
Big companies have so many levels for the information to go through that by the time the employees tell the managers what the customers want , the meaning is likely lost or garbled .
3 . The ability to change quickly
For a big corporation to do change what it ’s doing takes a lot of effort .
The new idea first has to make it ’s way through management teams , and if it ’s lucky it ’ll make it to the board .
With board and shareholder approval , the company will probably direct millions of dollars into feasibility studies and R&D .
Then it might change .
For you , as a small business owner , it ’s a lot easier .
If you see that your consumers are missing a service then you can start offering it .
It takes one decision , and there is very little risk .
The difference between a big corporation and small one is like the difference between a MAC Truck and a sports car .
You can move , turn , change , accelerate , slow down , and adjust - much faster .
Here ’s how can you turn this to your advantage immediately : call up several of your customers and tell them that in the interest of improving your business you ’d like to ask them some questions .
Ask them what your doing well , what your doing poorly , and what services they might want you to offer that you do n’t .
Then , and this is what a big business can’t do , implement their suggestions right away .
Take these three points to heart , and use them whenever you can .
Keep your customers very close , give them personal service .
Build an understanding of what they want , what they like and dislike .
Then use your small business agility to make changes much faster than the big guys can .
If you do all three , I can promise you ’ll see great results .
CAMDEN , Ala . —
Hundreds of hospice providers across the country are facing the catastrophic financial consequence of what would otherwise seem a positive development : their patients are living longer than expected .
Over the last eight years , the refusal of patients to die according to actuarial schedules has led the federal government to demand that hospices exceeding reimbursement limits repay hundreds of millions of dollars to Medicare .
The charges are assessed retrospectively , so in most cases the money has long since been spent on salaries , medicine and supplies .
After absorbing huge assessments for several years , often by borrowing at high rates , a number of hospice providers are bracing for a new round that they fear may shut their doors .
One is Hometown Hospice , which has been providing care here since 2003 to some of the most destitute residents of Wilcox County , the poorest place in Alabama .
Tony Snow : Bush sometimes ' makes you want to just dash your brains out '

Print This Email This When White House Press Secretary Tony Snow appeared on David Letterman 's show Thursday , he told Letterman that he was " suckered into " working at the White House but said " I 'm glad I did .
I had a great time . "
" It seems like it would be a horrible job , " Letterman commented .
" The president 's a really fun guy to work for , " Snow responded , adding that he also gets along well with reporters and enjoyed working with them .
" There were n't any people when I saw them I 'd sort of blanch with dread , " Snow said of the White House press corps , " but on the other hand , there were people who had certain , sort of , quirks .
Like there was one fellow who would always ask questions that were basically designed to set off global thermonuclear warfare .
... Get India versus China , or whatever . "
Letterman brought up Bush 's low approval ratings , asking , " Does this kind of thing bother the administration , bother the president ? "
" Well , he does n't run around doing high fives , he 's not happy about it . " said Snow .
However , he noted that Congress is doing even worse , quipping that " Bin Laden is outpolling Congress . "
Letterman told
Snow he keeps hearing what a warm , cordial man Bush is in private , but that " something happens when you put him in front of an audience .
...
He can't get it , it 's stuck in gear .
... Is that a fair assessment ? " " Yeah , " said Snow .
" And there are time you want to just dash your brains out against the wall . "

For example , they said only that the government knew of the general timeframe for the attacks , or that the government had a list of potential targets , on which the World Trade Center was one of many potential targets ( of course , other whistleblowers have been more specific ) .
Casazza further stated that these whistleblowers saw how Sibel Edmonds was being harrassed and gagged , and were fearful that the same thing would happen to them .
So they approached the Jersey Girls to ask them to demand the 9/11 Commission subpoena the whistleblowers .
The Jersey Girls tried to bring the whistleblowers before the 9/11 Commission , and the Commissioners agreed , but then never let the whistleblowers testify , let alone subpoena them .
Why is this important ?
Because defenders of the official government story have argued that 9/11 could n't have been an inside job or else whistleblowers would have come forward .
Ms. Cassaza confirms what many have said : there are a lot of 9/11 whistleblowers who are afraid to come forward -- especially without a supboena -- for fear of being attacked and harassed .
A video of Ms. Cassaza 's statement has just been released :
Another day , another patent infringement lawsuit .
This time , Canada - based Wi-LAN — " a leader in technology licensing " — has filed two suits against 22 total companies that it alleges have infringed on its patents relating to WiFi and power consumption in DSL products .
Those companies include some strange bedfellows : PC manufacturers like Apple , Acer , Gateway , and HP ; WiFi gear makers such as Atheros Communications , Belkin , Broadcom , Buffalo Technology , and D - Link ; and a pair of big - box retailers — Best Buy and Circuit City — just for kicks .
The complaint , filed in the patent - litigation hotbed of the Eastern District of Texas , accuses the 22 companies of making or selling products that infringe on three of its patents : patent numbers 5,282,222 , RE37,802 and 5,956,323 .
The patents address Wi-LAN 's developments on WiFi transceivers and power consumption , which are utilized in the products sold by many popular companies .
Wi -LAN does not make or sell any products itself , however — the company has done work on broadband wireless technology since 1992 , but " reinvented itself " in 2006 to focus on licensing its intellectual property .
One such successful reinvention came from Fujitsu , which recently signed a license agreement with Wi-LAN , giving the company access to Wi-LAN 's entire patent portfolio .
" Wi - LAN has successfully negotiated patent licensing deals with a number of companies covering a broad range of patent families and technologies , " said Wi-LAN CEO Jim Skippen in a statement .
" Our existing licensing agreements are a strong endorsement of the strength and validity of our valuable patent portfolio .
While we prefer to resolve patent infringement through business discussions , we have consistently maintained that litigation was always a possibility when negotiations do not result in a license within a reasonable time . "
Skippen said in a conference call this morning that the reason Wi-LAN targeted so many companies at once was so that it could ensure its own choice of venue for the suits ( Marshall , Texas — natch ) .
" We were concerned that we would be forced into other courts through declaratory judgment actions if we did not sue virtually all of the likely defendants , " he said during the call .
It 's highly unusual for an IP firm to sue retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City .
What exactly does Wi-LAN expect to get out of targeting those two companies ?
It 's difficult to envision Best Buy no longer selling 802.11b/ g/n access points as a result of the lawsuits .
" We cannot predict how Best Buy or Circuit City will respond to our lawsuits , " Wi-LAN VP of licensing and general counsel Bill Middleton told Ars .
" However , many retailers choose to encourage their suppliers to act quickly to take a license to the patents at issue . "

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Pakistan will be under a state of emergency for " as long as it is necessary , " Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said Sunday , a day after Pervez Musharraf suspended the constitution and widened his powers as president and military chief .
In a commentary written for CNN on Sunday , opposition leader Benazir Bhutto called Musharraf 's plan " a step to entrench his dictatorship " and called for elections under an independent caretaker government .
But Aziz said it could be months before parliamentary elections -- scheduled for January -- will take place .
" The parliament could give itself more time , up to a year , in terms of holding the next elections , " Aziz said .
" However , at this point , no decision has been made . "
The state of emergency had been imposed to " bring more harmony to the pillars of state " and to protect against extremism in the country , Aziz said .
See a timeline of the upheaval in Pakistan »
Hundreds of people have been detained .
Earlier in the day , Musharraf 's spokesman , Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan , said on Dubai - based GEO TV that parliamentary elections would be delayed indefinitely .
Aziz stressed that despite the emergency measure , Musharraf 's government is " committed to pursuing our parliamentary form of government " and " making sure elections are held . "
Before imposing the state of emergency , Musharraf had vowed to hold elections no later than January 15 .
The move has put the United States in a precarious position and has raised fears about widespread chaos in Pakistan , a nuclear nation .
Washington will review its financial aid package to Pakistan , its key anti-terrorism ally , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Sunday .
Watch Rice call the move to martial law a big problem »
But she noted that the situation is complicated because much of the billions of dollars sent to Pakistan fund anti-terrorism measures .
Washington was not consulted about Musharraf 's plan , Rice said , adding that she is " disappointed in his decision . "
The political turmoil comes ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on whether Musharraf 's recent re-election is legal .
Aziz said there could be " some timing difference " on the schedule for elections but affirmed the Pakistan leadership was still committed to democracy .
Meanwhile , up to 500 people had been arrested so far in a roundup of judges , lawyers and political activists , Aziz said .
About 1,500 are on a list of people to be arrested , according to police sources and witnesses .
Among the political activists arrested is Gen. Hameed Gull , the former head of the ISI , the Pakistani intelligence service , police officials told CNN .
In the wake of Saturday 's declaration , the government also issued new rules forbidding newspapers and broadcasters from expressing opinions prejudicial to " the ideology of Pakistan or integrity of Pakistan " .
In response to questions on the measures taken by the Pakistan government against the media , Aziz said the media would have to abide by a new " code of conduct . "
He insisted that the code was not designed to curb dissent and that " constructive criticism is welcome . "
Musharraf declared a state of emergency ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on whether his recent re-election to the presidency was valid .
Bhutto , a former prime minister , said Musharraf is sending the wrong message .
" At a time when he should be demonstrating to our country and the world his seriousness in allowing free , fair and transparent elections , he has declared martial law , " Bhutto wrote in the commentary for CNN .
A victory for Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party in parliamentary elections would give her a chance to win a third term as prime minister .
Looking ahead to the next vote , Bhutto urged Musharraf to put in place an " election monitoring mechanism ... that can guarantee the sanctity of the ballot and allows election experts to conduct exit polls to ensure that the counting reflects the voting . "
" It is time ... for reconciliation to truly begin that will allow for the mobilization of the moderate majority of my nation and the marginalization of militants , fanatics and extremists , " she wrote .
Bhutto , who ended eight years of self - imposed exile when she arrived in Pakistan last month , said Musharraf 's declaration probably stemmed from fear that the high court might not certify the October presidential results in which he garnered a vast majority of the votes .
The Supreme Court was considering legal challenges filed by the opposition questioning Musharraf 's eligibility to hold office .
" Now , I can understand that he might have had difficulty in accepting the verdict of the Supreme Court , but one has to accept the ruling of a court , " she said .
Watch Bhutto call the developments in Pakistan a big setback »
Under the constitution , Musharraf was ineligible for run for another term while serving both as president and military leader .
However , the court allowed the election to go ahead , saying it would decide the issue later .
Since then , Pakistan has been in a state of political limbo while the Supreme Court tackled legal challenges filed by the opposition that question Musharraf 's eligibility to hold office .
Some speculated that a declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court is planning to rule against Musharraf .
Musharraf has stated repeatedly that he will step down as military leader before retaking the presidential oath of office on November 15 .

All About Pervez Musharraf • Pakistan
Back in 1988 , there was an impressive chess festival in the small industrial town of Saint John , Canada .
Two large and very strong Open tournaments were combined with the complete set of seven Candidates matches in the World Championship cycle of the time ( Karpov was to join the seven winners ) .
The English contingent were all on good terms and in good cheer ( Nigel Short was making mincemeat of Sax in his match , likewise Jon Speelman of Seirawan ) and usually formed , combined with certain selected  foreigners  ( like Spassky ) , a massive eating party which the local restaurants struggled to accommodate .
I have a fair recall of the conversation on one such evening .
Nigel Short was asked what he thought his IQ was .
He was not sure , but ( far too modestly ) proposed 130 or 140 .
John Nunn , his second , suggested that with a little training , Nigel could knock his score up to at least 160 .
Speelman was not impressed by IQ tests generally , and everybody saw the inadequacy of any test which depended on how much practice you had had at the type of questions involved .
At this point , some bright spark ( me ) suggested that it might be a better measure of intelligence to do two tests and see how much the person improved .
Quick as a flash , Nigel replied that this was a very bad idea since you could do deliberately badly in the first test !
It took me a few seconds to grasp his meaning - that you could artificially inflate the difference in your scores and thus score better in the proposed test .
Everybody was fairly impressed by this quick and crafty answer and the conversation moved on .
The story illustrates something important about the nature of the chess mind - how good it is at short cuts ( no pun intended ) and tricky ways round things .
Mathematicians are usually less devious in their thinking - it is important to find direct ways to prove things .
There is a story about a Turkish reformer who wanted to discourage women from wearing the veil .
Instead of attempting to forbid it directly ( the mathematicians approach ) , he issued a decree that all prostitutes must wear veils .
This indirect trick proved the workable , effective way to his objective and shows the sort of thinking which chessplayers are often rather good at .
In chess too , it is the result that counts , not how correctly it is derived .
 Players  like to try things out , and not to study other peoples work diligently .
Chessplayers are good thinkers but not always good students , as many university dons have found to their annoyance !
I discussed what is meant by intelligence at the start of the book ( just after the introduction ) , and later gave it as a typical characteristic of the chess genius , but so far I have not really answered the question : how strong is the connection between chess ability and IQ ?.
There are many reasons , some of them simply common sense , to believe that the two are strongly correlated .
( A correlation of zero means that two things are entirely independent ; a correlation of one means they are entirely related or dependent on one another .
Mathematically speaking , all things are correlated somewhere between zero and one . )
De Groot considered several of these reasons , and the next paragraph summarises some of his conclusions .
Spatial intelligence - especially the ability to perceive possibilities for movement - is clearly crucial to chess thinking , as is the capacity to build up a system of knowledge ( knowing that ) and experience ( knowing how ) .
This system must be stored ( memory ) and well managed - rules , analogies and operating principles must be constantly abstracted , adapted and improved ( perhaps not always on a conscious level ) .
Chess thinking often involves a complex , hierarchical structure of problems and sub-problems , and the capacity for retaining such complex structures of data ( not getting confused ) , and for keeping objectives clear and well organised , all correlate with having a high IQ .
Before offering , very tentatively , my equation linking potential chess strength with IQ , I would like to say a little more about the IQ scale .
Assuming , somewhat incorrectly as pointed out earlier ( and it is true that from a false assumption you can deduce anything , but this sort of false assumption should be seen as just an inaccurate approximation ) , that intelligence follows the normal distribution ( mean 100 , standard deviation 15 ) , then how many really bright people would there be ?
The mathematical / statistical implications would be as follows :
16 % above 115 ; 2.3 % above 130 ; 0.13 % above 145 and 0.003 % above 160 .
This would correspond to there being approximately the following numbers of people above the given levels in England :
1,150,000 above 130 ; 65,000 above 145 and 1500 above 160 .
This should give you a fair idea of the way the normal distribution works , though remember that these are underestimates of the actual numbers .
It is very difficult to generalise about the type of characteristics people have at different levels of intelligence .
The following attempt to do so , an excerpt from Choice Mathematics ( book one ) by Kevin of the Teachers , is certainly quite provocative :  There appears to be a hierarchy of abilities and traits in those of high intelligence as follows , suggesting an order for teaching intelligence .
IQ ( S.D. = 15 ) Attributes 185 High natural neuro - kinesthetic control ; high curiosity drive ; anti trivia ; in a hurry 180 New creation 175 Knows intelligent ( and right ! )
165 Formalisation ; beginnings of self confidence ; less hiding 160 Interest in logic ; paranoia ; minor creation ; recognises good work ; art ; music 150 Trivial formalisation 145 Below this level and often above is everywhere found a slavery to conditioning 
If this is true , then I guess all us slaves to our conditioning had better hope that the conditioning is good conditioning !
Now that the vast majority of readers are feeling suitably outraged , it is time to present the  Levitt Equation .
I stress that this equation is subject to a number of reservations and should not be taken too seriously .
I have been in the financial and political world for nearly 40 years .
I have dealt with the most powerful political and business people during that time .
That experience was enhanced by founding Air America Radio and Nova M Radio .
For many years I used to be able to rely on what is called the " prudent man rule . "
An alternative to this is referred to as the " rational adversary " concept .
In political terms , the USSR was the best example of the " rational adversary . "
Even totalitarian nations generally have a survival instinct .
Yesterday I watched the PBS Frontline episode about Iran .
Most people do not know as was pointed out in the episode that Iran condemned 911 and helped us overthrow the Taliban in 2002 .
Iran had a reformer as its president who was reaching out to the US until the famous " axis of evil " speech by Bush in 2002 .
Despite that , the Iranian president sent through the Swiss channel an offer of a lasting piece with Iran and a cessation of their nuclear program and aggressive attitude towards Israel .
Unfortunately for US , Bush did not respond because he was determined to invade Iraq and ultimately if successful do the same to Iran .
This was a blunder of monumental proportions to our national security and the stability of the region .
Now that the Bush Administration is going into its last year , it would seem that they would be more willing to salvage some legacy .
This would be true for any rational administration .
But , as I have learned painfully in the last few years , the " prudent man rule " and the " rational adversary " theory are becoming less reliable .
I have coined a term for this : " insanity is trump . "
You can throw away the rule book for the Bush Administration because he and Cheney have lost their minds .
We are dealing with desperate wounded irrational people in those two .
And that is cause for great alarm to those in the Democratic leadership that believe that they can ride out the storm until January 20 , 2009 .
They cannot and human survival is in jeopardy if they do .
Bush once flubbed on a an old saying .
" Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice , shame on me . "
That is exactly the way I feel about the Democrats and those who voted with Bush on the recent Iran condemnation in the Senate .
Any prudent Democrat should now know that this President is unbalanced and is dangerous to US and himself .
That is why the Democrats have to stop playing politics with Bush .
He is irrational and cannot be moved .
The idea of winning the 2008 Presidential election by riding this out is not reasonable given this irrational adversary .
They have to move now to de-fund the war in Iraq no matter what the perceived political cost .
I personally believe that de-funding the war would actually strengthen the Democrats politically .
That was what the 2006 voters wanted .
It is time for the Dems to stop being naive and understand that " insanity is trump . "

( CNN ) -- A Saudi Arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang - raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case .
Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim .
The attorney , Abdulrahman al - Lahim , had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the Saudi - controlled media about the case , al - Lahim told CNN .
The judge more than doubled the sentence against al - Lahim 's 19 - year - old client because she spoke to the media about the case , a court source told Arab News , an English - language Middle Eastern daily newspaper .
The woman -- who was initially sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law .
" We were shocked , " al - Lahim said of the increased sentence .
CNN has been unable to reach Saudi government officials for comment on this report , despite repeated requests .
Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim »
Al - Lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty , but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences , which had been two to three years , to two to nine years , al - Lahim said .
The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups .
" Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , " said Fawzeyah al - Oyouni , founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women 's Rights .
" This is not just about the girl , it 's about every woman in Saudi Arabia , " she said .
" We 're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there .
We 're afraid of going out in the streets . "
Human Rights
Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah " to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . "
The woman , who is married , and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago , the lawyer said .
The male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison , al - Lahim said .
The man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al - Lahim .
Citing phone records from the police investigation , al - Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client .
He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position .
Al - Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day .
It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law .
Al - Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month , where he faces a possible three - year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch .

Saudi court ups punishment for gang - rape victim Saudi King's U.K. visit draws protests
He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al - Sheikh .
" Currently she does n't have a lawyer , and I feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , " he said .
" We will not accept this judgment and I 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . "
He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month .
" The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , " he said .
Saudi Arabia 's Islamic law or sharia is not written and , therefore , subject to a wide array of interpretations .
Human Rights
Watch points out that a judge in Jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the Ismaili faith , a branch of Shia Islam .
Under Saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery .
Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote .
The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women 's rights and creation of a human rights commission .
Christoph Wilcke of Human Rights
Watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case , which he said may be indicative of " many injustices that we still do n't know about . "
" It 's not only one court , it is the Saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who 's been raped [ and ] punishing the lawyer who 's trying to help her and doing that both because they 've spoken to the media , " Wilcke told CNN .
" And if they had n't spoken to the media , we would n't know about it . "
Shying away from criticism of key ally , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the case and the punishment " surprising " and " astonishing . "
" While this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country , still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation , I think most people would be quite astonished by the situation , " McCormack said .
" I can't get involved in specific court cases in Saudi Arabia dealing with its own citizens .
But most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out , " he said .

Back in 2006 , Joanna Rutkowska made waves by announcing she 'd developed a malware creation system she dubbed the " Blue Pill . "
Rutkowska , who worked for the Singapore - based security firm COSEINC , claimed to have developed a method for creating 100 % undectable malware by using AMD 's Pacifica virtualization technology .
Now , statements from Rutkowska on the subject of Blue Pill 's detectability seem to indicate that keeping the hypervisor rootkit completely undetectable has been far more difficult than originally anticipated , though this difficulty may have been exacerbated by her move from COSEINC to her self - founded Invisible Things Lab .
Fast forward a year , and security researchers Tom Ptacek , Nate Lawson , Peter Ferrie , and Dino Dai Zovi ( from Motasano Security , Root Labs , and Symantec , respectively ) have challenged Rutkowska to a contest .
They 're collectively willing to bet that a hypervisor rootkit detector they 've written is capable of detecting Rutkowska 's " Blue Pill " and are offering her a chance to prove or disprove that hypothesis at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas later this summer .
Rutkowska 's response thus far has been that she 's interested in the contest , but that Blue Pill is n't ready for combat at this time .
In her InvisibleThings blog , she notes :
Our current Blue Pill has been in the development for only about 2 months ( please note that we do not have rights to use the previous version developed for COSEINC ) and it is more of a prototype , with primary use for our training in Vegas , rather then a " commercial grade rootkit " .
Rutkowska goes on to say that her new Blue Pill prototype would require " about six months ' full - time work by two people to turn it into such a commercial - grade creature that would win the contest described above .
We 're ready to do this , but we expect that somebody compensate us for the time spent on this work .
We would expect an industry standard fee for this work , which we estimate to be $ 200 USD per hour per person . "
It 's beginning to look like this is a battle royale we 'll never see , however .
Rutkowska says that her challengers should pay for the cost of the development , slyly arguing that her challengers should be able to find sponsorships for the event since they 're so sure they 've solved the problem .
Meanwhile , her challengers have taken her statements as proof that she 's unable to deliver a 100 % undetectable hypervisor rootkit .
Underneath the layers of e-peen , the point seems to be that developing undetectable malware / rootkits is difficult — significantly moreso , perhaps , than Rutkowska 's original announcement led people to believe .
This is no small matter because it has been suggested on several occasions that concepts like " Blue Pill " are the reasons why Microsoft is afraid to let consumers virtualize Vista Home Basic and Premium .
The possibility that malware could exploit a hypervisor and remain undetectable appears to be more theory than praxis for now .
0:36 Intro .
When economists try to explain bad policies , they look at special interest groups .
Caplan 's view : public opinion data suggests policies like the seal tariff are extremely popular .
Not just special interest group .
Big press conferences held by special interest groups suggests that they want votes .
Special interests are not so much sneaking things past the voters as saying out of all the things the voters are willing to support , what helps them [ the special interest group ] the most .
Persuade along the margin .
So , democracy works well , politicians give voters what they want ; but what people want is not really good , not even for themselves .
Farm subsidies example : equally popular in farm and non-farm states .
Pew poll suggested that people agree with statement that farm subsidies are necessary to guarantee the food supply .
Economists , on the other hand , see farm subsidies as wasteful and unnecessary to guarantee food supply .
Puzzle is :
Why are economists not listened to ?
One hypothesis : people just have n't thought about it .
But even when well - explained , economists ' analyses are not persuasive or interesting to many people .
6:12 Alternative hypothesis : People generally get some psychological benefits out of believing the world is the way they like to see it , they feel comfortable with that view , fit in with society ; and to challenge that view would be painful for them .
Minimum wage example : Economist at picnic explained why minimum wage might harm the very people it 's trying to help by discouraging hiring , only to have fellow picnickers edge away from him .
Why do bad ideas persist ?
Cover of book is bunch of sheep ; Robin Hanson said that was too optimistic !
Sheep could converge on good idea ; but around the world and over time , there is a persistent tendency to select economically bad policies .
Over time and across countries , stories seem very similar .
Bastiat in France , Adam Smith in England , Böhm - Bawerk talking about interest during the ancient Israelites .
Biological , evolutionary stories .
Paul Rubin , Southern Economic Journal , " Folk Economics . "
Persistent anti-foreign bias .
Not a large percent of U.S. budget , but evolutionary story may explain some of it .
On the savannah , the appearance of another tribe - - you'd have to be pretty naive to see that as an opportunity for advantages of more trading opportunities .
What it realistically meant was competition over a fixed pool of animals in the short term ; and the possibility of inter - group violence .
Those concerns might evolutionarily overpower the gains from trade .
But we 've transferred that fear of foreigners in primitive conditions to the Toyota dealership , even though we do n't think the Toyota dealership will put a spear through our windows .
But the economic metaphor of stealing our jobs , stealing our wealth is used .
11:50 Anti-market bias : General public tends to underestimate the social benefits of relying on the market .
People look at the intentions and see that they are out to make money , they are greedy .
This is true : waitress , business ; but it 's not what we want our mothers to act on .
But what economists have been saying since Adam Smith is that we should think twice , just because someone 's intentions are self - interested does not mean that the consequences for society will be bad .
Competition forces the seller to become empathetic ( while not necessarily sympathetic ) .
Put yourself in the shoes of the person running a business .
All the same , economists have a radically different view from the public at large .
Make - work bias .
Bastiat called it Sisyphism , after Sisyphus , Greek mythological figure , who was doomed in Hades to push a boulder up a hill , only to have it roll back on reaching the top .
Sisyphus was fully employed .
But it 's not productive economically to see employment as better than production .
In 19th century there was plenty of employment , long hours ; but living standard was miserable .
Even if we had redistributed the production of the 19th century economy equally with no loss on incentives or production , we 'd still be tremendously poorer in the 19th century than today .
Growth of the economy has much greater benefits than forced redistribution .
If you go to a poor country in Africa , some people are much wealthier than others , but if you equally divided the produce , the people would still be extremely poor .
Anything that lowers employment , though , is looked on by the public as bad , specifically trade and technology -- which have widespread economic benefits .
20:29 Pessimistic bias .
Less evidence that it is cross-cultural , but in U.S. people tend to think the economy is in decline and will get worse , relative to what economists think .
Russ :
Asking people what is the change in our standard of living since 1900 typically gets median answer is 50 % increase , with 10 - 20 % of the audience thinking our standard of living is actually lower today .
While this is actually a hard question to answer accurately , it is easily at least 5 times higher , probably 10 times higher , could even argue 30 times higher ; but only 50 % higher is a very downwardly - biased answer .
Unreasonably pessimistic answer is reported by general public .
But when the crowd is misinformed , aggregation methods of gathering information are biased .
Betting markets — prediction markets — would give better answer because uninformed people would stay out of the market .
24:57 Maybe economists are wrong .
Maybe foreigners are dangerous , trade hurts our economy , employment is crucial , trade is a 0 - sum game , etc .
How do we know economists are right and the public is wrong ?
If that 's what you think , go read an Econ 101 textbook .
Anyone who , with a calm spirit , gives a basic economic textbook a fair reading would come away , would come away thinking otherwise .
People do n't even know what economists think .
Why do n't they know ?
So hyper , so upset that they are unable to sit and listen to someone else .
Caplan exam question :
Find one thing Caplan said that is least defensible and tell me why I 'm wrong .
When experts and laymen disagree , the expert is usually right is the presumption - - auto mechanics .
Not always true -- astrologists .
In the case of economics experts , there are two common theories about why economists should not be trusted : 1 . They are rich , they are white , they are male , they have job security -- self - serving bias ; and 2 .
They are a bunch of ultra-conservative Republicans and therefore they think all these crazy things -- ideological bias .
Problem with these two stories : they are testable .
Kaiser Family Foundation data set addresses self - serving bias :
When you control for all these variables that you think will sway a person 's beliefs ( income , gender , race , income growth , etc. ) , belief gap between economists and the public is reduced by at most 18 % .
Ideological bias cannot possibly work because the typical economist is moderate Democrats .
( George Mason U. is unusual . )
The typical economist is in fact a moderate Democrat who thinks that downsizing is good for the economy , also that supply and demand determines the price of gas .
Controlling for ideology slightly increases the gap between the economist and public because political views suggest economist should be anti-market , but he is not .
31:50 Claim is that the study of economics and the identification of oneself as an economist creates a result that economists have very different views than the average person .
Economists are much more likely to see the benefits of trade , immigration , markets , wealth creation and exchange are positive sum rather than 0 - sum game .
Question is :
If voters have this world view that is very different from economists , biased , what does that imply for what politicians will support and put in place ?
Price controls after hurricane example .
Public thinks we should impose price controls .
You could give a lecture , showing supply and demand and how price controls create shortages and free market brings in needed goods .
Politicians are more likely to look into the camera and say , " We must do something to keep speculators to keep from exploiting human suffering . "
When trying to win support , winning strategy is to say you favor what is desired by public and be very passionate about it rather than explain the economics .
In private markets , say , market for cars , if I have four kids and I decide to buy a Cooper MINI I 'd soon find that that was not so good for my situation , so I 'd probably trade it in for a mini van .
I 'd learn from my mistakes .
Is n't it the same in politics -- politicians who pursue bad policies can be thrown out , election works as a form of competition so really stupid policies should be rooted out .
Why does n't that happen ?
Have to understand what politicians are competing about .
Have first to understand who is responsible : Can scapegoat a politician who has very little to do about a particular policy .
Politicians spend a lot of time talking about policies per se : legalizing drugs vs. crime rate example .
If voters evaluate politicians based on policies they like or do n't like as opposed to results , politicians will persistently deliver bad policies .
Pharmaceutical industry example .
Most Americans like pharmaceutical innovation for their health and the future health of their children and grandchildren ; but they also like the government to regulate the safety of drugs .
Claim is that most people prefer to give up the benefits because they just like the policy -- the FDA .
Gun control .
" To the public , it appears that merely getting legislation passed equals a result . "
Politician who says he cares about results may only care about policy .
41:31 Is it hard to get evidence on the efficacy of particular policies ?
Is real world just too complex ?
Not so .
If world was so complex , rational strategy is not to be so dogmatically support a particular policy , but to be agnostic , to simply say you do n't know the answer , not to scoot away on the picnic blanket in the face of discussion .
History of ancient Assyria -- if someone told me Babylon was the capital , I would n't say " You do n't know what you 're talking about . "
Even if it seemed that someone had an agenda , I would n't insist on believing the opposite ; I 'd just say that I 'd have to think about it .
In that kind of world , most voters -- the unknowledgeable - - would split 50 - 50 , and policy would be determined by those who had read the economics textbook .
But that 's not what happens .
People think they know the answer , vehemently , and generally they seem to gravitate toward the views that economists know are wrong .
When debating with someone who disagrees with you , economists have to work hard to be civil and not offend the person .
But why ?
Why is n't everyone just fascinated or interested in the discussion ?
Analogy between religion and politics : politics is the religion of modernity .
Dogmatism .
People get agitated if you try to find out beliefs .
But this is not a good way to find out truth .
The God That Failed , book of autobiographies of ex-communists .
Koestler , Crossman .
Everyone reports that it was painful to change their minds .
Have to admit you were wrong .
Psychological pain , psychological switching cost .
47:48 Once you realize there is this psychological pain .
Suppose a person could change policy .
Trade - off could be weighed : higher standard of living vs. painfulness of change .
Aside : people vote not just in their own self - interest , which would seem to be a good thing .
Suppose surgeon believes he can operate well on people even when drunk .
Gratifying belief but very high cost , so he 'd probably ruin his career or revise his belief quickly .
But voter -- what are odds he will change the policy by changing his vote ?
Zero .
In most elections , your vote does n't matter much .
Most elections are usually not a tie , so your vote is not decisive .
Not like three people over lunch .
Suppose there is a small chance you could improve your situation by being more rational about economics , but suppose it 's psychologically painful , you could become a pariah - - not a good deal , in terms of your self - interest .
If you are completely rational about a subject , you are exposing it to reputation , taking risks .
If you are unreasonable , your beliefs are safe .
You do n't have to worry about new facts coming along and proving you wrong .
People are more open - minded , more reasonable about questions with high cost of being wrong .
You have to keep an open mind on whether a block of stone will fall on you but immigration and open borders less critical .
Pat Buchanan , blockading China .
Not just complexity : you can't directly see it with your eyes , truth at conceptual level vs. perceptual level , Ayn Rand .
54:05 Free-riding problem .
I do n't have the incentive to vote wisely , so I 'm not going to vote wisely .
Air-quality , masks , Cairo , Mexico City example .
Suppose you see someone getting into a car and polluting .
Does it make sense to say " You fool , look how much you are hurting yourself ! "
No . Quality of air depends on average , one person does n't make much of a difference , tragedy of the commons , externality .
" Irrationality is political pollution . "
One person does n't tilt the scales , but if millions and millions of people do it , it affects policy .
Losses are spread out over many people .
If you had two countries , one with free trade mandated in the Constitution , the other puts it up for a vote , you could easily have people voting for protectionism , being unhappy with the results , and then fleeing for the country that has free trade .
Mexico : Politician coming along proposing reforms to make it more like the United States is unlikely , but people would prefer to live in the U.S. Person is willing to vote for a society he would n't want to live in , and then physically turn his back on the society he voted for in exchange for a few thousand dollars .
Psychological cost to bucking national traditions , turning one 's back on what makes his country distinct , but is willing to move to make himself better off .
I 'm willing to move to the United States if it makes me rich , but to vote for a good policy that would only make me rich if everyone else voted for it is not worth it to me .
Quite possible for a person to be quite rational in some areas of life -- when there is not cost -- but irrational in other areas of life .
In those areas where putting on their thinking cap would not change the outcome very much , they indulge in irrationality .
1:00:22 People are irrational about their economic world view , political system indulges it , and politicians cater to it because they want to stay in office .
Why do n't we have more protectionism ?
Why are we out of the stone age ?
Economy does grow every year despite lots of regulation and certainly by historical standards .
Why are we over - achieving relative to what you 'd expect a democracy to do ?
Voter turnout : those who vote are not representative of population .
Age and education are good predictors of voting ; but only education is a good predictor of thinking like an economist .
( Note : Universities are not reliable samples for measuring education . )
So people politicians have to appeal to are relatively reasonable .
Second , there is something to view that if the economy tanks and there is a terrible war , it hurts politicians ' popularity .
Does n't mean politician should adopt unpopular views .
Have to strike a balance between doing what 's popular and doing what works .
Net effect of doing what voters ask for could be to hurt you .
Nixon 's wage and price controls hurt economic performance but the policy was extremely popular .
Gray Davis , governor of California , gave people what they asked for but was thrown out .
Side - agreements on laws may not be enforced .
He rented an apartment for his wife and children , and then traveled to Lebanon .
There , he applied for refugee status , encouraged by an announcement by American officials that immigration quotas for Iraqis would be raised , but ran out of money after waiting months for his application to be processed .
Unable to work in Lebanon legally , and faced with a choice of bringing his wife and children into poverty there , or living apart in Iraq , he decided to return to Iraq , forfeiting his application .
Now he lives on the third floor of a cheap motel in a poor neighborhood in Baghdad , away from his wife and children .
He sleeps on a thin foam mattress and padlocks his door at night .
“ My economic situation controls me , ” he said .
“ I have nothing now . ”
The squat , dingy , five - story motel is filled with Iraqis leading double or even triple lives .
There are many varieties : Police officers who encountered trouble in their neighborhoods , interpreters for the American military , and laborers like Hamed .
They pay $ 80 a month for a room .
Almost everyone there is someone else .
Hamed shares his small room with his brother , who tells residents that he works in an electrical shop .
Another resident , Felah , a 42 - year - old former sports coach who works at the same American base as Hamed , says that he is a carpenter .
He says he works for a company that makes desks for schools , a story he chose because he had some carpentry experience and could bluff if confronted .
Each detail of his life must match .
He portrays a scar on his hand , from when he tried to free an American soldier whose leg was trapped under a forklift , as a wound from a wood sander .
His cover was threatened when an elderly resident asked him to repair a bed .
Felah liked the man and handled the task well , but that only invited another request : Could he make a table ?
Busy with his job at the base managing an Iraqi work team , and not skilled enough in carpentry , Felah decided against taking the job , but could not tell the man .
“ I ’m thinking to go buy this from a store , and tell him , ‘ I made this for you , ’ ” he said .
“ Our life , it makes you laugh , but it ’s a tragedy , ” said Felah , a bowlegged Shiite man with a tired look , who has lost six close relatives , including a brother , to Sunni militants , and whose wife and children have been forbidden to see him by a bitterly sectarian father - in - law .
“ We feel that we are not telling the truth , but what can we do ? ”

All morning , Google Calendar has looked different than it usually does .
I believe I have some appointments today , but I do n’t know when they are or who they are with .
Sometimes , even mighty Google is no match for that free calendar , complete with recipes , sitting on my fridge at home .
Unfortunately , it ’s at home .
Not that it really matters , since it does n’t have any of my appointments on it .
They ’re all sitting somewhere behind that 404 page .
Recently we had a conversation about where we ranked among science sites .
There are a few measurement services out there , and they all give different numbers ( none of which are truly accurate ) plus they all seem to have their own method for determining ' reach ' that goes beyond simple traffic .
We decided to compare all the science sites , including ones that are doing different things like articles , blogging and news releases , against each other , using the results from two traffic ranking services , one opt - in popularity service and one service that measures inbound links .
We used traffic rankings first , assuming that they are going to be reasonably inaccurate for everyone the same way .
They wo n't be 50 % high for one site and 50 % low for another and using two balances out the inequities .
One service listed both US and international numbers for a few sites and only US numbers for the vast majority , so we used the US numbers for all to stay fair .
We used four methods of reach because any deficiencies in one measurement are likely balanced out in another .
A site with few Technorati links , for example , may have a lot of traffic but may not have bloggers linking back to their articles while Alexa was only available for Internet Explorer until recently so that limited their usage .
We used Compete.com and Quantcast.com for traffic , Alexa.com for general reach and Technorati.com for links .
We understand that each one of these probably has detractors .
We gathered the pool of science sites by asking everyone we know what they read .
Some had to be eliminated because we can't get individual traffic numbers .
Example : we like " > Nova and " > Tierney Lab but their URLs resolve to PBS and the NY Times in traffic measuring services so they were excluded .
That goes for a lot of sites that resolve to the NIH too .
Each rating service total provided a score between 1 and 100 for each site based on the numeric values they provided .
The lowest site received 1 and the highest 100 with all others getting points in even increments between them .
Here , at the end , whittled from 48 at the start to the top 20 ( including a few surprises ) , are the most popular science sites out there .
And we did n't even make the list !

On 6 January earlier this year , one of the strongest thunderstorms in livin ’ memory a-crashed and a -roared its way across the Sea of Japan , rattlin the daylights outta the Kashiwazaki - Kariwa nuclear power plant on the coast .
This power plant is fitted with one of the most advanced radiation detectors on the planet and durin ’ the storm it collected some extraordinary data .
After a lil number crunchin , a team of physicists led Kazuo “ Tiger ” Makishima at the Cosmic Radiation Lab RIKEN , are publishing details of what they saw .
That night the nuclear power station was bombarded with gamma rays with energies of at least 10 MeV ( that was the limit of the detectors ) .
Now gamma rays bursts ai n’t commonly detected on the ground cos they ain’t easy to make ( if you spot any it ’s a good sign your local nuclear power station ai n’t workin properly .
It ’s also why n- plants have the kit to detect ’em ) .
The RIKEN team says the gamma rays were probably caused by the sudden deceleration of high energy electrons as they smashed into atoms in the thunderclouds above , forcing the electrons to given up their energy in the form of gamma ray photons .
But how did the electrons get accelerated to energies of 10 MeV or higher ?
That ’s a bit of mystery cos our ground - based accelerators require a near perfect vacuum to get particles a -movin and a - groovin at any kinda decent energy .
Without a vacuum , particles start a - crashin and a - bangin into atoms and molecules in the air before they can get going .
Thunderclouds are known to have hugely powerful electric fields of more than 400 kiloVolts per meter so getting to 10 MeV from scratch requires quite a few metres of acceleration .
Unless the electrons start off with a fairly high energy , that is .
The RIKEN team speculates that the gamma ray bursts in the thunderstorm were triggered by cosmic rays– high energy particles from outta space that come a -smashin and a - bargin their way through the atmosphere , creatin a shower of energetic electrons in their wake , a well known phenomenon .
So it ’s quite possible that high energy electrons were created by a cosmic ray shower in the thundercloud and then accelerated to even higher energies by the electric field .
That seems to be backed up , at least in part , by the fact that the gamma ray bursts did not occur at the same time as visible lightning strikes so the mechanism behind that kinda discharge do n’t seem to be responsible .
Fascinatin ’ stuff , huh ?

AK - 47 assault rifles might have ended up in insurgents ' hands
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) says the Pentagon cannot track about 30 % of the weapons distributed in Iraq over the past three years .
The Pentagon did not dispute the figures , but said it was reviewing arms deliveries procedures .
About $ 19.2 bn has been spent by the US since 2003 on Iraqi security forces .
GAO , the investigative arm of the US Congress , said at least $ 2.8 bn of this money was used to buy and deliver weapons and other equipment .
Correspondents say it is now feared many of the weapons are being used against US forces on the ground in Iraq .
The Iraqi interior ministry has blamed the Americans for the disappearance of the weapons .
A spokesman , Brigadier General Abd- al - Karim Khalaf , told the BBC his ministry had not been consulted over the distribution .
He also said there was no evidence to suggest that insurgents might have got hold of some of the weapons .
Discrepancies
The GAO said weapons distribution was haphazard and rushed and failed to follow established procedures , particularly from 2004 to 2005 .
MISSING IN IRAQ AK - 47 rifles : 110,000 Pistols : 80,000 Body armour pieces : 135,000 Helmets : 115,000
During this period , security training was led by Gen David Petraeus , who now commands all US forces in Iraq .
The GAO reached the estimate - 111,000 missing AK - 47s and 80,000 missing pistols - by comparing the property records of the Multi-National Security Transition Command for Iraq against records maintained by Gen Petraeus of the arms and equipment he ordered .
Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary Mark Kimmitt told AFP the Pentagon was " reviewing policies and procedures to ensure US - funded equipment reaches the intended Iraqi security forces under the Iraq program " .
Weapons delay
The report comes as a political battle rages in Washington over the progress of the war in Iraq .
Gen Petraeus and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker are scheduled to report to Congress by mid-September on the success of efforts to halt sectarian violence and return Iraq to viable self - governance .
Meanwhile , at the end of July , the US Defence Department admitted that the US - led coalition in Iraq had failed to deliver nearly two - thirds of the equipment it promised to Iraq 's army .
The Pentagon said only 14.5 m of the nearly 40 m items of equipment ordered by the Iraqi army had been provided .
The US military commander in charge of training in Iraq has asked for help in speeding up the transfer of equipment .
Iraq 's ambassador to the US said the delays were hindering the fighting capacity of its armed forces .
One of the factors that separated Ken Burn 's recent opus on World War II from the horde of ever - sombre celluloid reliquaries that fill the cable channels was the focus on events on the home front .
A thousand things -- some tiny , others far from it -- reminded even those who never donned a uniform that their nation was at war .
There were the kids who collected rubber , and blackouts at night .
There were nickels that were n't nickel because that metal was needed for the war , and automobile factories filled with women welding together aircraft .
There was a shortage of sugar on the table , and gold stars in windows .
It was hard for any American to go a day , or even an hour , without encountering some sacrifice being made for the war .
In our own struggle -- the messy , uncoordinated scramble some political pundits on the right have been quick to dub " World War III " ( or even " World War IV " ) -- many people have been struck by the idea that we are being asked for no sacrifices on the home front .
We drop some supplies in the " Any Soldier " box at church .
We sympathize with friends , relatives , and co-workers asked to go to Iraq again .
And again .
But those of us without a uniform in this fight have been asked to sacrifice by ... shopping .
Honestly , if Iraq and Afghanistan were to fall into the great abyss of media forgetfulness ( the one that readily swallowed New Orleans ) , would we know we were " a nation at war ? "
But the truth is , we are being asked to make sacrifices .
We 're being asked to sacrifice privacy in all our communications .
We 've been asked to sacrifice morality .
We 're being asked to ransom the future of our children to pay for the national shopping spree in Iraq .
Many of the sacrifices of World War II were open , shared , and in a sense , unifying .
The sacrifices of today are secret sacrifices , hidden losses , that pit Americans against each other not by accident , but by design .
Perhaps the greatest sacrifice we 've made on the home front is simply one of depleted attention given to things not Iraq .
We all have only so many hours in our day .
We all have a limited quantity of outrage we can express , before that outrage sours into ennui .
I do n't want to imply that the invasion in Iraq was plotted only as a distraction , but it is a distraction .
And while we 've kept so much of our attention focused over there , others have taken advantage of that distraction .
For the last two weeks , I 've been writing almost daily about the struggle to save the Appalachian Mountains from the depredations of mountaintop removal ( and I 'm about to do so again , so if you 're disinclined to follow , this is a good place to get off ) .
Is mountaintop removal the most important issue before us ?
It is , if your house is located next to a mine setting off blasts on the same scale as a small nuclear weapon .
It is if you live in a town wedged into a narrow Appalachian valley , downstream from a leaking dam made from piles of mud and rubble .
But for most of us , even those of us who care deeply about environmental issues , mountaintop removal has taken a backseat to Iraq .
And those who want to expand mountaintop removal know it .
That 's why the Bush administration has chosen this moment to relax the rules on mountaintop removal mining .
They 're convinced that they can slip this change in now , hand out permits like candy , and have the mountains down before you 've taken your eyes off the news from Anbar province .
As I 've put out the diaries on this subject for the last fifteen days , almost every day has been greeted by at least one comment saying that this issue was n't important , that it is only a distraction from Iraq .
I agree .
It is .
But dammit , we 're going to have to learn to split our attention , to remain engaged in Iraq , but to still worry about health care , and energy , and social justice , and the environment .
To paraphrase Our Glorious Leader , if we keep all our attention focused over there , they are going to whip our butts at home .
I just want to ask you to do two things this Sunday Morning .
First , go read this diary , which is undoubtedly the best dairy on this subject .
And for tomorrow , I want you to go shopping .
Shopping for more cosponsors for the Clean Water Protection Act , that is .
The Act now has 108 cosponsors , but more are needed to get it out of committee and up for vote .
Check the list to see if your representative is already on board .
If so , thank them and let them know this issue is important to you .
If not , it 's even more important that you contact them and tell them to sign on .
The struggle against ideological totalitarianism cannot be lost among the ruined cities of Iraq .
It ca n't be surrendered at gunpoint in Kabul .
It can only be lost on the home front .
Do n't start by handing over the mountains .

Frank Kakopa said he was worried about his wife and children
Frank Kakopa has been paid £ 7,500 after the Immigration Service wrongly held him in prison for two days .
Mr Kakopa , originally from Zimbabwe , was on a short break with his wife and young children in 2005 , when he was stopped at Belfast City Airport .
He had proof he lived in England but was still strip - searched and jailed .
His work manager had also confirmed both his legal residency and employment position .
Eileen Lavery from the Equality Commission said she had concerns over why Mr Kakopa was singled out and held in Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn , as he had " an enormous amount of documentation " .
" Why pick on him ?
Other than I think because he is black , " she said .
My wife and young children were left abandoned at the airport of a strange country worrying about where I was and how I was being treated
Frank Kakopa
His family were left at the airport and Mr Kakopa said he had no idea what had happened to them .
" They would n't allow me to make phone calls - I was actually detached from the world , " he said .
" I did not know where my kids were taken to .
" It is still difficult to believe that what was supposed to be a relaxing break for my family turned out to be our worst nightmare .
" I was locked up with convicted criminals , having committed no crime , while my wife and young children were left abandoned at the airport of a strange country worrying about where I was and how I was being treated . "
The Equality Commission took on the case alleging false imprisonment and discrimination .
In an out - of - court settlement , the Immigration Service admitted false imprisonment and apologised to Mr Kakopa and his family .
They also agreed to discuss their practices with the Equality Commission .
The Home Office said in a statement that it did not comment on individual cases .
Intelligence Director : US is intercepting ' billions ' of foreign communications David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 18 , 2007
Print This Email This Update : McConnell says 9/11 ' could have been prevented Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , which he invoked to justify expanding US spy powers , " could have been prevented " under existing laws if intelligence agencies had " connected the dots " in analyzing intelligence .
A 9/11 plotter in the United States was speaking to a known al Qaeda operative abroad , and the US failed to intercept the conversations , McConnell said , although Democrats reminded him of other indications of a pending attack that were missed .
" 9/11 should have and could have been prevented , " the intelligence director said .
He then posed the question , " What about when you have a foreign terrorist - a known terrorist - calls into the United States ? "
McConnell continued , answering himself , " We have a procedure to deal with that .
We would minimize it if a foreign terrorist calls in and there 's no intelligence value but , what I would highlight is that it might be - as it was in 9/11 - that might be the single most important call we get .
It might be to a sleeper cell .
It might be activating something . "
McConnell says number of Americans overheard small in comparison The United States ' top spy said American intelligence agencies are intercepting " billions " of conversations and e-mails abroad , but he would not say how many Americans have been inadvertently snared in this international warrantless wiretapping dragnet .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell would say only that the number of Americans overheard by National Intelligence Agency eavesdroppers was " small " in relation to the massive number of " transactions " intercepted from overseas targets .
" It 's a very small number considering that there are billions of transactions every day , " McConnell told the House Judiciary Committee Monday .
The US is spying on " thousands , potentially millions ( of ) potential targets of interest , " McConnell said later in the hearing .
Congress is beginning to consider another update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires intelligence agencies get a warrant before spying on Americans .
McConnell insisted that Americans were the " targets " of " wiretaps " without a court order , but he acknowledged that Americans phone calls inevitably were overheard when foreign intelligence targets were wiretapped .
In cases where spies picked up US - based conversations , " minimization " techniques were employed , and a warrant would be required to target the person in the United States -- whether or not he or she is an American citizen .
" Sir , I need to answer your question one more time , ' How many Americans ' phones have been tapped without a court order ? ' , and it's none , ' " McConnell said .
Rep. John Conyers , the Judiciary Committee 's chairman , tried to nail down specifics from McConnell , but the intelligence chief tried to maintain focus on the need to update the law to ease interception of foreign - to - foreign conversations , which Democrats and Republicans agree should not be subject to warrant requirements .
But in his closely parsed answers , McConnell seemed to say that in spying on foreign targets , US wiretaps pick up every conversation they make , including those that come into the US .
Later in the hearing , Rep. Dan Lungren , the committee 's top Republican , compared the minimization techniques to protocols used by the FBI in surveillance of organized crime suspects .
When the G - Men wiretap a suspected mobster 's phone they pick up every conversation , including to the local pizza place or dry cleaners , and they have to make sure not to listen too long to calls unrelated to criminal investigations .
McConnell did not dispute Lungren 's comparison .
Familiar faces disrupt hearing
At several points in Tuesday 's hearing -- McConnell 's first appearance before the Judiciary Committee -- protesters from the anti-war group Code Pink interrupted the proceedings with boisterous signs , chants and marches .
Conyers called the demonstrations " counterproductive , " but he did not move as quickly to have them removed as did Rep .
Ike Skelton ( D - MO ) during last week 's testimony from Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
" This is unfair and is not the kind of hearing I know you wish to conduct , " Lungren chastized Conyers in requesting the protesters be kicked out immediately .
At one point after Capitol Police removed several protesters , and Conyers warned others not to hold up signs , a dozen or so members of the group returned to the Capitol Hill hearing room and marched up and down the aisle shouting " save the constitution . "
" We implore you Mr. Conyers , open up impeachment , " said one of the demonstrators .
When they left Lungren joked , " I guess I do n't have to go to Disneyland this year . "

This video is from C - SPAN 3 , broadcast September 18 .
In the following video clip , Code Pink protesters interrupt hearing .
In the following video , CIA Director McConnell admits that the September 11th attacks could have been prevented .
With the release of the GAO report on Iraq coming out , and positioning in advance of next week well underway , you ’re likely to hear quite a few numbers being tossed around .
When it comes to the surge , keep in mind that even the encouraging news is not quite what it seems .
According to U.S. military figures , an average of 1,000 Iraqis have died each month since March in sectarian violence .
That compares with about 1,200 a month at the start of the security plan , the military said in an e-mailed response to queries .
This does not include deaths from car bombings , which the military said have numbered more than 2,600 this year .
What ’s more , Matt Yglesias notes , “ It seems that when a Shiite kills a Shiite ( as happens frequently in the south ) that does n’t count .
Similarly , when a Sunni kills a Sunni , that does n’t count .
Nor does it count when the death was caused by a car bomb since , obvious , well , um , I could n’t even say .
The exclusion of Shiite - on - Shiite and Sunni - on - Sunni violence seems like a clever - if - underhanded exploitation of critics ’ tendency to deploy the phrase “ sectarian violence ” even though there ’s a lot of politically motivated violence that is n’t sectarian in nature .
The car bomb exclusion seems entirely unprincipled . ”
UA Researchers Create Robot Driven by Moth's Brain
The research offers insights into the mechanism of the brain and how it works .
By Rebecca Ruiz - McGill , University Communications
In a notion taken from science fiction afficionados , University of Arizona researchers presented a robot that moves by using the brain impulses of a moth at the 37th annual Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego .
Charles M. Higgins , UA associate professor of electrical and computer engineering , and doctoral student Timothy Melano presented their findings and outlined the mechanics behind the robotâs movements .
The robotâs motion is guided by a tiny electrode implanted in the mothâs brain , Higgins said , specifically to a single neuron that is responsible for keeping the mothâs vision steady during flight .
The neuron transmits electrical signals which are then amplified in the robot's base and through a mathematical formula , a computer translates the signals into action , making the robot move .
The moth is immobilize inside a plastic tube mounted atop the 6 - inch - tall wheeled robot .
To get the moth to imitate flight , Higgins and his team placed the moth in its apparatus on a circular platform surrounded by a 14 - inch - high revolving wall painted with vertical stripes .
The moth 's neuron reacts to the movement of the stripes and the process begins .
The brain of a moth is about the size of a grain of rice .
Although small , âits compact size and simplicity allows for an efficient way to do brain research , â Higgins said .
' The underlying point in the creation of the robo - moth is the notion of advancing neuroscience , " he said .
The Society for Neuroscience meets annually to show advances made by scientists who work to study the architecture of the brain and use that knowledge in the design of new machines .
â Combining the study of machines and the mechanics of the human body has led to great advances that have direct health benefits such as the development of the mechanical heart .
Unfortunately , we are nowhere as advanced in our study of the brain as we are in the study of the heart , â  Higgins added .
â Scientists have reached a frustrating point in understanding the brain - we know how it operates , to an extent but donât know how to stop brain damage or repair it when it occurs.â 
Higgins said .
But that may change in the future .
Higgins has thus far been able to have robo - moth turn left or right but not forward or backward .
The longest recorded movement has been 88 seconds .
Higgins ' work is funded through grants from the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Air Force .
Both agencies granted funding to help gain an understanding of human visual operations .
Higgins ' research is a step toward a future in brain engineering that will help repair damage or replace lost brain functionality .

We know that on YouTube , anyone can post pretty much anything and although YouTube will remove most offensive materials , some will slip through the cracks unnoticed .
Now that YouTube Germany has launched , some sources express concern due to some extreme right - wing videos which can be found on YouTube but are illegal under German law .
While the source in question does not actually link to any such videos , it 's easy to imagine that extreme right videos can be found on YouTube , especially if one remembers that this is not the first time this story has surfaced .
First time around the videos in question were related to Blood and Honour , a neo -Nazi music promotion network , and an extreme right oriented heavy metal group called Landser .
YouTube supposedly did n't do much about this problem the first time around , but now that YouTube Germany is live , they might want to look into it more carefully to prevent possible clashes with the German laws and various activist groups that will no doubt react loudly to any Nazi- related materials .
It 's the one issue no environmentalist organisation wants to talk about .
Population .
Thirty years ago , when international concern first began to mobilise about the planet 's future , it was the pre-eminent question , but now you 're hard put to get a straight answer .
Does the UK need population management ?
Does the world need it ?
This is one of those issues that is regarded by many privately as common sense but rarely gets a public airing .
Of the environmental organisations I managed to contact , all acknowledged that it was frequently brought up by the public in meetings and letters .
Yet all said they did not campaign on the subject and had no position on it .
It seems that there is a worrying disconnect between a generally accepted consensus among those who shape the national conversation about the environment and their audiences , who either are much less certain or believe that , if the planet 's resources are being grossly depleted , there are just too many of us about .
Too many people .
That is certainly the impression from studying the maps published today by the Campaign to Protect Rural England , which chart how fast the areas of the country undisturbed by urban development , roads or other noise are disappearing .
Since the 60s , whole chunks of England have been broken up into small fragments , absorbed into a dense network of towns , cities and major roads .
The maps reinforce what people experience .
You try getting away from it all in England , and you are tangled in traffic jams , shoe - horned into campsites , followed by the whine of motor - bikes and the roar of traffic even up on the hills .
We live in a crowded island - a truth that it has become unacceptable to acknowledge because of the unpleasant associations it brings with it .
But England is now the second most densely populated country in Europe , after Belgium , and at current rates of increase it could be second only to Bangladesh in the world by 2074 .
There are those who argue that there 's no need for alarm , and that we can concentrate development in brownfield sites to accommodate all the millions of extra homes needed .
But how many more people can you squeeze into cities that already seem to be choking under the weight of their population density - the buses and trains packed , the streets clogged and the parks on a Sunday afternoon teeming with people .
It 's not surprising that environmental organisations fight shy of getting into this subject .
It embroils them in a host of deeply emotive and difficult debates .
Immigration for one .
Most of the UK population growth in the next few decades will be attributable to immigration .
Should we have a balanced migration policy with a net zero increase ?
Given how many British - born are emigrating to Australia , the US , Spain and France , it would still allow us to maintain our international responsibilities to provide asylum .
But it would n't allow us to absorb the same quantities of cheap east European labour that have subsidised our economic growth .
Population management is just as emotive .
People quickly bristle at the idea of any government telling them how many children they can have .
The whole policy area of population was given a bad name by India 's enthusiasm in the 70s and 80s when government programmes ensnared uncomprehending young men into having vasectomies .
But should the UK government pursue a policy of persuasion , a Stop at Two campaign , to bring people 's attention to the carbon footprint of having lots of children ?
If it did , would it work ?
Internationally , population policy has been crippled by US and Vatican opposition on abortion and contraception .
Have they managed to bully environmental organisations into this awkward silence ?
When challenged , environmentalists have coherent arguments to defend their retreat from the population debate .
They insist that the pressure on the earth 's resources - its water , forests , soil fertility - and carbon emissions are all about consumption and lifestyle , not about sheer numbers of human beings .
They rightly point out that the average American produces some 20 tonnes of carbon a year while some of those living in areas of the world with the fastest growing populations , such as Africa , produce a tiny fraction of that kind of carbon footprint .
They insist that the earth can support the 9 billion now predicted by 2050 ( the increase in the next 40 years will equate to roughly what the entire global population was in 1950 ) if everyone is living sustainable lifestyles .
The focus of campaigning must stay on the consumption patterns of the developed world , rather than on numbers of people .
But there is growing disquiet that it 's not an either / or .
As the environment finally gets the prominence it deserves , some environmentalists are prepared to assert that population management has to be on the agenda .
Christopher Rapley , the director of the Science Museum , has spoken out on the subject ; Jonathon Porritt , chair of the government 's Sustainability Development Commission , admits it is " tough territory " but argues that " it is intellectually unjustifiable " for the environmental movement not to address it .
He wants to see a UK population policy that covers both family planning and immigration , aimed at long - term population decline .
That would mark a dramatic shift in policy .
In particular , he rejects the oft - cited need to keep up the birth rate to pay for pensions .
But his attempts to get the government to engage have got nowhere .
As Porritt ruefully admits , his position lands him in some unsavoury company .
The Optimum Population Trust proposes some batty ideas such as government campaigns on the unattractiveness of parenthood .
And it gets much worse .
As is often the case where there is a disconnect between public debate and popular sentiment , the British National party ( BNP ) is stepping in to grab the territory .
It argues that " our countryside is vanishing beneath a tidal wave of concrete " , " immigration is creating an environmental disaster " and Britain could become " a tarmac desert " .
The BNP is peddling alarmist nonsense .
Only 8 % of the land of this country is built on , but , as a Mori poll commissioned for Kate Barker 's review of land use for the Treasury showed , it does n't feel like that : those polled put the figure at 50 % .
This sense of crowdedness and the resentment it can generate needs a grown - up debate .
That means talking about consumption patterns and population numbers .
It includes pointing out that consumer trends - such as our taste for mobility , the move to smaller households and multiple bathrooms - squeeze the space and resources we share on a small island .
But it would also include discussion of the environmental impacts of migration and family size .
There 's no point giving up your meat and your car , recycling your rubbish and producing lots of children .
The challenge is to have that debate while steering well clear of racism - or of the authoritarianism that lurks in the background of environmentalism .

The Internet is 30 today .
Exactly 30 years ago today on November 22 , 1977 the first three networks were connected to become the Internet .
These three were :
ARPAnet
A lossy packet radio network ( the lossiness of this network greatly influenced the design of TCP / IP )
The Atlantic Packet Satellite Network ( a.k.a. SATNET )
There were computer networks before this , but this was the first network of networks that deliberately attempted to connect heterogeneous systems without regard for platform .
It was the thing which grew into today ’s Internet .
Except for one brief discontinuity in 1983 when the entire Internet was turned off to switch over to TCP / IP , there ’s a continuous progression from then to now .
I doubt anyone back then had any idea of what they had created .
The Apple II was only a few months old , 300 baud modems were state of the art , and most networks just connected dumb terminals to a mainframe or minicomputer .
You could still find medium - sized businesses that did n’t even have any computers , much less a network .
Letters were still typed on paper .
People still talked about the phone company , because there was only one .
Back then a graphical user interface meant a terminal with an interactive green screen instead of punch cards .
E-mail and file transfer were the major applications on the early net .
( Some things never change even if the protocols do . )
However Usenet and NNTP were still a couple of years away , as were gopher , archie , IRC , Gnutella , BitTorrent , MMPOGs , VOIP , and of course the Web .
The Internet spoke NCP , not TCP / IP .
Viruses , worms , and Trojan horses were imagined only by the most cutting edge science fiction .
The original Internet addresses were 32 - bits , like IP4 today .
However only the first byte was reserved for network identification .
The assumption was that 256 networks would be plenty .
Although other groups were busy inventing LANs and Ethernet at the same time , no one really thought of that .
Over the next 30 years the Internet continued to grow in directions no one imagined until they invented it .
Arguably the Internet revolution is more important than the computer revolution that enabled it .
Unconnected , computers just let us crunch numbers , process data , and and type a few letters .
With the Internet computers let us communicate faster , better , and in more ways than ever before .
Computers are for data and numbers .
The Internet is for people .
What will the next 30 years bring ?
Will the Internet even last another 30 years or is some other unnoticed research project revving up to sweep away the Internet the way the Internet swept away most competing systems ?
The only thing I ’m sure of is that I do n’t know , but it should be fun to watch .
Bad Idea : robbing a bank
Really Bad Idea : robbing a bank without a weapon
Priceless : robbing a bank without a weapon , right in front of a uniformed officer !
Add this to our ever - growing list of stupid criminals on Neatorama :
Langston Robins , 21 , is accused of walking past an off - duty officer and then trying to hold up the Metropolitan Bank on Wednesday in Little Rock .
" As far as we know , the robber did n't have a weapon .
He just walked up with a note and laid it on the counter , right in front of the uniformed officer , " Little Rock police spokesman Lt. Terry Hastings tells KATV - TV .
Police took Robins into custody after a foot pursuit .
" I just do n't know why he did n't see a uniformed police officer standing basically right in front of him , " Hastings tells the Associated Press .
" My guess is he 's just not the brightest of people . "
Here 's the video :

In a victory for the EFF , Judge Vaughn Walker ruled today that AT&T , Verizon , Cingular ( now part of AT&T ) , Sprint , and BellSouth ( also part of AT&T now ) must all maintain any data or papers related to the NSA spying case that Walker is overseeing in California .
The EFF had requested the ruling out of concern that documents would be destroyed as part of routine data deletion practices before the case could even progress to discovery .
The move was opposed not only by the telcos but also by the federal government , which has repeatedly pursued the claim that the case involves " state secrets " and should not proceed .
A hearing on the matter was to have been held on November 15 , but Walker decided after reading the papers submitted by both sides that no hearing was necessary .
Instead , he ordered the telcos to retain all " documents , data and tangible things in the possession , custody and control of the parties to this action , and any employees , agents , contractors , carriers , bailees or other non-parties who posses materials reasonably anticipated to be subject to discovery in this action . "
Counsel for each company are specifically told to make sure that no routine business practices result in the destruction of useful information .
Walker also ordered the lead counsel for each telco to notify him in writing before December 14 that the order had been carried out .
The order comes a day before the AT&T whistleblower who bolstered the EFF 's case , a technician named Mark Klein , holds a DC press conference to publicly discuss his claims of " secrets rooms " and optical splitters .
He will also call for Congress to grant no retroactive immunity to the telcos for their part in the entire surveillance scheme .
While the order is certainly good news for the EFF , it does not require the telcos to say if they have any such evidence and it does not mean the case will necessarily move on to discovery .
Kol hakavod to Armond Schiff , who takes us on this virtual tour
( illustrated by yours truly ) :
Let me first give you a couple of minor points .
Israel occupies 0.1 % of the landmass of the Middle East and it is the only Jewish state , not only in this region , but in the world , and surrounded by 22 Arab states .
Let us begin your virtual tour !!
You have already been through immigration at Tel Aviv Airport with your boyfriend , whom we shall call Ken .
You will have filled out a visitors form .
This form will not ask you , as it will in many of the countries that surround us , what is your religion , and it will certainly not ask you , as they do in Saudi Arabia , for a " certificate of religion " .
The day is Sunday !
You will want to attend a church service .
No problem in the Apartheid State of Israel .
We tolerate , and freely allow , worship for all religions .
This is more than can be said for all of the surrounding 22 Arab nations .
In fact many of them would not even have a single church , let alone a synagogue .
After a lovely service you and Ken would head for a leisurely lunch - maybe at one of the lovely beachfront restaurants in Tel Aviv .
You would most likely have returned to your hotel and put on a very casual outfit , as befitting the very hot Israeli summers .
This could be a pair of shorts and a tight fitting skimpy t- shirt .
No problem in the Apartheid state of Israel .
In Israel we allow freedom of dress , especially for women , who are not made to wear bulky long robes , a veil to cover their face , and , would n't it be a pity if you had to c over that lovely coiffed hairdo , as you would probably have to in the surrounding 22 Arab states .
During lunch Ken could gaze lovingly into your heavily - painted eyes , complete with a good application of black mascara .
He would be free to lean across and kiss your lips - finely painted with lip liner , 2 shades of burgundy lipstick and gloss .
People would probably think you were in love , especially as Ken has proudly displayed a good wine on the table .
Public displays of affection and consuming alcohol in the Apartheid state of Israel is nothing unusual , and its not even scorned upon .
That 's more than can be said for most of the surrounding 22 Arab states , where your glossy lips would be considered whorish and alcohol is forbidden .
... Ken , being a little flirtatious , pinched one of the young waitresses , while you went to reapply your lipstick .
It was harmless and luckily for the young girl in the Apartheid State of Israel , her father and 6 brothers will not take her to the family pool in the evening and drown her , or slit her throat - as they would in the surrounding 22 Arab states .
After lunch you and Ken drive around .
You are even allowed to drive .
It is not forbidden in Israel .
The majestic dragon can oft be spied in the dark basements of suburbia , where its nocturnal wearers use its bright plumage to attract their bearded compatriots to rousing games of Warhammer and all - night Battlestar Galactica DVD binges ( the original , of course ) .
This beautiful creature has become ever more elusive over the years , as nerds have discovered irony and now favor garments emblazoned with humorous Linux - based innuendoes .
Only the rarest of nerds , those earnest few who take no pride in their nerdiness ( and may not even be aware of it ) , still dare to accept the dragon shirt upon their corpulent bodies .
The dragon is now limited to those nerds so unaware of their condition that they truly believe that the dragon shirt is rad , and that it will benefit their quest to meet women .
For what fair lady , they reason , could resist the allure of a beast so noble ?
Disney to lay off 28,000 at its parks in California , Florida
Visitors to Japan tend to fall prey to the power of booze rather than narcotics , thanks to the scarcity and astronomically high cost of drugs in Japan .
That , and terrifying rumours of ludicrously harsh prison sentences for drugs offenses , in jails where inmates get whipped senseless with rubber hoses and have large objects shoved up their bums by cackling sadist guards .
Yikes .
So I was surprised recently when a group of English teachers employed by NOVA corporation , were busted for cocaine possession .
And I ’d like to know how they can afford coke on a teacher ’s salary !
When I first came to Japan a few years ago , magic mushrooms were readily available in “ head ” shops throughout the country , but annoyingly they were banned in time for the 2002 world cup , due to fear of hallucinating foreigners wreaking havoc .
Still , if you ’re really desperate , there is readily available a repulsive - tasting legal liquid E concoction .
It ’s sold in bottles claiming to contain massage - oil , by furtive - looking vendors on the streets of Tokyo .
This stuff makes you go nuts for about twenty hours , so you may find yourself boogieing until the next afternoon in sordid after - parties full of recently clocked - off nighclub hostesses and strippers , ( which is n’t so bad ! )
But , on the down side , you also get chronic diarreah .

" Maybe they will find room somewhere else .
Perhaps this whole city will be a graveyard . "
President Robert Mugabe 's destruction of his own economy as he fights to hold on to power - with inflation running above 10,000 % , power and water cuts a daily reality , shops rapidly emptying of food and the grain harvest expected to fail yet again after the seizure of white - owned farms and drought - has played a large part in the surging number of deaths .
Millions are underfed , weakening immune systems and bringing on Aids .
Few can afford the drugs to treat the illnesses that the disease brings on , even if the medicines are available which , increasingly , they are not .
Many of the country 's doctors and nurses have left for South Africa or Europe .
The World Health Organisation estimates that that lethal combination is claiming 3,500 lives a week in the former British colony .
The World Food Programme says 4 million Zimbabweans , one - third of the population , will need food aid this year .
Mr Ncube 's team of diggers is making four to five new graves each day , and that is just in one corner of one cemetery .
" We work harder now .
There are many many more .
Look , you can see it 's different .
Over there the graves are like they used to be , a certain distance apart .
Now we put them almost on top of each other , " he said .
Many of the dead are laid to rest in cardboard coffins or cloth bags .
Mr Ncube says some people come in and bury their relatives at night in the graves dug during the day because they cannot afford the funerals or the ubiquitous burial societies , a savings club that provides a decent funeral for the dead if nothing for the surviving family .
The number of burials in Bulawayo is rising by about 20 % each month .
The mayor , Japhet Ndabeni - Ncube , says the time has come when people will have to be buried one on top of the other or not at all .
He wants the city 's residents to accept two bodies in a grave or cremation , a social taboo for many .
" It is very real .
In most cases we run away from facing reality , " he told a council meeting last week .
" It is incumbent upon us to go and spread the message on cremation and the burying in the same grave , and at the same time continue with the fight against Aids . "
Another councillor , Amen Mpofu , said the real problem was not how to bury the dead but how to save the living .
" I think the most important question we should ask ourselves as we discuss this is why are people dying at this rate ?
I think this is what we should zero in on , " he said .
WELCOME TO SAND HILL PRESERVATION CENTER
Please check the News and Updates for the latest on the after effects of the large August 10 storm and current status of operations .
We are a small home based privately funded gene bank or germplasm center .
Founded with the purchase of the farm December 5 , 1988 our collection has grown to over 2500 varieties of vegetable crops and poultry .
We grow and maintain all of it here on the 40 acre farm in western Clinton county Iowa .
The farm has about 23 tillable acres and 17 acres of sand hill left from glacial outwash .
The farm was started by Glenn and then Linda joined the operation when we were married in 1993 .
We do most of the work ourselves with some assistance from a couple of others on an as needed basis and we usually have a few student helpers to help with some of the farm chores .
We were informed by Seed Savers Exchange in 2018 that we are responsible for saving over 675 varieties that may well have become extinct otherwise .
In 1996 we had some of the last remaining flocks of heritage turkeys and were recognized for our conservation work in 1999 by the Livestock Conservancy .
Our goal and mission is genetic preservation and education on the importance of diversity in our food crops .
We are not set up as a true business with making a profit the goal .
Our goal is to preserve and educate .
All funds generated go directly back into the efforts to improve and increase our collections .
WHAT WE CAN DO
Accept orders via mail with payment in the form of check or money order .
Provide rare varieties that are difficult to find elsewhere .
Offer assistance when looking for a rare and unusual variety .
Grow around 80 % of the seed we sell and maintain breeder flocks for 100 % of the poultry we offer .

New Century ’s stock price , which seemed to mirror the trajectory of the subprime business , peaked at nearly $ 66 a share in December of 2004 and traded in the $ 40s most of last year ; on Friday , it was trading at $ 11 a share after the market closed .
In a series of sales from August to November , two of the company ’s founders sold shares for an average price of about $ 40 a share , for a total profit of $ 21.4 million .
It is not known whether the stock sales by the founders are among the sales being examined by federal investigators .
Some of them had been part of scheduled stock sales that are often used by executives to diversify their portfolios .
But some of the sales occurred on the same day that the executives entered the plans .
A New Century spokeswoman , Laura Oberhelman , said that executives declined further comment .
The founders ’ stock also rose in the social circles of southern California , the epicenter of the boom in subprime .
Five of the 10 biggest providers of subprime mortgages last year had their headquarters in the region .
Robert K. Cole , 60 , a co-founder who retired as chairman and chief executive last year , lives in a 6,100 - square - foot oceanfront home in Laguna Beach that is valued at tens of millions of dollars and was once owned by the chief executive of Pimco Advisors , the giant bond trading and management firm .
Edward F. Gotschall , 52 , another co-founder who is vice chairman of the board , donated $ 3 million for an expanded trauma center at Mission Hospital that will be named for him and his wife Susan .
The executives from New Century are by no means alone in cashing in on the bonanza , and they do not appear to have scored the biggest profits .
That title may be claimed by Angelo R. Mozilo , the chief executive of Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s largest stand - alone mortgage company and one of the largest subprime lenders last year .
He reaped more than $ 270 million in profits from sales of stock and the exercise of stock options from 2004 to the start of this year , according to the Thompson analysis .
Of course , most of the 500,000 people who work in the mortgage industry did not cash in so grandly .
The wealth was concentrated among executives , loan officers and brokers , because the greatest rewards were meted out in the form of commissions , bonuses and stock awards .
“ In the hot times , it was not unusual to see a broker make a million bucks , ” said Guy Cecala , publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance , a trade publication .
“ You can carry that up further to people who ran the companies .
The whole business revolves around personal compensation . ”
Authorities evacuated more than a million people as south - east China braced for the onslaught from powerful Typhoon Krosa , which killed at least two in Taiwan .
Packing winds of 180 kilometres an hour , at 8 pm ( 10 pm AEST ) Krosa was 455 kilometres off the coastal city of Wenling in Zhejiang province , Xinhua news agency said , quoting the provincial observatory .
By Saturday evening ( local time ) , Zhejiang and neighbouring Fujian had evacuated more than one million people as the typhoon was expected to make landfall in the region Sunday .
Zhejiang evacuated more than 837,000 residents and recalled more than 32,000 boats to port , Xinhua said , while Fujian had relocated about 230,000 people and recalled nearly 37,000 vessels .
More than 500,000 holiday - makers who had flocked to the coast for the week - long National Day holiday were evacuated , Xinhua said , quoting the provincial tourism bureau director Zhao Jinyong .
Meanwhile rescuers say Krosa left two people dead , two missing and at least 17 others injured earlier as it pounded Taiwan with powerful winds and torrential rain .
In Taipei , a 30 - year - old man was killed when mudslides crushed his house and rescuers were digging desperately through the ruins for his missing 60 - year - old father , said the National Fire Agency , which coordinates rescue work .
A 79 - year - old man fell to his death from a roof while a cook went missing when the hostel he worked for in the north of the island was hit by mudslides , it said .
Floods in central Vietnam unleashed by another typhoon , Lekima , have killed at least 17 people , as rescuers struggled to reach communities submerged by the heavy rains .

Levels of Engagement :
These eight levels ( y - axis levels from minus 2 to plus 5 ) represent the amount of material ( meaning , stories , associations , imagery , multiple layers ) in a name the audience has to play with and personalize – and how " engaged " they are by a name .
Names in the minus 2 level are the least engaging , and likely to be quickly forgotten ; the higher the number the better , with level 5 being the best .
Functional Names :
The lowest common denominator of names , usually either named after a person , purely descriptive of what the company or product does , or a pre- or suffixed reference to functionality .
( Infoseek , LookSmart )
Invented Names : " Invented " as in a made - up name ( Acquient , Agilent , Alliant , Google ) or a non-English name that is not widely known .
Experiential Names : A direct connection to something real , a part of direct human experience .
Usually literal in nature , but presented with a touch of imagination .
( Netscape , Palm Pilot )
Evocative Names :
These names are designed to evoke the positioning of a company or product rather than the goods and services or the experience of those goods and services .

China introduced a one - child policy to control its soaring population
There were 163.5 boys for every 100 girls aged up to four in the eastern city of Lianyungang , it said .
Abortions of female foetuses were the main cause of the imbalance , CFPA said .
China 's one - child policy , and a preference for male heirs , has led some women to abort girls despite a ban on abortions after a baby 's sex is known .
The ban does not apply if an abortion is required for medical reasons .
Social instability
Ninety - nine cities had gender ratios higher than 125 , state - run news agency Xinhua quoted the CFPA as saying in a report .
The provinces of Hainan , Henan , Guangdong and Anhui also had particularly high imbalances , it said .
China 's national average was 119 in 2005 but the UN recommends a gender ratio of no more than 107 .
Song Jiang , from Renmin University told Xinhua that " the traditional thinking that boys are better than girls " was behind the imbalance , particularly in poor areas .
The report also warned of China 's ageing population .
More than 11 % of the population was older than 60 , with that figure expected to grow to 16.1 % by 2020 .
In January , the State Population and Family Planning Commission warned that gender imbalances could lead to social instability .
It said China 's men were facing a shortage of wives , with a predicted 30 million more men of marriageable age than women by 2020 .
Correspondents say the one - child policy has caused other social problems , with many single children facing the prospect of supporting two parents and four grandparents well into their old age .
China established the policy in the late 1970s to control its soaring population .
A hundred year old wild ginseng was sold for 1.88 million yuan ( ~ USD250,000 ) in an auction in Guangzhou , China , on November 6 .
Ginseng is a precious herb widely used in Chinese and Korean medicine .
USD250 k seems like an outrageous price for a piece of ginseng , but it ’s not the most expensive wild ginseng ever sold … a 300 - year - old ginseng was sold for USD400,000 back in August 2007 .

Jose Antonio Vargas of the Washington Post reports : Four days after the Democratic debate in Charleston , S.C , . more than 400 questions directed to the GOP presidential field have been uploaded on YouTube -- targeted at Republicans scheduled to get their turn at videopopulism on Sept. 17 .
But so far , only Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) and Rep. Ron Paul ( Tex. ) have agreed to participate in the debate , co-hosted by Republican Party of Florida in St. Petersburg .
" Aside from those two candidates , we have n't heard from anyone else , " said Sam Feist of CNN , who 's co-sponsoring the debate with the popular videosharing site .
Aww .... whassamatter , Republicans ?
Afraid to stand up to the scrutiny of non-loyalty oath - signed crowds ?
Ca n't stand to answer for all the misdeeds of the rubberstamp Republican majority for the first five years of the Bush Administration ?
Do n't want to justify your continuing loyalty to party over country ?
Afraid to have to answer to the grieving mother of a fallen soldier ?
Hmmm .... did n't stop the RNC from encouraging their mailing list to send in questions for the Democratic candidates , did it ?
Fujitsu hits the spot with almost every feature of its new , tiny external hard drive .
The TARDIS - like External Hard Disk Drive ( yeah , we know .
How did Fujitsu think of that name ? ) is a svelte 0.86 ” x 3.3 ” x 4.7 ” on the outside and has a massive 300 GB on the inside .
The unit is bus powered , so it ’ll sup its juice from a USB port .
And it ’s cheap , for what you get , at $ 230 .
In fact , the only downside is that , at just 5,400 rpm , the drive is built for comfort , not speed .
And of course , you ’ll have to throw out all the supplied crapware that comes with it .

They are bold , they are funny , they are creative , they are hilarious and most important they are subtle ( ok , only some ! ) ... like them or hate them , but you just can't ignore them !
Here I come on the with one of my most awaited posts , the writeup on the adverts of WonderBra .
The brand has been criticized by many for the obvious but the sales of the brand has always been successful to make the brand have the last laugh .
It comes as a default choice for many for functions and social interactions ; while others are still wondering what the hoopla is all about .
What ever , the only ' point ' am concerned over here is the advertising done by the brand .
Its brand are one of the most subtle ones and many times are requires a long perplexed view by people to understand them .
Question is are these adverts targeted at the consumers ?
A majority feels against it , they say that the ads are made just for the jury of advertising awards .
Ask me and my opinion is - Maybe yes , obviously not !
Why do you think such a product will be sold ?
Or lets answer what is being sold by WonderBra ?
Is it just an inner wear ?
I register a denial .
An inner wear is for a personal use , the use here is for others , the product 's money spent will be taken recovered by the consumer when she gets the glances being promised by adverts .
So target one is the base consumer here who is wearing the product .
Target two is the rest of public , especially men .
With these adverts they actually will be recognizing the use of such a product whenever they see one , this builds up the response that the consumer of the product is actually looking for , hence drives the sales in other way .
So target two here is the intended evaluator of product ( not necessarily the men ) .
( society and esp men ) .
Just look at this - there was one print advert which shows just a blonde model wearing a black WB , and only one sentence
I can't cook , who cares !
Hence to make it an iconic brand , the marketers have done the best thing : attach it to the behavior , derive the impact of social cognition and consumer behavior .
Who does n't want to be recognized ?
and thats where these marketers target .
And when we say that intended impact is on social cognition , then it in itself encompasses both the targets , making the mental constructs or schema in consumer as well as the evaluator .
Just look at this - there was one print advert which shows just a blonde model wearing a black WB , and only one sentence
DRM - free music sells at a much higher rate online than protected music , according to UK - based digital music store 7 Digital .
In fact , customers buy it four times as often as they do DRMed music .
As a result , almost 80 percent of the store 's sales are of DRM - free content .
7 Digital may not sound familiar to some , but it carries over 3 million songs and has many selections from major artists in addition to independent labels .
" MP3 is the only truly interoperable format that works with the iPod , most mobile phones ( including the iPhone ) and all MP3 players , " said 7 Digital 's Ben Drury in a statement .
" Consumers are a lot savvier than some people think . "
The availability of DRM - free music is not only good for track sales , it 's doing favors for full album sales too .
7 Digital said that customers buying unprotected music are more likely to buy albums than those buying music with DRM , with some 70 percent of MP3 sales being part of full album downloads .
This should come as good news to the music industry , which has long seen album sales suffer since the proliferation of music stores that allow customers to cherry - pick tracks ( which includes pretty much every music store these days ) .
Music labels have been trying to come up with incentives to entice customers to buy more at a time , such as offering exclusive content that only comes with an album purchase .
Some artists still stand by the album format , too , at the risk of selling fewer tracks overall .
Hip hop artist Jay - Z recently made a decision to withhold his most recent album , American Gangster , from the iTunes Store because he did n't want the tracks to be sold individually .
So far , EMI is the only major music label to fully embrace DRM - free music sales .
EMI now sells its music without copy protection on any music store that wants to participate , which includes the iTunes Store and Amazon 's music store .
Universal is still experimenting with DRM - free downloads on select music stores , but otherwise Sony BMG and Warner are still slow to catch up .
With news like this , though , they might be more likely to give DRM - free music a try .

Sex and Death Among the Ice Cubes :
Subliminal Messages in Advertising
( jump to the ads )
You 'll probably find the ideas and analysis in this section controversial .
The thought of subliminal manipulation frequently excites passionate reaction .
Some embrace these ideas immediately , others react with horror and disgust .
I hope you wo n't accept or reject anything blindly .
I only ask that you consider rationally what you 'll see and read .
If you feel the desire to reject something out of hand , resist doing so .
Instead , generate as many alternate explanations as you can ( working in small groups makes this much easier ) , then test each logically and rationally to determine which best fits the facts .
Remember that advertisers spent tens of thousands of 1970s dollars to create each ad I 've included below , then hundreds of thousands or millions more to place them where they 'd be seen .
You also need to remember that if subliminal messages were in fact included in these ads , they were most likely intentionally hidden from conscious perception .
( It is conceivable that in the case of some symbolic subliminals , the creators acted unconsciously . )
If the theory is correct , for them to work , it is necessary that our subconscious minds " see " them while consciously we ignore them .
On the whole , advertising may be the most carefully constructed of all human communication ; it is certainly the most expensive .
The press likes to comment on the cost of motion picture and television production , but common sense ( as well as research ) tells us that advertising costs more to produce .
After all , in our culture it supports entertainment production and presentation .
Second for second , the cost to produce an ad is more than that to produce a feature film or TV show .
Therefore , it should n't be surprising when we find that more care ( and consequently more cost ) is devoted to the minute details in an ad than to those in either a TV episode or a feature film .
Like most people , advertisers sometimes like to discuss their work .
Reading the descriptions some have given of how particular ads and campaigns were created ( caveat : before using this article with your students , review it for age - appropriate language and ideas - a good idea in general , but especially for links in this section of the site ) , we see that every component of an ad is carefully constructed and placed , sometimes deceptively so .
So before automatically rejecting a subliminal explanation for the presence of something , try to find a better one to explain its appearance .
I 've titled this section Sex and Death Among the Ice Cubes because it is based in large part on my reading of the work of Wilson Bryan Key .
While I do not believe that attempts at subliminal manipulation are as common as Key asserts , I find the contents of a small number of ads impossible to explain reasonably in any other way .
Key singles out ice cubes because , as something most of us rarely attend to consciously , they make perfect objects for subliminal tinkering .
As a psychologist , researcher and former advertiser , Key knew that photographers take large numbers of photos in order to give ad agencies and producers the selections they need to get just what they want in a particular ad .
Doing this takes time .
Since ice melts over time , especially under the heat generated by the lamps used to light photographers ' sets , advertisers prefer to use substitutes of one sort or another .
Thus , what appears to be ice in an ad is either some sort of plastic prop , or is artistically added to the photograph ( or enhanced in it ) after the shutter snaps .
Sex and Death are topics of universal human interest .
In western culture they are also taboo .
I 'm certain that many of you will think about contemporary entertainment , then question my sanity for choosing to write the last sentence .
Nonetheless , I stand by it .
The gratuitous sex and violence on display in print , film and television correlates to human experience almost as much as the appearance of models in ads correlates to the appearance of the average man or woman on the street ; which is to say close to zero .
We are usually encouraged to repress our questions and fears about both sex and death , often to the detriment of our mental health and personal relationships .
Key asserts that advertisers know this , and use it to manipulate us subconsciously .
Here is how I summarize the argument Key makes in his books .
Please be aware that I do not have the educational or vocational background to either refute or support it .
I find it useful in understanding the ads linked below because I can explain what I see in them in no other way .
Human minds instantaneously perceive all information transmitted through our senses ( sight , smell , touch , hearing and taste ) .
The conscious mind filters out those things with which it is unable to deal ( either psychologically or because of the sheer volume of sensory experience ) , and constructs an acceptable and meaningful mental image from those stimuli made conscious .
The remaining sensory inputs are stored ( at least for a time ) in the unconscious , where they can effect conscious behavior .
Advertisers have found that subliminal messages in advertising can motivate purchases .
Ads are designed to transmit their information in a fraction of a second ( i.e. the time it takes to turn a page ) .
If an individual stops to read an ad , that is a plus .
Advertisers realize that any given ad will only motivate a small percentage of people exposed to it to make a purchase , so ads are targeted at audiences most likely to be receptive to their messages .
Thus we have a market research industry .
If an ad can bring in $ 20 in sales for each dollar it costs , it is considered to have broken even .
Beyond marketing effects , advertisers have not explored the effects of subliminal messages .
Furthermore , they do not know how or why they work .
Research along these lines may have been done in the private sector ; but , if so , it is considered proprietary and has been kept secret or destroyed .
Indeed , the federal government may also have commissioned such research in connection with the use of subliminal embeds on currency .
If so , that has also been suppressed .
Public ( i.e. university ) research in these areas is almost non-existent as funding has been nearly impossible to secure .
Key posits that subliminal ads work by connecting repressed needs and fears with a product .
When the unconscious feels the need or fear , the conscious perceives the need for the product , or becomes aware of the product .
Since Americans ( indeed most of those from western culture ) are taught from infancy to repress questions and thoughts about sex and death , they make the best subjects for subliminal ad messages .
While invisible to the vast majority of Americans ( and others from western cultures ) , people from cultures that deal openly with sex and death have no trouble seeing such messages .
By playing on people 's repressed fears and needs , subliminal advertising may be a contributing factor to many personal and social problems - drug abuse , suicide , insanity , unmarried pregnancy , VD , the breakup of the family , violent crime , etc .
Key reports showing an ad containing subliminal castration imagery to a group of college students .
He claims that a high percentage of the men reported feeling fear after viewing it , without knowing why .
Women had no such reaction .
Subliminal techniques are used in all media .
Print ads are the easiest to study .
Broadcast subliminals are impossible to locate without sophisticated equipment ( remember that Key wrote in the 1970s , the necessary equipment may now be cheaper and more common ) .
Indeed , since the techniques are constantly changing , it is often difficult to know what to look for even if one has the proper equipment .
The Ads
If they are present , subliminal messages in ads are either symbolic ( plainly visible , but with a meaning that producers believe from testing and research will be psychologically repressed by the target audience ) or embedded ( hidden from conscious perception artistically ) .
Embeds are the most controversial , the most expensive to create ( requiring expensive talent and technology ) , and ( from my observation ) the least common .
If you choose to use one or more of these ads with your students , you might want to make copies for distribution ( clicking an ad image on any analysis page I 've created will open that image in a separate browser window from which you can use your browser 's print command to print it ) .
If you want , begin by adapting the activity outlined in What 's Wrong with this Picture ? , substituting one of the ads below for the album cover image .
Use it as an introduction before presenting anything about subliminal techniques or theory .
You can then proceed to use additional ads where you 'll ask your students to complete a blank analysis questionaire prior to a group discussion .
Click on an image to open the page containing the analysis I have prepared for it .
Before clicking , try to identify one or more messages on your own .
The process that works best for me is to not focus on searching , but to let my mind go blank while looking at the image .
After a few moments , something often " jumps out " .
I assume that by actively searching for meaning , my conscious mind is working to block whatever I 've learned to repress .
Looking without seeking allows otherwise subconscious thoughts to find a way into consciousness .
I 've used these ads in slide presentations to many groups over the years ( secondary classes , teacher conferences and in - service days , etc. ) , and I can remember no one being able to identify a subliminal until after I 'd gone through an example and explained this process .
I will say that once people see them , they do n't forget them , unless of course they are among the group that finds this all a bunch of hogwash .
All of these ads ran in magazines in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Where I noted the source at the time I clipped an ad , I have provided it below .

Wilson Bryan Key - Amazon.com 's list of books by the controversial writer and researcher
Wilson Bryan Key began publishing books on subliminal messages embedded in advertising during the 1970s .
Most of his books are out of print ; but if you can find them , they are fascinating to read and guaranteed to engage .
At the time of this writing ( February 2002 ) , Subliminal Adventures in Erotic
Art is still available as a new book , as is The Age of Manipulation .
Attorney August Bullock developed his interest in subliminal advertising in the 1970s .
An avid researcher , his book ( published in 2004 ) uses more than 100 images he has collected over the years to illustrate in precise detail how advertisers convey subliminal messages , what those messages mean , and how they might work .
The book is beautifully printed on high quality paper .
Anyone interested in the possibility of the existence of subliminal messages will not want to miss it .
While the following two books do not deal with subliminal messages , I 'm including them here because readers should come away from them with a better idea of the attention to detail that goes into ad creation .
Once one recognizes the care with which ads are crafted , it seems a smaller jump to the realization that some advertisers might use subliminal effects as just one more tool in their creative arsenal .
I see this as a major message in Ron Rosenbaum 's article too .
( To understand the care with which a movie is put together , listen to Terry Gross ' March 6 , 2002 interview with director Ridley Scott .
Scott , who began his career by directing more than 2,000 TV spots , has a lot to say , none of it dull .

CNN Not Hot In Israel
Philip Stone November 2 , 2007
It s a classic capitalistic battle  the supplier wants at least as much if not more for a product , and the customer values it at much less than had previously been paid .
The supplier in this case is CNN and the customer is HOT , Israels largest cable company , and the stalemate that even saw Parliament getting in the act as moderator saw CNN dumped Thursday .

At 28 , Joe has become something of an expert at heroin detox - he 's tried it nine times .
Between programs , he 's attempted to quit on his own .
Once , when the cravings got the best of him , he tried to knock himself out by hitting his head against a brick wall .
So late last year , when Joe checked himself into a New York outpost of Phoenix House , the country 's largest residential rehab program , he knew exactly what to expect : the plastic cups of methadone to wear down his dependence , the sedated days and sleepless nights , the chill of the toilet seat , the sickening sight of food .
But then a doctor handed him a medication he'd never heard of .
Something called buprenorphine - or simply , bupe .
No way , Joe thought .
No way this little orange pill is going to do the job .
That first day at Phoenix House , Joe remembers , his last heroin high was wearing off .
He felt the familiar beads of sweat .
Nausea began to creep to his throat .
Perfect conditions , his doctor said ; bupe works only when patients are in withdrawal .
So Joe curled back his tongue , placed the little hexagonal tablet underneath , and waited .
He felt it slowly soften to a gritty paste and disappear .
It still amazes him how quickly it worked .
He did n't feel high , did n't feel withdrawal symptoms , did n't even feel medicated ; he just felt better .
" It took away the pain , " he says .
" It even took away the craving .
I had my strength back , and I was eating sooner than I ever had in detox .
I got clarity when I took that first pill . "
The details of his addiction - kicked out of high school , stripped of a college basketball scholarship , and ultimately sent upstate to prison - already seem like stories from someone else 's life .
Bupe won approval as an addiction treatment in late 2002 .
Sold by British firm Reckitt Benckiser and prescribed under the brand name Suboxone , bupe is a synthetic opiate that pushes the same buttons as heroin or painkillers like Vicodin , Percocet , or OxyContin , only without the high or any other significant side effects .
It frees recovering addicts from cravings and crashes , allowing them to focus on counseling , work , and relationships .
" It is the first real innovation in treatment in 40 years , " says Phoenix House medical director Terry Horton .
Before bupe , there was mainly methadone , an amber syrup that offers similar relief from opiate cravings but is highly habit - forming .
By law , methadone must be dispensed at special clinics and , for most patients , only in single daily doses .
Widely prescribed beginning in the 1970s , methadone was medical science 's first real attack on addiction , and study after study showed it prevented relapses and deaths by overdose .
But public opinion swelled against it .
Neighborhood groups battled methadone clinics , where patients congregate daily for their meds .
Politicians charged that junkies were merely swapping one habit for another .
Methadone has been controversial among addicts , too .
Some rejected it for producing a powerful sedative effect that makes it difficult for a recovering addict to perform job duties .
Others took methadone illegally as a cheap tranquilizer .
" People get a methadone habit because it feels like what you were taking before , " says Solinda , a former Wall Street office manager , heroin addict , and occasional methadone abuser who also went through bupe detox at Phoenix House .
Patients on bupe do become physically dependent on the pill - as do people taking medication for most chronic conditions .
Suboxone , though , has no strong side effects .
Nor can users get high by taking a larger dose - in other words , no inching up from dependence to addiction .
Bupe is also safer than methadone - which , like any strong opiate , suppresses breathing if too high a dose is taken - and easier to taper off .
And instead of visiting a treatment center every morning or quitting cold turkey , addicts can get a bupe prescription from their regular doctor .
This offers real appeal to addicts , particularly white - collar ones , who cringe at the stigma of methadone lines .
" You 're just taking medication , " Solinda says .
" You do n't feel sick .
You do n't feel high .
It makes you feel stronger as a person . "
For all these reasons , doctors and mental health professionals expected bupe to take off quickly .
But that has not been the case .
While Reckitt Benckiser wo n't disclose sales data , Shaun Thaxter , vice president of pharmaceutical marketing , says that 5,000 doctors are now prescribing buprenorphine .
However , according to two prominent bupe researchers , sources inside the company late last year said only half that number is prescribing either Suboxone or Subutex , a form of pure bupe often used at hospitals for detox .
And Herbert Kleber , director of the substance abuse division at Columbia Medical School , says the company told him it had recorded only about 1,500 prescribing doctors nationwide last summer .
Reckitt Benckiser estimates that since bupe was introduced , 100,000 patients in the US have used it , whether in the form of a single dose during detox or in ongoing treatment .
But Yale scientist David Fiellin , a longtime bupe researcher , says that medical privacy laws make it impossible for the company to accurately count the number of patients taking the drug .
" They can't know , " he says .
A more reliable indicator is the number of prescriptions filled by pharmacies , which are required to report their data to state health agencies .
In New York City , home to an estimated 200,000 heroin addicts and perhaps two to three times that many prescription opiate addicts , some 34,000 people were on methadone maintenance throughout 2004 , while only about 1,000 people filled a bupe prescription last year .
" It 's depressingly few , " says Lloyd Sederer , New York City 's deputy executive commissioner for health and mental hygiene .
So why has bupe 's progress been so sluggish when it 's clearly a superior innovation ?
There are several reasons .
The general practitioners who were meant to write most of the prescriptions have proved ambivalent , at best , about treating addicts .
Lawmakers have bungled regulations ; at one point , there was even a federal law barring methadone clinics from dispensing bupe , despite their experience and reach within addiction circles .
Meanwhile , Reckitt Benckiser has been conservative in marketing the new drug .
It 's all enough to drive Sederer crazy .
Reducing the number of active addicts in the city would help check the spread of HIV and other diseases that hang out on dirty needles .
It would lessen the number of deaths by overdose .
It would cut crime ; 20 percent of all convicted felons in New York test positive for opiates .
It might even save money .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that every $ 1 spent on drug treatment erases $ 7 in social costs ranging from unpaid ER bills to prison overhead .
But Sederer remains hopeful .
He and Andrew Kolodny , a city health department psychiatrist , have launched a campaign to place at least 60,000 New Yorkers on bupe maintenance by 2010 - nearly double the number on methadone .
They are turning city staffers into part - time drug reps to push bupe to health workers and patients at needle exchanges , methadone and HIV clinics , residential treatment centers , hospital wards , even prisons .
They figure that if the bupe brand surges in these settings , then the harder - to - reach patients like white - collar professionals will hear about it , either when they make the occasional foray from their middle - class world to buy drugs , or when the city 's inroads on addiction make headlines .
Then these patients will ask their doctors for prescriptions , which in turn will make the medical community more comfortable with treating addiction as an illness .
" We 're doing all the work for the drug company , " Sederer says laughing .
" Here you have a couple of psychiatrists launching a marketing campaign ! "
Andrew Kolodny looks uncomfortable at the head of a long conference table in the city 's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , where staffers are filing in for a final briefing on the bupe campaign .
Soft - spoken , with a shy demeanor and a disarming smile , Kolodny , 36 , joined the health department a couple of years ago while doing a fellowship at Columbia Medical School for doctors interested in clinic or government work .
Tomorrow , the city 's marketing literature , written by health department staff , will arrive from the printer .
" Hopefully , by the time we 're done today , everyone will feel comfortable delivering this information , " Kolodny begins encouragingly .
It 's cram time .
Kolodny reminds his colleagues of the drug 's advantages .
He stresses that bupe in the form of Suboxone is safe and almost impossible to abuse , a huge selling point at many of the clinics they will visit .
Suboxone has a second active ingredient in the mix , he explains , an anti-overdose drug called naloxone .
It does nothing if you take bupe as directed .
But if you sniff bupe or inject it or otherwise try to pack enough into your bloodstream to get high , the naloxone acts like a chemical booby trap , erasing the effects of any opiate , bupe included , and bringing on sweaty , nauseating withdrawal .
" That 's the last time you 'll do it , " Kolodny says dryly .
The length of treatment varies , with some doctors preferring a short detox and others believing addiction is best treated as a chronic condition - like depression or diabetes - with ongoing medication .
" Any questions ? " he asks .
One employee is still confused about why Reckitt Benckiser needs help marketing its drug .
If anything , pharmaceutical firms promote their products too well , turning millions of otherwise sensible Americans into Googling hypochondriacs , and doctors into vending machines .
" They are not a pharmaceutical company , " Kolodny replies .
" They make Lysol . "
" Woolite , also , " adds another employee .
" And French 's mustard , " Kolodny says , smiling a bit .
The room breaks up laughing .
" How did they come up with this ? " another staffer asks .
" Were they injecting Woolite ? "
" I hope they 're not making all this stuff in the same lab , " a guy in the back mutters .
Reckitt Benckiser , " the world 's number one in household cleaning , " according to company literature , stumbled upon the compound in the 1970s .
A few years later , scientists at Kentucky 's Addiction Research Center discovered that buprenorphine reduced opiate craving .
It bound tightly to the brain 's opiate receptors - nerve endings designed to catch the body 's pain - easing , pleasure - pumping endorphins - so that even a low dose blocks the effects of heroin or anything else a relapsing addict might take .
In the early 1990s , when bupe began its slow path toward FDA approval , it faced more obstacles than the average drug .
Until the early 20th century , you could order just about any narcotic you wanted from the Sears , Roebuck & Co. catalog : morphine , heroin , opium .
But in 1914 , Congress passed the Harrison Narcotic Act , barring doctors from prescribing opiates to known addicts .
Congress amended the act in 1966 to permit methadone as an addiction treatment and again in 2000 , to allow doctors to prescribe bupe .
But it tacked on strict conditions in 2000 , partly in response to methadone 's troubled history .
First synthesized in the 1940s by German scientists and scooped up after the war by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly , methadone attracted attention in the addiction community in the 1960s .
That 's when a husband and wife team , doctors Marie Nyswander and Vincent Dole of Rockefeller University , found that with a daily dose of methadone and some counseling , opiate addicts had a much better chance of staying clean .
Public health officials heralded the discovery as a revolution .
To get methadone to the masses , Congress created a class of tightly regulated health clinics to treat nothing but addiction and barred them from issuing any prescription but daily single doses of methadone .
Some 40,000 New Yorkers were signed up by the mid-1970s .
But the public success fizzled as NIMBY neighbors protested the location of clinics , illicit methadone hit the street , and critics slammed maintenance programs as nothing more than legalized addiction paid for by the government .
" Methadone is stigmatized , destroyed , " says Edwin Salsitz , a leading methadone expert based at New York 's Beth Israel hospital and a regular instructor in buprenorphine licensing classes .
" It 's a medical tragedy . "
Meanwhile , methadone regulations effectively ostracized addiction treatment from the medical mainstream .
Most med schools leave it off the curriculum for all but psychiatry students , who get a mere four weeks of exposure .
When young doctors train at big -city hospitals , most of their encounters with addicts are hard cases showing up in the ER in the middle of the night .
" The top attendings make fun of them , " Salsitz says .
An opportunity to bring addiction treatment back into the mainstream appeared when lawmakers amended the Harrison Act in 2000 to enable bupe to come to market .
It made a step in that direction by allowing general practitioners to prescribe the new drug .
Yet it barred methadone clinics from prescribing the pill at all .
This set the stage for some treatment centers to view private - practice physicians as rivals .
Yale 's David Fiellin , who attended several early training courses , recalls clinic workers standing up to share horror stories about hardcore addicts and suggesting that family physicians , if they prescribed the new drug , could expect the same in their waiting rooms .
After bupe had been on the market a year , the law was amended to permit methadone clinics to prescribe it , but only under the same rules used for methadone ( one dose per visit ) , which erases one of bupe 's major advantages - that you do n't have to schlep to a clinic every day .
Meanwhile , many methadone providers have remained openly skeptical of the new med , fearing that it will further stigmatize methadone , or siphon off their most stable patients .
The government reimburses methadone programs for the number of patients they oversee , not for the specific services they provide , so the payment for a stable patient who takes a dose and goes to work subsidizes treatment for more fragile clients with multiple addictions , mental illness , housing and unemployment issues , and more .
The regulatory problems did n't stop there .
Influenced by tales of unscrupulous methadone clinics taking on huge case - loads for the reimbursement cash , Congress barred doctors from maintaining more than 30 bupe patients at a time .
And in a monumental blunder , the law classified giant HMOs like Kaiser Permanente , as well as hospitals , as single providers , with the same 30 - patient cap that Kolodny has in the solo practice he maintains on evenings and weekends .
Four years later , the law remains unchanged .
One clear sign of the law 's unintended consequences :
The world - renowned Addiction Institute of New York ( better recognized by its old name , Smithers ) does n't mention bupe in its advertising because with a 30 - patient limit , it fears it would have to turn people away .
Meanwhile , even private - practice physicians open - minded enough to seek bupe training find that it reinforces old stereotypes .
" The courses are a disaster , " says Columbia 's Herbert Kleber , who has a contract from the federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to redesign the curriculum .
The classes rely on scenarios instead of letting doctors interact with live patients - who tend not to be the monsters that many doctors imagine , Kleber says .
The message that comes across ?
" Addicts are a difficult group to deal with .
They 'll rob your office blind and steal your nurse 's purse , " Kleber says , frowning .
" You 're a general practitioner :
Tell me if you 're going to prescribe . "
The result is that bupe faces an uphill battle to find its way into doctors ' offices .
Kolodny steers a big government sedan through the busy streets of Queens , past a billboard that promises , somewhat disturbingly , The World 's Boldest Corrections Officers , then over the bridge to Rikers Island , where he 'll talk about bupe to a group of prison docs and nurses .
" Best - case scenario , everyone hears my speech and thinks this is an amazing treatment , " he says .
" But they may not want to be innovators .
They may be content in what they 're doing . "
What they 're doing is maintaining inmates on methadone , trying to tame their addictions before they return to the street .
Kolodny hopes that with the enticement of meds donated by Reckitt Benckiser - seed drugs - the prison will agree to put some inmates on bupe instead .
Then , when they check out , they can tell their neighbors about it and increase the pressure on local doctors to write prescriptions .
A security escort leads Kolodny through two guard stations and a razor - wire fence that stands between roughly 17,000 inmates and a postcard view of the Manhattan skyline .
He hands Kolodny a visitor ID - " Lose this and I 'll fucking kill you , " he instructs - and asks what brings him to Rikers .
" You 're talking about replacing methadone ? " he says , skeptically , before Kolodny corrects him .
" We 're pretty anal about change here , " the guard warns .
" We do n't like change . "
A group of 25 doctors and nurses is already waiting when Kolodny arrives at the prison 's health offices .
He surveys the collection of bored , tired faces staring back at him , shuffles his notes , and begins .
" With any new medication with significant advantages , you 'd see ads on TV , like you do with Zoloft , you 'd see ads in journals , docs would start prescribing it , " Kolodny says .
That obviously has n't happened with bupe .
The doctors ask about side effects .
Good news there .
They ask whether it shows up on a drug screen ( methadone does , so many people who might face a urine test at work avoid it ) .
Nope , Kolodny says , a bupe patient 's urine tests negative - more good news .
They ask about the potential for black - market dealing ; inmates learn to hold their methadone in their throat , spit it back up , and sell the spit .
That 's pretty much impossible , Kolodny says , to nods of approval .
Will inmates be able to keep receiving bupe after they leave prison ?
Some , but not all , Kolodny says .
That 's because of the nearly 300 doctors in New York licensed to prescribe bupe , only a handful will accept Medicaid , even though it covers the treatment .
Any more - well , the city is working on it .
As he leaves through the tall , steel gates , Kolodny breaks into a smile .
" I did n't think people would greet us this warmly , " he says , genuinely surprised .
" I do n't know if I 'd go so far as to say we achieved buy - in , but it was a start . "
On the drive back to his office downtown , Kolodny 's Treo rings twice , just minutes apart .
Two more people looking for bupe treatment at his private practice .
" That 's weird , " he laughs .
Or , maybe , an encouraging sign .

A Wikipedia Reversal
In the recent dustup over a Wikipedia administrator dubbed Essjay who lied about his academic credentials in a New Yorker profile , here ’s how Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales responded when The New Yorker recently ran a correction :
Jimmy Wales , the co-founder of Wikia and of Wikipedia , said of Essjay ’s invented persona , “ I regard it as a pseudonym and I do n’t really have a problem with it . ”
It is unclear from this quote whether Wales was responding generally to Essjay ’s use of a pseudonym or the fact that Essjay lied about his credentials .
Regardless ,
Wales ’s response struck me , and many others , as stoutly tone deaf .
Here , now , is Wales ’s current thinking on the subject , posted on Wikipedia .
An excerpt :
I understood this to be primarily the matter of a pseudonymous identity ( something very mild and completely understandable given the personal dangers possible on the Internet ) and not a matter of violation of people ’s trust .
I want to make it perfectly clear that my past support of EssJay in this matter was fully based on a lack of knowledge about what has been going on .
Even now , I have not been able to check diffs , etc .
I have asked EssJay to resign his positions of trust within the community .
Hmm .
Did Wales really not know the scope of Essjay ’s deception when he gave the quote to The New Yorker ?
Did The New Yorker contextually make Wales look more unbothered than he actually was in order to punish him for the original deception ?
Or has Wales simply seen that the blowback to Wikipedia was greater than he imagined it would be , and decided to reverse course ?

That ’s already a good idea , but here ’s the clincher :
When you hear a song that you like on one of XM ’s 70 themed , ad - free music channels , one button - press records that song from the beginning — even if you were a little late hitting record .
In all , this gadget can hold about 25 hours ’ worth of recorded radio .

Long - suffering music fans could probably have predicted that XM would be sued over this glorious idea , and , well , sure enough .

MUSIC BEAMING
The Zune , Microsoft ’s new music player , does something amazingly well that its rival , the iPod , does n’t do at all :
It lets you beam songs or photos wirelessly to another Zune .
It ’s easy and fast , and it could be a great way to discover new music recommended by your friends .
In practice , there ’s more to the story .
To avoid lynch mobs from the record companies , Microsoft designed the Zune so that beamed songs self - destruct after three plays or three days , whichever comes first — even , idiotically , your own recordings like college lectures and garage - band demos .
The Zune , therefore , is that classic case : a killer idea diluted by a ham - handed execution .
THE VIDEO - GAME WORKOUT Nintendo ’s
Wii game console , on the other hand , is a stellar product that succeeds precisely because its central idea is unencumbered by corporate baggage — and is tons of fun .
The masterstroke is its wireless controller , which detects the motion of your arm in three dimensions and in real time .
As you swing , jab or whap through the air , your animated character on the TV screen swings the corresponding baseball bat , tennis racquet , fishing rod and so on .
( Perhaps it ’s a bit much to suggest that this video game may actually help to address America ’s problem of sedentary youth .
But my own two in elementary school play the Wii ’s tennis doubles game nightly with full - body vigor — and are perspiring after half an hour . )
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Iraq 's prime minister wants private military contractor Blackwater out of his country after an Iraqi probe found Blackwater guards randomly shot civilians without provocation in a Baghdad square last month , an aide said Tuesday .
A man bicycles past a car on September 20 that was damaged during the September 16 Blackwater shootings .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and most Iraqi officials are " completely satisfied " with the findings and are " insisting " that Blackwater leave the country , al - Maliki adviser Sami al - Askari told CNN .
The U.S. State Department and the FBI are conducting their own investigation into the September 16 killings in western Baghdad 's Nusoor Square , and a joint U.S. - Iraqi commission is reviewing the results of both probes .
Mirembe Natango , a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman , said policy recommendations would be up to that commission .
" We need to let the joint commission do its work , " Natango said .
The State Department relies on Blackwater contractors to provide security for U.S. Embassy staff and has paid the company more than $ 830 million for its services since 2004 , according to the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Tom Casey said the department has received " no specific request " from Iraq to withdraw the company 's contractors .
Iraqi officials said 17 people , including women and children , were killed and 27 were wounded when Blackwater guards fired on motorists around Nusoor Square .
The Iraqi investigation has concluded the shootings were an act of " premeditated murder " and recommended that Blackwater pay $ 8 million to families of each of the people killed .
Blackwater founder and CEO Erik Prince said Sunday the team was attacked and was defending itself at an intersection not far from the heavily guarded Green Zone .
" There was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents , " Prince said on CNN's " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . "
There was no " deliberate violence , " he added .
Watch more on the Blackwater investigation »
But survivors have told FBI investigators harrowing stories of being shot at by the guards despite presenting no threat .
And the first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene have told military investigators that they found no evidence the contractors were fired upon , a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN .
The soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars that were trying to leave , and found that weapon casings on the scene matched only those used by U.S. military and contractors , the military source said .
The shootings placed new scrutiny on the operations of Blackwater and other security firms in Iraq , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq , security contractors have immunity from Iraqi law .
Earlier this month , the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to place private contractors overseas firmly under U.S. law , allowing American courts to prosecute crimes committed in a war zone .

The cynical methods used by one of Britain 's biggest banks to avoid refunding customers ' unfair bank charges are exposed today .
High Street giant Lloyds TSB , which has been accused of overcharging customers £ 300 million a year , has issued staff with guidelines on how to deal with complaints .
In a 16 - page training pack it instructs workers to :
• Reject first - time claims , even if they are legitimate .
• Offer a maximum payout
of £ 750 .
• Only offer immediate settlements to those who are " very ill " – or dying .
• Not refund or waive interest .
Banks and building societies make an estimated £ 1.7 billion a year from levying charges of up to £ 39 each time a customer goes overdrawn or bounces a cheque .
Since Financial Mail on Sunday and consumer groups began highlighting these " unfair " profits and campaigning for a fairer system , millions of customers have asked their banks for a refund of the charges .
Lloyds TSB has been so inundated with claims for refunds that it has set up a special Recovery Centre at its offices in Andover , Hampshire – and has had to draft in agency workers to help its hundreds of " customer care " staff .
The training booklet is the first concrete written evidence of the banks ' seeming determination to cheat their clients out of reclaiming the fees .
One complaint handler for the bank , who contacted The Mail on Sunday , said : " Cynical does not even begin to describe it .
" I was placed by a recruitment agency , working from 5 pm until 1 am for about £ 200 a day to work in this nondescript building on the outskirts of Andover .
" I was one of about 50 people just dealing with complaints about service charges – we were told the bank was receiving more than 500 a day .
" This training pack was given to me on my first morning and I was told I had to adhere to it as this was the company policy – no deviating .
" The booklet was telling us
to reject customers asking for refunds , then to palm the
more persistent ones off with
nuisance money . "
He added : " It did not matter
if the charges had been unfair or if the records showed the applicant was owed thousands of pounds in refunds .
" We were told to offer those who wrote in after the initial rejection refunds of up to
£ 750 – but for most the claim was going back five to ten years , meaning the money
people were owed ran into the thousands .
" The bank 's attitude was very much that they could take it or leave it and we were always told that it was to be stated that this was a goodwill offer , and in no way an acceptance that the customer had a case . "
The Banking Ombudsman investigates complaints from customers about their bank ,
but it is a lengthy and time -
consuming process .
Banks , for example , are given up to eight weeks to respond to the original complaint .
" Offering people £ 750 to just go away was a quick and easy option , ' said the Lloyds TSB worker .
" We would tell them it would be in their bank in two days .
What none of them knew was that they could still pursue the bank for the rest of the money . "
This year , bank customers have reclaimed more than £ 200 million in overdraft fees .
Campaigners argue the real cost to a bank for a bounced cheque is only £ 2.50 .
Andrew Oxlade , Editor of The Mail on Sunday 's financial website This Is Money , which has led the campaign to highlight unfair bank charges , said : " One has always strongly suspected that bank staff have not come up with these sort
of dirty tricks on their own , particularly when they sometimes sound like they are reading from a set script .
" Now we have the first
concrete evidence that at least one of the big banks is actually schooling workers in underhand tactics .
It is quite simply appalling . "
The Lloyds TSB training manual carries the distinctive prancing horse logo and describes as Complex Cases anyone writing in for a refund for the first time .
It says : " We tend to reject these unless there is evidence that a customer is vulnerable . "
In another section , under the Paying Out Rules , it tells staff of a £ 750 Payment Rule and says any pending charges for a customer accepting the offer are to be waived .
The document says customers have to be " very ill " to be considered vulnerable in order to get an immediate refund .
It also states : " Death cases : if you identify the customer has died since complaining , or a party is claiming on behalf
of the deceased , DO NOT DEAL .
" Clearly indicate that it is a death case and pass it to your team leader . "
And on the media , the document says : " Any cases with mention of Press involvement or threats of media need to be passed to your team leader immediately .
Do not review these cases ! "
A spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB said : " Clearly , as a large organisation we have
a policy for handling complaints but this is purely a framework , and every case is handled on a case by case basis according to the individual circumstances . "
Democrats plan to cut Cheney out of executive funding bill Josh Catone
Published : Saturday June 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Following Vice President Dick Cheney 's assertion that his office is not a part of the executive branch of the US government , Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) plans to introduce an amendment to the the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill to cut funding for Cheney 's office .
The amendment to the bill that sets the funding for the executive branch will be considered next week in the House of Representatives .
" The Vice President has a choice to make .
If he believes his legal case , his office has no business being funded as part of the executive branch , " said Emanuel in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" However , if he demands executive branch funding he cannot ignore executive branch rules .
At the very least , the Vice President should be consistent .
This amendment will ensure that the Vice President 's funding is consistent with his legal arguments . "
At a press briefing yesterday , White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino said that Cheney 's assertion that he operates outside of the executive branch of government was " an interesting constitutional question that people can debate " and a " non-issue . "
On Thursday , Emanuel suggested that if Cheney feels his office is not part of the executive branch " he should return the salary the American taxpayers have been paying him since January 2001 , and move out of the home for which they are footing the bill . "
Emanuel also released the following graphic satirizing the situation :
Our future is highly dependent on the way in which worldwide crude oil production is going to decline .
If it goes rapidly , declining with a few percent each year or more , than it will be very difficult to complete the energy transition without severe economical consequences .
If production stabilizes and plateaus for a decade or longer , after which the period of long decline begins , it would provide much greater means to sustain the present economy .
Stability is needed to scale up alternative sources of energy sufficiently to replace crude oil during a transition period of decades .
This article is about the way in which oil production is going evolve .
Will there be a sharp peak , or a long lasting plateau ?
Within the world of independent forecasters both the peak and the plateau scenario exist .
The group of sharp “ peakers ” are mainly represented by the experts within the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) .
The best publication out there so far is that of the Uppsala Hydrocarbon Study Group ( UHSG ) , which is led by ASPO President Kjell Aleklett .
In his PhD thesis , Fredrik Robelius has outlined the fate of the Giant oilfields , that drive crude oil production , and came to the conclusion that production will peak between 2008 and 2018 , at approximately 90 to 95 million barrels per day .
With the more likely scenario stating that the peak is in 2012 after which a sharp decline occurs .
By 2030 he suggests production could have declined towards the low point of 50 million barrels per day .
Figure 2 - Fredrik Robelius
The group of “ plateau ” forecasters are widespread .
Coming from a variety of organisations such as the BGR , the World Energy Council and energy consultancy PFC Energy .
The analysis of the latter results in maximum production being reached around 2014 , at nearly 100 million barrels per day , which would be maintained for a decade after which a slow decline occurs .
The plateau scenario would be far more beneficial for the world because it is not likely that it will lead to widespread liquid fuel shortages .
Other liquid sources or equivalent energy sources can in that case fill a large part of the gap between supply and demand that is going to occur .
The world could step up the pace significantly for the energy transition to succeed , leading the way for the time when production worldwide is going into actual decline .
If this decline would occur immediately after the peak without significant preparation instead of a plateau , a worldwide liquid fuels crisis is inevitable .
Differences come mainly from disagreement related to the role of technological progress on valorising oil reserves into producible reserves .
What drives oil production ?
From statistics we know that since the beginning of 2005 , crude oil production including unconventional has been on a slightly upsloping plateau ( see Oilwatch Monthly ) .
It can be concluded from different reports , that in the the same period of time , 4 to 5 million barrels per day of new production have been added to supply ( Skrebowksi , 2006 ; Koppelaar , 2006 ; CERA , 2005 ) .
Which implies that present world production is declining at a rate of 4 % to 5 % annually .
When looking at the scheduled new oil fields coming on - stream in the coming years , one can see a continuation of recent supply additions .
Approximately 5 million barrels per day will be added each year up to 2010 .
From this it can be concluded that the present situation – a plateau that started in 2005 - is stable for now as long as no major factors are going to change .
This situation is plotted in figure 3 below , where we see production increasing through an up sloping plateau until 2010 , continued by a down sloping plateau until 2013 after which the decline sets is .
In total this scenario amounts to total present recoverable ( proven + probable ) reserves of 1220 billion barrels , which is in line with current estimates from the IHS Energy database .
Figure 3 - The base of existing production declining at 4.5 % per year in green and my own estimate for new oil field projects currently scheduled in red ( from the ASPO - Netherlands projects database )
In relation to the peak or plateau question , this raises two questions .
For how long will the oil industry be able to add such a large amount of new production each year ?
And the second being , is the decline rate of 4 % to 5 % stable or will it increase or decrease in the future ?
The answer on the first question is dependent on two developments , future oil discoveries , and additions from unconventional plays .
The answer to the second question is dependent on technological developments that add reserves , keeping the decline rate down , and on the production expectations for the giant oil fields in the world ( Robelius , 2007 ) .
From historical data we know that discoveries peaked in the 1960 ’s and have been declining ever since .
Presently we are discovering on average one barrel for every three consumed .
The continuation of this trend , which is very likely given the lack of new regions that have not yet been explored , would imply a remaining amount of oil yet to be found in the order of 100 to 250 billion barrels .
The effect of 170 billion barrels of new discoveries in the coming 15 to 20 years is shown in figure 4 below .
This would extend the present plateau until approximately 2017 , under the assumption that the present decline rate of 4.5 % will remain stable .
Figure 4 – The effect of 170 billion barrels of discoveries on the shape of oil production , assuming a continuation of the present decline rate of 4.5 % .
While discoveries can influence the extension of the plateau , unconventional crude oil is not likely to have such an influence .
With unconventional in this article I mean oil sands , oil shale , polar oil and heavy and extra heavy oil .
Present scenario’s for these sources of unconventional oil estimate a production level between 8 to 12 million barrels per day in 2030 ( Campbell , 2006 ; IEA , 2006 ) .
This is too little and too late .
The effect of approximately 12 million barrels per day by 2030 of unconventional production is shown in figure 5 below , which only slows the decline setting in 2017 slightly .
Figure 5 – The effect of 12 million barrels per day of unconventional production by 2030 on the shape of oil production .
The figure of 12 million b/d can be aggregated from 2 million b/d in the existing green production part , 3 million b/d in the red new oil projects part and 7 million b/d in the purple unconventional part .
Will the decline rate continue at 4.5 % ?
The scenario in figure 5 above , with a plateau extending for a decade , is very dependent on the future evolution of the decline rate .
As mentioned before , technological development can add reserves to the present oil fields of the world , so called reserve growth , and thus slow the decline rate significantly .
For more details about reserve growth , I wrote a three part series about this topic , published on The Oildrum last year ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) .
Estimates and opinions on reserve growth differ widely .
For the purpose of this scenario exercise , we take the figure of 500 billion barrels presented by Ray Leonard as the consensus conclusion of one of the latest HedBerg Conferences on the future of oil production .
More information about this conference can be found in the interview of journalist David Strahan with Ray Leonard about the HedBerg Conference .
The figure of the Hedberg conference leads to a recoverable conventional reserves estimate of 1890 billion barrels ( 1220 billion from present reserves , 170 billion from future discoveries and 500 billion from reserve growth ) .
How likely this amount of reserve growth is going to occur will be discussed later in the discussion at the end .
The effect is shown in figure 6 below , where we see that a sum of 500 billion barrels does not lead to an extension of the plateau , but to a much slower decline rate after the slightly higher peak .
Figure 6 – The effect of 500 billion barrels added from reserve growth on the shape of oil production .
On the other hand , there is also a significant downward potential because of the giant and super giant oilfields which dominate production .
In his PhD thesis , Fredrik Robelius did a splendid job on analysis the largest oil fields in the world .
A set of 507 giant and supergiant fields , contain around half of the words presently expected oil reserves that are going to be produced , according to the IHS Energy database .
Their share of present total production is 48 % , or in production terms , 40 million barrels per day .
From his model , Robelius expects that these fields are the main driving force behind the shape of oil production yet to come .
When this group of fields , that has been on a plateau since the ‘ 80s , starts to decline , world production will go with them .
In figure 7 below the low standard case from Robelius is shown , assumptions behind this scenario can be found in his PhD. thesis on page 126 and 127 , such as the expectation that the ultimate production of the supergiant Ghawar will be 105 billion barrels .
Figure 7 – The effect of the decline in the giant oil fields on world oil production - taken from the giant oil fields of the world , Fredrik Robelius , 2007 , Uppsala University
Next to the decline in production from the super giant oilfields , which is bound to increase decline rates , deepwater production will also have a significant influence .
Deepwater fields have a rapid upslope , a short peak and a rapid downslope , because that is the most economical way to produce the oil from deepwater fields .
In total , deepwater production is expected to ramp up to 9 to 12 million barrels per day at the beginning of the next decade , after which a annual decline of 10 % - 15 % sets in ( Campbell 2006 , Robelius 2007 ) .
A scenario of what could happen to the shape of oil production because of these downward potentials is shown in figure 8 below .
Here we see production increasing to a peak in 2010 , after which the decline sets in which increases rapidly at the end of the next decade .
Leading to a recoverable conventional reserves estimate of 1170 billion barrels ( 1000 billion from present reserves and 170 billion from future discoveries ) .
Figure 8 – The effect of an increase in the decline rate of present production towards 8 % on the shape of world oil production .
Conclusions
1 ) If the global decline rate of existing production of 4.5 % continues , oil production is likely to plateau at a level of 90 million barrels per day around 2010 until the end of the next decade , after which a moderate to sharp decline sets in .
2 ) If the global decline rate of existing production of 4.5 % slows down to 2 % , thanks to the addition of 500 billion barrels due to reserve growth , production will likely increase with some bumps towards 95 million barrels per day at the end of the next decade , after which a slow to moderate decline sets in .
3 ) If the global decline rate of existing production of 4.5 % increases to 8 % , due to the effect that the end of the era of giant oil fields and declining deepwater production has , production will likely peak around 2010 at 88 million barrels per day , declining slightly to 80 million barrels per day at the end of the next decade , after which a sharp decline sets in .
Discussion
The discussion on peak oil has progressed significantly since the article on the end of cheap oil was published in Scientific American ( Campbell & Lahérrere , 1998 ) .
Presently there is a converging agreement that we are going to enter a period in which supply can no longer meet demand , giving way to sustained high oil prices .
Either because of the expectation of a long production plateau for one to several decades , or a peak after which a sharp decline sets in .
My scenario exercise supports mainly the view of a peak with a sharp decline .
The conditions in which a plateau can occur for more than a decade are an unlikely amount of reserve growth , significantly above 500 billion barrels , and / or much higher unconventional production increases .
As to what is the most likely scenario , I expect that the increase towards a higher decline rate , as shown in figure 8 , is going to occur .
The reasoning behind this is a combination of developments , 1 ) The end of the era of giant oil fields , where there was a sustained base of production of 40 million b/d , which is going to fall away , 2 ) The end of a sharp increase in production thanks to deepwater , which is going to go away with an equally sharp decrease , 3 ) The fact that the world has produced more reserves in the past three years than have been added from discoveries and reserve growth ( Robelius , 2007 ; J.S. Herold , 2007 ) , 4 ) The effect of above ground factors on production , which will lead to higher declines , because from 2009 / 2010 onwards there will be a significant gap between personnel supply and demand ( CERA , 2007 ) , there is a problem to scale up sufficient oil rigs for exploration and production ( Simmons 2006 ) , unrest and geopolitics are delaying new oil fields developments , and keeping production down in several countries such as Iraq , Venezuela and Nigeria , which is not likely to change for the better in the future .

7. Final Fight
The plot : Mayor Mike Haggar 's daughter , Jessica , is kidnapped because he would not work with Mad Gear to ensure their dominance of the streets of Metro City .
So what does a former ex-wrestler do when his back is against the wall ?
He calls up his daughter 's boyfriend Cody and his sparring partner Guy to head into the streets to bust some Mad Gear skulls .
Awesome because :
It was a very simple game to play .
Two buttons for mashing , and if you hit both buttons at once you performed an " uber- manuever " that pretty much cleared the screen of all the baddies .
Yes , this was a tried and true story of rescuing your kidnapped girlfriend , but folks , let it be known that this was a story of love .
The love for pure unadulterated violence !
Oh , and do n't forget the bonus levels where you got to destroy a car for no good reason .
Yippppppy !
Side Note : I hated playing this game in the arcade , but only because I was a poor kid growing up .
You only got two lives with each quarter !
Fucking bastards would make you fight a 100 guys at once , and to add insult to injury they would tie dynamite to your character to suck more quarters out of you because they knew you were n't going to just let him blow up .
Bastards .
6. BAD DUDES vs. DRAGONNINJA
The plot :
President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas .
Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie ?
That right there says everything you need to know about this amazingly " gritty " game .
Yes , it may have seemed liked your typical beat 'em up from the 80s , but this game was so much more .
Awesome because : Easy .
For starters : the boss fights , which included all sorts of colored ninjas , a dude who looked like Shredder and the legendary fire - breathing Karnov .
And if you managed to kill any of these bad ass bosses , the Bad Dude would raise his fist in the air ( ala Rocky ) and yell , " I 'm bad ! "
That line is probably the single greatest victory quote in the history of gaming .
Side Note :
If you happen to love Van Damme movies , this game is definitely for you .
Every single pose / fighting stance is straight out of a Van Damme movie .
5. River City Ransom
The plot :
We follow two high school students -- Alex and Ryan -- as they attempt to rescue River City High and Ryan 's girlfriend Cyndi from the clutches of a villain called " Slick " and his gang of students .
Awesome because : " BARF ! "
That 's what the enemies would yell when they were defeated .
Best part of the game is clearly the amount of weapons .
You can hit people with them , throw it at them , or use your weapon to deflect incoming weapons !
You can also kick boxes and tires at people , or ride them - up to you .
Hell you can even pick up bodies and use them as weapons !
River City Ransom was the first beat 'em up that introduced RPG elements that included character customization .
There 's nothing like beating a video game with a supposed splitting image of your 6 ' 2 " , 200 lbs. , and strikingly good looking self .
4. Golden Axe
The plot :
You could play as one of three characters : Gilius Thunderhead ( dwarf ) , Ax Battler ( male barbarian ) and Tyris Flare ( amazon ) .
Each of the three warriors are bent on revenge against the tyrant , Death Adder .
Death Adder has taken over the land of Yuria .
Death Adder has the Golden Axe , which he plans to destroy unless all the people of Yuria bow to his will .
Awesome because :
One of the first beat 'em ups , if not the first , to allow mounts .
Yep , you could mount fire breathing dragons if one were so inclined .
Bad ass .
Another point of awesomery was boosting your health and magic .
In order to do so you had to beat up the little guys who were giving them to you .
Side Note :
Who wanted to be the dwarf ?
This was the only game I played growing up where I 'd choose a female character over a male .
3. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV : Turtles in Time
The plot : Krang , Shredder and the gang steal the Statue of Liberty while April O'Neil is reporting live from Liberty Island .
The Turtles then pursue the Foot on to the streets and the city sewers ( then to the Technodrome in the SNES version ) , where Shredder is waiting to send them through a time warp .
You then have to fight Shredder and his army in both the past and the present .
Awesome because :
It broke the golden rule of typical beat 'em ups .
No girlfriend was kidnapped .
Unless you consider the Statue of Liberty your lady lover .
Playing this game in single - player mode is definitely fun .
But playing this game in multi-player mode is face raping awesometastic .
A friend said it best , " Few moments in gaming are as great as picking your favorite turtle , teaming up with a friend , and beating the shit out of Bebop and Rocksteady . "
I could n't agree more .
Many would conclude this game as the greatest beat 'em up of all time , but they are wrong ...
2. Double Dragon
The plot : ( According to Wikipedia )
The story of Double Dragon is set in a post - apocalyptic version of New York City , five years after a nuclear war , where gangs and criminal organizations have taken control of the city .
The protagonists are Billy and Jimmy Lee , the titular duo and the successors of a fictional martial arts style known as Sou - Setsu - Ken ( loosely based on Jeet Kune Do ) .
One day , Billy 's girlfriend , a student named Marian , is kidnapped off the street and the Lee brothers receive a message from her captors , the Black Warriors , demanding to known the secrets of Sou - Setsu - Ken in exchange for her release .
The Black Warriors are the largest criminal organization in the city , led by machine gun-toting crime boss Willy Mackey .
In the NES version of the plot , Willy is apparently only a figurehead , while Jimmy is the true boss ( the " Shadow Boss " in the English version ) .
Awesome because : 1 ) It was the father of all beat 'em ups .
It allowed for co-op which instantly turned the genre around and made it the most exciting type of game in any arcade .
2 ) A movie was made of it .
3 ) The airplane level .
It 's so amazing that Double Dragon was almost catapulted to the # 1 slot on this list because of it .
No level in any beat 'em up that followed was ever able to top it .
4 ) Honestly , if you had to make a nostalgic arcade cabinet what would it be ?
Yeah , I thought so .
Side note : I do n't know anyone , when hearing the name Double Dragon , who does n't react with , " Dude , what about when you had to fight your friend for the girl at the end ! ! "
1. Streets of Rage 2
The plot : ( According to the manual )
According to the game 's Instruction Manual :
This time it 's personal
One year had passed since ex-police officers Adam Hunter , Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding had broken the Syndicate 's hold and destroyed it 's leader , the mysterious " Mr X " .
Peace had returned to the streets , people were moving back to into the once vacant city neighbourhoods , and the city had returned to prosperity .
On the anniversary of the Syndicate 's destruction , Adam , Axel and Blaze met at their favourite nightspot to commemorate the occasion and catch up on the latest news .
Both Axel and Blaze had moved out of the city ;
Axel working as a bodyguard , and Blaze teaching dance .
Adam had rejoined the police force , and moved to a small house on the edge of the city with his kid brother .
The three celebrated until late in the night , and made plans to meet at the same place next year .
As he was planning to check out of his hotel the next day , Axel received a frantic phone call from Eddie " Skate " Hunter .
He had arrived home from school to find the place a total ruin .
He 'd called the police department , but nobody there had seen or heard from his brother since early that morning .
Both Axel and Blaze rushed to Adam 's house .
Windows had been shattered , furniture smashed .
Stuck on the remains of the splinted front door was a photo :
Adam in chains lying at the feet of a man they knew only too well .
Adam 's disappearance marked the beginning of the nightmare .
Criminal elements swarmed out to reclaim the streets .
Gangs roamed the parks , and bomb - wielding bikers made the roads deadly to travel at night .
Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight .
Chaos reigned in the city , far worse than before .
Axel and Blaze tried to contact their old friends at the force , the ones who 'd provided backup with heavy artillery .
But everyone they knew had either been fired or transferred elsewhere .
This time the Syndicate was in complete control and the two ex-cops were on their own .
Assisted by Adam 's brother Skate and Axel 's friend Max , Axel and Blaze set out to rescue their friend and destroy Mr X once and for all .
Standing in their way is the nastiest collection of punk and brawlers ever assembled .
Add to that a force of professional fighters specially groomed to take them out of the picture !
As one of the 4 young vigilantes - or together with a friend - you 'll battle with your fists and feet , and attack with whatever weapon you come across , as once more you walk the Streets of Rage !
Blaze without her jacket was hot .
' Nuff said .
Okay , yes , obviously this glorious game had additional cool points .
Like the ability to play with four very balanced characters , who all specialized in different moves .
This is a game that has held its game play value over the years because it still poses a challenge to any sort of gamer , thanks to the " mania " difficulty setting .
Streets of Rage 2 is fast and ferocious even with the up - beat porno music blasting in the background .
All of these qualities only solidify the fact that Streets of Rage 2 is truly the apex of all side - scrolling beat 'em ups .
EAVESDROPPING LAW EAVESDROPPING
LAW
In 2006 , the Bush administration filed 2,181 applications for warrants to perform surveillance in national security cases .
The law governing such " foreign intelligence surveillance " searches was modified last month but expires in February .
Congress plans to take up new legislation this fall .
Here are key differences between the former and current law , along with differences over proposed changes : Previous law Required a court warrant to intercept electronic communications carried by a U.S. wire or fiber - optic cable , even if both parties were based abroad .
2007 law Phone calls and e-mails can be intercepted without a warrant if one or both parties are " reasonably believed " to be abroad and the subject of a national security or terrorism investigation .
Proposed law • Director of National Intelligence and Bush administration want to make the 2007 law permanent and add immunity from lawsuits for telecom companies that helped intelligence agencies carry out eavesdropping .
•
The ACLU and some congressional Democrats want some judicial review of eavesdropping on communications to or from the USA .
They oppose lawsuit immunity for telecom companies .

Facebook Saying older surveillance laws were " dangerously out of date , " President Bush pressed anew Wednesday for Congress to pass permanent legislation that allows intelligence agencies to carry out warrantless surveillance on all communications of a foreign terror suspect .
Legislation passed by Congress last month " has helped close a critical intelligence gap , allowing us to collect important foreign intelligence and information about terrorist plots , " Bush said after he was briefed at the National Security Agency .
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF : Scant citizens spied on " The problem is the law expires on February 1 — that 's 135 days from today .
The threat from al - Qaeda is not going to expire in 135 days , " Bush said .
Bush 's comments come one day after the nation 's intelligence chief told Congress that fewer than 100 Americans have become surveillance targets because they were initially overheard communicating with foreign terror suspects .
" How many Americans ' phones have been tapped without a court order ?
The answer is none , " Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell told the House Judiciary Committee .
The law that expires in February allows intelligence agencies to carry out warrantless surveillance on all communications of a foreign terror suspect , even if a U.S. - based person is on one end of the call .
Congressional Democrats say the new law 's wording could promote warrantless spying on Americans .
The law is written " so broadly and loosely that it permits the government to intercept … anyone even thought to be abroad , " Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers of Michigan said at Tuesday 's hearing .
The House Intelligence Committee is expected to begin considering changes to the warrantless wiretapping law next month .
McConnell and the Bush administration also want the law expanded to include immunity from lawsuits for telecom companies that helped intelligence agencies carry out spying .
Democrats , including Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes , D - Texas , want stricter rules covering surveillance of Americans .
" These restrictions would impede the flow of information that helps us protect our people , " Bush said Wednesday .
" These restrictions would reopen gaps in our intelligence that we had just closed . "
At NSA , Bush received private briefings from intelligence officials and mingled with employees in the National Threat Operations Center .
While cameras and reporters were in the room , the large video screens that lined the walls displayed unclassified information on computer crime and signal intelligence .
Along one wall at NSA is a sign that says , " We wo n't back down .
We never have .
We never will . "

For a worker down in the cube farm , it 's easy to see the dysfunction of your own company , and to imagine that almost anyplace else would be better .
I do n't have any data to back this up except my own personal experience , but I 've worked at enough companies and seen enough others up close that I 'm willing to go out on a limb here :
All companies are dysfunctional .
The thing is , they 're all dysfunctional in different ways .
This means that it 's possible to pick an employer whose dysfunctions are ones that will bug you less .
The key is to understand what it is that 's really bugging you , and then to check for those particular dysfunctions at the new company .
The first part is easy to describe , although it may be hard to get the perspective to do a good job .
All you need to do is :
Analyze the dysfunctional aspects of your work that bug you .
Think about them .
The " thinking " stage here is not about coming up with ways to fix things at your current employer -- let 's give you credit for having made those efforts long ago .
The reason to think about them is to come up with questions to ask at a potential new company to see if they 're dysfunctional in the ways that you 've already learned are a problem for you .
( You do n't need to find out if they 're dysfunctional in other ways : they are .
But maybe they 're dysfunctional in ways that , although they may bug other people , you 'll be able to just shrug off as no big deal . )
If you 're interviewing with people who will be your peers , you do n't even have to be especially subtle .
They do n't want to have to work with some new - hire who turns grumpy and grouchy as soon as he or she starts , so if there 's something that would make you grumpy or grouchy , ask about it .
In the thinking stage above , you 've come up with polite ways to get the information you want .
You do n't need to ask , " Is the manager a insecure fool who cares more about face - time than actually getting the work done ? "
But you can ask , " What measures does the boss seem to use when evaluating performance . "
Your potential peers will very likely clue you in .
You do n't need to ask , " Is the manager a psycho who yells at anyone who suggests that doing things differently might be better ? "
But you can ask , " Is process - improvement an important goal here ? "
It 's always good to toss out a few general questions that can elicit warnings .
" Tell me about the culture here , " is worth trying .
Ask about how different departments work together .
If there are multiple sites , ask about how they work together .
Any general questions about how things are done give people a chance to warn you about the things that bug them , giving you the information you need to decide if those things will bug you .
If your only chance to interview is with the boss , it gets a little harder , but only a little .
Your boss is no more interested in hiring someone who will be miserable there than your peers are .
Find ways to ask the questions such that asking wo n't ruin your chances if the answer is what you 're hoping it is .
Neutral questions , such as " What are a couple of things you do to promote teamwork among your employees ? " are usually safe .
Even better are questions that give the boss a chance to praise their working environment .
You 'll find out what the boss thinks are plusses , without needing to mention things that might be minuses for you .
When a potential boss or coworker does n't have a good answer , it 's always possible that simply asking will shoot down your chances -- but that is n't so bad if you 'd just have been miserable at the new place anyway .
I 've known too many people who have gone from job to job to job , always leaving because they were unhappy , but always finding themselves at a new job that also made them unhappy , simply because they did n't take the time to get clear in their head what it was about their job that made them unhappy and then check whether the new place would be better .

Newman drinking pop so he can return empty bottles to Michigan .
Kramer and Newman en route to Michigan , to return bottles .
Seinfeld had a two - segment episode on " The Bottle Deposit , " which aired in 1996 , where Kramer and Newman try to take advantage of Michigan 's 10 cent per bottle deposit , by driving Newman 's mail truck to Saginaw , Michigan filled with empty bottles .
Unfortunately , they never it made all the way to Michigan during Part 2 , you can read details here for Part 1 and here for Part 2 .
However , about $ 10 million worth of empty bottles and cans do get smuggled into Michigan from Ohio and Indiana by people who cash in on Michigan 's 10 - cent deposit refund .
Ohio and Indiana do not require a deposit on beverage containers , and returning those out - of - state bottles and cans in Michigan can turn in a small profit .
Michigan lawmakers now want to stop the smuggling by requiring beverage manufacturers to put a code on all bottles and cans that are sold in Michigan , and require that automated bottle return machines be programmed to read the Michigan - only code so they accept only containers sold in Michigan .

Sir Jimmy said he would give the thief a box of chocolates
Sir Jimmy Savile
The veteran star , aged 81 , said the thief made off with his John Lennon - style glasses as he was leaving a function at the Queens Hotel .
Sir Jimmy reported it to police , but compared the experience to being chased by fans in the 1960s .
" The fact I 've not been mugged for over 50 years , I thought it was marvellous , it was just like old times , " he said .
The former DJ and TV presenter , who lives in Roundhay , said he was walking down the hotel 's corridor at about midnight on Wednesday when the woman pounced .
' Gave me a thrill '
" She was walking alongside me and the next thing she reaches up - I thought she was going to give me an embrace , but she grabbed my glasses and took off down the corridor , " he said .
" I thought , I 've been mugged .
How wonderful . "
Sir Jimmy said that the unexpected theft had n't left him unable to see as he has a spare pair of glasses .
He added : " I 've told the police that if the girl turns up and I get my glasses back , I will give her a box of chocolates for giving me a 1950s thrill in 2007 . "

With President George W. Bush indicating a large contingent of U.S. troops likely will be engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan for many years to come , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the total tab for the wars from 2001 through 2017 .
CBO estimated that interest costs alone from 2001 - 2017 could total more than $ 700 billion .
So far , Congress has given Bush $ 604 billion for the two wars , with about $ 412 billion spent in Iraq , according to CBO , which is Congress ’ in - house budget analyst .
In Iraq alone , the United States is spending about $ 11 billion a month , with costs escalating .
Bush is seeking another $ 196 billion for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan through September 30 and Congress is expected to debate that request over the next few months .
CBO estimated that between 2008 and 2017 , the wars could cost slightly more than $ 1 trillion , assuming overall troop strength is cut to 75,000 by 2013 .
Currently , there are about 170,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and another 26,000 in Afghanistan .
Finance charges for the money already spent on the war will total $ 415 billion from 2001 to 2017 , according to CBO .
For the next decade , “ interest outlays would increase by a total of $ 290 billion over that 10 - year period , ” CBO told the House Budget Committee , which is reviewing long - term war costs .
“ To put it all on our credit cards with no accountability , with no plan to pay for it , I think is the height of irresponsibility , ” said Rep. James McGovern , a Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the budget panel and is an outspoken war critic .
“ It will be just one more toxic legacy of this disastrous war we will have to leave our kids to clean up . ”
With national elections about a year away and public discontent with the Iraq war running deep , Democrats are highlighting the huge costs of the Iraq war as they seek $ 22 billion more than Bush wants for domestic social programs such as health care and education .
Bush has vowed to veto the added funding .
CBO estimated that of the $ 2.4 trillion long - term price tag for the war , about $ 1.9 trillion of that would be spent on Iraq .
In a recent editorial , an attorney representing a defendant in one of the RIAA 's 19,000 lawsuits over P2P technology made the case that the RIAA 's arguments in Elektra v. Barker , if accepted by a judge , have the potential to undermine the very nature of the Internet .
Here at Ars , we 've previously touched on the RIAA 's radical notion , first introduced in this case , that simply making files available on a shared folder constitutes infringement ( regardless of whether the files were actually accessed by another party ) .
The new editorial reiterates the dangerous absurdity of parts of the RIAA 's arguments , but in favorably citing a recent EFF amicus brief in the case it also raises the question of who , in fact , is really the party arguing for the pre-digital status quo .
The EFF 's most recent brief , summarized here and available here , has been covered here at Ars before .
But it 's worth taking another good look at , because of the odd and ironic way that it places the EFF on the side of arguing for a pre-Internet model of distribution , while the RIAA , in its own twisted fashion , tries to drag copyright law into the digital age .
To recap briefly , the EFF has caught the RIAA and their allies ( the MPAA and the US Attorney General 's Office ) trying sneak through the courts a complete overhaul of existing copyright legislation .
The change in the definition of a copyright owner 's exclusive right of distribution that the RIAA seeks to have the court acknowledge is at once troubling and fascinating — troubling because , hey , it 's the RIAA that 's pushing this , and we all know they 're Pure Evil ( TM ) , and fascinating because in its own odd way the attempted alteration would " update " copyright law to take account of the reality of digital distribution in a manner that it currently does not .
Exclusive rights , and the RIAA 's arguments against P2P
US copyright law gives rightsholders the following exclusive rights over their work :
The right to reproduce the copyrighted work ;
The right to prepare derivative works based upon the work ;
The right to distribute copies of the work to the public ;
The right to perform the copyrighted work publicly ; and
The right to display the copyrighted work publicly .
( Bitlaw has a good , quick rundown of these rights .
For even more practical , layperson - friendly discussion of these issues , I like Nolo's The Copyright Handbook : How to Protect and Use Written Works , by Stephen Fishman . )
In its lawsuits against P2P users , the RIAA wants to argue two things .
First , it wants to argue that illegal downloaders are infringing on the copyright owners ' exclusive right to reproduce their copyrighted work .
As the very word " copyright " suggests , the rightsholders ' exclusive right to make copies of a work is at the very heart of copyright law , and the EFF in fact concurs with the RIAA on this issue , holding that P2P downloading is technically copyright infringement from a legal standpoint .
More controversially , though , the RIAA would like to argue that those who upload copyrighted works onto P2P networks are infringing on rightsholders ' exclusive right to distribute copies of the work to the public .
This argument that a digital transmission of a work that results in a copy on the other end equals distribution is where things start to get really , really interesting .
Defining " distribution "
The letter of US copyright law specifically and clearly stipulates that in order to " distribute " a copyrighted work , an actual , physical exchange of a material object ( a book , a CD , a tape , etc. ) must take place .
In this sense , the Copyright Act is n't really cognizant of the concept of digital distribution of copyrighted works — it just is n't on the law 's radar at all .
Apparently , the DMCA did n't really fix things in this regard , either .
As far as the courts are concerned , the issue of distribution and digital transmission is significantly murkier .
The EFF 's brief illuminates just how murky the issue is , with some courts taking for granted that digital transmission does constitute infringing distribution and at least one lower court hewing to the letter of the law and ruling that it does not .
The EFF therefore urges the US District Court to be the first court to explicitly tackle the issue of digital transmission and distribution , and to define " distribution " so that it requires the exchange of a physical object .
The part that 's fascinating and somewhat ironic , at least to me , is that the EFF is now in the position of arguing in favor of an outmoded , pre-Internet concept of " distribution , " and one that runs directly counter the plain sense of the way that both the language and the concept of " digital content distribution " is currently employed in just about any online venue where the topic is discussed .
Would anyone argue that Apple is not , in fact , in the business of distributing music now ?
( Actually , that 's a bad example , because Apple may be arguing exactly that in their ongoing dispute with Apple Records .
Still , you get the point . )
Anybody who moves music , video , and text online is in the " distribution " business , more or less .
That 's how we think about it , and that 's how we talk about it .
So does it really make sense to continue to define distribution strictly in terms of the transfer of material objects , and then to adopt the fiction that consumers of digital content are somehow licensed " reproducers " and that the distributors of it are not actually doing any " distributing . "
I 'm not actually sure what 's to be done here .
On the one hand , the RIAA can't be allowed to single - handedly remake copyright law so as to favor its own business model and possibly wreck the Internet .
But on the other hand , copyright law needs to be fundamentally rethought for the digital age .
I just do n't trust anyone in Washington — neither those in Congress who 'll vote on any overhaul legislation nor those on K Street who'll write it — to do anything but stick it to consumers and innovators .
The last time we tried something even remotely like this , we got the DMCA .
Conclusions
Ultimately , the Elektra v. Barker case is about case law and legal precedent .
On one side is the RIAA and their allies , who'd like to have a high court " clarify " in a ruling that will bind the lower courts that digital transmission is indeed " distribution " per the Copyright Act .
On the other is the EFF , who would also like a binding , clarificatory ruling to the opposite effect .
However this case turns out , it 's going to have major repercussions for everyone in the digital content business .
And however it turns out , I have no doubt that it 's only the opening salvo in a battle that will take at least a decade to sort itself out .
This case will be appealed , regardless of who wins , and I 'm certain that the issue of digital transmission and distribution will eventually be dealt with in Washington , either by the US Supreme Court or by Congress .
On Monday , September 17 , 2007 , police at the University of Florida tasered Andrew Meyer , a 21 - year - old student , for asking Senator John Kerry challenging questions .
As Mr. Meyer writhed on the ground in agony , most of his fellow students sat passively in their seats and Senator Kerry , the only man in the building with the power to stop the torture , made no attempt to intervene .
This sad incident is much more than just an isolated attempt to squelch one dissenting voice at a small speaking engagement in Florida .
Indeed , the tasering of Andrew Meyer is a microcosm of the United States of America in the year 2007 .
The four players in the present - day American political drama were all represented at the University of Florida on Monday :
1 ) Andrew Meyer writhing on the ground in agony represents the Constitution and the freedom of speech and the protection from unlawful arrest that it enshrines .
2 ) The police holding Mr. Meyer to the ground and inflicting torture with 50,000 volts of electricity represent the fascist forces in America led by George W. Bush and their attempts to kill the Constitution .
3 ) John Kerry droning impotently on in the background and allowing the torture to occur through his shameful lack of courage and principle represents today 's Democratic Party .
4 ) The majority of the students who sat passively by while one of their own was tortured for speaking out represent the largely apathetic American populace .
And , of course , after the fact , the fifth and perhaps most important player in the drama made its inevitable entrance : the press .
Major press outlets and even some supposedly left - wing political blogs were united in suggesting that Mr. Meyer actually deserved to be tasered because of his history as a prankster .
Thus , the American media has sanctioned the torture of an American citizen who exercised his freedom of speech .
In this they stand firmly in the tradition of all fascist states , in which certain undesirables and those who dared to speak out were officially sanctioned as targets of violence .
As Naomi Wolf has rightfully pointed out , the tasering of Andrew Meyer will be remembered as a watershed moment in American history .
That much is certain .
The only thing that remains to be seen is how we , as Americans , react to it .
Will we sit passively by while our Constitution and our Democracy are murdered right before our eyes ?
Will we demand that our supposed political leaders take meaningful and principled action ?
Will we allow our press to make excuses for the fascist takeover of our country ?
The choice is clear : either we fight fascism right now with all our power , or we will be the next ones on the ground with a policeman 's knee on our throats and 50,000 volts of electricity coursing through our bodies .

Revealing once again how little we know about our oceans ' inhabitants , researchers announced discovery of two new marine species , including a Dwarf Killer Whale in Antarctica and a new species of beaked whale in the tropical pacific .
Loren Coleman has more over at Cryptomundo .
From one of his posts about these animals :
The oceans hold many natural history treasures and wonders .
New animals are being discovered at a faster rate from the seas than in freshwater or on land .
But these finds from the marine environment often get little attention from Homo sapiens versus , say , a new giant peccary or a new monkey .
Overnight , famed marine biologist Bob Pitman shared with me breaking news about several new marine mammal species .
The news will not get as much of a read as a fuzzy picture of a land mammal from the woods of Pennsylvania or of a rapid moving otter - like animal videotaped in Loch Ness .
That 's a darn shame .

Ai n’t Google Adwords a miracle o’ modern science ?
Here ’s a system that searches your web page for keywords , hunts for advertisers who wanna have their message displayed next to these keywords and then auctions the advertising space to the highest bidder .
All in the twinklin ’ of an eye .
Adwords is so good that it ’s made Google millions or billions or zillions ( who ’s countin’ ? )
What can game theory tell us about the future of this digital auction house ?
According to Sudhir “ Secrets ” Singh , an electrical engineer at the University of California , Los Angeles and his buddies , game theory suggests that everybody would benefit by the emergence of a new kind of online business that exploits the inefficiencies of the Adwords system .
Here ’s the thinkin’ .
There is a limit to the number of advertising slots on each page and this leaves advertisers a - scramblin and a -scufflin for spaces next to the most popular keywords .
Inevitably , the advertisers who miss out are left a -sobbin and a - wimperin at the end of the day .
The sobbers and wimperers are perfect fodder for the new businesses .
According to Secrets Singh , these businesses are gonna buy up popular keywords and then resell them to advertisers who want to ensure they do n’t miss out on a slot .
Secrets and his crew have built a model of this new market and calculated the revenues and payoffs for all parties .
The model assumes that this game is a symmetric Nash equilibrium , meaning that everybody plays in the same way ( or at least that nobody has anything to gain by unilaterally adopting a different strategy ) .
Under these circumstances everybody wins –the auctioneer , the reseller and the bidders .
Ain’t that a bee - yoo - tiful story ?
So ya’ll gonna see resellers springin up all over the place soon .
Secrets Singh and his buddies even have a start up called Ilial.com and there ai n’t no prizes for guessing what that ’s gonna be doin ’ .
They ’ll already be a - dreamin and a - wondrin about the zillions they gonna make .
I know ya’ll lurv a happy endin .
So ya’ll keep quiet about Adwords not being a symmetric Nash equilibrium .
Y’hear ?

Questions That Wo n’t Be Asked About Iraq
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
In the House of Representatives , September 10 , 2002
Soon we hope to have hearings on the pending war with Iraq .
I am concerned there are some questions that wo n’t be asked — and maybe will not even be allowed to be asked .
Here are some questions I would like answered by those who are urging us to start this war .
1 . Is it not true that the reason we did not bomb the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War was because we knew they could retaliate ?
2 . Is it not also true that we are willing to bomb Iraq now because we know it cannot retaliate — which just confirms that there is no real threat ?
3 . Is it not true that those who argue that even with inspections we cannot be sure that Hussein might be hiding weapons , at the same time imply that we can be more sure that weapons exist in the absence of inspections ?
4 . Is it not true that the UN ’s International Atomic Energy Agency was able to complete its yearly verification mission to Iraq just this year with Iraqi cooperation ?
5 . Is it not true that the intelligence community has been unable to develop a case tying Iraq to global terrorism at all , much less the attacks on the United States last year ?
Does anyone remember that 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and that none came from Iraq ?
6 . Was former CIA counter - terrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro wrong when he recently said there is no confirmed evidence of Iraq ’s links to terrorism ?
7 . Is it not true that the CIA has concluded there is no evidence that a Prague meeting between 9/11 hijacker Atta and Iraqi intelligence took place ?
8 . Is it not true that northern Iraq , where the administration claimed al - Qaeda were hiding out , is in the control of our " allies , " the Kurds ?
9 . Is it not true that the vast majority of al - Qaeda leaders who escaped appear to have safely made their way to Pakistan , another of our so - called allies ?
10 .
Has anyone noticed that Afghanistan is rapidly sinking into total chaos , with bombings and assassinations becoming daily occurrences ; and that according to a recent UN report the al - Qaeda " is , by all accounts , alive and well and poised to strike again , how , when , and where it chooses " ?
11 . Why are we taking precious military and intelligence resources away from tracking down those who did attack the United States — and who may again attack the United States — and using them to invade countries that have not attacked the United States ?
12 . Would an attack on Iraq not just confirm the Arab world ’s worst suspicions about the US — and is n’t this what bin Laden wanted ?
13 . How can Hussein be compared to Hitler when he has no navy or air force , and now has an army 1 / 5 the size of twelve years ago , which even then proved totally inept at defending the country ?
14 .
Is it not true that the constitutional power to declare war is exclusively that of the Congress ?
Should presidents , contrary to the Constitution , allow Congress to concur only when pressured by public opinion ?
Are presidents permitted to rely on the UN for permission to go to war ?
15 .
Are you aware of a Pentagon report studying charges that thousands of Kurds in one village were gassed by the Iraqis , which found no conclusive evidence that Iraq was responsible , that Iran occupied the very city involved , and that evidence indicated the type of gas used was more likely controlled by Iran not Iraq ?
16 .
Is it not true that anywhere between 100,000 and 300,000 US soldiers have suffered from Persian Gulf War syndrome from the first Gulf War , and that thousands may have died ?
17 .
Are we prepared for possibly thousands of American casualties in a war against a country that does not have the capacity to attack the United States ?
18 . Are we willing to bear the economic burden of a $ 100 billion war against Iraq , with oil prices expected to skyrocket and further rattle an already shaky American economy ?
How about an estimated 30 years occupation of Iraq that some have deemed necessary to " build democracy " there ?
19 .
Iraq ’s alleged violations of UN resolutions are given as reason to initiate an attack , yet is it not true that hundreds of UN Resolutions have been ignored by various countries without penalty ?
20 . Did former President Bush not cite the UN Resolution of 1990 as the reason he could not march into Baghdad , while supporters of a new attack assert that it is the very reason we can march into Baghdad ?
21 . Is it not true that , contrary to current claims , the no-fly zones were set up by Britain and the United States without specific approval from the United Nations ?
22 . If we claim membership in the international community and conform to its rules only when it pleases us , does this not serve to undermine our position , directing animosity toward us by both friend and foe ?
23 .
How can our declared goal of bringing democracy to Iraq be believable when we prop up dictators throughout the Middle East and support military tyrants like Musharraf in Pakistan , who overthrew a democratically - elected president ?
24 .
Are you familiar with the 1994 Senate Hearings that revealed the U.S. knowingly supplied chemical and biological materials to Iraq during the Iran - Iraq war and as late as 1992 — including after the alleged Iraqi gas attack on a Kurdish village ?
25 . Did we not assist Saddam Hussein ’s rise to power by supporting and encouraging his invasion of Iran ?
Is it honest to criticize Saddam now for his invasion of Iran , which at the time we actively supported ?
26 .
Is it not true that preventive war is synonymous with an act of aggression , and has never been considered a moral or legitimate US policy ?
27 .
Why do the oil company executives strongly support this war if oil is not the real reason we plan to take over Iraq ?
28 .
Why is it that those who never wore a uniform and are confident that they wo n’t have to personally fight this war are more anxious for this war than our generals ?
29 .
What is the moral argument for attacking a nation that has not initiated aggression against us , and could not if it wanted ?
30 .
Where does the Constitution grant us permission to wage war for any reason other than self - defense ?
31 . Is it not true that a war against Iraq rejects the sentiments of the time - honored Treaty of Westphalia , nearly 400 years ago , that countries should never go into another for the purpose of regime change ?
32 . Is it not true that the more civilized a society is , the less likely disagreements will be settled by war ?
33 .
Is it not true that since World War II Congress has not declared war and — not coincidentally — we have not since then had a clear - cut victory ?
34 .
Is it not true that Pakistan , especially through its intelligence services , was an active supporter and key organizer of the Taliban ?
35 .
Why do n’t those who want war bring a formal declaration of war resolution to the floor ofCongress ?

The Best of Ron Paul
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A former aide to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told Congress on Wednesday she “ crossed the line ” by letting politics influence the Justice Department ’s hiring process .
But Monica Goodling , the 33 - year - old counsel to Gonzales who resigned after Congress began an investigation of the firings of federal prosecutors , said she had a limited role with the case that has triggered bipartisan calls for Gonzales to resign .
“ I did not hold the keys to the kingdom , ” said the former employee of the Republican National Committee who testified only after being granted immunity from prosecution .
“ I was not the primary White House contact for purposes of the development or approval of the U.S. attorney replacement plan , ” which originated at the White House shortly after President George W. Bush was re-elected in November 2004 .
Indeed , Goodling , a graduate of conservative Christian leader Pat Robertson ’s Regent University law school who served as a senior counsel to Gonzales and the department ’s White House liaison , said Bush political adviser Karl Rove never contacted her about the firing of any prosecutor .
One of the dismissed U.S. attorneys was replaced by a former Rove aide .
Goodling was subpoenaed as part of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee ’s probe of Gonzales ’ firing last year of nine of the 93 U.S. attorneys , all Bush appointees .
She also faces an internal Justice Department investigation into whether she brought political questions into the hiring process for career positions , such as assistant U.S. attorneys .
That would violate federal law .

REGRETS MISTAKES
“ I do acknowledge that I may have gone too far in asking political questions of applicants for career positions and may have taken inappropriate political considerations into account on some occasions , ” Goodling told the House panel .
“ I regret these mistakes , ” said Goodling .
Asked if she believed she had done anything illegal , Goodling said : “ I know I crossed the line . ”
“ But I did n’t mean to , ” she added .
Bush and Gonzales have said the firings of U.S. attorneys were justified though mishandled .
They have rejected charges that some were politically motivated to impact ongoing federal probes involving Democratic or Republican lawmakers .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Gonzales , in earlier testimony before the committee , said he had not gone back to talk to staff involved in the firings “ in order to protect the integrity ” of the investigations .
Yet Goodling said Gonzales told her about his recollections of the dismissals in March , shortly before she resigned .
“ I did n’t know that it was maybe appropriate for us to talk about that at that point , and so I just did n’t , ” she said .
Goodling placed some of the blame for the furor over the fired prosecutors on Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty , denying claims she had withheld information from him before he testified to Congress in February .
“ Despite my and others ’ best effort , the deputy ’s public testimony was incomplete or inaccurate , ” Goodling said , adding , “ I believe the deputy was not fully candid about his knowledge of White House involvement in the replacement decision . ”
In a statement , McNulty said he testified truthfully “ based on what I knew at that time . ”
“ Ms. Goodling ’s characterization of my testimony is wrong and not supported by the extensive record , ” said McNulty , who recently announced plans to resign .
Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , vowed to push ahead with the probe , saying : “ The issues we are examining -- which include possible obstruction of justice , misleading Congress ... are quite serious . ”
But Rep. James Sensenbrenner , a Wisconsin Republican , called it a “ fishing expedition .
There ai n’t no fish in the water . ”
Ethics for Programmers : Primum non Nocere
I 've been mulling over these ideas for quite a while , and I think I may still have more thinking to do , but recent events have gotten me thinking again about the increasing urgency of the need for a professional code of conduct for computer programmers .
I posit that , in no uncertain terms , it is a strong ethical obligation on the part of the programmer to make sure that programs do , always , and only , what the user asks them to .
" The user " may in some cases be an ambiguous term , such as on a web - based system where customers interact with a system owned by someone else , and in these cases the programmer should strive to balance those concerns as exactly as possible : the administrator of the system should have no unnecessary access to the user 's personal information , and the user should have no unnecessary control over the system 's operation .
All interactions with the system should faithfully represent both the intent and authority of the operator .
Participants in the DRM debate implicitly hold the view that the ownership of your operating system , your personal information , and your media is a complex , joint relationship between you , your operating system vendor , the authors of the applications you run , and the owners of any media that pass through that application .
Prevailing wisdom is that the way any given software behaves should be jointly determined by all these parties , factoring in all their interests , and that the argument is simply a matter of degree : who should be given how much control , and by what mechanism .
I do n't like to think of myself as an extremist , but on this issue , I can find no other position to take .
When I hear lawmakers , commercial software developers , and even other open source programmers , asking questions like , " how much control should we afford to content producers in media playback programs ? " , I cannot help but think of Charles Babbage .
On two occasions I have been asked [ by members of Parliament ! ] , ' Pray , Mr. Babbage , if you put into the machine wrong figures , will the right answers come out ? '
I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question .
The " you do n't own your computer " paradigm is not merely wrong .
It is violently , disastrously wrong , and the consequences of this error are likely to be felt for generations to come , unless steps are taken to prevent it .
Computer programmers need a socially , and legally recognized code of professional ethics , to which we can be held accountable .
There have been some efforts in this direction , the most widely - known one being the
Although there are many different codes of ethics for medical doctors , a principle which echoes through them all is one which was formulated in ancient history , originally by
The idea is that , if you are going to be someone 's doctor , you have to help them , or at least , you should n't ever harm them .
Doctors generally regard this as a sacred responsibility .
This basic tenet of the doctor - patient relationship typically overrides all other considerations : the doctor 's payment , the good or harm that the patient has done or may do , and the advancement of medical science all take a back seat to the welfare of the patient .
In this modern day and age , where doctors often perform general anesthesia on their patients to prepare them for surgery , this understanding is critical to the credibility of the medical profession as it stands .
Who would knowingly submit themselves to a doctor , knowing that they might give you a secondary , curable disease , just to ensure they got paid ?
Lawyers have a similar , although slightly more nuanced , principle .
Anybody who has watched a few episodes of Law and Order knows about it .
A slightly more authoritative source than NBC , though , is the American Bar Association , who in their The professional judgement of a lawyer should be exercised , within the bounds of the law , solely for the benefit of his client and free of compromising influences and loyalties .
Neither his personal interests , nor the interests of other clients , nor the desires of third persons should be permitted to dilute his loyalty to his client .
( emphasis mine )
For criminal defense lawyers , these " compromising influences and loyalties " may include a basic committment to the public good .
A lawyer who represents a serial murderer who privately admits to having committed heinous crimes must , to the best of their ability , represent the sociopath 's interests and try to get them exonerated , or , failing that , the lightest sentence possible .
Low as we as a society might consider a lawyer who defends rapists and murderers , we would think even more poorly of one who gave intentionally bad advice to people who he personally did n't like , or sold out his client 's interests to the highest bidder .
A doctor 's responsibility is somewhat the same .
If a doctor is treating a deeply evil person , they are still obligated by the aforementioned sacred patient / doctor pact to honestly treat that person , not use their position as a doctor to proclaim a death sentence , or cripple them .
They are obligated to treat that person equitably , even if that person 's evil extends to not paying their medical bills .
This pattern is n't confined to professional trades .
Catholic priests have the concept of the " any circumstances , regardless of the possible harm to others .
A priest certainly should n't threaten their flock with knowledge of their confessed sins to increase contributions to the donation plate , even if one of them has confessed a murder .
In each case , society calls upon a specialist for navigating a system too complex for laymen to understand : the body , the law , and the soul .
In each case , both society at large and individuals privately put their trust completely into someone allegedly capable of navigating that system .
Finally , in each case , the trust of that relationship is considered paramount , above the practitioner 's idea of the public good , above the practitioner 's ( and other 's ) financial considerations .
There is a good reason for these restrictions .
Society has systems in place to make these judgements .
Criminal defense lawyers are not allowed to judge their clients because that 's the judge 's job .
Doctors are n't allowed to pass sentences on their clients because that 's the legal system 's job .
Catholic priests do n't judge their confessors because that 's God 's job .
More importantly , each of these functions may only be performed with the trust of the " client " - and it is important for the client to know that their trust will not be abused , even for an otherwise laudable goal , such as social welfare , because notions of social welfare differ .
I believe that computer programmers are a fourth such function .
Global telecommunications and digital recording are new enough that I think this is likely to be considered a radical idea .
However , think of the importance of computer systems in our society today .
Critical functions such as banking , mass transit , law enforcement , and commerce would not be able to take place on the scale they do today without the help of computer systems .
Apropos of my prior descriptions , every lawyer and doctor 's office has a computer , and they rely on the information provided by their computer systems to do their jobs .
More importantly , computers increasingly handle a central role in our individual lives .
Many of us pay our bills on a computer , do our taxes on a computer , do our school work or our jobs on computers .
Sometimes all of these things even happen on one computer .
Today , in 2005 , most of those tasks can be accomplished without a computer ( with the exception , for those of us with technical professions , of our jobs ) but as the public systems we need to interact with are increasingly computerized , it may not reasonable to expect that it will be possible to lead an average modern life in 100 years without the aid of a personal computing device of some kind .
If that sounds like an extreme time frame , consider the relative importance of the automobile , or the telephone , in today 's society versus 1905 .
It 's not simply a matter of convenience .
Today it is considered a basic right today for accused criminals to make a phone call .
Where was that right when there were no telephones ?
Another way to think of this relationship with technology is not that we do a lot of things with computers , but that our computers do a lot of things on our behalf .
They buy things .
They play movies .
They make legal claims about our incomes to the federal government .
Most protocol specifications refer to a program which acts on your behalf ( such as a web browser ) as a user agent to reflect this responsibility .
You are not buying a book on Amazon with your computer ; you click on some links , you enter some information , and you trust that your computer has taken this information and performed a purchase on your behalf .
Your computer could do this without your help , if someone has installed a malicious program on it .
It could also pretend to have made a purchase , but actually do nothing at all .
Here is where we approach the intersection between programming and ethical obligation .
Every time a user sits down to perform a task with a computer , they are , indirectly , trusting the programmers who wrote the code they will be using to accomplish that task .
Users give not only the responsibility of performing a specific task , they trust those programs ( and thereby their programmers ) with intensely personal information : usernames , passwords , social security numbers , credit card numbers - the list goes on and on .
There may be a technological solution to this problem , a way to limit the amount of information that each proram needs , and provide users with more control over what different programs can say to each other on their own computer .
Some very smart people are working on this , and you can read about some of that work on
, but the real problem is that it 's the top of a very long , very slippery slope .
Its advocates point at the top of that slope and say " See , it 's not so bad ! " - but where will it end ?
While I am annoyed , I 'm not really that concerned with the use of this kind of technology to prevent copyright violations .
It 's when we start using it to prevent other sorts of crimes that the real fear sets in .
Today , it 's considered almost ( but not quite ) acceptable that Sony installs the digital equivalent of a car - bomb on my computer to prevent me from copying music .
As I said at the beginning of this article - they do n't think that the practice is inherently wrong , simply that there are some flaws in its implmentation .
Where will this stop ?
Assuming they can perfect the technology , and given that my computer has all the information necessary to do it , will future versions of Sony 's music player simply install themselves and lie in wait , monitoring every download , and automatically billing you for anything that looks unauthorized , not telling me about it until I get my credit card statement ?
Whether unauthorized copying should be a crime or not , preventing it by these means is blatantly wrong .
Let me be blunt here .
It is simply using a technique to wring more money out of users because the technique is there .
Much like the doctor who cuts off your nose and wo n't reattach it until he gets paid for his other ( completely legitimate ) services , this is an abuse of trust of the worst order .
It does n't matter how much money you actually owe the doctor , or Sony : in any case , they do n't have the right to do violence to you or to your computer because of it .
What of " terrorism " ?
Will mandatory anti-terrorism software , provided to Microsoft by the federal government , monitor and report my computerized activities to the Department of Homeland Security for review ?
From here , I 'll let you fill in the rest of the paranoid ravings .
I do n't see this particular outcome happening soon , but the concern is real .
There is no system in place to prevent such an occurance , no legal or ethical restriction encumbent upon software developers which would prevent it .
This social dilemma is the reason I termed the IEEE / ACM ethics code " sophomoric " .
With the directionless enthusiasm of a college freshman majoring in philosophy , it commands " software engineers " to " Moderate the interests of [ themselves ] , the employer , the client and the users with the public good . " , to " Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user , the public , or the environment " , to " Obey all laws governing their work , unless , in exceptional circumstances , such compliance is inconsistent with the public interest . "
These are all things that a good person should do , surely , but they are almost vague enough to be completely meaningless .
These tenets also have effectively nothing to do with software in specific , let alone software engineering .
They are in fact opposed to certain things that software should do , if it 's written properly .
If the government needs to get information about me , they need a warrant , and that 's for good reason .
I do n't want them taking it off my computer without even asking a judge first , simply because a helpful software engineer thought it might be a " potential danger to the public " .
Software developers should start considering that accurately reflecting the user 's desires is not just a good design principle , it is a sacred duty .
Much as it is not the criminal defense lawyer 's place to judge their client regardless of how guilty they are , it is not the doctor 's place to force experimental treatment upon a patient regardless of how badly the research is needed , and it is not the priest 's place to pass worldly judgement on their flock , it is not the programmer 's place to try and decide whether the user is using the software in a " good " way or not .
I fear that we will proceed down this slippery slope for many years yet .
I imagine that a highly public event will happen at some point , a hundred times worse than this minor scandal with Sony BMG , and users the world over will angrily demand change .
Even then , there will need to be a movement from within the industry to provide some direction for that change , and some sense of responsibility for the future of software .
I hope that some of these ideas can provide direction for those people , when the world is ready , but personally I already write my code this way .
I 've written about this
So , like I said , this post is n't about Divmod - exactly - but when we say " your data is your data " ... we mean it .
This post is n't about Divmod , exactly .
I 've been mulling over these ideas for quite a while , and I think I may still have more thinking to do , but recent events have gotten me thinking again about the increasing urgency of the need for a professional code of conduct for computer programmers .
Mark Russinovich reported on Sony BMG 's criminal contempt for the integrity of their customer 's computers , and some days later CNET reported on Sony BMG 's halfhearted , temporary retraction of their crime .
A day later , CNet 's front page has news of Apple trying to institutionalize , as well as patent , a similar technique .
While the debate over DRM continues to rage , there are larger issues and principles at stake here that it does n't seem like anyone is talking about : when you run a program on your computer , who is really in charge ?
I posit that , in no uncertain terms , it is a strong ethical obligation on the part of the programmer to make sure that programs do , , and , what the user asks them to .
" The user " may in some cases be an ambiguous term , such as on a web - based system where customers interact with a system owned by someone else , and in these cases the programmer should strive to balance those concerns as exactly as possible : the administrator of the system should have no unnecessary access to the user 's personal information , and the user should have no unnecessary control over the system 's operation .
All interactions with the system should faithfully represent both the intent and authority of the operator .
Participants in the DRM debate implicitly hold the view that the ownership of your operating system , your personal information , and your media is a complex , joint relationship between you , your operating system vendor , the authors of the applications you run , and the owners of any media that pass through that application .
Prevailing wisdom is that the way any given software behaves should be jointly determined by all these parties , factoring in all their interests , and that the argument is simply a matter of degree : who should be given how much control , and by what mechanism .
I do n't like to think of myself as an extremist , but on this issue , I can find no other position to take .
When I hear lawmakers , commercial software developers , and even other open source programmers , asking questions like , " how much control should we afford to content producers in media playback programs ? " , I cannot help but think of Charles Babbage .
The " you do n't own your computer " paradigm is not merely wrong .
It is violently , wrong , and the consequences of this error are likely to be felt for generations to come , unless steps are taken to prevent it .
Computer programmers need a socially , and legally recognized code of professional ethics , to which we can be held accountable .
There have been some efforts in this direction , the most widely - known one being the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice .
As long as I 'm being extreme : this code of conduct is completely inadequate .
It 's sophomoric .
It 's confused about its own purpose .
It sounds like it was written by a committee more interested in promoting " software engineering " techniques , as defined by the ACM , than in ethics .
I 'll write a bit about exactly what 's wrong with it after I describe some similarities in existing professional codes of conduct which themselves have legal ramifications .
Although there are many different codes of ethics for medical doctors , a principle which echoes through them all is one which was formulated in ancient history , originally by Hippocrates but distilled into a catch - phrase by Galen : " First , do no harm .
" The idea is that , if you are going to be someone 's doctor , you have to help them , or at least , you should n't ever harm them .
Doctors generally regard this as a sacred responsibility .
This basic tenet of the doctor - patient relationship typically overrides all other considerations : the doctor 's payment , the good or harm that the patient has done or may do , and the advancement of medical science all take a back seat to the welfare of the patient .
In this modern day and age , where doctors often perform general anesthesia on their patients to prepare them for surgery , this understanding isto the credibility of the medical profession as it stands .
Who would knowingly submit themselves to a doctor , knowing that they might give you a secondary , curable disease , just to ensure they got paid ?
Lawyers have a similar , although slightly more nuanced , principle .
Anybody who has watched a few episodes ofknows about it .
A slightly more authoritative source than NBC , though , is the American Bar Association , who in their Model Code of Professional Responsibility ( the basis for the professional responsibility codes of most states ' Bar associations in the United States ) declare : For criminal defense lawyers , these " compromising influences and loyalties " may include a basic committment to the public good .
A lawyer who represents a serial murderer who privately admits to having committed heinous crimes , to the best of their ability , represent the sociopath 's interests and try to get them exonerated , or , failing that , the lightest sentence possible .
Low as we as a society might consider a lawyer who defends rapists and murderers , we would think even more poorly of one who gave intentionally bad advice to people who he personally did n't like , or sold out his client 's interests to the highest bidder .
A doctor 's responsibility is somewhat the same .
If a doctor is treating a deeply evil person , they are still obligated by the aforementioned sacred patient / doctor pact totreat that person , not use their position as a doctor to proclaim a death sentence , or cripple them .
They are obligated to treat that person equitably , even if that person 's evil extends to not paying their medical bills .
This pattern is n't confined to professional trades .
Catholic priests have the concept of the " seal of confession " .
If you confess your sins to a catholic priest , they are not to reveal those sins undercircumstances , regardless of the possible harm to others .
A priestshould n't threaten their flock with knowledge of their confessed sins to increase contributions to the donation plate , even if one of them has confessed a murder .
In each case , society calls upon a specialist for navigating a system too complex for laymen to understand : the body , the law , and the soul .
In each case , both society at large and individuals privately put their trust completely into someone allegedly capable of navigating that system .
Finally , in each case , the trust of that relationship is considered paramount , above the practitioner 's idea of the public good , above the practitioner 's ( and other 's ) financial considerations .
There is a good reason for these restrictions .
Society has systems in place to make these judgements .
Criminal defense lawyers are not allowed to judge their clients because that 's the judge 's job .
Doctors are n't allowed to pass sentences on their clients because that 's the legal system 's job .
Catholic priests do n't judge their confessors because that 's God 's job .
More importantly , each of these functions may only be performed with the trust of the " client " - and it is important for the client to know that their trust will not be abused , , such as social welfare , because notions of social welfare differ .
I believe that computer programmers are a fourth such function .
Global telecommunications and digital recording are new enough that I think this is likely to be considered a radical idea .
However , think of the importance of computer systems in our society today .
Critical functions such as banking , mass transit , law enforcement , and commerce would not be able to take place on the scale they do today without the help of computer systems .
Apropos of my prior descriptions , every lawyer and doctor 's office has a computer , and they rely on the information provided by their computer systems to do their jobs .
More importantly , computers increasingly handle a central role in our individual lives .
Many of us pay our bills on a computer , do our taxes on a computer , do our school work or our jobs on computers .
Sometimes all of these things even happen oncomputer .
Today , in 2005 , most of those tasks can be accomplished without a computer ( with the exception , for those of us with technical professions , of our jobs ) but as the public systems we need to interact with are increasingly computerized , it may not reasonable to expect that it will be possible to lead an average modern life in 100 years without the aid of a personal computing device of some kind .
If that sounds like an extreme time frame , consider the relative importance of the automobile , or the telephone , in today 's society versus 1905 .
It 's not simply a matter of convenience .
Today it is considered atoday for accused criminals to make a phone call .
Where was that right when there were no telephones ?
Another way to think of this relationship with technology is not that we do a lot of things with computers , but that our computers do a lot of things on our behalf .
They buy things .
They play movies .
They make legal claims about our incomes to the federal government .
Most protocol specifications refer to a program which acts on your behalf ( such as a web browser ) as ato reflect this responsibility .
You are not buying a book on Amazon with your computer ; you click on some links , you enter some information , and youthat your computer has taken this information and performed a purchase on your behalf .
Your computer could do this without your help , if someone has installed a malicious program on it .
It could also pretend to have made a purchase , but actually do nothing at all .
Here is where we approach the intersection between programming and ethical obligation .
Every time a user sits down to perform a task with a computer , they are , indirectly , trusting the programmers who wrote the code they will be using to accomplish that task .
Users give not only the responsibility of performing a specific task , they trust those programs ( and thereby their programmers ) with intensely personal information : usernames , passwords , social security numbers , credit card numbers - the list goes on and on .
There may be a technological solution to this problem , a way to limit the amount of information that each proram needs , and provide users with more control over what different programs can say to each other on their own computer .
Some very smart people are working on this , and you can read about some of that work on Ka-Ping Yee 's " Usable Security " blog .
Still , one of the experts there contemplates that perhaps , given the abysmal state of software today , perhaps the general public should n't even use the internet DRM is definitely a problem , but the real problem is that it 's the top of a very long , very slippery slope .
Its advocates point at the top of that slope and say " See , it 's not so bad ! " - but where will it end ?
While I am annoyed , I 'm not really that concerned with the use of this kind of technology to prevent copyright violations .
It 's when we start using it to preventsorts of crimes that the real fear sets in .

I 've written about this a couple of years ago , and I think there 's more to the issue , but I feel like this key point of accurately relaying the user 's intent is the first step to anything more interesting .
I do n't really know if a large group of people even agree on that yet .
So , like I said , this post is n't about Divmod - exactly - but when we say " your data is your data " ... we mean it .

Lord Goldsmith had given " outstanding service " to the country
He said he will leave his post next week - as Tony Blair quits after 10 years as prime minister .
Lord Goldsmith said he had been " immensely privileged " to serve what had been a record period of time for a Labour attorney general .
Tony Blair praised the work of Lord Goldsmith and said he could look at his time as attorney general with " personal and professional pride " .
Lord Goldsmith said he had wanted to move on for some time and had told Mr Blair and Gordon Brown he believed that now was the right time to make that move .
In his resignation letter to Mr Blair , the government 's legal adviser acknowledged the " challenge " of advising on the legality of the war in Iraq .
There was controversy over his advice that the 2003 invasion would be legal under international law amid claims he changed it under political pressure - something which he vehemently denies .
In his letter , Lord Goldsmith wrote of the past six years : " It hardly needs saying that during that period we have faced a host of challenges , many of them raising important legal questions .
" These include two conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , the fight against terrorism , the balancing of individual rights and collective security , continuing constitutional reform and the great progress towards peace and stability in Northern Ireland .
" I have been privileged to play my part in meeting these challenges . "
' Immense contribution '
In his written reply , the prime minister said Lord Goldsmith had " made a huge contribution " to the government 's success in improving the criminal justice system .
Prime Minister - in - waiting Mr Brown said Lord Goldsmith had given " outstanding service " to the country .
" His contribution to the country and this government has been immense , not least through transforming the Crown Prosecution Service , " he said .
" It is with my regret that he has made his personal decision to step down . "
All future attorney generals should take office only if Parliament agrees with the prime minister 's choice
Simon Hughes
Liberal Democrats
Lord Goldsmith profile
Lord Goldsmith will take part in a review of legal and other aspects of citizenship for Mr Brown .
Liberal Democrat president and legal spokesman Simon Hughes said Lord Goldsmith would be remembered as " one of the most controversial attorney generals in post - war British politics " .
" He will always share responsibility for the decision to invade Iraq and to drop the investigation into alleged corrupt dealings between BAE and the Saudi government in connection with Britain 's biggest ever defence contract , " he said .
Mr Hughes called for " different procedures " for decisions about any future prosecution on cash - for - honours , and " new arrangements " for the role and accountability of law officers .
" From now on , all future attorney generals should take office only if Parliament agrees with the prime minister 's choice , " he added .
“ We found that most young adults do n’t have an ingrained news habit , ” he said .
“ Most children today , when watching television , are not watching the same TV set that their parents are watching .
So even if their parents are watching the news every day , the children are likely to be in another room watching something else and are n’t acquiring the news habit . ”
The survey went a step further to see what the respondents meant when they said that they did pay attention to the news .
Those results , especially among the younger groups , were equally discouraging for the news industry , said Alex S. Jones , the director of the Shorenstein Center .
“ What we found is that what people mean when they say they are engaged in the news has much more of a glancing , superficial basis than anything we would have hoped , ” he said .
“ Young people seemed to think that just listening to the radio in the background was listening to the news . ”
The results were especially grim for newspapers .
Only 16 percent of the young adults surveyed aged 18 to 30 said that they read a newspaper every day and 9 percent of teenagers said that they did .
That compared with 35 percent of adults over 30 .
Furthermore , despite the popular belief that young people are flocking to the Internet , the survey found that teenagers and young adults were twice as likely to get daily news from television than from the Web .
Despite this , some in the industry say the situation is not hopeless .
Jane Hirt , the editor of RedEye , a free daily newspaper that is published by The Chicago Tribune specifically for young , urban professionals , said that her publication had succeeded and had even expanded its audience by adopting some of the lessons learned from television and the Internet and by experimenting with ways to tell stories .

If Naomi Wolf in her recent book " The End of America : A Letter of Warning To A Young Patriot " has it right , you do n't have much time to learn .
Wolf 's book is scarier than any Stephen King 's fantasy ( at least for me ) , I do n't recommend reading it at night .
The second book I started reading last night is " Takeover : The Return of the Imperial Presidency and the Subversion of American Democracy " by Charlie Savage .
I found this book even more interesting than " The end of America " because where Wolf 's book is prescriptive , Savage 's is descriptive ( the Stewart - Colbert two - headed monster should invite the author to the program if it has n't yet ) .
The first thing you need to remember is that tyrannies are extremely popular .
For one , they usually come to provide peace and order to societies that feel that things are out of control .
It does n't seem to matter that societies end up being as bucolic as cemeteries instead of as chaotic as a County fair , we have , after all , our well - cherished peace and quiet .
The other issue is that when people start being incarcerated , disappear , or begin to be otherwise " organized " , the rest of the society tends to shut down in a very human way .
You see , our instinct is to avoid pain and seek reward , when the threat of pain becomes too high , it is just natural to withdraw into silence .
Dictators usually herald this silence as the clear demonstration that the silent majority supports the system , hence the popularity of tyrannies .
So , if you are human , you may need to be aware of this little flaw of ours .
If you do n't mind a little bit of strong hand in order to have your well deserved comfort , here are a few simple steps that will allow you to participate in the social experiment of a totalitarian America :
Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman apparently thinks it would be a really good idea if the government could watch your every move :
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - Conn. ) , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , said Sunday he wants to â€œmore widelyâ€ use surveillance cameras across the country .
â€ œThe Brits have got something smart going in England , and it was part of why I believe they were able to so quickly apprehend suspects in the terrorist acts over the weekend , and that is they have cameras all over London and other of their major cities , â€ Lieberman said .
â€ œI think itâ€™s just common sense to do that here much more widely , â€ he added .
â€ œAnd of course , we can do it without compromising anybodyâ€™s real privacy.â€ 
Lieberman lamented the â€œpetty , partisan fightingâ€ in Congress and called on his colleagues to join together to upgrade the nationâ€™s electronic surveillance capabilities .
â€ œRight now , weâ€™re at a partisan gridlock over the question of whether the American government can listen into conversations or follow e-mail trails of non-American citizen , â€  he said on ABCâ€™s This Week with George Stephanopoulos .
â€ œThatâ€™s wrong .
Weâ€™ve got to solve that problem , pass a law to give the people working for us the ability to protect us.â€ 
The image was stunning : tens of thousands of saffron - robed Buddhist monks marching through the streets of Rangoon [ also known as Yangon ] , protesting the military dictatorship of Burma .
The monks marched in front of the home of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , who was seen weeping and praying quietly as they passed .
She had n’t been seen for years .
The democratically elected leader of Burma , Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since 2003 .
She is considered the Nelson Mandela of Burma , the Southeast Asian nation renamed Myanmar by the regime .
After almost two weeks of protest , the monks have disappeared .
The monasteries have been emptied .
One report says thousands of monks are imprisoned in the north of the country .
No one believes that this is the end of the protests , dubbed “ The Saffron Revolution . ”
Nor do they believe the official body count of 10 dead .
The trickle of video , photos and oral accounts of the violence that leaked out on Burma ’s cellular phone and Internet lines has been largely stifled by government censorship .
Still , gruesome images of murdered monks and other activists and accounts of executions make it out to the global public .
At the time of this writing , several unconfirmed accounts of prisoners being burned alive have been posted to Burma - solidarity Web sites .
The Bush administration is making headlines with its strong language against the Burmese regime .
President Bush declared increased sanctions in his U.N. General Assembly speech .
First lady Laura Bush has come out with perhaps the strongest statements .
Explaining that she has a cousin who is a Burma activist , Laura Bush said , “ The deplorable acts of violence being perpetrated against Buddhist monks and peaceful Burmese demonstrators shame the military regime . ”
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , at the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , said , “ The United States is determined to keep an international focus on the travesty that is taking place . ”
Keeping an international focus is essential , but should not distract from one of the most powerful supporters of the junta , one that is much closer to home .
Rice knows it well : Chevron .
Fueling the military junta that has ruled for decades are Burma ’s natural gas reserves , controlled by the Burmese regime in partnership with the U.S. multinational oil giant Chevron , the French oil company Total and a Thai oil firm .
Offshore natural gas facilities deliver their extracted gas to Thailand through Burma ’s Yadana pipeline .
The pipeline was built with slave labor , forced into servitude by the Burmese military .
The original pipeline partner , Unocal , was sued by EarthRights International for the use of slave labor .
As soon as the suit was settled out of court , Chevron bought Unocal .
Chevron ’s role in propping up the brutal regime in Burma is clear .
According to Marco Simons , U.S. legal director at EarthRights International : “ Sanctions have n’t worked because gas is the lifeline of the regime .
Before Yadana went online , Burma ’s regime was facing severe shortages of currency .
It ’s really Yadana and gas projects that kept the military regime afloat to buy arms and ammunition and pay its soldiers . ”
The U.S. government has had sanctions in place against Burma since 1997 .
A loophole exists , though , for companies grandfathered in .
Unocal ’s exemption from the Burma sanctions has been passed on to its new owner , Chevron .
Rice served on the Chevron board of directors for a decade .
She even had a Chevron oil tanker named after her .
While she served on the board , Chevron was sued for involvement in the killing of nonviolent protesters in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria .
Like the Burmese , Nigerians suffer political repression and pollution where oil and gas are extracted and they live in dire poverty .
The protests in Burma were actually triggered by a government - imposed increase in fuel prices .
Human - rights groups around the world have called for a global day of action on Saturday , Oct. 6 , in solidarity with the people of Burma .
Like the brave activists and citizen journalists sending news and photos out of the country , the organizers of the Oct.
6 protest are using the Internet to pull together what will probably be the largest demonstration ever in support of Burma .
Among the demands are calls for companies to stop doing business with Burma ’s brutal regime .

Heist !
There was a spectacular bank heist here the day after I moved to Buenos Aires .
What I know about it has all come through the thick veil of my rudimentary Spanish , so I 'm sure details and entire facts have been embellished to suit my sense of fun , but even in general outline it's a crime straight out of the movies .
On the afternoon of ( Friday ! ) January 13 , four gunmen walked into the Banco Rio in Acassuso ( part of greater Buenos Aires ) and took the staff and customers hostage .
There was a tense six hour long siege by the police , expertly handled by the robbers - they let each hostage call home , so that family members showed up at the scene ; the calculation was that the police would be more reluctant to storm the building immediately if hostages ' relatives were watching .
They made sure to release three hostages right away as a gesture of goodwill , but of course the three released included the security guard and police officer already in the building .
While one of the robbers stayed on the phone , negotiating with police , the remaining ones got busy cracking open safe deposit boxes .
Towards four in the afternoon , the police delivered six pizzas and some bottles of soda , the fruit of all those hours of negotiation , which the robbers passed along to the hostages .
And then they went silent .
After about an hour of no contact and no news , an elite police bank - storming squad stormed the bank , only to find a group of bewildered hostages sitting scared in the smoke .
There was no trace of the gunmen .
Initially the police suspected that the perpetrators had mixed in with the hostages , and questioned the hostages rather roughly as a result .
" The robbers treated us better than the police ! " , someone complained to the press later .
But after intense questioning , two things became clear to the Argentine boys in blue : all of the hostages ' stories checked out , and there was also a rather large tunnel leading out of the bank basement .
The tunnel led to an extensive storm sewer system that underlay all of Buenos Aires .
Geologists working with the police estimated it must have taken fifteen days or so to dig the tunnel , and that it had been dug within the last three months .
The entrance point in the bank was easily disguisable by making a proper arrangement of furniture , one of many reasons the authorities suspected an inside job .
The robbers had unburdened the bank of 600,000 pesos ( $ 200,000 US ) and 145 of the largest safe deposit boxes , which officially were not supposed to contain more than fifty thousand dollars each , but unofficially were probably full of things that their owners did not particularly want declared to the Argentine fiscal authorities .
The cash and the boxes were floated out either onto the River Plate or to a nearby superhighway in inflatable rubber motorboats - the tunnels were marked with special paint visible only with night - vision goggles - and the eight or so perpetators then departed to take their well - deserved retirement in Brazil or the Carribean .
The guns they used turned out to be props .
Apart from some rough handling of hostages by police , no one was hurt .
I read about this heist on my second day in the city , sitting in a beautiful jewel of a pastry shop , eating the medialunas ( croissants ) that they regrettably glaze with sugar here in an attack of confectionary insecurity .
Below the newspaper with the heist story was a glossy magazine with a ten - page photo spread on a derelict Diego Maradona attending somebody 's wedding .
And I knew I 'd come to the right country .
Life Is Far Too Short To Drink Cheap Beer – 10 Ways To Maximize Your Beer Value
By Al at Hop Talk
Editors Note : I wrote a piece on how to save money on beer awhile back and Al chasized me for only considering how to save money and not about how to get true value .
In response , he has put together this list of how to get the best value out of the beer you buy .
First , stop thinking of beer as a commodity .
It ’s not toilet paper , or screws , or an all - you - can - eat buffet .
Stop thinking of beer in terms of the bland , yellow , fizzy beverages foisted on the American public by huge brewing conglomerates .
Not just the big American brewers , who have spent countless marketing dollars convincing most of us that beer is supposed to be bland , yellow , and fizzy , but also their overseas counterparts who offer essentially the same product but use the additional marketing message that theirs is better because it ’s imported .
In spite of being upwards of 80 % + of the American domestic beer market , American light lagers are by no means the entire universe of beer .
In the U.S. alone , the Brewers Association recognizes well over 100 distinct styles of beer , and even within those styles are the brewer ’s own variations .
Beer is a food .
It is made from grain ( almost always barley ) , hops , yeast , and water .
Except for the hops , and if the grain was milled into flour instead of malted for brewing , you ’d have a basic bread recipe .
When is bread best ?
As fresh as possible .
It is just as true for beer .
To stretch the beer as bread analogy a little further , industrial - brewed American light lagers are the beer equivalent of Wonder Bread .
Do n’t you want a nice , hearty loaf ?
So , if you are ready slough off the misconceptions of maximizing quantity of your beer and instead get the most value , i.e. , enjoyment , out of your beer , here are some simple tips .
1 . Shun the sun : Beer ’s number one enemy is light .
Riboflavin acts as a photosensitizer , which causes the production of singlet oxygen from ultraviolet and visible light .
The oxygen then reacts with substances called Isohumulones , which comes from the hops , to create a substance called MBT ( 3 - methylbut - 2 - ene - 1 - thiol ) .
It is , essentially , the same chemical that skunks use to defend themselves .
“ Skunked ” beer just what it sounds like .
As such , brown bottles are best , and green bottles are n’t much better than clear ones .
Cans , obviously , will also work , but there are n’t many craft brewers who use cans .
2. Keep it cool :
While heat wo n’t affect your beer the same as light , it can cause it ’s own issues .
For one thing , greater chance of oxidation .
Oxidized beer tastes like cardboard .
It can cause other off - flavors as well .
You should store your beer in a cool , dark place .
3 . Stay fresh : Beer , like bread , which is a very similar recipe , is better when it is fresher .
( There are a couple of styles which can be cellared , but that ’s outside the scope of this discussion . )
Depending on the style , beer has , at best , a shelf - life of about six months to a year .
A better target is three or four months .
Beyond that you risk getting off - flavors or , at the very least , a beer that does n’t taste its best .
Look for a “ brewed on ” or “ best before ” date .
Unfortunately , not all brewers do this , and far too many retailers leave stock on the shelves until it sells .
Here ’s a clue : if the bottles are dusty , do n’t buy it .
4 . Buy local :
Not to get all “ green ” on you , but try to buy from brewers who are within , say , 150 miles of you .
Less transportation means less pollution , of course .
But it also means lower transportation costs , meaning more money can be put toward the ingredients of the beer .
A shorter travel distance also means the beer is more likely to be fresh .
And , of course , has had fewer opportunities to encounter light and / or warm storage .
5 . Serve it properly :
In a glass : A large part of our sense of taste comes from our sense of smell .
If you ca n’t smell the beer while you ’re drinking it , like drinking it from the bottle , you ’re missing most of the flavor .
Some beer purists will tell you that each beer style should be served in its own special glassware .
I do n’t disagree , but let ’s not get crazy here .
At the very least , use a glass ( not plastic ) that allows you to smell the beer while you ’re actually drinking it .
Also , there ’s “ clean ” and there ’s “ beer clean ” .
Beer glasses should be hand - washed with a minimum of soap .
Actually , baking soda would be a better option .
Your beer glasses also should n’t be used to drink anything else .
Besides , how else are you going to see the pretty color ?
6 . Serve it properly : Not ice cold :
When too cold the aromas of the beer are not present or very weak .
You want to maximize the aroma to have the best flavor .
The proper temperature varies by style , of course ( pilsners I would serve around 40 degrees Fahrenheit , stout a bit above 50 degrees ) but there ’s no need to start dipping a thermostat into your beer .
When you take a bottle out of the refrigerator , open it , and let it sit on the counter for five , ten or fifteen minutes .
It will be much more flavorful than if you drink it right after taking it out of the fridge .
In general , lighter styles should be colder than darker styles , but that ’s not hard and fast .
This is a good one to experiment with .
7 . Pour strong !
Again with the aromas .
When pouring , do n’t carefully dribble the beer down the side of the glass .
Pour it down the middle .
You want to “ break the carbonation ” and release the aromas .
Aim for ( again , depending on style ) about two fingers ’ width of head .
The bubbles in the head should be small and the head itself should be creamy or fluffy .
8 . Find your style :
With over 100 different styles , you are bound to find something , or several somethings , that you like .
Maybe you like the spicy hop bitterness of a pale ale , the mild sweetness of a brown ale , the roasted goodness of a porter , the fruity spiciness of a hefeweizen , or the clean crispness of a pilsner .
You ’ll never know unless you try .
If you ’re having more than one style in a single sitting , start with the lightest and finish with the heaviest .
This will keep your tastebuds from being overwhelmed .
9 . Pair it up :
There is a school of thought that says that beer pairs better with cheese than wine .
That ’s not all , of course .
Many people have heard that oysters make an excellent companion to an Irish stout .
Me , I love having an IPA with anything spicy , like chili or Buffalo wings .
The right beer can be paired with just about anything .
Look for “ beer dinners ” at restaurants near you .
The Brewer ’s Alley in Frederick , Maryland sponsors one about every three months .
There are usually about five courses , each paired with a different beer , including dessert .
10 . Invite your friends :
Beer should be shared .
Beer is social .
Ancient peoples would sit around a communal pot and drink their beer through reeds .
( Probably because of all the grains floating in it . )
When I get together for a beer with my friends , very often we ’re talking about the beer we ’re drinking .
But , then , most of my friends are beer geeks like me .
It does n’t matter what the occasion is .
Beer with friends is the best beer in the world .

Gillian Gibbons is described as " a talented and able teacher "
Colleagues of Gillian Gibbons , 54 , from Liverpool , said she made an " innocent mistake " by letting the six and seven - year - olds choose the name .
Ms Gibbons was arrested after several parents made complaints .
The BBC has learned the charge could lead to six months in jail , 40 lashes or a fine .
Officials from the British embassy in Khartoum are expected to visit Ms Gibbons in custody .
" We are in contact with the authorities here and they have visited the teacher and she is in a good condition , " an embassy spokesman said .
The spokesman said the naming of the teddy happened months ago and was chosen by the children because it is a common name in the country .
" This happened in September and the parents did not have a problem with it , " he said .
' Very sensitive '
The school has been closed until January for fear of reprisals .
Fellow teachers at Khartoum 's Unity High School told Reuters news agency they feared for Ms Gibbons ' safety after receiving reports that men had started gathering outside the police station where she was being held .
The school 's director , Robert Boulos , said : " This is a very sensitive issue .
We are very worried about her safety .
They came up with eight names including Abdullah , Hassan and Muhammad
Robert Boulos
Director of Unity High School
" This was a completely innocent mistake .
Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam . "
Mr Boulos said Ms Gibbons was following a British national curriculum course designed to teach young pupils about animals and this year 's topic was the bear .
Ms Gibbons , who joined the school in August , asked a seven - year - old girl to bring in her teddy bear and asked the class to pick names for it , he said .
" They came up with eight names including Abdullah , Hassan and Muhammad , " Mr Boulos said , adding that she then had the children vote on a name .
Twenty out of the 23 children chose Muhammad as their favourite name .
Mr Boulos said each child was then allowed to take the bear home at weekends and told to write a diary about what they did with it .
He said the children 's entries were collected in a book with a picture of the bear on the cover and a message which read , " My name is Muhammad . "
Book seized
The bear itself was not marked or labelled with the name in any way , he added .
It is seen as an insult to Islam to attempt to make an image of the Prophet Muhammad .
Mr Boulos said Ms Gibbons was arrested on Sunday at her home inside the school premises after a number of parents complained to Sudan 's Ministry of Education .
I know Gillian and she would never have meant it as an insult .
I was just impressed that she got them to vote
Muslim colleague in Sudan
He said police had seized the book and asked to interview the girl who owned the bear .
The country 's state - controlled Sudanese Media Centre reported that charges were being prepared " under article 125 of the criminal law " which covers insults against faith and religion .
No -one at the ministries of education or justice was available for comment .
Mr Boulos told the BBC he was confident she would not face a jail sentence .
One Muslim teacher at the independent school for Christian and Muslim children , who has a child in Ms Gibbons ' class , said she had not found the project offensive .
" I know Gillian and she would never have meant it as an insult .
I was just impressed that she got them to vote , " the teacher said .
In Liverpool , a family spokeswoman said Ms Gibbons ' grown children , John and Jessica - both believed to be in their 20s - were not commenting on her arrest .
Gillian Gibbons had been working in Khartoum since August
" I have spoken with her children and they do not want to say anything and aggravate the situation over there , " she said .
Rick Widdowson the headteacher of Garston Church of England Primary School , where Gillian worked for ten years , added : " We are an Anglican school and I know for a fact that Gillian would not do anything to offend followers of any faith .
" Certainly she is also very worldly wise and she is obviously aware of the sensitivities around Islam . "
Cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad printed in several European newspapers sparked violent protests around the world in 2006 .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Patent Busting Project takes aim at another patent as the EFF and lawyer Rick Mc Leod have joined forces to request a USPTO re-examination ( PDF ) of an Ideaflood patent on " virtual subdomains . "
According to the request , the patent in question describes capabilities that had already been implemented in Apache when the patent was filed .
The patent in question was filed in 1999 and approved in 2004 .
Patent holding company Ideaflood had it for a while , but the patent has now been transferred to a company called Hoshiko .
While Ideaflood owned the patent , it threatened sites like LiveJournal unless they coughed up the cash — and all of this over a technology that was n't particularly complex and was n't ( allegedly ) even novel .
Patent busting , EFF style
The Ideaflood patent describes virtual subdomains .
The idea here is that it would be impractical for companies with large number of subdomains ( blog hosts that offer username .
bloghost.com , for instance ) to create new DNS records for each subdomain .
The solution was to use " virtual " subdomains that put a wildcard in the DNS record .
Instead of creating a thousand DNS entries for ann .
bloghost.com , bob.bloghost.com , crazycarl.bloghost.com , etc. , there would only be a single entry , *.bloghost.com , and it would resolve to a single IP address .
The webserver at that IP address would then read the host request ( ann.bloghost.com ) and parse it so that it pointed to Ann 's public HTTP folder residing somewhere on the server ( ~login / public_html or wherever ) .
Mc Leod , who wrote the re-examination request , points out that this capability was already being used early in 1998 by Apache 's mod_rewrite module , written by Ralf Engelschall .
Engelschall 's work and other people 's comments on it are preserved in developer newsgroups and could be enough to show that this was a commonly - understood technology by one " skilled in the art . "
" This illustrates how an open - source project can establish a public record of technology development and thwart invalid patents , " said EFF senior staff attorney Jason Schultz .
" The public discussions on the Apache and other mailing lists have shown that Ideaflood 's patent claims were without merit and that the patent should be revoked before it causes any more damage to innovation on the Internet . "
This prior art is the grounds for the re-examination , as Mc Leod argues that the patent describes techniques that were already " integral and configurable features of the single most popular Web server software available , the Apache Web server , httpd , " at the time of the filing .
Of the ten top patents targeted by the Patent Busting Project , three have already had re-examination requests ( one of those requests , against Test.com 's online test - taking patent , has already been granted ) .
A fourth patent , Clear Channel 's live concert recording " invention , " has already been overturned .
Members of the highly respected National Association of Headteachers will this week tell Parliament that the issue is starting to change the culture of some schools .
Some heads said the issue was ' out of control ' .
While praising the ability of the new pupils , many of them from eastern Europe , and emphasising that they should be welcomed into schools , headteachers are concerned they do not have the amount of money needed to cope with the issue .
' There is a feeling among some of our members that this is out of control and unpredictable , ' said Mick Brookes , general secretary of the NAHT .
Brookes , who will give evidence this week to a Parliamentary inquiry investigating the impact of immigration on British society , added : ' Some schools just do n't know how many migrant children they will have to admit . '
He said that while schools could absorb one or two foreign pupils , some were struggling with the sudden large increase in the numbers of children from overseas :
' If you get a sudden influx not only will it strain or even break the resources of the school , it will also change the culture of that school . '
Clarissa Williams , head of Tolworth Girls ' School in Kingston upon Thames , south London , said she received £ 1,300 a year from the government to cover the costs of teaching English to foreign pupils but was having to spend £ 30,000 of her own budget to keep pace .
' These children just appear from nowhere , ' Williams said .
' They turn up on your doorstep and if you have space you have to make the necessary arrangements .
It places a significant additional strain on budgets . '
On Tuesday the association will tell the House of Lords economic affairs committee that education budgets have not kept pace with the increase in the number of pupils for whom English is a second language , or not spoken at all , who have entered Britain since the European Union expanded three years ago .
The ethnic minority achievement grant , the main funding stream for schools , has increased marginally from around £ 160 m to just under £ 180 m since 2005 , when countries from the former eastern bloc joined the EU .
But over the past three years , hundreds of thousands more migrant children have entered Britain 's education system .
Figures compiled by the Institute for Public Policy Research think - tank show that , since EU expansion , there are now some 12,900 children from the Czech Republic in British schools , 30,400 from Lithuania , 170,000 from Poland and 28,700 from Slovakia .
' It 's important all children are welcomed into schools and that they feel partt of the community , ' Brookes said .
' But there is a lot of pressure on school capacity to absorb these additional children . '
Experts suggest the pressures are being felt particularly in some rural schools that until now have experienced little of the impact of migration .
With foreign workers now filling agricultural vacancies in such counties as Lincolnshire , some schools now find themselves accommodating significant numbers of foreign pupils .
Last year 96 children who did not speak English unexpectedly joined primary schools in Boston , Lincolnshire , alone , more than doubling the number attending the previous year .
' This can have a real impact on school league tables , ' Brookes said .
' We need to look at how we deal with the new challenges facing these sorts of schools . '
Jill Rutter , a senior research fellow with the IPPR , said it was time for the government to reassess the provision of English language teaching to migrant pupils .
' The main need of migrant children is to learn English , ' Rutter said .
' But funding of English language learning is just not keeping pace with the number of migrant children entering British schools .
If we are not careful we are going to fail a generation of schoolchildren . '
Experts say the system for channelling additional funds to the more needy schools is flawed .
Additional emergency funding is made available only if the number of pupils in a local authority region increases by 2.5 per cent or more .
For somewhere like West Sussex , for example , this would require an overall increase of 2,275 pupils .
A spokesman for the Department of Children , Schools and Families pledged there would be a ' sustained ' increase in funding for English language teaching , and that by 2010 the ethnic minority achievement grant would reach £ 206 m .
There is considerable evidence that both falling in love and long term attachment are associated with the levels of various chemicals in the brain .
Suppose we learn enough about the process to be able to control it artificially .
What might the results be and should we approve ?
A couple fall in love and get married .
To properly regulate their emotions thereafter , they get a prescription for a few months of " being in love " drugs and use them to enjoy their honeymoon and the beginning of their marriage .
Being in love is too intense an emotion for the long term , so they then switch to the " long term attachment " prescription .
Later , as their schedules permit , they temporarily switch back in order to experience a second , third , fourth honeymoon .
That is , however , only the first step in the social changes made possible by the new technology .
Currently , falling in love is usually a necessary step in the process that leads to marriage .
But should it be ?
It is not at all obvious that the person you fall in love with is the best candidate for a long term relationship — a point made long ago by defenders of the old system of having parents choose mates for their children .
Our emotions , after all , are driven by processes generated by Darwinian selection in a very different environment and " designed " not for our happiness but for reproductive success — the interest not of us but of our genes .
The new drugs provide a new option — choice of mate not by either our parents or our hormones but by our reason .
You employ some suitable search strategy to find a woman who is well suited to be your wife and will think you well suited to be her husband .
Once the marriage contract is signed , the final step in the ceremony is for both of you to take your love drugs .
You look deep into her eyes ... .
Courtesy of YouTube , some supreme audacity from the former Mayor of New York and the former Governor of Massachusetts when confronted with people for whom medical marijuana is a real , everyday , issue :
First , Il Duce :
Then , Romney :
The utter disregard for the suffering of real people that drips from the canned rhetoric of these two men is , in a word , disgusting .
And , no , I am not talking about that pesky little war in Iraq where we actually have hundreds of troops being killed in a foreign country .
That only makes news when something “ newsworthy ” occurs because we all know a real war is such a downer to talk about .
I am talking about the “ newsworthy ” war that we all should apparently be up in arms about .
The Mommy Wars .
Are you battle ready ?
Did you buy your fatigues and kiss your family goodbye ?
No ?
Shame on you !
You are at war !
I sat down to try to write a fair and balanced report on this topic .
However , there is not one thing that is fair or balanced about this media fueled war .
In fact , my keyboard is whimpering in pain as I slam out these words .
Once again the media has grabbed hold of one woman ’s opinion about another and simply had to exploit it into the Mommy Wars .
I am so sick of this being blown out of proportion and doing nothing but stirring controversy and anger .
Why do n’t you report it as you really appear to consider it ?
“ Good morning !
Today we will be talking about another Rowrrrr Cat Fight between a few women .
Stay tuned .
We ’ll take a hard hitting look at this issue after we report on this pesky Iraq situation . ”
Yes , morning “ news ” shows , I am talking to you .
Today Show ?
Good Morning America ?
CBS
This Morning ?
I have a question for you .
Who are you helping ?
What greater good are you serving when anytime there is a difference of opinions between at least two mothers you immediately jump on the “ Ohhhhh , the Mommy Wars are in full battle mode ! ” and then talk about it as if all mothers are attacking each other ?
Is your purpose to get us fighting ?
Is it to make us judge each other ?
Or is it just so that you can get us mad enough we talk and you get the ratings ?
I will give you the fact that you get us talking .
About you .
About how sick and tired we are of being thrown into your “ war ” and causing strife among a massive portion of the population who quite honestly would rather find support and acceptance from each other .
Can you show me a list of the people you are helping when you are exploiting your Mommy Wars ?
I can certainly give you a massively extensive list of people you are hurting .
Surely , that is not your intent .
Is it ?
I know I am not alone in my feelings of wanting to end your Mommy Wars once and for all .
A comment from techmama hits it the point many of us feel .
I also commented on another post that people seem to be missing an important point :
Why does the media so quickly jump on controversial issues ( by blowing it up and throwing in the word “ mommy wars ” ) without showing other opinions ?
Sharing opinions is just that .
Has the media covered moms in support of families staying together on the road ?
Or is that not news worthy ?
Can moms have a good debate on issues without the media or public viewing it as mommy wars ?
In the comments about this issueBeth — also of Silicon Valley Moms Blog– brings up a very important point about this entire Mommy Wars topic that gets the media whipped into a frenzy .
One point that is being lost is the media frenzy about creating “ mommy wars ” from opinions mom have on specific issues .
They do n’t jump on it when moms talk about their positive thoughts – but if a mom dares share a controversial view – then they jump on it .
I want to see the media share our positive messages also .
I am tired of this !
Exactly !
Why ca n’t there be more stories on support , helping one another , or the tons of support groups that Moms are involved in ?
Where is your story on BlogHers Act ?
Where is your story on Moms supporting another Mom who has cancer ?
Those who rally around her and are doing things to support her in her life ?
Where are those stories ?
Is there going to be a day where every woman–every mom–agrees with each other ?
Of course not .
If I hear another mom say that all women should work outside the home full time or they are poor examples to their children , will I agree with her ?
No .
Does that put me at war with her ?
Absolutely NOT .
On the other side of the coin , if I hear a mother say that every mom should stay at home with her children or they are bad mothers , will I agree with her ?
Of course not .
Am I at war with her ?
Absolutely NOT .
We do n’t want your “ war . ”
We do not want to be exploited for your Mommy War ratings .
Do you want to know what we want ?
We want to find an even playing field where we can both agree and disagree without having the media jump into the fray and tell us we are at “ war ” with each other .
We want to find support and learn from our different experiences .
We want you to know that we do n’t always have to agree with each other to still respect each other .
We CAN agree to disagree without your contrived controversies and made - up wars .
Now even Katie Couric is being thrown into this and having her mothering attacked by covering the REAL war in Iraq .
In two separate segments yesterday , Fox News attacked CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric for reporting from the ground in Iraq , calling it “ a desperate move ” and asking if it was a “ ratings ploy or legitimate journalism . ”
She is doing her job .
HER JOB , people .
But no .
It is not her job that is in question .
It is her mothering .
On Your World With Neil Cavuto , guest host Dagen McDowell featured Janice Crouse of Concerned Women for America , who characterized Couric ’s trip as “ a clear act of desperation ” by a single mother whose “ priorities [ are ] so determined by her ambition rather than her children ’s welfare . ”
Crouse pointedly accused Couric of being a bad mother for going to cover Iraq : I would say the same thing if this were a man journalist going out there , a male anchor , because when you look at the choice she ’s making , she ’s saying my ratings are more important than my children .
That ’s the bottom line . “
First , there are many men journalists going out there and I have yet to read an attack on his parenting skills .
Secondly , I have searched all over to find Katie Couric saying that her ratings are more important than her children and have yet to find it .
Why ?
Because that is NOT what she is doing .
Just as Elizabeth Edwards is not a terrible mother for taking her children on the campaign trail .
Two different high profile mothers .
Two different situations .
Both being attacked for their personal choices .
I have been taken to task before for talking about the Mommy Wars here as it gives them a forum .
I respectfully disagree .
You wo n’t silence me when you throw trash at me .
You are going to from hear me .
And you are going to hear me tell you that you are wrong to pit mothers against mothers .
Because that appears to be the goal here .
It has been noted that the reason the Mommy Wars exist in first place is because women can be judgmental and vicious to each other .
Really ?
There ’s a newsflash for you .
You can title it DUH !
But to add fuel to that fire and use your weapons of mass destruction against us only hurts mothers everywhere –regardless of who they are .
( And trust me on this one .
There are weapons of mass destruction used in this “ war ” and I can find them easily and show you how you are making this war worse for motherhood as a whole . )
End it .
Now .
It is time for mothers to just stand up and say ENOUGH .
We do n’t have to agree with each other .
We do n’t have to live the same lifestyles , make the same choices or have the same political views to work together to stop this overly blown out of proportion “ war ” that we did not sign up for or agree to be a part of .
Are you sick of this , too , Moms ?
Then let ’s end it .
Stand with me and tell the media to cut the crap , end their fueling of this idiocy and let us be who we are without pitting us against each other .
Because frakly , I have children to raise and a life to live and do n’t have time to fight the Mommy War that the media so badly wants me to fight .
I am over it .
OVER .
IT .
Are you , too .
Share it .
Speak out against it .
Write about it .
Tell them to cut the crap and move along to real stories .
It ’s what I am doing and will continue to do .
Because Moms ?
I am not at war with you .
I never have been and have no plans on enlisting .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Record melting of Arctic sea ice this year sent a “ very alarming ” signal about warming at the North Pole , but it could n’t all definitely be blamed on manmade climate change , the U.N. ’s top weatherman said on Tuesday .
Michel Jarraud , head of the U.N. World Meteorological Organisation , speaks during the Reuters Environment summit at the Reuters headquarters in London October 2 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Simon Newman
The amount of Arctic ice which melted this summer beat a previous record , set two years ago , by an area more than four times the size of Britain , a 30 - year satellite record shows .
“ This year was quite exceptional ... the melting of the Arctic ice ... it ’s quite spectacular , ” Michel Jarraud , secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation , told Reuters .
“ Can it all be attributed to climate change ?
That ’s very difficult .
It ’s very , very alarming , ” he said .
His answer to how best to interpret the melt was -- “ let ’s do more research ” .
“ What it means is that we have to monitor that very , very carefully .
It ’s a warning signal . ”
Melting of sea ice does n’t affect sea levels because it ’s entire volume is already in the water , but scientists fear if it melted that could trigger more warming and melting of ice sheets over Greenland , which could raise sea levels by 7 meters .
Asked if scientists should have better predicted the rate of sea ice melting now seen Jarraud said : “ I do n’t know the answer .
It ’s a difficult question .
Some of the models predicted faster melting than others . ”
The prospects for avoiding dangerous climate change depended on the world putting in place measures to cut emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for heating the planet , he said .
But things were looking up .
“ There ’s a lot more political attention on this issue .
I take it as a positive signal , ” he said , referring to two high - level climate meetings last week hosted by the United Nations and the United States in New York and Washington .
POLITICAL ATTENTION
Vast geographical and scientific gaps in the global meteorological and oceanographic monitoring system had to be filled urgently , said Jarraud .
The world ’s weather centers spent $ 5 - 10 billion a year in total , and for every extra $ 1 billion spent up to 10 times that amount could be saved in preparing for and better reacting to climate disasters , Jarraud said .
The ultimate goal , he said , would be to refine climate change forecasting from a coarse global level down towards a regional or even national level so governments could plan in detail how to prepare .
“ We are very confident that over the next five to 10 years we will be better able to answer questions of regional outlook , ” Jarraud said .
The U.N. - sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) this year concluded global warming was definitely happening and almost certainly manmade .
A fifth such IPCC report in six years time would yield answers to whether the increasing frequency and severity of specific extreme weather events , like hurricanes , floods and heatwaves , was linked to climate change .

Amanita muscaria and Cannabis Sativa - Keys to Christianity ?
- BUY SOMA
by Jason Fitzgerald
Adapted from an e-mail to the Global Ideas Bank .
Editorial comment :
We hold no brief for marijuana - indeed there are credible research reports which state , for instance , that it can trigger schizophrenia in susceptible individuals .
But the following article is an interesting restatement of the claim that Christianity has emerged from an ancient mushroom cult .
Christianity is a mature enough religion not to take offence at this exuberant anthropological excursion into its possible prehistory .
The Rig - Veda , one of humanity 's oldest scriptures , contains over 1,000 poems extolling the merit and virtues of ' King Soma ' , who is portrayed as a lightning - born , mountain - residing deity and a urine - tinged elixir of health & strength , as well as being praised as the direct means of communion with the Divine and as the supreme poetic & musical inspiration .
R. Gordon Wasson 's Soma : Divine Mushroom of Immortality 1969 ) identifies Soma as a mixture of amanita muscaria , a mushroom found under conifer trees having a blood - red cap spotted with white thornlike crusts , and the resinous flowers of cannabis sativa , commonly known as ' marijuana ' .
' Muscimol , the psychoactive element of Amanita muscaria , remains active in urine for up to seven re-ingestions '
Wasson notes ancient Hindu scriptures depicting urine drinking as bestowing spirituality , just as Siberian shamans drink the urine of amanita muscaria - fed reindeer which exhibit appropriate signs of mushroom intoxication in order to gain insight and wisdom .
This is because muscimol , the psychoactive element of Amanita muscaria , remains active in urine for up to seven re-ingestions or for use by others , which the shamans drink as a holy wine , the epitome of true transubstantiation .

John Marco Allegro used Wasson 's theory and comparative linguistics to decipher the Gospels of Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls .
He was summarily dismissed from the translation team for these documents upon publishing his findings in The Sacred Mushroom & the Cross 1970 ) .
Clark Heinrich published his further research on entheogens - organic substances which enhance feelings of the Divine residing within those who partake - in Strange fruit - Alchemy & religion , the hidden truth 1995 , Bloomsbury Press ) , explicating the case for the amanita muscaria as the interpretive key to the mythic symbolisms of the Vedas , Torah and Talmud and Gospels of Jesus , as well as the true identity of the Philosopher 's Stone of Alchemy and the Holy Grail , which Heinrich suggests is simply the chalice - shaped mushroom .
' The role of Messiah or " Anointed One " - literally , " one smeared with semen " '
Jesus as a symbol of the mushroom
Jesus is portrayed as the Son of God , sent to fulfil the role of Messiah or ' Anointed One ' - literally , ' one smeared with semen ' .
As a mushroom , the amanita muscaria does not disseminate seeds as plants do , but ejaculates microscopic spores which create a threadlike fungal network at the base of conifer trees from which thunderstorms elicit more mushrooms .
Prior to knowledge of spores , lightning was thought to be the source of mushrooms and lightning was considered the fiery progenitive spears of God , hence the phallic fungi were called ' Sons of God ' .
The mushroom 's spore ejaculate leaves an oily film on the blood - red cap spotted with white thorns , hence the term ' Messiah ' ( ' Anointed One ' ) and allusions to thistle - entwined , bloody - browed sacrifices , such as the miraculous ' Ram ' of Abraham ( Genesis 22:13 ) and Jesus the thorn - crowned ' Lamb of God ' .
' Mushrooms were also seen as " winged " creatures , or crowned by a cloudy cap or " halo " , each carrying a " message " from God '
Mushrooms were also seen as ' winged ' creatures , or crowned by a cloudy cap or ' halo ' , each carrying a ' message ' from God , the very definition of an ' Angel ' .
Some mushrooms were ' good ' or nutritious , some were ' evil ' or poisonous , but amanita muscaria was considered ' blessed ' and capable of bestowing health , strength , inspiration and the power of prognostication .
Ingestion of the amanita muscaria can revive the deathly ill and enables people to perform unusual feats of strength .
The Gnostics used the mushroom to access ' gnosis ' or ' sacred knowledge ' and become privy to seeing the ' Kingdom at hand . '
The experience can also result in a very deep sleep , giving the appearance that the partaker has died , only to be ' resurrected ' as the effect wears off .
The decaying mushroom smells like rotting flesh thus attracting flies , hence another term for the mushroom , ' fly agaric ' .
Flies seem to die on contact with the mushroom , but if observed for a period of about 12 hours , however , the insects experience ' resurrection ' and fly away .
As John Allegro points out , the ' Cross ' is merely the cuneiform symbol of the mushroom , just as the ' Asclepius ' , or snake - entwined staff topped by a winged disc found on nearly all medical facilities , is also just an ancient symbol of the mushroom .
Jesus as a symbol of marijuana
Jesus is also portrayed as the offspring of a female virgin named ' Mary ' , who represents cannabis sativa or hemp , since female plants are cloistered , or kept separate from male plants , in order to produce more THC , the medicinal chemical found in the resin of cannabis flowers which are commonly known as marijuana .
' Jesus performs healings astonishingly similar to the confirmed medicinal effects of THC '
Jesus , the offspring of the Blessed Virgin , performs healings astonishingly similar to the confirmed medicinal effects of THC .
Healings of Jesus Diseases THC treats
Blindness Glaucoma
Deafness Tinnitus
Lameness Arthritis
Sickness Nausea ; Cramps ; Migraine
' Leprosy ' Skin Lesions
' Demon- Possession ' Epilepsy ; Multiple Sclerosis
Not only does cannabis heal people , it also restores topsoil to poor land such as the Jews were relegated to .
Mark 4:3 - 8 , the Parable of the Sower , is a premier hemp reference since ( a ) hemp seed is the favoured food of most species of bird ; ( b ) hemp grows very quickly ( having four seasons per year in climates as diverse as Siberia & Jamaica ) ; and ( c ) hemp , unlike wheat and other crops , replicates itself 30- , 60 - and 100 - fold , as any good ' weed ' should .
Cannabis was the basis of pre-industrial civilisation , providing Earth 's most nutritious food for humans & animals ( hemp seed ) , rope and canvas for tents & clothing ( ' canvas ' being derived from the word ' cannabis ' ) , fuel for heating & cooking ( seed oil ) , the means of fishing & sea travel ( sails , rope for rigging and nets , sealant for boats ) and wood oil & varnish ( aged seed oil ) , part of the occupational means of a carpenter , which Mary 's husband , Joseph , is portrayed as being .
The importance of the Jesus myth
If Jesus is just a fictional personification of psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana , what is the significance of his capital punishment at the hands of civil and religious authorities and his subsequent resurrection celebrated on Easter ?
Jesus life and execution symbolise the inherent antagonisms between Earth 's organic bounty of food , provisions and medicine plus the natural fact of human mortality versus the pseudo - scarcity economics of the centralised technological state and the empty assurances of human immortality by esoteric ecclesiastic polities , which both profit from human misery and sickness as well as from environmental ignorance and disregard .
By prohibiting and criminalising the very essence of ' Jesus ' , the modern state fully realises its biblical designation as the ' Anti - Christ ' , orchestrating the monopolisation of ecology and economy by corporations whose inferior substitutes for botanic resources desecrate the Earth and its inhabitants - an ' abomination causing desolation ' .
Ironically , it is very often those who designate themselves as Christians who are most vocal and active in their support for measures to persecute and imprison those who actually know ' Jesus ' more intimately than any self - righteous prohibitionist ever could , even as so - called Christians read and study the Gospels of Jesus as printed on the tissue - thin hemp paper used in the majority of modern Bibles ( source : Zondervan Books ) .
They reject the true sacrament and settle for stale bread and sour grapes .
' Jesus ' resurrection symbolises Earth 's faithful yielding of the true sacrament '
Jesus ' resurrection symbolises Earth 's faithful yielding of the true sacrament as well as the undying hope that humanity might learn to recognise and embrace both the natural means of living and the natural fact of dying and henceforth live abundantly , even under penalty of imprisonment , persecution and death .
In demonstrating that most sacred myths are symbolisms of psychedelic mushroom & marijuana use , Wasson , Allegro and Heinrich undermine claims of unique access to communion with the Divine as well as claims of entitlement to eternal life and bliss made by those who effectively prohibit the easiest means of feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , sheltering the indigent and attending the sick by criminalising the ' soma ' ( see Note below ) of Jesus , King of kings .
Note : ' Body ' in Greek , Mark 14:22 .

Franco Fabbro 's site with mosaics from the Basilica of Aquileia : www.etnoteam.it/maiocchi/fabbro.htm
This country has been heading downhill for a long time and we only have ourselves to blame .
When the attacks on the USS Cole happened , we were outraged .
Blackhawk Down was a movie that hurt American Pride .
When the attacks on the World Trade Center happened , nobody asked the right questions , we were all too mesmerized by the constant repetition of those planes hitting the towers over and over again .
The American people wanted someone to pin it on , and the Bush Administration , after they finally had the guts to come back to Washington , gave us the perpetrators .
How quickly they had all 19 terrorists identified and their recent histories ready for publication .
It didnâ€™t seem odd to anyone that while Bush was flying around in Air Force One , the only other airplanes that were in the air were members of Bin Laden family and members of the Saudi Royal Family .
I was always told to be careful of the company you keep .
It didnâ€™t surprise anyone that most of the members of the gang that supposedly did the hijackings were mostly Saudi citizens ?
I watched Bush ratchet up the hysteria toward Iraq and Saddam .
At that time even the Democrats were foaming at the mouth .
I volunteered to go to Afghanistan but came down with cancer .
Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t go .
I would still probably be in the Army at 56 rears old , fighting in Iraq , a country that had nothing to do with any attack on America .
I learned something back then , something that I knew at thirteen when I watched a â€ œSpecial Reportâ€ on television while my mother was in the kitchen making dinner .
She walked into the living room near the end of LBJâ€™s speech .
She asked me what was going on .
I turned to her and said â€œitâ€™s war Mom , the government said that North Vietnamese patrol boats attacked American destroyers and now heâ€™s going to send the rest of the Army in there .â€ 
She asked me why would patrol boats attack destroyers ?
I told her so LBJ could send the Army in .
I shook my head and went down to my room in the cellar and fumed , mad as hell at the government for blowing things out of proportion .
You might believe that Iâ€™m making this up , but I assure you that what Iâ€™m writing here is the truth .
I absolutely knew then that it was ridiculous to believe that Vietnamese patrol boats tried to take on American Navy destroyers .
The rest of the country didnâ€™t think it was unbelievable .
In fact , Congress let LBJ have Carte Blanche to do exactly as he pleased .
The same way 30 years later that Congress rolled over and did exactly the same thing over again with Iraq .
You see , at first itâ€™s that old â€œfight or flightâ€ instinct .
Works every time .
When Hitler invaded Poland , he said that the Polish Army had overrun a radio station on the border with Poland .
The German Army took some old polish uniforms , put them on convicted criminals and shot them to death at the radio station .
They had a newsreel of some old trucks with polish markings crashing through the fence and then had German commandoâ€™s in Polish Uniforms shoot civilians that were surrendering .
The stage was set .
Of course nobody asked how the German Army just happened to be there en masse , that was immaterial .
The German citizens wanted blood , and they got it too .
So much blood that even now Europeans donâ€™t have the thirst for the stuff they used to have .
Itâ€™s easy to scare Americans in this New Century .
Just ell them that they are going to be attacked , over and over .
Goebbles claimed that if the lie is outrageous enough and you repeat it often enough , it becomes the truth .
â€ œWe fight them there so that we donâ€™t have to fight them hereâ€ .
Even Barak Obama has tried to counter Hillary Clinton by claiming that he would attack Pakistan if he knew he could â€œchop of the head of al Qaedaâ€ .
Look , we donâ€™t know if Osama Bin Laden is alive .
Iâ€™m sure that taking out a few terrorists isnâ€™t worth proving to the Pakistani People that we are so callous to bomb their country without asking , thereby causing more problems in Pakistan that could possibly topple Musshirif and bring on a government of Islamic fundamentalists just isnâ€™t worth it .
He has gone from â€œnegotiatingâ€ with people to threatening them , isnâ€™t that odd ?
Meanwhile Hillary Clinton , when mentioning dictators threw in Hugo Chavez .
I thought that he was a democratically elected President of Venezuela ?
Just by that one â€œslipâ€ of the tongue you can see that if she is elected , that itâ€™s going to be business as usual for America .
We still donâ€™t talk to Cuba , even though that country has been at peace for the longest time that I can remember in my lifetime .
Iâ€™m tired of having official â€œenemiesâ€  that we are always trying to thwart and governments we are always trying to topple , and sanctions that we are always imposing .
When will America take care of business at home ?
Our infrastructure is crumbling beneath us .
Estimates are it will cost one and a half trillion dollars to make it right .
We have already spent almost a Trillion on this war in Iraq .
Why not rebuild this country and put people back to work ?
These are the questions that people are asking .
If we were making sure that oil money was going back into the peopleâ€™s pockets that live on top of the oil , instead of into transnational oil companies that America seems to revere , maybe we wouldnâ€™t have so many jihadists .
Kuwait does a pretty good job of spreading their wealth around .
How many Kuwaitiâ€™s are jihadists ?
Our entire vision of the world is skewed .
We are always searching for the antagonists , as if they must be there all of the time .
We are either rewarding other nations or punishing them .
It never stops and unless we change our mindset , it never will stop .
Look at the Middle Eastern countries .
These people have been carved up into artificial States , they have constantly been raped of their resources by corporate controlled governments and Big Oil Companies since the day the Ottoman Empire fell .
We have been the cause of these terrorists .
We are the ones that set up al Qaeda to fight the Russians .
We supplied the Taliban .
As long as they were on our side against the Russians , we didnâ€™t give a damn what they did .
Now itâ€™s us they are after , and we wonder why .
We are so morally opposed to these people now .
We know why , we all do .
When the Shah was in power , we turned a blind eye to the way he treated his people .
Is it any wonder that when they deposed this make - believe American imposed Shah that they attacked his benefactor ?
Not once did we take responsibility for what we did to the Iranian people .
We were the ones that made Saddam a military power .
The Iraqi people have NEVER benefited from the sale of their own oil .
How long did we let that go on ?
In almost every case we ourselves are to blame for our bad relations with other nations .
It comes out of our mindset of either play the game we want you to play , or we will punish you .
This is how America has operated since the end of the Second World War .
Itâ€™s about time that this way of doing business stops .
We can always , like Theodore Roosevelt said , â€œspeak softly but carry a bug stickâ€ .
The only time that stick should be used however , is when American lives are at stake .
At the moment though , not ten years down the road .
Thatâ€™s fodder for another pre-emptive war .
We must understand that we are but a member of this community of nations , not the worldâ€™s dictator .
We need to replace suspicion with compassion .
We need to replace ignorance with understanding .
We must change who we are and what we stand for .
This isnâ€™t a very nice country in the eyes of the world .
Not only is our infrastructure collapsing around us , so is our attempt to shape the world in our image .
What makes this world such an interesting place is because of the differences among nations .
We are not the first great civilization , nor will we be the last great civilization ( unless we destroy this planet ) .
We need to be a part of this world again , not the principle player in our own playbook .

Medford , Ore. --
Pat Hardy hefted two book bags stuffed with " cozy murder mysteries " through the snow to Ella Fitzsimmons ' front door at the Blue Spruce Mobile Estates trailer park .
" I brought you extra , because this will be your last delivery , " said Hardy , who has been bringing the bloodless whodunits to the homebound 78 - year - old every month for the last several years .
Fitzsimmons ' literary lifeline will be cut April 7 , when Jackson County in southern Oregon shuts down its entire public library system .
The 15 libraries serving this rural forest community lost $ 7 million in federal funding this year -- nearly 80 percent of the system 's budget .
[ Podcast : Kids :
We like our libraries ]
[ Podcast : The Breakfast Club at Sally 's Kitchen in Medford , Oregon , on the merits of a sales tax and whether libraries are worth saving ]
Now , not long after all 15 branches were rebuilt or remodeled , every one will be shuttered in what 's being called the largest library shutdown in the United States .
The crisis in southern Oregon can be traced not only to changing funding priorities on Capitol Hill , but also to crooked railroad deals in the Wild West , a spotted owl and a shrinking timber harvest .
Struggling library systems have come close to extinction in Salinas , Merced County and Niagara Falls , N.Y. , but they pulled back from the brink , said Leonard Kniffel , editor of American Libraries magazine .
Nothing , he said , compares to the scope and severity of the pending closure in Jackson County , where about 100 library employees will be laid off .
Although the Bay Area is on a library high , having just opened four state - of - the - art libraries in Alameda , Belmont , Hercules and San Mateo , book lovers like Fitzsimmons in rural areas are getting left in the dark .
" I am very ticked ! " she said .
" Something screwy is going on . "
Her sentiment is shared throughout southern Oregon , where the library crisis has stirred accusations of county mismanagement , children 's protests in the streets , and a backlash against a proposed property tax to keep the libraries open .
An otherwise quiet collection of former timber towns , Jackson County has drawn national attention as librarians and book lovers lament in the blogosphere about the demise of a society that can't find a way to safeguard the citizenry 's right to stay informed .
" I wish we could call FEMA ; this feels like a natural disaster to me , " said Ted Stark , interim library director for Jackson County .
" Libraries are so much more than just libraries in rural areas .
This is where all the town meetings are held , where all the kids come after school , where everything -- everything -- happens , " he said .
Indeed , today ;s libraries have evolved from merely loaning out books to providing Internet access , reading hour for babies , community meeting centers and art galleries .
Last fall , Congress failed to reauthorize a $ 400 million annual subsidy to 41 states to help rural counties prop up their local economies .
Oregon took the biggest hit -- $ 150 million .
Jackson County lost $ 23 million and had to slash everywhere , from reducing jail beds to cutting search and rescue teams .
That meant some hard choices , said Jackson County Administrator Danny Jordan .
" Losing libraries is a huge business deterrent -- who wants to move to a city that does n't have libraries ? "
Jordan said .
" But we decided we had to maintain public safety , which is already taking a $ 3.5 million cut .
We wo n't be able to monitor misdemeanor sex offenders anymore .
The hard reality is that libraries are not an option for us . "
Jordan says Congress broke a promise when it cut off the funds -- the money was supposed to be in exchange for land taken away from Oregon by President Theodore Roosevelt .
In the early 1900s , Roosevelt took 2.4 million acres away from the Oregon - California Railroad , which was accused of swindling land deals in exchange for building the railroad .
When the federal government reclaimed the land , Oregon lost half its property tax base .
To make up for it , the federal government agreed to split timber revenues on the acreage with Oregon .
Over the next 50 years it was a lucrative arrangement , and timber money was used to build courthouses and jails , pave roads and free Oregonians from having to pay sales taxes .
The good times petered out in the early 1990s , when the northern spotted owl was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act , all but shutting down large - scale logging .
Today , just one large sawmill remains in Jackson County , compared with 91 in 1954 .
While promising to come up with rules for a more ecologically friendly logging method , Congress agreed in 2000 to continue " safety net " payments to rural counties for six more years .
But no one did the hard work of figuring out how to balance the timber industry with nature .
So the checks stopped in December 2006 .
" The federal government stopped making money off of Oregon trees , so they stopped sending money to us -- it's that simple , " said Leonard Kranenburg , a retiree who meets his " breakfast club " buddies every morning at Sally 's Kitchen in Medford for coffee and conversation .
In November , Jackson County residents voted down a property tax levy that would have generated $ 9 million a year to keep the libraries open .
It was the third time since 1984 that voters were asked to bolster the library budget , but the first time they said no .
" Back in November , the feds had not cut us off yet , and the possibility they 'd continue to fund us was still there , so people did n't think the libraries were really going to close , " said Margaret Jakubcin , a regional manager for the Jackson County Libraries .
Library supporters are trying again .
They put an identical property tax levy on the upcoming May ballot .
But in order to pass , 50 percent of the registered voters have to participate in the election , and a majority of them have to vote yes .
While Kranenburg 's breakfast companions Sixto Rodriguez and Joe Camp say they will vote for it , Kranenburg sees a moral imperative to say no .
" The government broke their promise to Oregon , " he said .
" I see this as our way of fighting back .
We can't give in .
If we do , that 's like taking away our guns . "
Librarians have become political lightning rods in Jackson County .
" Some people come into the library and cry when they find out ; others yell at us , " said Luke Kralik , who just earned his master 's degree in library science so he could work in the new Medford Central Library .
The contemporary 83,000 - square - foot stone and concrete building has enormous glass panels on the second floor , children 's gardens , bronze sculptures in the reading room and a computer network that allows librarians to answer instant message reference questions .
" There 's something magical about the public library -- those moments when you help a kid find a book on wolves , or someone comes in with a family member whose just been diagnosed with something and they need help finding information , " Kralik said .
" I can't imagine what it would be like if that were gone . "
Joy Davis , who has been blogging about the impending closure of her branch in the small town of Phoenix , said she 's been getting sympathy worldwide in response to her posts .
" When I first heard the library is going to close , I almost passed out -- I had to sit down , " said Davis , who checks out about 30 books a week to research her writing projects .
Currently , she 's interested in pinpointing the source of the conflict between creationism and evolution .
" I have a set of Britannica books , but that 's not really a replacement , " she said .
Despite her Internet savvy , Davis does n't trust online information and depends on the library for solid data .
Kniffel , the American Libraries magazine editor , said most people feel the same way , and despite the advent of electronic information , library visits nationwide increased 61 percent between 1994 and 2004 .
" Say you search something online and get 550,000 hits .
How do you know which one is the right one ? " he said .
" You need a knowledgeable navigator to help you . "
Miranda Canfield , 13 , worries she will get F's on her essays if she can't rely on the librarians at Central Point Library in Jackson County .
" All my friends at school are talking about the libraries , and we were thinking of collecting cans or cleaning up yards to raise money to keep them open , " she said .
While libraries have become the most contentious political issue in southern Oregon , everyone can agree that a long - term funding solution is needed .
" We 're tired of begging Washington for money , " said Jackson County Commissioner C.W. Smith .
There 's talk in Jackson County of bringing back sustainable - yield logging , cities running their own libraries , and even mention of the unmentionable -- instituting a sales tax .
Local politicians are pressuring Congress for a one - year rural funding extension .
Smith has two suggestions .
He wants the government to keep half the Oregon timber lands as wildlife habitat but allow the state to sell the other half so the land could go back on the tax rolls .
While the spotted owl 's listing " has been tied up in courts for nearly two decades , the trees did n't stop growing , " said Smith , pointing to a map of forest fires in his office .
The red blotches on the map indicate a steady increase in forest fires since 1980 .
" In some areas , the Forest Service is paying $ 400 an acre just to thin it , " he said .
Smith is also talking to school superintendents and city mayors about pooling resources to keep the libraries open .
" Whether we could make it work would vary from community to community , " he said .
In Talent , a town of 20,000 halfway between Medford and Ashland , residents shared cake Monday at the grand opening of their new public library .
The foyer was decorated with a neighbor 's collection of gleaming pink conch shells , each one the size of a football .
Three times the size of the old library , the new 7,000 - square - foot branch has a teen room with a graffiti wall , a Spanish - language section , and floor - to - ceiling windows in the children 's area that allow parents to read on indoor couches while keeping an eye on the playground outside .
" We 're trying to be upbeat , but how ironic is it to celebrate an opening that 's going to last six weeks ? " said branch supervisor Laurel Prchal .
If the property tax proposal on the May ballot fails , she fears the libraries are sunk .
" In 2000 , when Congress started paying the timber subsidies to Oregon , we were in a surplus .
We were n't at war .
We did n't just have a massive hurricane in New Orleans , " she said .
Prchal raised the new flag for the first time outside the Talent Library .
But its first trip to the top of the mast was a short one .
Prchal waited a few seconds , then lowered it halfway -- an Oregon soldier had been killed in Iraq .
At the Ruch Branch , a 30 - minute drive east of Medford , artist Marvin Rosenberg lovingly pointed out the ceramic pieces of the library 's mural .
Residents of all ages made the pieces and pressed them into a cement backing :
There were black bears , covered wagons , Canada geese , salmon , lumberjacks , even Bigfoot peeking from behind a tree .
The fire chief had pressed his badge into the mural .
" This place is our home .
This is our community center .
This is where we problem - solve .
They can't take this away , " Rosenberg said .

The Chronicle
( CNN ) --
A sheriff 's deputy who killed six young people at a house party in Crandon , Wisconsin , apparently died after shooting himself three times in the head with a .40 - caliber pistol , the state attorney general said .
Tyler Peterson , a sheriff 's deputy , shot and killed six people , police said .
Initial reports that 20 - year - old Tyler Peterson was killed by a police sniper 's bullet were apparently incorrect , though it appears the sniper may have shot Peterson in the arm , Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said .
Although the final forensic determination could take several weeks , the attorney general said that Peterson had his personal .40 - caliber Glock when police found him .
The three gunshots to the head came from a .40 - caliber .
" The three gunshot wounds to the head included two nonfatal rounds with entry points below the chin , and one fatal shot that entered Peterson through the right side of the head , " Van Hollen said .
" Each of the three head shots were fired while the gun was in contact with his skin , or extremely close to the skin , " he said .
" These three head wounds are consistent with self - inflicted wounds , and not consistent with long - range rifle fire . "
The fourth gunshot wound , Van Hollen said , struck Peterson in the left bicep and appeared to have been fired from a rifle " at some distance . "
Watch Van Hollen explain the shootings " will never make sense " »
Peterson was a Forest County sheriff 's deputy and a part - time officer with the Crandon Police Department .
According to Van Hollen , Peterson , while off - duty shortly before 3 a.m.
Sunday , entered a house where the seven young men and women had gathered .
While there , Van Hollen said , Peterson apparently got into an argument with Jordanne Murray , accusing her of having a relationship with another person .
" The argument got heated , and Murray demanded he leave , " the attorney general said .
" Peterson left , and returned minutes later , " breaking down the door and opening fire with an AR - 15 rifle , of the type he was issued by the Forest County Sheriff 's Department .
Police said Peterson fired about 30 rounds .
Fewer than 20 minutes later , a patrolling Crandon police officer , after hearing gunfire , reported it and went to the house to investigate , Van Hollen said .
The officer , Greg Carter , 21 , reported seeing Peterson leave the house with a rifle .
After momentarily losing sight of Peterson , Carter " heard multiple rounds of gunfire " and his windshield burst .
Peterson escaped .
Van Hollen said that Peterson apparently " drove aimlessly around the northern part of the state " for several hours , calling in false reports to police to throw them off .
Peterson ended up at a cabin in the town of Argonne shortly before 8 a.m .
He told friends about the shootings , handed over the AR - 15 and two other rifles and left the cabin .
After meeting with family members , he returned to the cabin around 9:15 a.m .
Police arrived about 15 minutes later , Van Hollen said .
Peterson was killed during a police shootout after police could n't persuade him to surrender .
All seven victims were students or graduates of Crandon High School , from which Peterson also was a graduate .
In addition to Murray , the dead were identified as Aaron Smith , Bradley Schultz , Lindsey Stahl , Lianna Thomas and Katrina McCorkle .
The sole survivor , Charlie Neitzel , 21 , " played dead " after Peterson shot him three times , Van Hollen said .
After Peterson shot him once , Neitzel begged him to stop .
But Peterson fired again .
Neitzel fell to the floor , was shot a third time and did n't move .
" Playing dead until Peterson left , Neitzel survived , " Van Hollen said .
Neitzel was the last person shot .
Neitzel underwent surgery Tuesday and was in stable condition Tuesday night , a hospital employee said .
The families of the six slain young people asked that media leave them alone in their grief , Van Hollen told reporters .
But the families of the victims also wanted it known that they had met with Peterson 's family .
" They hold no animosity toward them , " Van Hollen said , conveying the families ' wishes that the Peterson family be allowed space and time to heal .

Talk about problems with obesity .
Astronomers have discovered a massive , record - setting black hole in a nearby galaxy that is confounding theories of how such objects should form .
The 3 - million - light - year - distant M33 X - 7 is apparently about 15.7 times the mass of our Sun , making it the most massive black hole created from the collapse of a star yet observed , researchers say .
But as part of a binary star system , orbiting a star fully 70 times the mass of the Sun , it presents a whole range of puzzles , and a fascinating future .
Says Jeffrey McClintock , of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics :
" This is a huge star that is partnered with a huge black hole . …
" Eventually , the companion will also go supernova and then we ’ll have a pair of black holes . "
The ponderous star - black hole system is so far leaving scientists scrambling to explain how it could exist .
Under normal theories of star evolution , the black hole must have originally had a mass larger than its chunky companion , in order to collapse first .
But if that was true , the now - collapsed star should also have had a radius larger than the current distance between the two companions , so that the two would have shared a common outer atmosphere .
But if that was true , scientists would ordinarily expect a huge quantity of mass to have been lost from the binary system – so much so that the black hole observed today should n’t now be as large as it seems to be .
To wind up with what researchers see , the original giant star must have shed material about 10 times slower than predicted before going supernova , and collapsing .
So , Americans , take comfort .
Dieting is tricky even in outer space .
Along with setting all kinds of records , and promising a deliciously explosive future , the binary system offers the first look at a black hole that undergoes eclipses from our point of view , as it rotates around its companion star .
That ’s giving researchers using NASA’s
Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Gemini telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii the ability to make unusually precise estimates of its mass .

Database Developers occasionally get crazy ideas into their heads .
I should know ; I ’ve had a few completely loopy thoughts that I ’ve pursued to destruction .
The one that still makes me wince is the time when I caused a production server to swear at the customers and insult them .
To understand what happened , I ’ll have to explain my thinking .
Ordinary people have great difficulty in remembering numbers , even in the short - term ..
Computer people find this hard to appreciate , and often insist that end - users must remember them so as to identify themselves , their bank accounts or their invoices .
These numbers often end up being written around the edge of the monitor , or on bits of paper around the desk , which rather defeats the object .
Errors abound .
On websites , there was a time when we tried giving out numbers that represented the primary key for a customer , but we ’ve all now abandoned that idea as being hopeless , and now use the email address to provide a unique ID for visitors .
People can remember words far more easily than numbers and it occurred to me that , whenever we wanted customers to remember an ID , we ought to translate it into a memorable nonsense - word , and give them that instead .
My idea was to create a program that would translate numbers into words , and vice versa .
It meant that , instead of a number , you could give someone a nonsense word , rather like the name of an alien space - traveller in a Science - Fiction film , which they found they could remember .
When it was fed back through the routine , it produced the original number .
Genuis !
As it happens , it was n’t such a good idea after all , but we ’ll come to that in due course .
A base - 245 numbering system
All you need to do is to create a table with the main consonant / vowel combinations of most languages :
CREATE TABLE [ dbo ] . [ Syllables ] (
[ The Index ] [ int ] IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL ,
[ Syllable ] [ varchar ] ( 4 ) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
NULL
) ON [ PRIMARY ]
GO
Then , a simple stored procedure can be written that stocks it :
AS CREATE PROCEDURE CreateSyllableTableAS
DECLARE @Possibilities VARCHAR ( 255 )
SELECT @Possibilities =’B C D F G H J K L M N P R S T V W Z SCSKKNSNSPSTBLCLFLGLPLSLBRCRDRFRGRPRTRVRSHSMGHCHPHRHWHBWCWSWTW ’
DECLARE @ii INT
DECLARE @jj INT
DECLARE @iiMax INT
DECLARE @Consonants VARCHAR( 2 )
DECLARE @Vowel VARCHAR ( 2 )
SELECT @ii=1 , @iiMax=DATALENGTH( @possibilities )
WHILE @ii<=@iiMax
BEGIN
SELECT @Consonants=RTRIM( SUBSTRING( @Possibilities , @ii,2 ) )
SELECT @jj=1
WHILE @jj<=5
BEGIN
SELECT @Vowel=SUBSTRING(‘ AEIOU ’, @jj ,1 )
INSERT INTO Syllables ( Syllable )
SELECT @consonants +@Vowel
SELECT @jj=@jj+1
END
SELECT @ii=@ii+2
END
Execute this stored procedure so as to fill the Syllable table .
The result is a list of around 245 vowel / consonant combinations :
BA , BE , BI , BO , BU , CA , CE , CI , CO , CU , DA , DE , DI , DO , DU , FA , FE , FI , FO , FU , GA , GE , GI , GO , GU , HA , HE , HI , HO , HU , JA , JE , JI , JO , JU , KA , KE , KI , KO , KU , LA , LE , LI , LO , LU , MA , ME , MI , MO , MU , NA , NE , NI , NO , NU , PA , PE , PI , PO , PU , RA , RE , RI , RO , RU , SA , SE , SI , SO , SU , TA , TE , TI , TO , TU , VA , VE , VI , VO , VU , WA , WE , WI , WO , WU , ZA , ZE , ZI , ZO , ZU , SCA , SCE , SCI , SCO , SCU , SKA , SKE , SKI , SKO , SKU , KNA , KNE , KNI , KNO , KNU , SNA , SNE , SNI , SNO , SNU , SPA , SPE , SPI , SPO , SPU , STA , STE , STI , STO , STU , BLA , BLE , BLI , BLO , BLU , CLA , CLE , CLI , CLO , CLU , FLA , FLE , FLI , FLO , FLU , GLA , GLE , GLI , GLO , GLU , PLA , PLE , PLI , PLO , PLU , SLA , SLE , SLI , SLO , SLU , BRA , BRE , BRI , BRO , BRU , CRA , CRE , CRI , CRO , CRU , DRA , DRE , DRI , DRO , DRU , FRA , FRE , FRI , FRO , FRU , GRA , GRE , GRI , GRO , GRU , PRA , PRE , PRI , PRO , PRU , TRA , TRE , TRI , TRO , TRU , VRA , VRE , VRI , VRO , VRU , SHA , SHE , SHI , SHO , SHU , SMA , SME , SMI , SMO , SMU , GHA , GHE , GHI , GHO , GHU , CHA , CHE , CHI , CHO , CHU , PHA , PHE , PHI , PHO , PHU , RHA , RHE , RHI , RHO , RHU , WHA , WHE , WHI , WHO , WHU , BWA , BWE , BWI , BWO , BWU , CWA , CWE , CWI , CWO , CWU , SWA , SWE , SWI , SWO , SWU , TWA , TWE , TWI , TWO and TWU
This then gives to a base - 245 numbering system where each syllable represents a digit .
Encoding and decoding the numbers
Encoding a number is then easy :
/*

eg
Declare @ The Code varchar( 100 )
Execute Encode 694852357567584 , @TheCode output

@TheNumber DECIMAL ( 18,0 ) ,
@ TheCode VARCHAR ( 100 ) output

END
END

WHILE @Bigdividend >0
BEGIN

END
END

The results are hardly longer than the original numbers , and generally much easier to remember .
They can then be quickly decoded .

So far , so good : you can then give your customers nonsense words , and these can either be used as the foreign key ( they will be guaranteed to be unique ) or translated into the original Identity field .
In situations where every object in your database , whether it be customers , products , purchases or whatever , has a unique name , then it is even better ; you can just key in the nonsense word , and the system knows what you are referring to and can navigate straight there .
Testing the App
I then tested it out on an application .
It worked perfectly .
The users of the system found that they could get the correct invoice onscreen just by typing ‘ Bupris Lona ’ ( actually 69485235 ) , or a purchase order called ‘ Bifu Glofro ’ ( actually 30586703 ) .
They could actually remember these names too , and the requirement for sticky notes and pencils plummeted .
The users were delighted and decided that I was ‘ on their side ’ against the alien force of geeks in IT .
In conversation .
I ’d hear people from accounts refer affectionately to a product or salesman as ‘ Gaci Skofo ’ or ‘ Bub Wivro ’ .
They were able to remember these names and write them accurately into the application .
Excellent , I decided .
I ’ve really discovered something here .
I then put a similar routine into a commercial website I was writing .
At first , the business was puzzled by the system because they expect impossible numbers from computer systems just as they used to expect flashing lights from computers .
Then , when I ’d demonstrated what I meant , they took to the idea with enthusiasm .
As I ’d tested the routine at length , I felt completely confident this time .
Swearing at Customers
My undoing was this : instead of seeding the tables from a large number , over four million , as with the previous application , this time they insisted that I seeded the customer table from 1 because the CustomerIDs started from 1 .
Generally , I always choose a good healthy number to start public - facing identity fields because I dislike letting anyone know how many customers we actually have , or the number of purchase there have been ; but at the time , I was too engrossed with other things to think through the potential consequences .
When I am nursing a new website , I check things every night before going to bed , just to peer around and see what is going on , and make sure that all is well .
What I do is to maintain a copy of the website on a local server .
I make a comparison using SQL Compare and use the application to see what has changed or been added during the day .
Then I re-synchronise .
When a website is just starting out , one can see almost at a glance what has happened during the day and one can pick up all sorts of problems that way , before they become a crisis .
All seemed well this particular night .
We ’d done good business and had got to customer no 4660 .
I sleepily looked at the email message queue to see the message go out for this customer ’s purchase :
‘ Dear Mrs xxxxx
Thank you for purchasing from the Kamakaze Laxative Company ( Not the real name I hasten to add ) .
Your customer ID is Fuca and your password …. ( blah blah ) ’
Suddenly , I was jolted awake .
Was I seeing this correctly , or had I fallen asleep at the keyboard and was suffering a ghastly dream .
The computer had suddenly been possessed with ‘ Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ’ and was sending obscene words to the customer !
No !
In a flash , I realised that it was my fault for insisting on memorable Ids – coupled with the fact that because I ’d had to start at 1 , the names were very short .
I managed to stop the message going out and sat back in my chair in relief .
Then I thought to myself ‘ I wonder what else we ’ve sent out ? ’
The result was not a pretty sight .
The English language has a number of four - letter words that are entirely innocent but look awful .
For some reason , the eye seems to convert them to the nearest politically inappropriate word .
Customer 1001 had been sent an Email informing him that his user ID was ‘ Buger ’ .
Customer 4415 had been sent an email assigning the name ‘ Foca ’ .
If I had n’t spotted the problem when I did , there were a range of offensive words that might have gone out .
Heaven only knows what would have happened when we got to N. I did not sleep well that night .
In the morning , I went to see the Boss , with the proverbial wet newspaper down the back of the trousers .
( Ed : aged Boarding - School joke ) .
I told him we ’d assigned the userID ‘ Foca ’ to one of his customers .
He pulled a face and got on the phone to the customer .
A lady answered .
She was very considerate but said that she had been rather surprised to receive the ID .
‘ It is all right you people swearing like that in the office , but we really do n’t appreciate it in the home ’ she laughed .
My boss was most charming to her ; it was a revelation , as it was a side to his character I had n’t seen .
I hurriedly reset the identity fields to a higher number , and made the routines more complex so that they could n’t come up with the commonest offensive syllables .
I did n’t know many of them myself , despite having gone to a boarding school , but a half hour in Dispatch gave me an encycopaedic knowledge , which I then used to cleanse the routine .
The system soldiers on , cured of its propensities for bad language , and still much appreciated by the users .
The staff of Dispatch still talk of the strange guy from IT who rushed around with a notebook , excitedly recording all their foullest language .
The incident has made me even more obsessional about ‘ nursing ’ my websites when they are newly launched because computer systems can fail in unexpected ways .
Most of all , however , I am far more cautious of my own big ideas and less eager to bully them through to implementation .
In a newly released survey , American journalists in Iraq give harrowing accounts of their work , with the great majority saying that colleagues have been kidnapped or killed and that most parts of Baghdad are too dangerous for them to visit .
The survey was conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism , an arm of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington .
Of the 111 journalists who participated , half had spent at least nine months in Iraq , and three - quarters had experience reporting on other armed conflicts .
Most of the journalists were surveyed in October , one of the least deadly months in Baghdad in recent years .
Almost two - thirds of the respondents said that most or all of their street reporting was done by local citizens , yet 87 percent said that it was not safe for their Iraqi reporters to openly carry notebooks , cameras or anything else that identified them as journalists .
Two - thirds of respondents said they worried that their reliance on local reporters — including many with little or no background in journalism — could produce inaccurate or incomplete news reports .
The Americans also voiced serious concerns about how effectively they were able to do their own jobs .
Most respondents said that the media did not do a good job covering the lives of ordinary Iraqis or reconstruction efforts , simply because those lines of reporting could be deadly .
All You Need To Know About Drones
A Drone is nothing but the aerial vehicle that is basically unmanned .
The drones are generally navigated without the need of a human pilot on the vehicle .

The lighter components in the construction of a drone make the reduce much weight .
Drones tend to be of different sizes and shapes .
Not only that , but it also has different functions .
Based on them , there are different controls in aq drone that actually helps in the flying of the drone .
Some of the controls of drones include a pitch , roll , Throttle , Yaw , the elevator , rudder , trim , and an aileron .
Further , there are maneuvering patterns of drone flying .
You get the bank turn pattern , figure 8 , and the hovering pattern .
Also , there a few flight modes that include the manual mode , GPS hold , and attitude , also known as the auto - level .
Getting A License for Drone Training
A drone pilot needs proper training to fly it understanding the proper mechanisms of how to fly a drone professionally .
There are various places where the drone pilots are trained to fly a drone .
You would also need a drone license to fly a drone .

Facebook Messenger will now send your photos in 4 K Resolution
More than 900 million people are using Facebook Messenger all over the world and are in second place in top messaging apps after Whatsapp .
There are many features like chat heads , video calling , and photo sharing .
More than 17 billion photos are sent through messenger every month and the resolution of the images that can be sent was of 2 k resolution .
When people send the images with higher resolution , the images are compressed and the highest resolution of the images that can be sent was the 2 k resolution .
The quality of images was a huge setback for Facebook back then .
The new update of Messenger is giving people an ability to share images with higher resolution i.e. , 4 k , which offers 4,096x4,096 pixels per image .
This is the maximum quality used by smartphones .
This increase in size wo n’t take much time while sharing photos , they are sent usually at the normal time only .
Once the app is updated the images you share will be sent in high quality as it is the default setting in the app .

What Do you Need to Know to Buy Google Pixel 2 ?
Two new Google Pixel phones were released consecutively , the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL .
However , due to several factors , Google has decided to give its full attention to publicise the Pixel XL over Pixel 2 .
While it is true the Pixel XL is the better looking , more functional ( and more pricey ) sibling of the two Pixel ’s , Pixel XL has come with its fair share of problems which are making many of the Pixel fans turn towards the Pixel 2 for comfort .
If asked for an honest comparison between Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , experts would tell you to go for the younger sibling ; the Google Pixel 2 .
While Pixel 2 costs lesser than the Pixel 2 XL and comes in a much smaller frame , it still hold a he price tag of Rs.61 , 000 .
While the Pixel 2 is not immune to the issues faced by the Pixel XL , good news is that on the Pixel 2 , most of these issues are fixable through the software .
While the build quality , look and feel of both phones are almost identical , the Pixel 2 comes in a smaller frame of 5 inches only .

UNSTOPPABLE HOAXING :
At the August 5 GOP debate ( hosted by ABCs George Stephanopoulos ) , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee explained the newest source of salvation .
Omigod , the ex-governor said .
If only we go with the Fair Tax ! HUCKABEE ( 8/5/07 ) : I absolutely support the Fair Tax , and part of the reason is , the current system is one that penalizes productivity .
A recent poll showed more Americans fear an audit of the IRS than they do getting mugged .
And the reason is getting mugged is n't as painless [ sic ] as an audit from the IRS .
[ Applause . ]
And the reality is , if we could have the Fair Tax , you take $ 10 trillion parked offshore , bring it home .
You 'd rebuild the made - in - America brand .
You free up people to earn money , to work .
You do n't penalize them for taking a second job .
You do n't penalize them for investing ; you do n't penalize them for savings .
Today our tax system does n't need a tap of the hammer , a twist of the screwdriver .
It needs a complete overhaul .
And what the Fair Tax does , it ends the underground economy .
No more illegals —
STEPHANOPOLOUS : Governor Romney —
HUCKABEE : Let me if I may — no more illegals , no more gamblers , prostitutes , pimps and dope dealers will be able to escape the tax code .
It 's the single greatest thing that will help this country .
According to the press corps newest fair - haired pin-up boy , the Fair Tax is  the single greatest thing that will help this country . 
But wouldnt you know it ?
This past Sunday , conservative economist Bruce Bartlett explained what a hoax the Fair Tax is .
To read Bartletts piece ,
How big a hoax is the Fair Tax ?
The plan is the latest successor to the so - called flat tax ,  the last piece of pseudo - conservative tax hoaxing which drove talk radio and fouled our debate .
As weve explained before , no Republican pol — not even Steve Forbes — has ever proposed a real flat tax ,  if by that we mean a tax system in which every tax - payer pays the same percentage of income in taxes .
Forbes well in the 1996 GOP primaries , riding what he called a flat tax proposal ; but because of his plans large deductions , some tax - payers would have paid 17 percent , many would have paid no taxes at all .
A few years earlier , Dick Armey had comically noted that the flat tax is progressive in his unintentionally humorous book of the same name .
No , that didnt really make sense .
But none of this tax hoaxing ever does — except as a way to rile up the herd and confuse the public debate .
As silly as these flat tax plans were , the new Fair Tax is a much bigger hoax .
But then , much of our ongoing public debate is a hoax , and has been for the past many years .
Because big liberal pundits wont tell you such things , we have to wait for people like Bartlett to do so from the conservative side .
How is our public discourse a hoax ?
Let us count ( a few of ) the ways :
Experts :
As liberals have recently noted , we live in a world where press elites tell us who our experts are .
This is true in the realm of foreign policy , but in many other areas as well ( see
Facts :
As with our experts , so with our facts :
The press corps agrees to dole out facts in accordance with preferred elite narratives .
( This involves the press corps bizarre group dynamics . )
Rudy Giuliani parades about denigrating European health care .
In the mainstream press , only Paul Krugman — no one else — ever dreams of stating elementary facts about the health care systems being trashed .
Most people have simply never heard the simplest facts about US health care versus other world systems .
Even in discussing Sicko , it was the law !
Basic facts could not be reported .
Campaign narratives :
When control of the White House is at stake , your press corps  offers you childish narratives , forcing discussion into tight , narrow channels .
In ways that would make a schoolchild blush , these narratives are blatantly shaped by elite opinion about the candidates .
In March 2000 , Post ombudsman E. R. Shipp described this process in brilliant detail ( see
Pseudo - conservative hoaxing :
In the past thirty years , pseudo - conservative hoaxing has played a persistent role in this unholy stew .
Denial machines mislead the public about climate change , for example — and GOP  think tanks  keep promoting an array of weird claims about taxes .
As this happens , mainstream news orgs dither about , refusing to describe or challenge the hoaxing .
Example : When Newsweek astonished the world with its recent report about climate hoaxing , the denial machine  it finally debunked had been running for the past twenty years !
Much of our discourse is a hoax ; the Fair Tax is just the latest example .
But why do we have to wait for Bartlett , a conservative , to debunk such pseudo - conservative nonsense ?
Because over the course of the past twenty years , our biggest liberal  spokesmen have simply refused to do so .
Potemkin liberals like E. J. Dionne make liberals believe that they re represented at the highest levels of media .
But they stand around and fail to notice when Democratic candidates are gored and swift - booted .
As a general matter , these pundits would jump off a very high bridge before theyd ever tell the public that their discourse is a large , rolling hoax .
They stood around while the Clintons and Gore were endlessly hoaxed in the 1990s .
Like OHanlon , these pundits are still in the game .
And they re prepared to be stupid again .
Once again , it has fallen to Bartlett to describe the depth of pseudo - conservative tax hoaxing .
But readers !
Quite plainly , Huckabee has become the press corps latest Republican darling , despite his devotion to this latest nonsense .
( So Funny !
So friendly !
He has his own band ! )
As the press corps starts to pimp Darling Huckabee , he joins Giuliani ( long pimped as  Americas Mayor ) and McCain ( the worlds most honest human ) — and he stands in opposition to Edwards ( whose haircut and house are both troubling ) and Clinton ( so vile for so long ) .
This brings us back to George Stephanopoulos .
Our advice : Read Bartlett and Drum on the Fair Tax hoaxing .
Then , gaze on the way this multimillionaire journalist described the Fair Tax at that recent debate .
Before Huckabee had to say a word , Stephanopoulos drew applause from the Republican audience with his description of this noble proposal .
This is the way multimillionaire journalists  mislead an unknowing public : STEPHANOPOLOUS ( 8/5/07 ) : I need to move on now .
The issue is taxes , always important in these caucuses and primaries .
And the Iowa Republican Party has said the most important economic reform Congress can act — can enact to win the fight against poverty is the Fair Tax .
For our viewers , I want to explain what the Fair Tax is .
It would eliminate the income tax , the state tax , the payroll tax and capital gains tax .
It would eliminate all those , and replace it with a 23 percent sales tax , That 's the Fair Tax .
And Mr. Yepsen has the question .
[ Applause . ]
DAVID YEPSEN : Governor [ Huckabee ] , this issue of tax policy , I see it as a real fault line inside your party — Fair Tax , national sales tax , a flat tax or big adjustments to the existing tax system .
Where do you come down on this question ?
 For our viewers , I want to explain what the Fair Tax is ,  Stephanopoulos said .
 It would eliminate all those [ existing taxes ] , and replace it with a 23 percent sales tax .
Stephanopoulos was grossly misinforming those voters , as you can see from Bartletts report .
But his recitation drew applause from the GOP crowd .
Poor fools !
Theyd been hoaxed once again .
In a wide array of ways , our discourse is an ongoing hoax .
But high - profile liberals have never quite managed to notice this fact .
Meanwhile , the trashing of our candidates is starting again — and we liberals seem completely unable to come to terms with this bit of presspolitics ( more below ) .
From this , we draw a troubling conclusion : Despite what you hear about a  Democratic year ,  libs and Dems should prepare themselves for defeat next year — and for subsequent war .
If we cant learn to play this game , well be unstoppably defeated .
Special report : Only Dems !
READ EACH THRILLING INSTALLMENT :
It s perfectly clear : By Hard Pundit Law , only Dems can have character problems !
For previous installment in this series , see THE DAILY HOWLER , 8/27/07 .
PART 5 — CANT COMPLAIN : Saturdays statement by Chris Cillizza was so remarkable , so instructive , that we suggest you review it again .
When you do , remember how hard the press corps worked to say that Candidate Gore kept reinventing himself  — and remember how hard they worked to trash Candidate Kerry as a flip - flopper .
But by now , its a tenet of Hard Pundit Law : Only Dems can have character problems !
Candidate Romney has reinvented his soul — has reinvented himself more completely and thoroughly than any candidate in our history .
But so what ?
From the heart of the mainstream press corps , a rising star now praises him for it .
It s to his credit that Romney did this — Cillizza said so two times : CILLIZZA ( 8/25/07 ) : [ Romney ] is nowhere near as conservative as he is painting himself to be .
I mean , the reality is , is Mitt Romney said he had stood up against , you know , attempts to restrict abortion , stood up against attempts to broaden gay rights .
You know , you can see a way in which he can color that , and he 's using , as Chuck [ Todd ] mentioned , this immigration issue that he had — he has stood up for it .
Well , again , it really went to being a he said / he said .
Giuliani's campaign pushes back and says ,  Well , no , not really , if you look at the record here . 
Mitt Romney understood very early on , to his credit , that the only way to win the race , from his perspective , was he needed to become the conservative candidate in this race come heck or high water , frankly , is that he knew he was going to have to answer for some of these things , like the fact that he said he would be better on gay rights than Ted Kennedy .
Thank you , YouTube , for reminding us of that one .
But I think he recognized early on , even when we thought John McCain was the front - runner , he recognized this was his path to the nomination .
And he has , to his credit , I think , insulated himself somewhat from that .
The problem is , and Chuck points this out , is both Thompson and Romney are , I believe , somewhat flawed messengers as the socially conservative candidate .
Neither of them have a squeaky clean , pure white record on this .
And so do people believe them over believing Rudy Giuliani , who said ,  Yes , look , I do — I do support a woman 's right to choose .
I 'm unapologetic about that ?
Gore was trashed for alleged reinventions ;  indeed , pundits made total fools of themselves as they struggled to find his troubling make - overs . 
But when Romney actually does reinvent — when he baldly pretends to be a conservative — its to his credit ,  Cillizza says .
He is nt said to be guilty of reinvention ; no , hes just a somewhat flawed messenger !
Suddenly , pundits are looking for ways in which a hopeful can color his record .
The rules which were used to club Kerry and Gore have suddenly , quite plainly changed .
But then , in the past fifteen years , the law has become very clear : Only Dems can have character problems !
Could this rule be more apparent ?
When President Clinton spends  sexy time ,  the pundits scream till the end of time — but not so with Sexy - Time Rudy .
The pundits pretend that Gore tell Big Lies — but ignore it when Saint Rudy actually does so !
John Edwards  house is deep cause for concern ; Romneys house is twice as expensive , but it somehow never gets mentioned .
No , only Dems can have character flaws .
How do we plan to address this ?
How do we liberals plan to address this ?
Right now , we do so amazingly poorly .
How poorly do we deal with all this ?
Just consider what has happened in recent days :
Trashing our own :
All over the netroots , commenters trash Candidate Clinton , currently the Democratic front - runner .
Often , they cite the tortured old character themes which came to us straight from the RNC .
But then , why should commenters show better long - term judgment when our leaders behave the same way ?
Last week , John Edwards played smarmy games with the Lincoln Bedroom — and then he said that he didnt mean Clinton !
This is what Bradley did to Gore .
It s a fast track to defeat .
Staying on defense : Michelle Obama makes a slightly ambiguous statement — and , as usual , by Hard Pundit Law , pundits start talking about Bill Clintons penis .
( No one imagines that she meant Giuliani , whose sexcapades were so public and bizarre . )
On cable , our brightest spokespeople face a dilemma — how do we fight back about this ?
For our money , our spokespeople stayed on defense last week .
But we all have to figure out how to deal with these problems .
We liberals have stayed on defense for so long that playing defense is now second nature .
( Yes , well discuss this point further . )
Refusing to speak :
And over and over , for the past fifteen years , we simply refuse to state our complaints .
We hate to single out Steve Benen , who does so much superlative work , at TPM ( on weekends ) and Salon ( on weekdays ) .
But good grief !
BENEN ( 8/25/07 ) : Reporters labeled Al Gore a serial exaggerator in 2000 on a whole lot less than this .
Good grief !
Let s say it again ; Steve Benen does a ton of good work .
But if that s the best way we can state our case about the way our campaigns get scripted , then we can get ready for President Rudy .
The next war we hate will be his .
Reporters labeled Al Gore a serial exaggerator in 2000 on a whole lot less than this ?
In fact , reporters labeled Gore a serial exaggerator in March 1999 , on the basis of three absurd charades .
The press corps invented those three silly claims — then trashed Gore with them for the next twenty months .
But eight years later , we still cant say it !
We still cant bring ourselves to describe our nations recent presspolitics .
What actually happened during Campaign 2000 ?
Ezra Klein described it once in The Prospect , then pretty much never did so again ( see KLEIN ( 4/06 ) :
The address was the keynote for the We Media conference , held at the Associated Press headquarters in New York last October and attended by an audience that included both old media luminaries and new media innovators .
In attendance were Tom Curley , president of the AP , Andrew Heyward , president of CBS News , and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , all leading lights of a media establishment that , five years earlier , had deputized itself judge , jury , and executioner for Gores 2000 presidential campaign , spinning each days events to portray the stolid , capable vice president as a wild exaggerator , ideological chameleon , and total , unforgivable bore .
According to Klein , the media establishment  — he specifically named the AP and the Times — deputized itself Gores executioner .
For twenty months , these news orgs were spinning each days events to portray the stolid , capable vice president as a wild exaggerator . 
Do we believe that that actually happened ?
Ezras statement was plainly correct — but he pretty much never said it again !
And here we see the remarkable way we choose to enable our own demise .
Only Dems can have character problems !
Clearly , this is now Hard Pundit Law .
Our candidates are suffering from this edict again — and to this day , we cant bring ourselves to tell the truth about what has happened .
Trust us :
If we cant complain any harder than this , well have much more to complain about .
Put another way :
If we wont say whats been going on , who in the world ever will ?
Good God !
Even as Romney is being praised for his laughable reinventions , we still cant bring ourselves to say what actually happened to Candidate Gore !
Instead , Edwards recites that old RNC line — bull - roar the Obama campaign has used twice .
As with Bradley and Willie Horton , so with these two and the Lincoln Bedroom !
It s amazing , but RNC hoaxing so suffuses our world that we state their top hoaxes for them !
In fairness :
So far , our candidates arent accusing each other of murders .
But just give these losers a chance !
Will 2008 be a Democratic year ?
At this point , that seems very dubious .
In the past week , weve begun to pick up the stink of defeat as we see the shaping of next years candidates .
And by the way :
Whose instincts were right back in March 1999 ?
We began debunking the war against Gore the very week the problem began .
Others still cant utter the truth , even now , eight long years later .
Has a gang like us ever lived on this earth ?
Something seems to make us long for the thrill of submissive defeat .
TOMORROW : How we defended Michelle .
At the August 5 GOP debate ( hosted by ABCs George Stephanopoulos ) , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee explained the newest source of salvation .

In what way does this constitute hoaxing ?
As weve seen in the case of Iraq , a person is designated an expert if he voices the standard views of insider DC press / political elites .
For this reason , experts who were right on Iraq get dumped ; experts who were wrong on Iraq are allowed to voice their views once again .
( O Hanlon keeps playing ; Ritter is gone . )
But then , the naming of experts  is a vast hoax — and it has been for a long time .

The report calls for a major overhaul of the US justice system
There are more than 1.5 million people in US state and federal jails , a report by a Washington - based criminal justice research group , the JFA Institute says .
Inmate numbers are projected to rise by 192,000 in five years , costing $ 27.5 bn ( £ 13.44bn ) to build and run jails .
The JFA recommends reducing the number and length of sentences .
The Unlocking America report , which was published on Monday , also advocated changing terms of parole and finding alternatives to prison as part of a major overhaul of the US justice system .
" There is no evidence that keeping people in prison longer makes us any safer , " said JFA president James Austin .
Women convicts
The report said that US crime rates , which have been in decline since the 1990s , are about the same as those for 1973 .
The report said that every year hundreds of thousands of Americans are sent to jail " for crimes that pose little if any danger or harm to society " .
It cited several examples including a Florida woman 's two - year sentence for throwing a cup of coffee at another car in a traffic row .
Its recommendations run counter to the Bush administration 's policy of longer , harsher sentences , which the government says has contributed to falling violent crime and murder figures .
The JFA researchers found that women represented the fastest - growing sector of the US prison population .
The report was funded by the Rosenbaum Foundation and the Open Society Institute .
A colleague of mine forwarded a copy of an accident report from Texas A&M. ;
It seems that in mid-January they had a bit of a blowout there , thanks to a big liquid nitrogen tank .
Now , liquid nitrogen cylinders are normally fairly benign , as long as you do n’t freeze your external organs off with the stuff or leave the liquid sitting around where it can condense oxygen out of the air .
But idiocy will find a way – note the regular cylinder on the right and the new , improved model next to it .
These guys are usually equipped with pressure relief fittings , since nitrogen does tend to want to be a gas , and gases do tend to want to expand quite a bit .
This tank , though , which seems to have been kicking around since 1980 , had been retrofitted by a real buckaroo .
Both the pressure relief and rupture disks had failed for some reason in the past , so they ’d been removed and sealed off with metal plugs .
You may commence shivering now .
Why it did n’t blow long ago is a real stumper , but presumably people were taking nitrogen out of it quickly enough to keep things together .
Not this time , though : at around 3 AM , things came to a head as the internal tank ( these things are double - walled ) expanded until it pressed against the outer one .
That kept it from expanding anywhere else except on the ends , and as fate would have it , the bottom blew out first .
The engineer ’s best guess is that this took place at around a 1200 psi load .
It must have been quite a sight , although it ’s a damn good thing that no one was around to see it .
I ’ll let the engineer ’s report take it from here :
The cylinder had been standing at one end of a ~ 20 ′ x 40 ′ laboratory on the second floor of the chemistry building .
It was on a tile covered 4 - 6 ″ thick concrete floor , directly over a reinforced concrete beam .
The explosion blew all of the tile off of the floor for a 5 ′ radius around the tank turning the tile into quarter sized pieces of shrapnel that embedded themselves in the walls and doors of the lab .
The blast cracked the floor but due to the presence of the supporting beam , which shattered , the floor held .
Since the floor held the force of the explosion was directed upward and propelled the cylinder , sans bottom , through the concrete ceiling of the lab into the mechanical room above .
It struck two 3 inch water mains and drove them and the electrical wiring above them into the concrete roof of the building , cracking it .
The cylinder came to rest on the third floor leaving a neat 20 ″ diameter hole in its wake .
The entrance door and wall of the lab were blown out into the hallway , all of the remaining walls of the lab were blown 4 - 8 ″ off of their foundations .
All of the windows , save one that was open , were blown out into the courtyard .
No one seems to have heard the celebrations , but someone noticed that the building ’s water pressure had gone a little wimpy and went to investigate , which I ’ll bet was a real eye - opener .
I get the impression that they ’re still trying to track down the Mr. Fix - It who inadvertently rigged the tank for takeoff .
The company engineer who came in to investigate noted that he ’s seen these kinds of “ repair ” jobs before , generally after they ’ve powered through something .
Diplomatic relations between Britain and the United States over Iran are under increasing strain after Gordon Brown 's special security adviser warned that American claims about Tehran 's military capability should be taken ' with a pinch of salt ' .
As a new conservative campaign group with links to the White House prepares to make the case that Iran is a direct threat to the US , Patrick Mercer urged scepticism towards any US justification for strikes against the country .
Mercer , the former shadow homeland security spokesman , who visIted the Iranian capital recently , said : ' There is increasing concern about the apparent evidence that America is preparing about Iranian military involvement . '
Mercer , who last month accepted a post as an adviser to the Brown government , said : ' All that I heard when I was in Iran was British authorities saying " be careful about what you hear from America " .
I 'm not saying for one moment that it is necessarily wrong , but it 's got to be taken with a pinch of salt .
Is it American rhetoric , propaganda or fact ? '
However he conceded that British military commanders had discussed the issue of Iran with their US counterparts , although there had been no offer of support for a US - led air strike against the country .
' Iran is a problem , there 's no doubt about it .
Whatever is going to occur vis à vis Iran is going to include at the very least British diplomatic effort . '
Meanwhile , a well - funded new conservative campaign group with links to the White House is making the case that Iran is a threat to the US and Israel and should be ' stopped ' .
Freedom's Watch was founded in March by a dozen billionaire and multimillionaire benefactors .
Critics say the organisation is a neo- conservative ' slush fund ' and front for White House policy , in particular the views of Vice President Dick Cheney .
The group has paid $ 15 m for media ads supporting the Bush strategy in Iraq at the time that Congress was deliberating the report of General David Petraeus .
In the ads it directly linked the 11 September terrorist attacks to the war in Iraq despite the fact that the 9/11 Commission report refuted any such links .
More recently Freedom 's Watch took out ads describing Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as ' a terrorist ' .
According to the New York Times , anonymous benefactors told the paper that the group plans to sponsor a private forum of experts on Islam to make the case that Iran poses a direct threat to the US .
The group has close links with the White House : its president , Bradley Blakeman , is a former deputy assistant to Bush .
Among its founders is Mel Sembler , a Florida shopping centre magnate who helped to finance the 2000 Florida recount campaign that gave Bush his first presidency .
Another is former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer .
But it is the link with Cheney that is the strongest , leading to the widespread view that the organisation is in effect his own creature .
The group was conceived in March following a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at which he was a keynote speaker .
Last month it emerged that Cheney had asked a number of right - wing think tanks to start building the case for war against Iran .

Limitations of Sub -Pixel Rendering Terrific as sub - pixel rendering is , it has a few limitations that need to be kept in mind : ONLY LCD's . . . not CRT's !
While the application of Sub - Pixel Graphic Rendering will absolutely benefit virtually all users of LCD displays , it 's important to understand that this technique is not applicable to high - resolution Cathode Ray Tube ( CRT ) displays .
Yes , I know , the sample above looked really great on your CRT , but that 's mostly because any mature sub - pixel rendering technology also incorporates aspects of anti-aliasing ( as we 'll see on the next page of this little web zone . )
And it's well known that anti-aliasing helps tremendously with the display of text .
So even though sub - pixel rendering is better than nothing on CRT's , its " colorized " aspects only really work on LCD displays .
Black and White Images are Best As we 've seen , the success of sub - pixel rendering depends upon using part of an adjacent pixel to extend an existing pattern of sub-pixels which the eye perceives as a slightly larger white or black pixel .
While this approach can also be employed with low - saturation ( pastel ) colors , it will always be most effective when displaying high contrast white and black images .
Dark colored text on a white background will be effective , as would white text on a dark colored background .
But black & white best shows off what this technology can do .
ONLY Landscape . . . not Portrait !
As we 've seen , sub - pixel rendering only enhances the horizontal resolution of LCD panels .
It 's incredibly convenient that ' horizontally ' is precisely where text needs the most help !
Emboldening stretches text only horizontally , kerning and micro-justification only shift text horizontally , and italicizing slants type by skewing it horizontally .
However , this means that existing color LCD panel technology can not be used with sub - pixel text rendering when the panel is used in a vertical , or portrait , orientation .
It seems to me that this significantly cools off our excitement about the application of our existing hardware for eBooks , since eBooks utilize the traditional book 's familiar vertical orientation which is completely incompatible with existing color LCD construction for under sub - pixel rendering .
However , there is certainly nothing to prevent the creation of a new breed of LCD panels specifically for eBooks .
They would be longer vertically than horizontally ( for portrait orientation ) , while orienting their sub-pixels horizontally like existing LCD panels .
Such a new style display would indeed be a fabulous eBook component since it could display color images clearly while simultaneously employing sub - pixel rendering for its page 's text .
Sub -Pixel Order Sensitivity
Since sub - pixel rendering depends heavily upon the physical proximity of adjacent sub-pixels , the rendering algorithm must know whether the pixels are ordered Red-Green - Blue or Blue - Green - Red .
( Those are the only two sequences occurring on LCD panels . )
If the sub - pixel rendering algorithm gets the sequencing backwards ( as shown in this example ) the result is as bad as getting it right is good .
Since a few LCD panels have their sub-pixels arranged in B - G - R instead of R - G - B order , any industrial strength delivery of sub - pixel rendering technology will require a user - settable ( or operating system readable ) option to inform the system 's LCD rendering engine whether the sub-pixels are arranged in ' forward ' or ' reverse ' order .
FARMINGTON , Mo. -
It 's a hefty price for a pastry : A man accused of stealing a 52 - cent doughnut could face time in jail .
Authorities said Scott A. Masters , 41 , slipped the doughnut into his sweat shirt without paying , then pushed away a clerk who tried to stop him as he fled the store .
The push is being treated as minor assault , which transforms a misdemeanor shoplifting charge to a strong - armed robbery with a potential prison term of five to 15 years .
Because he has a criminal history , prosecutors say they could seek 30 years .
" Strong - arm robbery ?
Over a doughnut ?
That 's impossible , " Masters told the St. Louis Post - Dispatch from jail .
He admitted that he took the pastry but denied touching the employee .
" There 's no way I would 've pushed a woman over a doughnut . "
Farmington Police Chief Rick Baker said state law treats the shoplifting and assault as forcibly stealing property .
The amount of force and value of the property does n't matter .
" It 's not the doughnut , " Baker said .
" It 's the assault . "
Masters said he did n't even get to enjoy his ill - gotten gains :
He threw the doughnut away as he fled .

By dispatching troops into the streets and imposing a curfew , Myanmar ’s cruel military junta has set the stage for a serious clash with pro-democracy activists .
A firm and united international response along the lines outlined by President Bush and the European Union at the United Nations yesterday offers the best hope of encouraging peaceful change in a nation that has endured a 19 - year reign of fear .
The question is whether the countries with the greatest influence on Myanmar ’s generals  China , Russia and India , which all sell weapons to the army , as well as the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that are Myanmar ’s immediate neighbors  have the good sense to condemn the repression and exert the pressures only they can wield with any hope of positive effect .
It is essential that they step up to the plate , and fast , before blood is spilled .
Peaceful protests that began last month over dramatically increased fuel prices became seriously threatening to the junta when Myanmar ’s highly revered Buddhist monks joined in .
The growing crowds gave voice to pent - up grievances  and the junta responded in a predictable , entirely wrongheaded way .
It sent troops into the streets , and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , the iconic democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner , was reported to have been moved to prison from house arrest .
The United States , which has long had sanctions on Myanmar , including an import ban , will now expand a visa ban against regime leaders and tighten financial penalties , Mr. Bush told the United Nations .
Although not spelled out , the plan is believed to include going after regime bank accounts in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries , a tactic used by Washington with some effect against North Korea .
The European Union also warned the junta that it faced tougher sanctions if it used force to crush the pro-democracy movement .
These were good and necessary moves , but the greatest leverage to forestall disaster lies with China , Russia and India , who are making money off the junta and enabling it to stay in power .
China , Myanmar ’s chief trade partner and the host of the 2008 Olympic Games , has beefed up arms sales to Yangon , formerly Rangoon , prompting Russia and India to do likewise as a way of offsetting Beijing ’s influence .
Here are some thoughts from Congressman Lamar Smith about the RESTORE Act :
" Democrats today failed to protect the American people by ignoring urgent requests from the intelligence community to update tools and modernize laws governing intelligence gathering , " stated Ranking Member Smith .
" The RESTORE Act undermines our national security and increases the risk of a future attack on our country .
Democrats are playing politics by claiming that this bill ' restores ' checks and balances , " continued Smith .
" But politics should never come before national security .
This bill restores nothing but a legal loophole for terrorists and spies .
Today 's vote comes at the expense of our national security .
Contrary to Congress 's intent when FISA was originally enacted , this bill requires the government obtain a court order to conduct surveillance of overseas targets , " said Smith .
" The implications of this requirement alone could be catastrophic .
The RESTORE
Act requires intelligence officials to obtain a court order to conduct surveillance on Osama Bin Laden , but does not require one to conduct surveillance on an illegal immigrant , " Smith added .
" The bill gives terrorists overseas more rights under the law , than individuals inside the U.S.
That is simply absurd .
This bill does nothing to protect America , nothing to preserve civil liberties and nothing to promote national security , " concluded Smith .
" So what does this bill do ?
It ignores 30 years of precedent in intelligence gathering and panders to special interests groups .
Americans would be better served if lawmakers listened to their requests , rather than playing politics with the safety and security of our nation . "
I included the extended quote because I do n't want to be accused of cutting out some allegedly crucial point , so there it is in all its glory .
Rep. Smith is a perfect example of mainstream Republican thinking these days .
He shows why the party is in dire need of a philosophical makeover , extremely unpopular and seemingly prepared to go down the drain with their leader .
Here are a few responses to the Congressman .
First of all , what special interest groups are being pandered to ?
The telecommunication companies quietly lobbying for amnesty are certainly being pandered to by Senator Jay Rockefeller and heaven knows who else .
Has Congressman Smith received money from them , and if so would n't his position be considered pandering to a special interest ?
I do n't want to get into the man 's psychology but I would n't be surprised if he 's projecting his own compromised character onto those opposing him .
Moreover , what special interest is pushing against amnesty ?
Is someone going to profit from telecom amnesty ?
Those with pending lawsuits may ultimately profit , so I guess the Electronic Frontier Foundation may be in for a big payday .
Of course a self - described " donor - funded nonprofit " probably is n't salivating over the huge sum this class action lawsuit could bring in .
It would be a lot more probable if some large company like Google stood to profit from their distress .
And actual evidence of special interest activism would be most persuasive of all .
From all appearances the anti-amnesty people are motivated by Constitutional principle and a belief in the rule of law - they will see no personal profit from succeeding , which obviously can't be said on the other side .
As for the urgent requests from the intelligence community , there is precisely one loophole in the FISA law that needs to be closed : Foreign - to - foreign communications that go through U.S. infrastructure .
The temporary lifting of that requirement expires in February and it needs to be made permanent .
There are no other tools that need updating or laws that need modernizing .
Under FISA the President can begin wiretapping any old time he likes .
He does n't need to get clearance from anyone first , he does n't need to wait for anything to get approved , he can just jump right in with both feet .
Of course , he also has to get a retroactive warrant within 72 hours from the famously compliant ( and secret ) FISA court .
In President Bush 's view any form of executive accountability is intolerable , so even setting the bar that low for him is unacceptable .
But the fact is , the intelligence community is not in any way hamstrung by the legal requirements of FISA and it is dishonest to say otherwise .
The real mind bender from the Congressman is that officials would need a court order to surveil Osama bin Laden .
Let 's assume Joe Spook at the NSA picks up a phone call from someone he thinks is the guy .
Joe can start tapping immediately and get the warrant later .
If the foreign - to - foreign loophole is closed he does n't even need to do that .
Either way we 're listening .
So what kind of scenario does this refer to ?
I suppose if John Lindh was in Pakistan talking to his parents in America then there would be a warrant required .
If Mohammed Atta in Miami was calling Mullah Omar in Afghanistan then there may not be any warrant needed .
That might satisfy the foreign - terrorists - but - not - individuals - here scenario .
In no event is anyone forced to wait before acting and in any event his reasoning is extremely convoluted .
That probably is not an accident - actual logic does n't make the case too well .
Rep .
Smith 's dark warnings about undermining national security and increasing the risk of attack is simply the basest form of fearmongering .
We do n't seem to be responding as viscerally to that line of propaganda these days but it still has a crude effectiveness .
Sooner or later the haze of fear will lift , and when it does we will have a sober assessment of the risks we face .
We will look at how to reduce or thwart them without compromising essential liberties and what to do to prepare for the worst case .
We will look back at this period as some kind of national fugue state and wonder at our panicked state of mind .
We will also take a hard look at the contemporary leadership , and the judgment against those who enabled the President to act with such impunity will be harsh .
Rep. Smith and his colleagues are declaring with their actions that they consider themselves Republican before American .
Each day they continue to do so the verdict of history will weigh heavier against them .
Major Darfur rebel groups have decided not to take part in talks
A Sudanese presidential adviser made the announcement at the start of talks in the city of Sirte .
But two of the main rebel groups have boycotted the talks in a row over invited factions , despite a threat of UN Security Council sanctions .
Some 200,000 people have died and 2 m have been displaced in the conflict .
Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir had said last month he was prepared to call a truce for the talks .
At the Sirte gathering , Sudanese presidential adviser Nafie Ali Nafie said : " We announce a ceasefire from this moment , and we will respect it unilaterally . "
The mediation has fallen in the trap prepared by the government by making the negotiations an arena for every Jack , Tom and Harry

Darfur deal a distant dream Sudan survivor link - up The Darfur rebel groups
The African Union envoy for Darfur opened proceedings by saying the talks were a new opportunity for the region .
" Today marks another milestone in our collective search for peace in Darfur , " Salim Ahmed Salim said .
" The journey has been long , arduous and extremely challenging .
And the results ... have been mixed .
But today we are here in this historic city of Sirte for another new beginning . "
Fighting in Darfur began in 2003 when rebels attacked government targets .
Sudan 's government then launched a military and police campaign in Darfur .
A 2006 peace deal faltered because it was signed by the Sudanese government and only one rebel group .
The latest talks are being hosted by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi .
' Trap '
Both the SLA - Unity and the Justice and Equality Movement ( Jem ) groups decided not to attend after the UN and the AU - who are mediating the talks - invited other rebel groups they claim have little support , said Mohammed Bahr Hamdeen , a senior Jem leader .
" The mediation has fallen in the trap prepared by the government by making the negotiations an arena for every Jack , Tom and Harry , " Mr Hamdeen said .
The UN 's special envoy for Darfur , Jan Eliasson , continued to hold out some hope for the talks , at which he will be an official mediator .
" This is the first time in a very long time that we have a chance to start to talk about the concerns of the people of Darfur - the right to return to their villages , the need to stop the violence , " he said .
When the conflict broke out in 2003 , SLA and Jem were the only two rebel movements .
Now , there are at least 12 .
Demonstrators protested against the talks in Abu Shouk , one of many refugee camps in Darfur , on Friday .
Many Darfuris from different tribes are united in their support for the key rebel leader , Abdul Wahid .
Large numbers are also strongly opposed to the talks and doubt that the negotiations will lead to any concrete improvements on the ground , says the BBC's Amber Henshaw , in Darfur .
They seem to blindly back Abdul Wahid , she adds , even his decision not to attend the peace talks - which means that their voices will not be represented at the discussions .

America 's national holiday is the 4th of July , the anniversary of public promulgation of the Declaration of Independence .
The 4th of July , like many other government holidays , is surrounded by numerous myths .
Some of the most notable :
The 4th of July is a celebration of the U.S. Constitution .
Actually , the U.S. Constitution 's purpose was to remake the American governments of the Revolution by making the system less democratic .
The delegates from 12 states who met in Philadelphia in summer 1787 had been sent by the states to recommend amendments to the Articles of Confederation .
Instead , they instantly decided to meet in secret , and then the nationalists among them tried to win adoption of a national — rather than a federal — constitution .
The 4th of July was the day that the 13 states established their independence .
No , it was not .
In fact , Virginia established its independence on May 15 , 1776 , when its revolutionary Convention adopted resolutions for a declaration of rights , a permanent republican constitution , and federal and treaty relationships with other states and foreign countries .
It was because the Old Dominion had already established its independence — had , in fact , already sworn in the first governor under its permanent republican constitution of 1776 , Patrick Henry , on June 29 — that Virginia 's congressmen , uniquely , had been given categorical instructions from their state legislature to declare independence .
Virginia was not the only state whose independence was not established by the Declaration on the 4th , as New York 's congressional delegation did not then join in the Declaration .
In short , the states became independent in their own good time — some on July 4 , some before , some after .
The chief legacy of the 4th of July is the political philosophy set out in the Declaration of Independence .
Since the 18th century , political radicals have argued for understanding the Declaration as a general warrant for government to do anything it likes to forward the idea that " all men are created equal . "
Yet , that was not what the Declaration of Independence meant .
The Declaration of Independence was the work of a congress of representatives of state governments .
Congressmen were not elected by voters at large , but by state legislatures , and their role ( as John Adams , one of them , put it ) was more akin to that of ambassadors than to legislators .
They had not been empowered to dedicate society to any particular political philosophy , but to declare — as the Virginia legislature had told its congressmen to declare — that the colonies were , " and of right ought to be , free and independent states . "
In other words , the Declaration was about states ' rights , not individual rights , and the Congress that adopted it had no power to make it anything else .
All the rest of the Declaration was mere rhetorical predicate .
The 4th of July is a non-partisan holiday dedicated to recalling the legacy of the American Revolution .
In the Founders ' day , the 4th of July was a partisan holiday .
It was celebrated in the 1790s and 1800s by Jeffersonian Republicans desirous of showing their devotion to Jeffersonian , rather than Hamiltonian , political philosophy .
If you were a Federalist in the 1790s , you likely would celebrate Washington 's Birthday instead of the 4th of July .
If you believed in the inherent power of the Executive in formulating foreign policy , in the power of Congress to charter a bank despite the absence of express constitutional authorization to do so , and in the power of the federal government to punish people who criticized the president or Congress , you would not celebrate the 4th .
The 4th was the holiday of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , those great states '- rights blasts at federal lawlessness .
It was the anti-Hamilton , anti-Washington , anti-nationalist holiday .
The fulfillment of the 4th of July lay in the establishment of a powerful national government .
Celebrants of the 4th of July in the Founders ' day rejected the idea that the Constitution had created a national government , but insisted that it was federal instead .
That is , they said that Congress had only the powers it had been expressly delegated , chiefly through Article I , Section 8 , that the federal courts had no more jurisdiction than they had been assigned through Article III , and that the vast majority of government functions had been kept by the states .
When federal courts grabbed for more power in 1793 , these people added the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution .
In response to the nationalists ' war on France and Alien and Sedition Acts , they first adopted the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , then elected Republicans — Jeffersonian states ' - rights / laissez - faire advocates — to run their government .
The Declaration of Independence stood for the rights of white , male property owners alone .
As noted above , the philosophical material in the first section of the Declaration , although commonplace at the time , had no legal or moral weight .
Congress had no power to commit the states to it .
Yet , given that fact , one might also note that revolutionaries who accepted the Lockean version of social compact theory did not necessarily believe that only white , male property holders had rights .
Thomas Jefferson , for example , who was the author of the draft Lockean section of the Declaration , followed his belief in the idea that all men equally had a right to self - government , coupled with his belief that white and black people could never live together peacefully as equal citizens in America , to the conclusion that blacks must be colonized abroad to someplace where they might exercise their right to self - government .
The fulfillment of the 4th of July will come when the United States has sponsored democratic revolutions throughout the world .
Euro notes in a file photo .
A German motorist surprised by euro notes swirling in the air around her car hit the brakes and collected a " substantial amount of money " before turning it over to police , authorities in Worms said on Thursday .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German motorist surprised by euro notes swirling in the air around her car hit the brakes and collected a “ substantial amount of money ” before turning it over to police , authorities in Worms said on Thursday .
A police spokesman in the small western town said the 24 - year - old woman saw the money flying through the air in her rear view mirror late on Wednesday .
She pulled over and tried to collect all the notes , unsuccessfully .
When police went with her to the scene they could not find any more cash .
A spokesman at Worms city hall said police were withholding details on the exact sum and location of the find in the hope of learning more about the money ’s origin .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s attorney - general ordered police on Monday to open a criminal investigation into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s purchase of a home in Jerusalem .

A complaint filed by an investigative journalist alleged Olmert received a “ significant discount ” on the price in return for using his influence in Jerusalem city hall to speed up building permits for the contractor who sold him the home .
Olmert denied any wrongdoing in the case , one of several corruption probes that have plagued the Israeli leader since he took office last year and raised questions about his political future as he pursues peace talks with the Palestinians .
“ The attorney - general decided to order police to open a criminal investigation into the Cremieux affair , ” the Justice Ministry said , referring to the street where Olmert bought the house for $ 1.2 million in 2004 .
Israeli media reports said $ 320,000 was knocked off the purchase price .
Olmert served as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003 .
Israel ’s main government watchdog , the state comptroller ’s office , first investigated the complaint and gave its findings to Attorney - General Menachem Mazuz .
“ This is a needless investigation , ” said a statement issued by the Prime Minister ’s Office after Mazuz ordered the police probe .
The price Olmert paid for the home , it said , was in line with real estate market conditions at the time .
“ The prime minister will cooperate fully with the investigation in order to bring it to as swift a conclusion as possible , ” the statement said .
BANK PROBE
Police are already investigating Olmert ’s role , as finance minister , in the 2005 privatization of Bank Leumi , Israel ’s second biggest commercial bank .
Suspicions in that case focus on whether Olmert tried to tailor the sale offer to give preference to a friend , who ultimately never bid on the bank .
Olmert has denied any wrongdoing and he is expected to be questioned by police soon .
Mazuz is also considering whether to instruct police to investigate whether Olmert , as industry and trade minister in 2003 , appointed cronies to a government - funded business authority and helped secure official funding for a factory represented by his former law partner .
Olmert has said the suspicions are baseless .
The Israeli leader , whose popularity ratings plunged to single digits after last year ’s Lebanon war , faces another possible blow when a government - appointed committee investigating the conflict files its final report .
The Winograd commission , in interim findings in April , said Olmert acted hastily in ordering the war against Hezbollah guerrillas after the Lebanese fighters abducted two Israeli soldiers in a cross - border raid in July 2006 .
No date has been set for publication of the final report .
It was Volkswagen 's Karmann Ghia meets George Jetson 's Flivver as Mitsubishi unveiled the very groovy i MiEV Sport electric - powered sports coupe , derived from the similarly motivated i MiEV hatchback sedan , which is itself derived from the non-electric production i ( yep , that 's the whole name ) .
The Sport version of the i MiEV ( as in Mitsubishi Innovative Electric Vehicle ) seats four and employs three electric motors — two in - wheel motors up front and one motor beneath the luggage compartment , driving the rear wheels — powered by a lithium - ion battery pack beneath the floor .
The combined output is a 117 horsepower and a pretty astonishing 502 pound - feet of torque .
Mitsubishi claims the car will hit 112 mph and cruise for about 125 miles .
We particularly like the photovoltaic roof panel and the power - producing fan inside the front grille .

Sir Mike said US anti-terror strategy was " inadequate "
In a Daily Telegraph interview , former chief of the general staff , Gen Sir Mike Jackson , added that US strategy had been " short - sighted " .
He said former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation " .
The Ministry of Defence said Sir Mike was a private citizen who was entitled to express his views .
The US Department of Defense said : " Divergent viewpoints are a hallmark of open , democratic societies . "
Sir Mike told the Daily Telegraph that Mr Rumsfeld 's claim that US forces " do n't do nation - building " was " nonsensical " .
We should have kept the Iraqi security services in being
Gen Sir Mike Jackson
Iraq militia ' freeze ' welcomed ' Frustration ' with UK in Basra
He criticised the decision to hand control of planning the administration of Iraq after the war to the Pentagon .
He also described the disbanding of the Iraqi army and security forces after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein as " very short - sighted " .
" We should have kept the Iraqi security services in being and put them under the command of the coalition , " he said .
Mehdi army
The Telegraph reports that in Sir Mike 's autobiography Soldier , which is being serialised in the paper , he said the US approach to fighting global terrorism was " inadequate " as it focused on military power rather than diplomacy and nation - building .
In the book , Sir Mike also said Mr Rumsfeld had refused to deploy enough troops to uphold law and order in Iraq and had rejected plans for administering Iraq drawn up by the US State Department , the paper says .
The criticism comes as the US military said an order from radical Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr to his Mehdi army militia to freeze operations for six months would allow coalition forces to concentrate their attentions on al - Qaeda .
A US statement said the instruction would mean fewer kidnappings , killings and attacks .
Sir Mike , who is now retired , also defended the record of British troops in Iraq after claims by US officials that UK forces had failed .
He said : " What has happened in the south , as throughout the rest of Iraq , was that primary responsibility for security would be handed to the Iraqis once the Iraqi authorities and the coalition were satisfied that their state of training and development was appropriate .
" In the south we had responsibility for four provinces .
Three of these have been handed over in accordance with that strategy .
It remains just in Basra for that to happen . "
His comments follow a series of critical remarks from US officials about the British attitude towards Iraq .
' Strain on operation '
US military adviser Gen Jack Keane said last week that American commanders had expressed " frustration " over the prospect of UK withdrawal .
Divergent viewpoints are a hallmark of open , democratic societies and that tradition is part of the military culture and ethos
US Department of Defense
BBC defence correspondent Paul Wood said Sir Mike 's comments may put further strain on the British - US operation in Iraq .
Sir Mike 's criticisms were backed by Sir Malcolm Rifkind , former Conservative foreign secretary and defence secretary .
Sir Malcolm told the BBC : " I think one of the most fundamental criticisms is not just that Rumsfeld was incompetent - which he was - but it was actually his boss , George Bush , who actually made the extraordinary decision to put the Pentagon and Rumsfeld in control of political nation - building after the actual war ended . "
A spokeswoman for the US State Department said she would not comment on Sir Mike 's views .
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said Sir Mike 's remarks reinforced his view that British troops should leave Iraq as soon as is practically possible .
He told BBC News 24 that Sir Mike was " a man well known for speaking his mind and not afraid to ruffle American feathers " .
Last week , Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to Mr Campbell , rejecting the Lib Dem leader 's call for a timetable for withdrawing UK troops .
Today there are several lines of research under way that are treating both the infirmities of aging and the aging process itself , so that we are treating many of the phenomena like loss of memory , loss of vision , sexual performance , and so on with individual therapies , and in the course of that we are essentially extending the quality of life for people at a much higher age .
If one then in addition looks at the current work on stem cells as well as on certain phenomon like telomerase , an enxyme in DNA , what we find is we are learning a great deal about how that mechanism is the control mechanism for aging , and it is very likely that over the next 25 years , we will be actually be able to manipulate the production of telomerase in individual cells .
In other words , society will see serious and effective medical intervention in the aging process --- people undergoing such therapy will keep looking and feeling and acting younger than their calendar age .
The prospect to individuals for living seriously longer than the current norm will begin to open up .
The Hayflick limit is the limit of the maximum number of cell replications that a human being ( or any species ) can engage in .
So , how many times do our cells replace themselves ?
That 's the limit of human lifespan .
When you can't replace your cells anymore , you die .
And Leonard Hayflick calculated that number for a variety of species , and for human beings it was 120 .
So we have almost no documented instances of people living more than one hundred and twenty years .
Science and medicine will not only be essentially extending people to their normal full life span ( i.e. 120 ) , but will extend the human natural life span to beyond that , and a reasonable guess as to how much will be gained over the next century or so is at least 25 or 30 years .
In other words , a person born in the year 2000 will still be alive in 2150 There 's one other factor .
If one simply looks at the historical trend , one finds that over the last century , we have nearly doubled human life span .
The average lifespan of human beings ( average , not maximum ) has gone from about 45 to about 85 .
With the advances in microbiology and molecular biology , there 's no reason to imagine that we wo n't do at least as much in the next century .
In fact , if you double 85 , you 're at 170 ... so I 'm actually being conservative .
Facebook Inc. wants to turn the members of its popular online hangout into champions of the brands that advertise there .
Trying to mine its commercial potential , the social networking site Tuesday unveiled an advertising strategy that piggybacks on one of its most powerful features : the news feed , which shows users a streaming list of what their friends are doing .
Facebook hopes the news feed also will help users promote its advertisers .
To do so , the company plans to follow users when they visit its partners ’ websites .
For example , Facebook users who add a movie to their rental queue on Blockbuster.com will see a message asking whether they want to tell their friends .

Users also can notify their online pals if they list items on EBay or buy movie tickets through Fandango .
For an unspecified fee , advertisers can attach targeted messages to these news alerts .
The method might seem creepy to some people .
But if done right , analysts said , it could make ads more relevant than ever on social networks , where young Internet users broadcast their every move .
“ This could potentially be game - changing for online advertising , ” said Debra Aho Williamson , an analyst with research firm EMarketer Inc .
Facebook promoted its strategy to Madison Avenue on Tuesday with big - name partners such as Coca - Cola Co. , Sony Pictures and Verizon Wireless .
The company is trying to boost its advertising revenue and prove its worth to investors .

Expectations rose last month when Microsoft Corp. , the world ’s largest software maker , agreed to buy a small stake in Facebook for $ 240 million .
The deal valued Facebook at $ 15 billion , turning up the pressure on the Palo Alto - based company to better engage major advertisers .
Facebook , founded in a Harvard University dorm room in 2004 , is expected to generate $ 150 million in revenue this year .
MySpace , the No. 1 social networking site , with 110 million users , on Monday showcased a new targeted advertising system that lets advertisers deliver banner ads based on data from users ’ profiles , the groups they join and the messages they post for their friends .
It also launched a service that makes it easier for small businesses to advertise on the site .
Social networking sites have amassed a wealth of data about users and their friends , who voluntarily disclose a lot of information through what they put on their profile pages and do on the site .
Those finely detailed insights into users ’ demographics and online behavior -- who they are , what they like and how they interact -- could be a boon for advertisers , who are expected to almost triple their online spending to $ 3.6 billion worldwide by 2011 , according to EMarketer .

Facebook is attempting to move beyond targeting to harnessing the power of word of mouth among a circle of friends , Williamson said .
“ This is not just banner ads flashing on top of Web pages , ” she said .
“ This is tapping into the way people interact with each other . ”
That ’s a big selling point with advertisers .
“ The most valuable marketing asset is a trusted referral by a friend , ” said Dwight Caines , executive vice president of worldwide digital marketing strategy for Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group .
“ We live and die by customer word of mouth . ”

Facebook is letting marketers create profile pages and invite fans of their products to become their online friends -- something MySpace has done for years .
But when people declare themselves fans of a particular product , Facebook will alert all their friends on the site .
The increasingly precise way marketers are aiming ads at users has raised some hackles .
Jon Leibowitz , a member of the Federal Trade Commission , last week expressed concern about threats posed to consumer privacy by so - called behavioral targeting .
Facebook says it plans to let users decide whether they want to alert friends about the brands and the bands they like .
The success of Facebook ’s advertising scheme will depend on what its 52 million users -- who use the site to stay in touch with friends and virtually “ poke ” one another -- think of it , Williamson said .
“ I do n’t think I am going to poke Coca - Cola or extol the virtues of products directly , ” said Alex Dempsey , a 23 - year - old programmer who uses Facebook every day .
He said he would have liked to have alerted his 250 Facebook friends recently when he bought plane tickets to visit his girlfriend in France .
And he ’s all for ads becoming more relevant to his interests .

“ The other day I heard one of those ‘ Congratulations , you have just won a free iPhone ’ ads on Facebook and it really pissed me off , ” Dempsey said .
“ If they keep doing that I think they are going to shoot themselves in the foot . ”
As part of its new advertising system , Facebook also can target ads to people who share certain interests , educational background or location .
No personally identifiable information will be shared with advertisers , Facebook said .
It did not say how much it would charge marketers for these services .

By the looks of him , he is a pretty big dude .
So , unluckily for me , I have to stop at a light .
At this point , my girlfriend is kind of freaking out .
I am probably , 5 - 7 or 5 - 8 with my hair standing up and do n't weigh much more than a buck fifty , maybe 60 after a big meal .
Never been much of a fighter , did n't really have to .
I have to say , it kind of freaked me out .
So , of course Mr Testosterone has to get out of his car and confront me .
Like I said , he looked big , and when he got beside me , unfortunately again for me , he was probably 6 - 2 and maybe 200 - 220 .
Dressed in a pretty sharp suit with no jacket and his tie loosened .
Probably had a pretty bad day as he proceeded to call me everything but an english speaking white man .
On and on , if I was to get out of the car he'd beat my ass blah blah blah .
Finally he called me a little cocksucker and then he told my GF that I was a bitch .
LOL .
The old bitch card .
So , I continued to look straight ahead , I rolled my window down , maybe a 1/3 , not quite half and asked him if he was having a bad day .
Without warning , Road Rage Guy punches at me .
Fucking longest light in the history of Vancouver right here ... sadly for him , his big fucking mitt hit most of my window - - shaking his hand he yelled for me to get out of the car -- LOL , here is where it gets funny .
I am still looking straight over my steering wheel .
He takes one step closer to the car to open it as the light changes .
Again , sadly for this fucking meathead , I had already locked the door , still looking ahead , I lunge through my partially opened window , grab him by his tie and pull him towards my car , frantically I rolled up my window and hit the gas , dragging this fuckwad through the intersection -- have you ever seen a cursing , swearing salesman do a sidestep at 15 KM /H ?
I am still kind of laughing , and of course my GF thinks it is hilarious -- I am still a little pissed off that I did n't hit 30 and drag this fucking monkey through the streets of Vancouver .
So , if you were the dork that assaulted me , too bad you are a such dick head , but I sincerely hope that you have another tie and pair of dress shoes , those shoes have to be scuffed the fuck up .
I do admire your agility at running beside my car doing cross overs .
Your football training probably saved your life .

09:34 am - hardware hack : UPS Battery Upgrade
I replaced an old UPS 's worn - out sealed lead - acid battery with a very large marine deep - cycle battery .
The result : probably a day 's worth of off - grid runtime for our house server , for about the cost of a replacement UPS .
You need :
* Old UPS that is bitching about a replacement battery , but otherwise works .
* Deep Cycle marine battery , about $ 90 , from your local megamart .
* Ring connectors that can screw down to the battery 's terminals , about $ 3 , near the battery display at the megamart .
Do n't use clips !
* Probably : A length of extension cord to make your UPS battery wires long enough to reach the battery 's mount location .
How to :
1 . Cut the connectors off the old UPS 's battery wires and strip the ends .
2 . Get a length of at - least 14 guage dual - conductor polarized zip cord ( as an extension ) , strip the ends , and fasten to the UPS battery leads ( observing polarity ) with solder or crimp - on connectors .
3. Crimp battery ring terminals to extension conductors and solder thoroughly .
4 . Securely mount the battery so it can't tip over , and place it where any possible leakage will be contained ( in a tray , or over a sink or drain )
5 . Paying strict attention to polarity (+ to + , - to -) , screw down ring terminals to battery .
Mind nothing metal touches both battery terminals at the same time !
Your UPS should be able to generate off - grid power now , as lead - acid batteries come fully charged from the store .
Plug in a lamp or something and give it a test .
Assuming everything works , plug your equipment in to the UPS , plug the UPS into the wall , and never worry about grid failures taking out your server again .
Addenda Whys and Wherefores :
" Do n't use clips " : Ring terminals can be screwed down for secure electrical contact .
Clips tend to wiggle loose and can oxidize , resulting in intermittent connections .
" Use polarized , dual - conductor , 14 - gauge extension wire " : Polarized wire helps you keep the + and - conductors distinguished .
If you get the polarity backwards , you will kill your UPS .
14 - gauge is a good size for a standard desktop UPS .
Speaker wire is ideal and inexpensive .
" Put the battery over a tray " : Lead acid batteries can , very rarely and under extreme abuse or catastrophic failure , leak a dilute sulfuric acid solution .
You do n't want this on your carpets .
" Solder when possible " : A crimp connection is generally reliable but subject to pull - out and possible oxidation , but a soldered and crimped connection will never fail .
" Deep Cycle Marine " : Regular or " Starting " lead - acid batteries cannot tolerate repeated full or near - full discharge .
They are made to put out lots of power to start an engine , not run low - power electronics .
Golf Cart , Deep Cycle , and Trolling batteries are made to be discharged slowly and fully -- so use them for your UPS .
" Why not just buy a new UPS battery ? " :
They 're not stock items at any store I live near , which means mail - order and shipping , which means paying to move LEAD around , which means they 're expensive to buy and expensive to ship .
I 'd rather spend a little more and get a very large battery with much longer back - up time .
" What do I do with the old UPS battery ? " :
Give it to the store you buy the marine battery from .
They 're required by law in most US states and Canadian provinces to accept old lead - acid batteries for recycling if they sell new ones .
DO NOT THROW IT AWAY .
Justice Department accused of hypocrisy over ' executive privilege ' Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This Alberto Gonzales 's Justice Department has issued legal opinions in recent weeks seeking to bolster the White House 's claims of executive privilege against Congressional investigations .
At the same time , a bipartisan group in Congress is fighting what it sees as hostility toward the exercise of attorney - client privilege in federal corporate crime prosecutions .
Advocates of new legislation to preserve attorney - client privilege pointed out the contrast between the Justice Department 's positions in these two areas .
" There 's a certain level of hypocrisy in terms of being willing to infringe on an organization 's or an individual 's right to privilege , but still standing very steadfast and adamant on the administration 's own attorney - client or executive privilege , " said Jesselyn McCurdy , Legislative Counsel in the American Civil Liberties Union 's Washington Legislative Office in an interview with RAW STORY .
McCurdy has been helping to spearhead an unusual coalition encouraging Congress to preserve attorney - client privilege in the Justice Department 's post -Enron and Worldcom corporate prosecutions .
Guided by the so - called ' Thompson Memorandum , ' a document written by former Attorney General John Ashcroft 's deputy , federal prosecutors have routinely required corporations to waive their right to attorney - client privilege , or the right to speak confidentiality with counsel on pending legal matters .
Critics of the government guidance argue it is used to coerce businesses , which are threatened with economic ruin if they do not appear to be fully cooperating with government prosecutions .
But a Justice Department spokesman , Erik Ablin , challenged the claim .
" Since the McNulty Memo was issued in December 2006 , prosecutors nationwide have submitted no waiver requests for attorney - client communications , " he wrote in a e-mail to RAW STORY .
Nevertheless , Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) , a Congressman who chairs the Crime Subcommittee on the House Judiciary Committee , introduced the Attorney - Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007 in the House of Representatives on Thursday night .
" This bill protects corporations and employees  from the executive suites to the mailroom  whose rights the Department of Justice and other federal agencies have violated ,  Rep. Scott said in a statement issued Friday afternoon .
" Corporate crime should be vigorously investigated and prosecuted but within traditional Constitutional boundaries .
When government agencies use tactics that violate Constitutional rights , it is time for Congress to act . "
Contrasting ' privileges ' in Gonzales ' Justice Department The White House has fiercely defended its ' executive privilege ' in the face of Congressional investigations , particularly the probe into the recent firing of 8 US Attorneys .
Solicitor General Paul Clement outlined the current administration 's position in a memo sent to White House Counsel Fred Fielding at the end of June .
" One of the underlying purposes of the privilege is to promote sound decisionmaking by ensuring that senior Government officials and their advisers speak frankly and candidly during the decisionmaking process , " Clement wrote to Fielding , relying on Supreme Court precedents set in the course of Congressional investigations of the Presidency of Richard M. Nixon .
Susan Hackett , the Association of Corporate Counsel 's Senior Vice President and General Counsel , agreed that there is a contradiction between the Justice Department 's positions on executive privilege for the White House , and their stance on attorney - client privilege in corporate prosecutions .
" We 've often joked that if you look at the government 's releases on why executive privilege should be maintained , they read like our documents , " Hackett explained to RAW STORY in a telephone interview .
" They are speaking out of both sides of their mouths .
They wish to exercise privilege in their own context , but they are relying on limiting it in their prosecutions . "
But the Justice Department 's spokesman questioned Hackett 's argument in a Friday e-mail .
" Your question contains the premise that DOJ ' routinely encourag [ es ] waivers of attorney - client privilege , ' which is not supported by the facts , " wrote Ablin , who serves as Senior Counsel in the Justice Department 's Office of Public Affairs .
Post - Enron tactics spark legal controversy Ablin was defending current federal investigations and prosecutions of corporate fraud and other offenses .
After the Enron and Worldcom collapses , Ashcroft no .
2 Larry Thompson issued a memorandum directing US Attorneys and other Justice Department officials to consider a number of factors in deciding whether or not an entire corporation should be charged for what might be the illegal practices of a few rogue employees .
" In determining whether to charge a corporation , that corporation 's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate with the government 's investigation may be relevant factors , " Thompson 's Jan. 2003 memo read .
" In gauging [ sic ] the extent of the corporation 's cooperation , the prosecutor may consider the corporation 's willingness to ... waive attorney - client and work product protection . "
Critics of the memo warned that this practice restricted the rights of individuals within the suspected corporation to speak with an attorney , a guarantee found in the Constitution 's Sixth Amendment .
" [ W ] eve conducted inquiries , conducted hearings , and solicited views and are of the judgment that the Thompson memorandum is excessive and that it impinges upon the constitutional right to counsel , " said Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) in a Dec. 2006 press conference .
Earlier this year , Specter introduced the Senate version of Scott 's bill .
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , the current chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , explained why he believed the issue was not only worrisome for large corporations .
" The right to counsel has long been recognized as essential to ensure fairness , justice and equality under the law for all Americans , " he said in a September 2006 hearing .
" This Administration has taken extraordinary steps to investigate and prosecute the press and to intimidate the press , critics , and attorneys while it has claimed unlimited privileges and secrecy for itself . "
The ACLU 's McCurdy agreed .
" We 're really concerned about the Justice Department routinely asking organizations to waive attorney - client privilege because of the way it affects individual employees and their rights to counsel and against self - incrimination , " the ACLU attorney explained .
" We 're concerned about the broader issue of maintaining and protecting privilege .
What 's the point of having that right if everything you say to your attorney can go to the government ? "
Additionally , a federal judge rebuked the Justice Department for the practice in his ruling on a prosecution brought against the company KPMG .
But the Justice Department insisted that any zealousness caused by the Thompson memorandum 's guidelines had been discontinued with the issuing of a follow - up guidance from current Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty ( who recently announced that he will resign from the Justice Department later this summer ) . " [ M ] y policy now makes clear that attorney - client communications should only be sought in rare cases ; that is , that legal advice , mental impressions and conclusions and legal determinations by counsel are protected , " McNulty said in a December 2006 address .
" Before they are requested , the United States Attorney must seek approval directly from me .
I must personally approve each waiver request for attorney - client communications . "
ACC's Hackett responded that the McNulty memo was " too little too late . "
" They still behave as if they have a right to decide when clients can or cannot consult their lawyers for confidential advice , " she wrote to RAW STORY .
" Those prosecutors who were likely to ask for privilege waivers before are still doing it now , without going up the ladder for permission , according to our members  feedback . "
' Strange bedfellows ' cooperate on attorney - client bill
In the current Congress , Democratic and Republican House Members are at odds over the course of the US Attorneys investigation .
But Rep. Scott 's legislation represents a rare point where Republican and Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee are coming together .
" Prosecutors may be overreaching by routinely demanding that corporations waive their attorney - client privilege as a condition of cooperation and a decision not to indict a company , " said Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee .
" The bill will bar prosecutors from making such a demand but will not prevent a corporation from voluntarily waiving the privilege . "
He was joined by other Republicans in supporting Scott 's bill : Ranking Crime Subcommittee Member Rep. J. Randy Forbes ( R - VA ) , Rep. Daniel E. Lungren ( R - CA ) , Rep. Howard Coble ( R-NC ) , Rep. Tom C. Feeney III ( R - FL ) , and Rep. Peter J. Roskam ( R - IL ) .
The ACC's Hackett suggested that the coalition supporting Scott 's bill was unusual .
" If you take a look at the coalition , the bedfellows are very strange , there is such a wide and diverse group of people who are worried about the Justice Department 's practices , " she said .
" It 's hard to figure out who 's against us except for the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission .
But it 's getting pretty cold out there for them . "
The ACLU 's McCurdy also insisted that the bill would n't be letting the next Enron off easily when it came in the sights of federal investigators .
" Prosecutors have the tools to investigate corporations now , " she argued .
" The concern we have about the routine waiver request is that it 's really just a way for the Justice Department to take a shortcut when prosecuting cases .
They can still collect evidence , but they have to do it in a way that 's consistent with the Constitution . "
BEYOND WORDS Kurt Cobain 's musical legacy Cobain 's dark life left shining legacy Cobain photo gallery Reader memories Listen to Nirvana clips ' Come as You Are ' ' The Man Who Sold The World ' ' Something in the Way ' ' All Apologies '
What did Kurt Cobain mean to you ?
We asked readers to share their thoughts about Kurt Cobain 's life , music and legacy .
Here 's what some of them said : " I was 15 when Nirvana burst onto the music scene , and I was completely blown away and captivated by this band from the first time I heard their music .
As cliche as it may sound , I viewed Kurt Cobain as the voice and poet for my generation .
I was a senior in high school and 18 when my friend Matt sat me down in my parents ' living room to inform me of Kurt 's death .
I was completely dumbfounded , numb .
Ten years later , I still remember that moment as if it was yesterday .
Now , at 28 , I have surpassed the age at which Kurt Cobain took his life and it hits me even more how tragic and untimely his death was . "
— Aimee Skold , Santa Monica , Calif .
" Kurt introduced a new form of music , alternative rock , that has amazingly simple riffs , painfully expressive symbolic lyrics and simple heavy distortion , all done with only a three - person band .
As with most good art , you do n't need to be highly complex to be very good ; and with Kurt , you did n't need to use the F - word . "
— Robert Boudreau , Corning , N.Y .
" I heard the news while I was doing a campus visit , trying to decide where to attend college .
I 'd like to say I did n't believe it at the time , but I 'm not sure that 's accurate .
In ( Nirvana 's ) song All Apologies , he did such a good job of describing his pain , that when the news hit it was almost just confirmation that the inevitable had happened , just sooner than we had feared .
My generation lost its John Lennon that day , and the world lost a great , albeit troubled , musician / father / husband / friend . "
— Brandon Mortensen , Minneapolis " Kurt Cobain and his band mates wrote the music that turned the music industry right - side up .
... Smells Like Teen Spirit signaled the arrival of underground music into the mainstream world .
Most significantly , it opened up opportunities for other great bands of the time .
So , in essence , Kurt was a musical messiah of sorts . "
— Chris Griffin , Atlanta " I was at working at a power plant when I first heard of the news Kurt Cobain 's suicide .
When I first heard of Nirvana back in 1991 - 92 , it was my freshman year at Fort Lewis College in Durango , Colo . ...
Ten years after , I reflect back and think of Nirvana and their songs and how much they attribute to my life .
Even my old college roommate bought a Kurt Cobain Jag - Stang guitar .
We used to jam on Nirvana while studying for finals . "
— E. L. Navajo , Shiprock , N .M. " Well , when Kurt Cobain died , I was 38 .
I was n't a young teenager anymore , but I really felt his words in the music he sang .
I was on my regular day walk and I had my headphones on when I heard it on the radio .
...
He was a very , sad young man , I always thought , and I always wished that there was something I could have said to him to help him .
But of course , that was impossible .
Even now , on the 10th anniversary of his death , it only seems like yesterday .
If only he knew how much his fans loved him and his unique style of music , he might have thought different and he would still be making music . "
— Debbie Wilgosh , Ontario , Canada " Kurt Cobain and Nirvana were my ultimate inspiration to become a musician .
...
When I heard about ( Cobain 's death ) , I think I was 9 or 10 .
His lyrics from songs like Lounge Act , All Apologies and the rare Verse Chorus Verse spoke to me in a way no other songs have before .
Kurt means so much to me .
I love everything about Nirvana and can't go a day without them . "
— Danny D'Agostino , Triangle , Va . " I believe genius sometimes comes in strange packages .
I am 45 - year - old , and when I first heard Nirvana , I just went , " Wow , who is this ? '
I am a huge rock ' n ' roll fan from the ' 70s and was so pleased to hear something fresh , alive and new .
Also , it 's one of the few bands my children and I like .
It 's too bad someone in his family was n't able to help him — having said that , I had someone in my family who took their own life , and sometimes you just do n't know . "
— Jennifer Reitsman " I was only 15 , so he did not mean much to me as a person .
He meant much more to me as an idea , a movement .
He inspired and changed a world disillusioned by happiness .
He reflected many of the same changes and hardships that I faced as a teenager during those times .
My parents split up , my world came crashing down , I realized all the pain in the world .
He sang about all of that .
He started a revolution in the thinking of the youth of our day .
He will be remembered more for what he started than who he was . "
— Brandon Hill , Dallas " Kurt was instrumental in the '90s rock music revolution ; he brought hope and inspiration to the masses who were disillusioned with what the music industry had become and what is once again .
Who will be the next revolutionary to shake things up and start a new music revolution ?
I hope he or she comes along soon . "
— Roy Farley , Seattle " It was the summer of ' 92 , and I spent the summer hitching around England .
I can't begin to tell you how many times I was stranded in the English countryside when no one would give me lift .
The only thing I had to keep me company was my Walkman and Nirvana cranking in my ears .
I have to admit that sometimes I hoped no one would stop , so I could let the song play out and keep slamming my head as I walked down the road .
Other times when a ride looked hopeless and there was nothing but time , I 'd chill with the songs and try to break down each line , going over and over them and thinking .
No other band before or after has touched me quite like Nirvana and Kurt Cobain . "
— Jason Eric , Los Angeles
" To me as a Baby Boomer , Kurt Cobain represented the final frontier of rock music .
I have not heard anything since his death that I consider new or revolutionary .
To me , most of the newer ' alternative ' music I hear my kids play sounds derivative of Cobain 's work I believe Cobain was the last of the popular music giants , and in a class with the Dylans , the Springsteens , the Morrisons , the Hendrixes and the Fogertys .
Unfortunately , this clearly was a guy in a lot of pain for whatever reason , and his seemingly doomed life was all too short .
I would have liked to see where he took music next . "
— Bill Nemser , Boca Raton , Fla .
" I was shocked to hear of Cobain 's untimely death in April 1994 .
Nirvana was a staple in my CD player , and it was sad to know that I was n't going to be buying any more classic albums like Nevermind or MTV Unplugged in New York .
In the latest issue of Rolling Stone , Vernon Reid of Living Colour made an interesting statement : ' I wish Kurt Cobain was still around to make music and confront George Bush .
Can you imagine the song he would have written about reality TV ? '
Sadly , we 're left only to imagine . "
— Ken Devine , Nashville " I understood the pain and suffering Kurt Cobain was writing about in his songs .
I was 17 and a junior in high school when he died .
... I am now 27 , the same age that Cobain ( was when he ) killed himself .
It 's a weird age to be .
I hardly ever cry , but I did cry when Kurt Cobain died .
After Kurt died , I really did n't have an idol or a celebrity I really identified with . "
— Michael Hatch , North Kingstown , R.I. " I was 9 years old at the time , and an older kid came to our lunch table and told me and all the rest of the fourth graders ( that Cobain had died ) .
I was n't exactly sure who Kurt was , but I had heard of Nirvana and still remember that exact moment today .
To me , it has meant a lot , as he was really a strong force behind the music of our generation .
It can still be heard in the sounds of the Vines , the White Stripes , and other bands that are popular now that our generation is in college .
It also meant a lot to me because I remember my cousin finding solace in the music of Nirvana while his sister was dying .
I never really understood it all at the time , but now I can see the impact it made on his life in dealing with what were very hard times . "
— Dane Johnson , Stillwater , Minn .
" I first heard the news of Cobain 's death when I woke up one morning to go to school and there was an MTV news flash saying Kurt had shot himself .
I just started crying uncontrollably .
I ended up skipping school and listening to Nirvana music all day in total shock and disbelief .
He was my everything at that age and is still there in his music today .
He is greatly missed . "
— Chris Fuller , Winthrop , Maine " I was 9 , and I sat in my mother 's car driving home from school when the DJ came on and said Kurt had shot himself .
It was at that moment in time that everything I had experienced so far came to a head , and I realized the finiteness of life .
Ever since then , I listen to Nirvana and remember we do n't have a lot of time , so we better take the most we can out of it . "
— Andrew D. Johnstone , Cambridge , Md. " I was 14 years old when Kurt Cobain killed himself .
I was rocked to the core .
Nirvana 's music had given me an outlet for my feelings .
The first time time I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit , I felt like a light bulb lit up .
My feelings of angst , depression and isolation were summed up in Nirvana 's music .
I could n't get enough .
I would sit in my room and blare it on my stereo and feel like someone understood .
...
The day I found out that Kurt Cobain killed himself it felt like someone had burst my bubble , taken my security blanket .
I felt like I lost an understanding friend , even though I 'd never met him . "
— Brandy Venditti , Sandston , Va . " I was only 11 when Cobain died , and then did n't really like Nirvana .
But in later years , I have grown to appreciate what music they left us and only wonder what could have been if he had n't had tragically ended his life .
It does make me upset , though , to see so many teenagers obsess over Cobain and exploit his life to its fullest marketable capacity .
He was just a man , not a saint .
Let his memory live , but let his soul rest in peace . "
— Jonathan Lane , St. Louis
" To this day , Kurt Cobain still means something to me .
Every song that he belted out was full of real emotions .
It was raw , stunning , and real .
No other musician or band will ever compare to Cobain and Nirvana .
I still listen to their music and it continues to give me goosebumps . "
— Danny McCaslin , Atchison , Kan .
" I was coming home from work and heard the news about Kurt on the radio .
... I think about Kurt all the time and still get teary - eyed thinking about that day . "
— Thomas Joy , Centralia , Ill .
Specter is making a ‘ statement ’
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) has caved to White House demands on a wide variety of issues , but when it comes to presidential signing statements , the Pennsylvania senator has actually been pretty good .
A year ago , he even tried to introduce legislation that would allow Congress to sue the president over his use of these legally dubious documents .
He asked at the time , “ What ’s the point of having a statute if … the president can cherry - pick what he likes and what he does n’t like ? …
If he does n’t like the bill , let him veto it . ”
Not surprisingly , Specter ’s Republican colleagues quickly would put the kibosh on the proposal .
John McCain helped kill the bill , arguing , “ I think the president will enforce the law . ”
( Yes , McCain ’s child - like naivete is rather amusing in retrospect . )
Specter , however , is quite right .
We have a bizarre dynamic at play : Congress passes bills , Bush signs the bills into law , and then , in several instances , after the president issues signing statements , the Bush administration decides not to do what the law mandated .
Bush has actually used signing statements to challenge more than 1,100 sections of legislation he ’s signed into law — more than every other president in U.S. history combined
Thanks to a more reasonable Senate majority , Specter is giving his bill another shot .
Frustrated by the Bush administration ’s continued use of presidential signing statements to challenge or ignore provisions of Congressionally approved legislation , Senate Judiciary ranking member Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) has reintroduced legislation to rein in President Bush ’s ability to use the tactic .
Specter , who has long been a critic of Bush ’s use of signing statements , quietly introduced his Presidential Signing Statements
Act of 2007 on Friday .
“ The president cannot use a signing statement to rewrite the words of a statute nor can he use a signing statement to selectively nullify those provisions he does not like , ” Specter said in a floor statement .
Specter added , “ If the president is permitted to rewrite the bills that Congress passes and cherry - pick which provisions he likes and does not like , he subverts the constitutional process designed by our framers . ”
( To which the White House apparently responded , “ Duh . ” )
For what it ’s worth , the GAO recently found multiple instances of the administration willfully ignoring provisions of laws the president signed , justified by Bush ’s dubious signing statements .
The GAO report might help the debate .
Federal officials have disobeyed at least six new laws that President Bush challenged in his signing statements , a government study disclosed yesterday .
The report provides the first evidence that the government may have acted on claims by Bush that he can set aside laws under his executive powers .
In a report to Congress , the non partisan Government Accountability Office studied a small sample of the bill provisions that Bush has signed into law but also challenged with signing statements .
The GAO found that agencies disobeyed six such laws , while enforcing 10 others as written even though Bush had challenged them .
House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers , Democrat of Michigan , said yesterday that the GAO ’s findings demonstrated a need for a more “ extensive review ” of how the government has followed up on hundreds of other laws challenged by Bush .
“ The administration is thumbing its nose at the law , ” said Conyers , one of the lawmakers who commissioned the GAO study .
With Specter ’s help , maybe there ’ll actually be some progress on the issue — just in time for the next president .

The period of work by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain , working under William Shockley , would become known as the " miracle month " and resulted in the world 's first working transistor .
" They demonstrated something that became the basic mechanism for our entire electronic industry , " said Dr Art Ramirez of Bell Labs , the location of the 1947 invention .
" They 're in aircraft , automobiles , digital cameras and microwave ovens , " said Jeff Katz , a guide at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley .
" In every house there is somewhere in the region of 50 to 100 million transistors , and that 's probably a conservative estimate , " he said .
" If you start including computers and digital cameras you are probably approaching one trillion . "
Computing age
Transistors are used to control the flow of electricity in a circuit .
The flow between two terminals - the source and the drain - is controlled by applying a current or voltage to the third terminal - the gate .
The first transistor consisted of plastic wrapped in gold foil

" It 's very much like a water faucet .
The gate is the handle and the faucet controls the flow of electrons between the source and the drain , " said Dr Ramirez .
The tiny devices have two key properties which make them attractive to electronics engineers : they can amplify a signal and they can act like a switch .
This ability to boost a signal makes them attractive to the communications and broadcast industry whilst their capability to turn on and off quickly has made them the component of choice for computation .
Their development came from a world recovering from the Second World War .
" During the war there was a lot of electronics work going on for communications and computation mainly for military purposes , " said Mr Katz .
For example , in December 1943 , the British built Colossus - the first electronic computer - to break messages passed by the German high command .
" This culminated in the invention of the ENIAC computer , " said Mr Katz .
TRANSISTOR HIGHLIGHTS
1947 : Transistor invented 1952 : First - commercial application - hearing aid 1954 : First mass - market device - transistor radio 1956 : First transistor computer
The ENIAC was installed at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and was the first large - scale programmable digital computer .
Like Colossus , instead of transistors it used vacuum tubes , also known as thermionic valves , which were delicate structures that looked similar to light bulbs .
" It filled a room , the power consumption was huge , it had nearly 18,000 tubes but it had very , very limited functionality , " said George Scalise president of the Semiconductor Industry Association ( SIA ) .
" There was no way of scaling up the computer without finding some way to make the devices that allowed it to function lower cost , lower power , smaller and more reliable . "
Crude device
As a result scientists across the world began to look for an alternative .
One of the leading groups was based at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey .
The Sonotone 1010 was the first transistorised product
There , a theoretician known as William Shockley led the solid state physics group , which included other scientists such as John Bardeen and Walter Brattain .
After hiring Bardeen , Shockley set him off on a project to understand the interaction of electrons on the surfaces of semiconductors , but personal differences meant the new recruit soon went his own way .
" Bardeen really did n't get along with Shockley so he started working with Brattain who was an experimentalist , " said Dr Ramirez .
Over 18 months the pair went about investigating these " surface states " using various experimental set-ups .
" It was a series of experiments that led to a deeper understanding of how to build a device that actually switched , " he said .
The work led to their miracle month and culminated with them showing off the first working transistor two days before Christmas in 1947 .
The half - inch ( 1.25 cm ) device , made from germanium with two gold contacts held in place by a plastic wedge , bore little resemblance to the tiny precise switches produced today .
" I have seen a replica been made of the first transistor in the same way as it was made and it's remarkably crude , " said Mr Katz .
However , it was enough to convince the hierarchy of Bell Labs and after filing patents it was announced to the public on 1 July 1948
" This was announced to fantastic fanfare , " said Dr Ramirez .
" Reading about it reminds me of the way that Steve Jobs rolls out the iPod . "
Silicon block
Over the next few years , Shockley modified the design of the transistor into a device closer to the design used today .
" He made such a key contribution that he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize [ for Physics ] in 1956 , " said Dr Ramirez .
With the invention of the transistor many new applications become possible , including the first transistor - based hearing aid , made by Sonotone
This was followed by the first mass market device - the transistor radio .
" They were about the size of a paperback book today but the replaced something that was about the size of a bread toaster , " said Mr Katz .
They were also used for military equipment , televisions and in communications networks .
Initially , transistors were built separately and then wired together to make circuits .
But in 1958 , Jack Kilby , a scientist at Texas Instruments , invented the integrated circuit , a circuit where all of the components were built onto a single block of material , commonly silicon .
The transistor had found its natural home and its development has continued ever since .
Elements that used to be measured in millimetres and even centimetres in the first device are now measured in nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) .
Intel 's next generation of chip , for example will pack more than four hundred million transistors into an area the size of a postage stamp .
The silicon industry is now worth almost $ 300 bn a year and plays a key role in almost every area of life from computing and health care to entertainment and global communications .
" Nothing else could have transformed the world to the extent that this has , " said Mr Scalise .
