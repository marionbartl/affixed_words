AFP : Iran said on Tuesday that a man convicted of adultery had been stoned to death in a village in northwestern Iran , the first time it has confirmed such an execution in five years .
TEHRAN , July 10 , 2007 ( AFP ) – Iran said on Tuesday that a man convicted of adultery had been stoned to death in a village in northwestern Iran , the first time it has confirmed such an execution in five years .
“ This case has been recently executed in the village that was mentioned , ” judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi told reporters about the stoning of Jafar Kiani in the village of Aghche Kand in Qazvin province .
“ The verdict was implemented because it was definitive , ” Jamshidi said , implying it was approved by the supreme court , which must uphold all execution orders .
Under Iran ’s Islamic law , adultery is still theoretically punishable by stoning although in late 2002 , judiciary head Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahrudi had issued a directive suspending the practice .
In June , the Fars news agency reported that the judiciary had halted the stoning of a man and a woman in Qazvin province , believed to be the same man who has now been executed .
The judiciary had up until now vehemently denied any stonings since 2002 , although rights activists and press reports have on occasion claimed that such verdicts have been carried out .
Under the punishment of stoning , a male convict is buried up to his waist with his hands tied behind his back , while a female offender is buried up to her neck with her hands also buried .
The spectators and officials attending the public execution start throwing stones and rocks at the convict , who is theoretically released if he is able to free himself .
A group of women ’s rights activists headed by feminist lawyer Shadi Sadr have been campaigning to have the sentence wholly removed from the statute books .
The stoning brings to at least 110 the number of executions carried out in the Islamic republic so far this year .
At least 177 people were executed in 2006 , according to Amnesty International .
Capital offences in Iran include murder , rape , armed robbery , apostasy , blasphemy , serious drug trafficking , repeated sodomy , adultery or prostitution , treason and espionage .
ISTANBUL , Aug. 18 — Two men tried to hijack a Turkish passenger plane with 142 people aboard on Saturday but failed after pilots arranged an emergency landing in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya and the two lost control of the passengers .
The plane was en route to Istanbul from Nicosia , in northern Cyprus , when the hijackers , identified by Turkish officials as Mehmet Resat Ozlu , a Turkish national , and Abdulaziz Maliki , a Syrian holding a Palestinian passport , demanded that it be diverted to Iran .
They were protesting actions by the United States administration , the officials said .
The pilots reported being under attack minutes after the Atlas Jet flight , carrying 136 passengers and six crew members , took off .
The two men , shouting in Arabic , ran to the cockpit door and tried unsuccessfully to kick it open .
One held a plastic bag and said it contained a bomb , passengers told NTV , the private television network .

Mr. McCain also said he would seek to attract corporate leaders to improve management of the Pentagon , citing figures like Frederick W. Smith , the chief executive of FedEx Corporation , and John T. Chambers , the chief executive of Cisco Systems .
“ I would go to these people and say ‘ Look , you ’ve made a billion dollars .
Come on now , and do what David Packard did years ago .
Serve your country , ’ ” Mr. McCain said , referring to the co-founder of the Hewlett Packard Company who served as deputy defense secretary in the first Nixon administration .
Mr. McCain also described Gen. James L. Jones , the former NATO commander and Marine general , as one of his closest friends , adding he expected he would “ play a key role . ”
Mr. McCain discussed Iraq during an hourlong session on Thursday at his Senate office , sipping cappuccino and talking in measured if intense tones in the presence of two aides .
He ended the interview to go to the White House for a meeting with Mr. Bush .
“ One of the things that I ’m going to tell him , and I do n’t often talk about my conversations with the president , is that the American people need to be told more often what ’s happening , ” he said .
“ Where we ’re succeeding ; where we ’re failing ; where we ’ve made progress ; where we have n’t , here ’s the state of readiness , here ’s why we continue to see suicide bombers . ”
“ There ’s got to be more communication with the American people , ” he added .
“ Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it . ”
Mr. McCain said that the increase in American forces had led to a decline of sectarian killings in the Iraqi capital .
Despite claims of progress in Iraq , however , Mr. McCain acknowledged that the American strategy would falter unless the Iraqis moved quickly to establish a more inclusive government .
He expressed disappointment that the effort to enact a new law that would allow more former Baathists to serve in the government was stalled and said it was vital to arrange provincial elections so that Sunnis could join the political process .
“ So how do you motivate the Maliki government ?
Well , one of the ways is go sit down and have dinner with him like Lindsey Graham and I did last week , ” he said , alluding to his Republican colleague from South Carolina .
He said that he and Mr. Graham had warned Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki that the patience of the American public was running out .
Many members of the Bush administration and other lawmakers have met with Mr. Maliki to make the same point .
Late last week , the RIAA was dealt another setback in its battle against copyright infringement on college campuses in the US .
A federal judge denied the record labels ' motion to conduct ex parte discovery to determine the identities of seven students at the College of William and Mary , making the task of identifying those targeted by the record labels much more time - consuming .
Ex parte discovery is the music industry 's method of choice in its legal campaign against file - sharing , as it allows the RIAA to file a John Doe lawsuit based only on an IP address .
Despite the questions about the legality of the RIAA 's requests , judges have typically been willing to issue subpoenas forcing ISPs to turn over the name and address of the subscribers in question without the accused having a chance to contest the subpoena .
The RIAA subsequently files suit against the former John Doe should he or she decline to take advantage of its litigation settlement letters .
The decision by Judge Walter D. Kelley , Jr. , marks the second time the RIAA has been prevented from using ex parte discovery to discover the identities of college students suspected of file - sharing .
Last month , a federal judge in New Mexico ruled that targeted students at the University of New Mexico should have a chance to respond to the John Doe lawsuits , writing that the RIAA 's claims that the record labels would suffer " irreparable harm " if they were not allowed to take immediate discovery required a " Coleridgian ' suspension of belief . ' "
Judge Kelley 's opinion , available from Recording Industry vs. The People ( PDF ) , essentially says that the RIAA is not entitled to immediate discovery because it is using the incorrect law as the basis for its request .
In their motion , the record labels cite the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 as the authorization for its ex parte subpoenas .
Judge Kelley says that the College of William and Mary is not a cable operator , and even if it were , " only 'a government entity may obtain personally identifiable information concerning a cable subscriber pursuant to a court order . '
Because plaintiffs are not government entities , the CCPA does not authorize their ex parte subpoena . "
In effect , the judge is saying " not only did you cite the wrong law as the basis of your request , but even if this law applied to colleges , you would n't be entitled to the information anyway . "
Judge Kelley also helpfully points out that the record labels should have used the DMCA instead .
" Plaintiffs ' motion and accompanying brief neglect to mention that Congress provided a framework for subpoenas to identify internet infringers in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ' DMCA ' ) , specifically 17 U.S.C. § 512(h ) , " wrote the judge .
" Section 512 of the DMCA establishes safe harbor provisions for four categories of internet service providers ( ' ISP ' ) based on the function which the ISP performs with respect to the infringing material — ' transmitting it per § 512 ( a ) , caching it per § 512 ( b ) , hosting it per § 512 ( c ) , or locating it per § 512 ( d ) . ' "
In order for a subpoena to be issued under the DMCA , according to Judge Kelley , the record labels must first issue a DMCA takedown notice to the ISP : in this case , William and Mary .
However , since the college did not host , cache , or transmit the music in question , there 's no place for a takedown notice ... and no room for a subpoena to be issued .
The end result is that the RIAA is barred from discovering the identities of the alleged file - sharers at the College of William and Mary under either the CCPA — which it has used in most ( if not all ) file - sharing cases — or the DMCA .
Judge Kelley 's ruling is not precedent - setting , but if other judges in cases involving universities follow his example , it will be impossible for the RIAA to make its customary end - run around the legal system and will give the college students accused of file - sharing a chance to fight any subpoena in court — an option denied to the vast majority of the RIAA 's targets .
Since the first implementation of Daylight Saving Time ( DST ) in the United State during World War I , jokes have abounded about people who mistakenly believed the springtime adjustment of clocks somehow created an “ extra ” hour of daylight ( when all it did was shift the time of day that daylight hours occurred ) or that it had a deleterious effect on crops and farm animals ( who are oblivious to humans ’ methods of keeping time ) .
Now that stock of humor has been increased with the additional claim that the lengthened Daylight Saving Time period which was implemented in 2007 ( when DST began three weeks earlier than in previous years and stayed in effect for an additional week longer in the fall ) contributed to record high temperatures recorded across the U.S. in the late winter and early spring by producing a daily extra hour of “ warming ” daylight .
One such item quoted above was indeed published as a letter to the editor by the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette on 16 April 2007 :
You may have noticed that March of this year was particularly hot .
As a matter of fact , I understand that it was the hottest March since the beginning of the last century .
All of the trees were fully leafed out and legions of bugs and snakes were crawling around during a time in Arkansas when , on a normal year , we might see a snowflake or two .
This should come as no surprise to any reasonable person .
As you know , Daylight Saving Time started almost a month early this year .
You would think that members of Congress would have considered the warming effect that an extra hour of daylight would have on our climate .
Or did they ?
Perhaps this is another plot by a liberal Congress to make us believe that global warming is a real threat .
Perhaps next time there should be serious studies performed before Congress passes laws with such far - reaching effects .

However , this missive was not intended to be taken literally , as its author , Connie Meskimen , is a Little Rock lawyer known for penning sarcastic letters with tongue planted firmly in cheek , such as the following :
I enjoy Paul Greenberg ’s column and regard it as an oasis in a desert of pretty bad writing ( and in the case of Philip Martin , very bad writing ) .
I have to take issue with the substance of his Feb. 9 column , however .
In this missive , he lambastes the recent film “ American Beauty ” as being superficial , unduly politically incorrect and , most surprisingly , lacking in spirituality .
He says , “ There is not one sign of prayer , sacrament , church or any kind of simplicity , especially spiritual . ”
Perhaps he should review the plot again for spirituality .
It goes like this : A middle - aged man abandons his quest for material goods and quits his job .
He shows compassion for the social misfits around him , most notably the closet homosexual next door and his misfit son .
He is tempted by his daughter ’s Lolita - like friend and finds redemption in the end by refusing her advances .
He is then killed and speaks to us after his death about salvation ( from on high , judging from the camera angle ) .
Hmmm , as Humphrey Bogart would say .
Seems like I have read this story somewhere else .
Imagine my delight when I opened my paper Dec. 14 to find not one , not two , but — count ’em — three movie reviews by Philip Martin on the same page .
Martin has made himself the Ginsu knife of the world of letters ( but wait , there ’s more ) , albeit without the cutting edge .
In his review of “ The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Rings , ” we are treated to this insight in the form of a sentence fragment , which in fact is an entire paragraph : “ Because a movie is not a book . ”
He favors us with this incisive information after telling us that he saw the movie in Manhattan .
It is difficult for one to discern the relevance of this bit of information other than to remind us that Martin was in Manhattan .
I guess it was n’t playing in Paris .
In his review of “ Not Another Teen Movie , ” he provides us with this : “ Unfortunately a stupid movie that knows that it is stupid is not the same as a funny movie . ”
It is an absolute tragedy that Groucho Marx did n’t have Martin to write his straight lines .
In his review of “ The Man Who Was n’t There , ” Martin finds it necessary to compare the Coen brothers to F. Scott Fitzgerald .
Martin states that the Coens “ are like that other fellow Minnesotan , F. Scott Fitzgerald , insofar as they have the knack of saying very little very beautifully . ”
How appropriate .
Martin , like some of his fellow Arkansans , has the knack of saying very little very often .
Oh , well .
I suppose there are those enamored of Martin ’s style .
As the existentialist philosopher Jean Boyd opined , one man ’s weed is another ’s flower .
Nonetheless , Connie Meskimen ’s controversial “ Daylight Saving ” missive prompted a number of responses from Democrat - Gazette readers , ranging from expressions of incredulity that such a letter could have been written ( let alone published ) to hopes that it was all meant as a joke :
Re Connie Meskimen ’s comments on Daylight Saving Time exacerbating warming :
It is hard to believe in this day and time that there are still people who believe that night and day are controlled by human beings .
That the world rotates on an axis and moves around the sun is apparently an unknown scientific fact to some people .
Whether we put a time frame around this occurrence is a human need .
There is no more daylight than usual , regardless of the time .
I ca n’t believe the Democrat - Gazette would even print such drivel .
Oh , wait .
Maybe it is because it is another attempt to bash liberals .
How sad .
I am baffled by your accepting , much less featuring , the letter about Daylight Saving Time .
Did the editor accept the premise that our warmer March was due to the extra hour of daylight ?
Or was the intent to show how illogical those opposed to the concept of global warming can be ?
The bias of the writer is shown by “ You would think that members of Congress would have considered the warming effect that an extra hour of daylight would have on our climate . ”
There is later reference to the “ liberal Congress . ”
The notion reminds me of earlier arguments that with Daylight Saving Time , the hens would get confused and not know when to lay their eggs .
Nature and weather are , of course , unrelated to our choice of how we divide the day .
In fact , it is only in relatively recent times that we divided the day into 24 hours and had clocks .
Re the letter from Connie M. Meskimen about Daylight Saving Time :
Oh , please , please , please tell me that the date of that submission was April 1 .
A recent letter to the editor excoriated Congress for changing the start of Daylight Saving Time .
The writer said that the abnormally high temperatures in March were due to the effects of the extra hour of daylight .
In fact , the letter even insinuated that the change to Daylight Saving Time was a plot by Congress to exacerbate the effects of global warming and make it a bigger political issue .
I have some bad news for the letter writer .
In March , we had the exact same number of hours of daylight as we do every March .
While Congress has the power to change many laws , it can not change the laws of nature .
All the members did was change the time on our clocks .
They did not actually add any hours of daylight .
Having just read the letter from Connie M. Meskimen of Hot Springs , I ’m at a loss to figure out how she thinks Daylight Saving Time , even if it is “ another plot by a liberal Congress , ” could have any effect on how many hours of daylight or darkness there are in the world .
Congress may and does make a lot of dumb moves , but this is one thing it ca n’t change .
All those “ legions of bugs and snakes ” crawling around do n’t have clocks , just natural instinct , which tells them when it ’s warm enough and light enough to crawl around .
On the other hand , maybe it is I who do n’t understand Daylight Saving Time .
No doubt mine will not be the only response to letter writer Connie Meskimen .
First of all , she is correct to acknowledge the changes we ’ve all seen in seasonal patterns .
Sadly , though , she apparently does n’t want to believe that this is indeed a result of global climate change , which will continue to have an impact on our environment until notable measures are taken to slow the damage being done to our atmosphere .
To deny that the problem exists is just willful ignorance .
With regard to the extension of Daylight Saving Time , I would like to point out that this measure was enacted by a Republican - controlled Congress and signed by a Republican president as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
So much for her vast , left - wing , liberal conspiracy .
But perhaps her most bizarre thinking is that somehow Congress has created an extra hour of daylight out of thin air .
Anyone with even a basic understanding of reality knows that the number of hours of daylight we have on any given day is n’t altered by simply resetting a clock .
We also know that this simple shift of time can help reduce the consumption of energy by delaying the increased need and use of electricity after sundown .
Perhaps Meskimen can find an elementary school student to explain it to her .
Re the letter from Connie M. Meskimen : I am somewhat confused .
She states that we ’ve had the “ hottest March since the beginning of the last century , ” and she goes on to blame Congress for that due to the earlier than normal time change .
Well , we did “ spring forward ” a few weeks earlier than we have in the past .
What I am confused about is , no matter whether our clocks are set forward one hour or back one hour , do n’t we continue to have the same amount of daylight hours every day ?
I have decided , though , to be very careful about my voting in 2008 .
Whether conservative or liberal , I do n’t want to be guilty of voting in someone who has that much power over our weather !
Evidently Mr. Meskimen received a number of direct inquiries about his bit of satire , as afterwards the voicemail at his office phone presented callers with the following message : “ If you are calling about the Daylight Savings Time letter and wish to explain global warming or daylight savings time to me , I would urge you to get a sense of humor and / or a life , in that order .
Unless , of course , you want to pay me for an interview ; if so , please leave your telephone number and I will expediently return your call . ”
A few sharp - eyed readers pointed out that another tongue - in - cheek letter similar to Mr. Meskimen ’s had appeared in the Aspen Times a month earlier :
The more things change , the more things stay the same .
Way back before Ronald Reagan ’s political career , he recognized the problems which would occur if America had adopted socialized medicine .
With congress working to pass the SCHIP bill to provide government funded healthcare for children of parents with annual incomes up to $ 80,000 , this radio commentary is just as relevant today as it was then .
Many of Reagan ’s fears about socialized medicine have been realized in other countries .
If we are not careful , we will face similar consequences here .

This is the kind of investigation I 've been waiting six years for ...
The Politico :
The House Judiciary Committee has launched an investigation challenging repeated assertions by President Bush that he need not enforce aspects of laws he deems unconstitutional .
Committee members clashed over the validity of the investigation , which began with a committee hearing on Wednesday .
Democrats said Bush is overstepping his executive role and meddling with the legislative process .
Republicans maintained the president 's assertions are merely guiding interpretations and follow long - term precedent .
The investigation will cover Bush 's commentary on bills approved by both congressional chambers that require presidential approval .
In at least 148 cases , Bush has appended what are known as " signing statements " to his signature .
The documents outline specific aspects of the law that he finds unconstitutional and might refuse to enforce .
Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. , D - Mich. , said Bush 's widespread use of the signings challenge at least 800 provisions in laws passed while he has been in office .
" The administration has engaged in these practices under a veil of secrecy , " Conyers said during the hearing .
" This is a constitutional issue that no self - respecting federal legislature should tolerate . "
The signing statements amount to a line - item veto , according to critics , and frustrate the legislative branch by not giving lawmakers the opportunity to override a presidential veto .
They also have said that Bush has failed repeatedly to notify Congress of his intentions and that a collection of his signing statements is not readily accessible to lawmakers or the public .
This is a story that I ’m sure is being written over and over again by software designers like myself that need to develop relatively complex applications in a short amount of time .
The only realistic way to accomplish this is to bite off major chunks of functionality by leveraging the work of others .
Reinventing the wheel , especially wheels you know hardly anything about , ca n’t be justified .
Because of that many of the architectural decisions you have to make revolve around figuring out how to get all of those ‘ frameworks ’ and libraries and GUI components to work together .
But I digress …
This post simply tells the tale of my journey though picking a framework for a project , how the landscape has changed over time , and what that means for the future .
In case you do n’t want to read on , the ending is happy — I think .
For any project that requires the storage and orderly retrieval of data there ’s pretty much no way to get around using a database .
Also , if you have a requirement ( like I did ) that the user is able to select from a variety of SQL back - end databases then the use of some sort of Object - Relational Mapping ( ORM ) framework software is the only sane way to implement your application .
I ’m not going to get into the details of ORM software or try to compare the features of the vast array of frameworks available .
One current list of object - relational mapping software includes 34 entries for .NET ( and another 27 for Java ) .
One problem with making a selection is that many of these frameworks are constantly evolving and are thus moving targets .
On a side note , Microsoft has squarely thrown their hat into the ORM ring with the introduction of Language Integrated Query ( LINQ ) which is scheduled to be released with the ‘ Orcas ’ version of Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 ( see a summary here and a great series of articles on ScottGu ’s Blog ) .
LINQ wo n’t be released until next year so it could n’t even be considered for my project .
So , the question is :
If you ’re developing a modest .NET application , how do you go about selecting an ORM framework ?
I ’ll walk you through the selection process I used .
General filtering criteria :
Non-commercial : I had no money to spend .
This cut the possibilities about in half .
Open source :
Even though I did n’t want to touch the implementation , it was critical for long - term security that I had all the source code and build tools so it could be modified if needed .
SQL back - end selection :
The framework needed to support at least four of the most popular SQL databases .
I wanted the user to be able to select local and server - based databases that were both free ( MySQL and SQLite3 ) and commercially available ( Microsoft Access and MS - SQL Server ) .
Ease of use :
The learning curve for some frameworks is steep .
I wanted something that was easy to learn and to get up and running quickly .
Documentation and example code : Having a well documented API is important , but it ’s the example code and tutorials that teach you how to use the framework .
Support :
This was the most subjective piece of the puzzle .
The key is to get a sense of the level of developer and community involvement in the project .
This comes from looking at the release frequency and history ( in particular , look at the release notes and the number and type of issues resolved ) and the level of Forum and / or Wiki activity .
It ’s pretty easy to detect a dead project .
Foreshadow : Just because it ’s an active project now does n’t mean it wo n’t die in the near future !
To make a long story short , I ended up evaluating two open source ORMs : NHibernate for .NET and Gentle .
Net .
As noted above , I did this evaluation about a year ago ( Summer 2006 ) and things have changed since since then .
In any case , at the time I felt that the two were comparable for the functionality I needed which included just simple class to table mapping .
The two major competing factors were ease of use ( # 4 ) and support ( # 6 ) .
NHibernate was clearly the more active project , but the Gentle .
Net developers ( in particular , Morten Mertner ) were responsive to questions and quickly resolved issues that came up .
I found Gentle .
Net much easier to get up and running .
In particular , in NHibernate you need to create a matching mapping file for every database class .
This was daunting at the start and I felt like the split - file definitions would create a long - term maintenance problem .
With Gentle .
Net , I was able to use MyGeneration to create the .NET class which included the database field decorators , and that was it .
Also , RE : # 4 the NHibernate core is a 25 MB download while Gentle .
Net is less than 7MB .
This is not only telling of the relative complexity of the frameworks , but it also means that there would be significantly more baggage that I would have to carry around with NHibernate — and install on customer systems .
Based on that analysis it should n’t be a surprise that I picked Gentle .
Net .
One year later I ’m still happy with that decision .
Gentle .
Net continues to meet my needs and will for the foreseeable future .
OK , I ’m happy , so where ’s the problem ?
The problem is that it appears development has stopped on Gentle .
Net .
I ’m using the .NET 1.1 assemblies ( 1.2.9+SVN ) with my .NET 2.0 application .
The features in the next generation Gentle .
Net ( 2.0 ) development looks promising , but at this point it does n’t look like it will ever be released .
In retrospect , I suppose that even with my concerns , selecting NHibernate might have been the better long - term choice .
I think it was primarily the ease of the initial Gentle .
Net implementation that had the biggest sway on my decision .
Does this mean I made a wrong decision ?
You may think so , but I do n’t .
There may be some cognitive dissonance going on here , but I did what I consider a reasonable evaluation and analysis and selected the best solution for my needs under the circumstances .
So here we are today .
At some point in the future I will probably need to update or add a new SQL database that Gentle .
Net does n’t currently support .
I ’ll have to do something .
Here are my options :
Add the needed functionality to the existing Gentle .
Net code base .
This might not be unreasonable to do , but it ’s just putting off the inevitable .
Re-evaluate current ORM frameworks and select one like I did last year .
Déjà vu all over again …
Microsoft side note : I can also wait for .NET Framework 3.5 to be released and use LINQ to SQL .
My concern with LINQ is support for non-Microsoft databases .
There ’s already some effort to develop LINQ providers ( MySQL , etc. see here ) but how long will it take to get reliable support for something like SQLite3 ( or 4 by then ) if it happens at all ?
Justify the expense and purchase a supported product .
I think my little tale is pretty typical .
Any developer that ’s using open source components is , or will be someday , in the exact same situation as I am .
Doing good software design to mitigate these types of issues is why they pay us the big bucks ! 🙂
UPDATE ( 6/23/08 ) :
Here ’s a good take on selecting an ORM : Objectively evaluating O/R Mappers ( or how to make it easy to dump NHibernate ) .
Finger Trees : A Simple General - purpose Data Structure
Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson , Journal of Functional Programming 16(2) :197–217 , 2006 .
doi:10.1017/S0956796805005769
Summary
We present 2 - 3 finger trees , a functional representation of persistent sequences supporting access to the ends in amortized constant time , and concatenation and splitting in time logarithmic in the size of the smaller piece .
Representations achieving these bounds have appeared previously , but 2 - 3 finger trees are much simpler , as are the operations on them .
Further , by defining the split operation in a general form , we obtain a general purpose data structure that can serve as a sequence , priority queue , search tree , priority search queue and more .
The basic structure is expressed as a non-regular ( or nested ) type :
data FingerTree a = Empty | Single a | Deep ( Digit a ) ( FingerTree ( Node a ) ) ( Digit a ) data Digit a = One a | Two a a | Three a a a | Four a a a a data Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a
( more examples ) and also supports efficient concatenation .
To support splitting and searching , we annotate the internal nodes of the tree with values drawn from an application - specific monoid .
Today , bowing to customer demand , Dell launched a new series of desktops featuring the free , open - source Ubuntu operating system .
To my knowledge , this is the first time Dell has ever offered any non-Microsoft operating system on their desktops .
Until today , it was quite literally impossible to decline the Windows license when you bought a desktop from Dell .
If you bought a desktop PC from Dell , you got -- and paid for -- a copy of Windows , whether you wanted it or not .
This is commonly referred to as " The Microsoft Tax " .
Offering a free desktop operating system is effectively the same thing as selling hardware without any operating system .
Whether you 're a fan of the latest open source operating systems , or just a fan of plain old - fashioned consumer choice , the end of the Microsoft tax is a win for customers .
I was a little worried that Dell would charge extra for the privilege , but it looks like they played fair and square :
Dell Dimension E520 Dell Dimension E520N CPU Core 2 Duo E4300 1.86 GHz Core 2 Duo E4300 1.86 GHz RAM 1 GB DDR2 1 GB DDR2 Hard Drive 250 GB 250 GB Media CD-RW/DVD CD-RW/DVD
Video Integrated Intel GMA X3000 Integrated Intel GMA 950 OS Windows Vista Home Premium Ubuntu Desktop Edition 7.04 $ 679 $ 599
The hardware is essentially identical .
We can infer that Dell 's price for a Windows Vista Home Premium license is $ 80 .
An OEM copy of Home Premium runs about $ 129 , so it 's cheaper to buy the license from Dell than it is to buy one yourself .
But if you have no intention of running Windows , you just saved eighty bucks .
Kudos to Dell for doing the right thing and ending the Microsoft Tax .
It 's also quite possible today will be looked back on as an important turning point in the history of desktop computing .
" " An IT worker draws a diagram of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) on a digital whiteboard .
GodfriedEdelman / Getty Images
The internet and the World Wide Web are wild frontiers that rely on computer languages and codes to find and share data and information .
One of the most fundamental instruments of the internet is the Domain Name System , or DNS .
( Although many people think " DNS " stands for " Domain Name Server , " it really stands for " Domain Name System . " )
DNS is a protocol within the set of standards for how computers exchange data on the internet and on many private networks , known as the TCP / IP protocol suite .
Its purpose is vital , as it helps convert easy - to - understand domain names like " howstuffworks.com " into an Internet Protocol ( IP ) address , such as 70.42.251.42 that computers use to identify each other on the network .
It is , in short , a system of matching names with numbers .
The DNS concept is like a phone book for the internet .
Without this kind of wayfinding system , you 'd have to resort to much more complicated and esoteric means to sift through the virtual open plains and dense cities of data strewn across the global internet ... and you can bet that it would n't be nearly as much fun , especially since there are now hundreds of millions of domain names [ source : VeriSign ] .

Computers and other network devices on the internet use an IP address to route your request to the site you 're trying to reach .
This is similar to dialing a phone number to connect to the person you 're trying to call .
Thanks to DNS , though , you do n't have to keep your own address book of IP addresses .
Instead , you just connect through a domain name server , also called a DNS server or name server , which manages a massive database that maps domain names to IP addresses .
Whether you 're accessing a website or sending e-mail , your computer uses a DNS server to look up the domain name you 're trying to access .
The proper term for this process is DNS name resolution , and you would say that the DNS server resolves the domain name to the IP address .
For example , when you enter " www.howstuffworks.com " in your browser , part of the network connection includes resolving the domain name " howstuffworks.com " into an IP address , for example 70.42.251.42 , for HowStuffWorks ' web servers .
But , you 're probably more likely to remember " howstuffworks.com " when you want to return later .
In addition , a website 's IP address can change over time , and some sites associate multiple IP addresses with a single domain name .
Without DNS servers , the internet would shut down very quickly .
But how does your computer know what DNS server to use ?
Typically , when you connect to your home network , internet service provider ( ISP ) or WiFi network , the modem or router that assigns your computer 's network address also sends some important network configuration information to your computer or mobile device .
That configuration includes one or more DNS servers that the device should use when translating DNS names to IP address .
So far , you 've read about some important DNS basics .
The rest of this article dives deeper into domain name servers and name resolution .
It even includes an introduction to managing your own DNS server .
Let 's start by looking at how IP addresses are structured and how that 's important to the name resolution process .
Greg Wilson is suggesting things Python 3000 could leave out and suggests tuples .
In the comments , Phillip Eby holds him to task for the assumption that tuples are just constant lists :
Tuples are not constant lists -- this is a common misconception .
Lists are intended to be homogeneous sequences , while tuples are hetereogeneous data structures .
I think it was years into my use of Python that I realised this and stopped thinking about them as just constant lists .
It was a powerful revelation for me .
So while I agree with Greg that many ( most ? ) programmers do n't understand the distinction , I think they are missing out and that we'd be better off improving the way lists and tuples are documented than try to conflate what is , in my opinion , a very useful distinction .
One way I 'd express it ( in addition to Phillip 's quote above ) is that the index in a tuple has an implied semantic .
The point of a tuple is that the i-th slot means something specific .
In other words , it 's a index - based ( rather than name based ) datastructure .
This notion of ' tuple ' is very important in relational algebra ( as Phillip also points out ) and so I 've been thinking about it in the context of relational python too .
When I started playing around with relational python ( which I need to get back to blogging about ) , it occurred to me that it might be useful to have the notion of a tuple whose slots could additionally be named and then accessed via name .
I implemented it that way in Basic Class for Relations .
UPDATE ( 2011 - 11 - 22 ) : of course , the idea mentioned in that last paragraph is now a reality in the form of Python 's namedtuple .

Holiday homes increasingly dominate Spain 's coast
Inside he found the mummified body of the previous owner .
Jordi Giro bought the flat in the Costa Brava resort of Rosas at an auction after the previous owner defaulted on her payments .
He told police that he was shocked on going into the flat for the first time to discover her body sitting on the sofa .
It seems that Maria Luisa Zamora failed to keep up payments on her mortgage because she had in fact died in 2001 .
Forgotten
Police believe the body has been preserved by the salty sea air .
Coroners said Mrs Zamora died of natural causes .
But questions are being asked about why no - one has been concerned as to her whereabouts for the last six years .
Police say neither her estranged husband nor her children in Madrid registered a missing persons report for the 55 - year - old .
Neighbours say Mrs Zamora had bought the flat as a holiday home and told AFP news agency that when the garden grew over they assumed she had simply stayed away .
When societal resistance to the science behind evolution comes up for discussion , it 's often an occasion for European readers to ask ( with varying degrees of politeness ) whether the US has lost its collective marbles .
Any sense of superiority they derive from viewing the rejection of science as an American phenomenon , however , should have evaporated in recent years as creationist efforts have popped up throughout Europe , including within several governments .
The situation has now reached the point where European governments have felt compelled to address the issue .
Ars has covered the recent attempts to promote Intelligent Design creationism in UK schools , but the draft version of a resolution being considered by the Council of Europe provides a far more extensive list of creationist agitation in Europe .
Some of these efforts have been made by private groups , including a Turkish Muslim organization that translated one of their anti-evolution tracts into French and then distributed it to schools in Belgium , France , Spain , and Switzerland .
But other anti-science efforts have come from within European governments themselves .
Although actions by the Polish deputy minister of education have attracted the most attention , other government officials have attempted to enact anti-evolution policies .
These include the Dutch minister of education , who suggested that classrooms host a formal debate between evolution and creationism , and the equivalent ministers in Italy and Serbia , who simply attempted to abolish the teaching of evolution .
These efforts to dilute science education have now prompted a backlash .
In the UK , a group calling itself Science , Just Science took advantage of the government 's new " E - Petition " initiative to submit one that requests the government " prevent the use of creationist and other pseudo - scientific propaganda in government - funded schools . "
The Prime Minister 's office has responded to the petition , saying , " The Government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science National Curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science . "
The response indicates that the office will be publishing detailed guidance in the future but in the meantime says that teachers faced with questions regarding creationism should answer them within a scientific framework .
In the rest of Europe , the topic has been taken up by the Council of Europe .
This organization has a broader membership than the European Union , and its resolutions are non-binding .
But it has had significant influences on policy ; its European Convention on Human Rights has served as the foundation for the European Court of Human Rights , which produces binding decisions .
The Council 's Committee on Culture , Science and Education has taken up the question of creationism and science education , and produced a draft resolution entitled " The Dangers of Creationism in Education " for the full council 's consideration .
As implied by the title , the resolution does not use diplomatic phrasing , declaring that " creationism in any of its forms , such as ' intelligent design , ' is not based on facts , does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes . "
It notes that there are some clear differences between science and non-science and hammers traditional creationism for promoting an " ' all things are equal ' attitude , which may seem appealing and tolerant but is actually disastrous . "
The draft also emphasizes that more recent formulations of creationism , such as ID , are equally lacking , scientifically : " The intelligent design theory annihilates any research process .
It identifies difficulties and immediately jumps to the conclusion that the only way to resolve them is to resort to an intelligent cause without looking for other explanations . "
The draft resolution was sent to the full council in a nearly - unanimous vote .
Unfortunately , the council voted to send it back to committee .
Reading the floor debate , it appears that the resolution 's return was prompted by a Belgian representative , who called the resolution " unbalanced . "
Attempts to get him to clarify his problems with the resolution were blocked when the vote on returning it to the committee passed without debate .
It 's unclear whether the resolution will ever re-emerge .
The strong responses by European government agencies demonstrate that , when it comes to issues with evolution , there are some key differences between the climate there and in the US .
Still , the fact that creationism has become such an issue in Europe reveals how resistance to evolution is now an international phenomenon .
Groups that are uncomfortable with science can be found in nearly any country , but the advent of modern communications technology have given them a huge boost by providing those in Europe with access to rich sources of material and tactical expertise in the US and the Islamic world .
These trends may keep the creationist movement active in Europe no matter what the local and regional governments do .
COLD FUSION
An Objective Assessment

( 12/16/01 )
ABSTRACT
Many people still believe that cold fusion is the result of bad science .
In contrast , numerous laboratories in at least 10 countries have now claimed production of anomalous energy using a variety of methods , many of which are now reproducible .
This energy is proposed to result from nuclear reactions initiated within a special periodic array of atoms at modest temperatures ( energy ) .
Evidence for nuclear reactions involving fusion of deuterium , transmutation involving both light and heavy hydrogen , and nuclear interaction between heavy nuclei has been published .
The claims , if true , reveal a new method to release nuclear energy without harmful radiation and without the radioactivity associated with conventional methods .
This paper examines published evidence describing this new phenomenon in order to test its reality and to extend an understanding of the process .
1. INTRODUCTION
In 1989 , Pons and Fleischmann [ 1 ] ( P - F ) caused a media storm by claiming to cause fusion to take place in an ordinary electrolytic cell containing D 2 O .
This process was first named " Cold Fusion " by Steven Jones - an especially poor description .
The names " Chemically Assisted Nuclear Reactions " ( CANR ) and " Low Energy Nuclear Reactions " ( LENR ) more correctly describe the phenomenon .
Over 21 papers by P - F describe their work in more detail , a few of the more important ones are noted here . [ 2 - 5 ]
Their claim was soon rejected because it could not be easily replicated and it could not be explained using information available at the time .
From six months after the announcement until now , the subject has been ignored by the scientific community and is considered by many to be pathological science .
In spite of this general rejection , work continues , initially in ten countries and now in six countries , with official government support in most cases .
These studies have provided a large number of observations and have answered most of the questions posed by skeptics .
Even though the results defy conventional explanation , it is time for this information to be known by the general scientific community , regardless of its interpretation .
If true , the observations reveal a completely new method to initiate nuclear reactions within an atomic structure .
On the other hand , if these claims are false , as many people believe , a large number of highly trained scientists , using well understood equipment , can not be trusted to obtain accurate data , thereby calling into question conclusions reached in other fields based on the same techniques .
The phenomenon is claimed to produce fusion as well as a complex mixture of transmutation reactions .
Twelve different methods , listed in Table 1 , have been reported to produce anomalous energy ( AE ) and / or nuclear products ( NP ) , some with good reproducibility and some with difficulty .
Most of these methods produce many of the same effects using both hydrogen and deuterium .
Consequently , light water can not be used as a null ( blank ) test of the method as some people have suggested .
Naturally , theoreticians have been busy trying to structure these observations into a model .
Over 500 models have been suggested with perhaps a dozen giving useful insight .
A few of these ideas will be discussed later in the paper .
Regardless of the explanation du jour , more energy appears to be produced than is being applied , thereby violating basic thermodynamic expectations .
The important question is , " Why " ?
TABLE 1
METHODS CLAIMED TO PRODUCE CANR 1 .
Electrolysis of D 2 O ( H 2 O ) - based electrolyte using a Pd , Pt , Ti , or Ni cathode ; ( This is the original P - F method , which has been duplicated hundreds of times to produce claimed AE and NP in every country where the method has been studied . )
2 . Electrolysis of KCl - LiCl - LiD ( fused salt ) electrolyte using a Pd anode ; ( This method has been difficult to duplicate . )
3 . Electrolysis of various solid compounds in D 2 ( Proton conduction ) ; ( This method has been duplicated in the US , Japan and France to produce AE . )
4 . Gas discharge ( low energy ions ) using Pd electrodes in D 2 ( H 2 ) ; ( Variations on this method have reported AE and NP in the US , Russia and Japan . )
5 . Ion bombardment ( high energy ions ) of various metals by D+ ; ( Variations on this method have reported NP in Russia and Japan .
Duplication in the US failed . )
6 . Gas reaction ( H 2 ) with Ni under special conditions ; ( Replicated independently several times in Italy to produce NP and AE . )
7 . Cavitation reaction involving D 2 O and various metals using an acoustic field .
( This method has been replicated in the US to produce NP and AE . )
8 . Cavitation reaction in H 2 O using microbubble formation ; ( Several attempts to duplicate variations on the method have succeeded in Russia , but failed in the US . )
9 . Reaction of finely divided palladium with pressurized deuterium gas ; ( Variations on this method have produced NP and AE in the US and Japan . ) 10 .

Biological Systems based on living cultures ; ( NP has been reported in Japan , Russia and France . )
The literature of the field now contains over 3000 publications on the subject with about 1000 being important to an understanding , only a fraction of which are discussed here .
Unfortunately , much of this information is not available in " normal " scientific journals to which a reader has easy access .
When possible , easily available , peer reviewed journals will be cited even though this will result in much useful information being ignored .
A few of the references in this paper are to conference proceedings because the data are available only from this source .
Listings of available references and the hard - to - find publications are available to serious students and can be obtained from several sources . [ 6 - 9 ]
This paper has three major objectives : to give a general overview of the field so that interested scientists can understand the individual observations , to answer some of the major challenges raised by skeptics , and to suggest several new ideas for future study .
The method used by Pons and Fleischmann will be the primary focus of the discussion because this is the most thoroughly studied method .
A few other methods are introduced briefly to show that the effect can be produced in several different ways to give similar patterns of behavior .
Hopefully , this effort will reawaken interest in this fascinating subject .
2. DISCUSSION
Several basic questions must be answered before the claims can be believed .
1 . Have the claims been replicated ?
2 . Can prosaic errors or processes explain the effect ?
3 . Are reproducible patterns of behavior observed ?
4 . Can the effect be produced using various methods ?
5 . Why has the effect been so hard to replicate ?
6 . Does the anomalous energy have a nuclear source ?
7 . Can these claims be explained ?
These questions were asked in 1989 and only now , 12 years later , can suitable answers be provided .
While the answers given here may not satisfy everyone , hopefully they will lessen doubt about the phenomenon being real and encourage more people to study the effect .
QUESTION # 1 . HAS ANOMALOUS ENERGY BEEN REPLICATED ?
As noted in Table 1 , many of the methods have been successfully replicated .
Because the P- F method has been given the greatest attention , this method will be used to answer Question # 1 .
A few other methods will be examined briefly as an answer to Question # 4 .
Please note that some of these methods use little or no applied power to produce the AE .
First , the nature of the so - called anomalous energy produced by the P-F method needs to be understood .
Claimed anomalous energy ( AE ) is detected as heat and measured using a calorimeter .
Anomalous power ( AP ) is defined as the difference between the amount of heat ( watts ) being removed from the calorimeter , based on a previous calibration , and the amount being applied as electrical power , which is calculated as voltage across the cell times current through the cell .
Anomalous energy is the product of anomalous power and time .
Table 2 shows a listing of AP using the P-F method .
These results were obtained by different laboratories , at different times , using different calorimeters .
Notice that for these examples , the amount of AP is always well above the claimed uncertainty .
In addition , many of these studies report finding numerous active samples even though only the most active one is listed in the table .
Many other studies either failed to detect AP or the results were marginal .
The wide range of values might indicate systematic error , but it also is consistent with a variable amount of active material being involved in the process .
Do these facts have any meaning other than that everyone is making the same mistake ?
An answer must come from an understanding of how the studies were done , as discussed in Questions # 2 and # 3 .

( a)
A flow - type calorimeter uses flowing water through a jacket that surrounds the cell , or through a coil inside the cell .
The flow rate and the temperature change of the water stream are measured .
Although this is an absolute method , it must be calibrated because the water can not capture all of the heat .
The isoperibolic calorimeter determines power production by measuring the temperature drop across the cell wall .
The device must be calibrated and is accurate only when the measured temperature represents the average temperature differential .
temperature differential .
The double - wall ( DW ) isoperibolic calorimeter uses an additional thermal barrier outside of the cell across which the temperature drop is measured .
The device must be calibrated , but is independent of any temperature variation within the cell .
The Seebeck calorimeter determines power production by measuring a voltage generated by the temperature difference between the inside and outside of its walls .
In this device , all walls are sensitive to this temperature difference , hence any energy that escapes the enclosure will generate a voltage proportional to the amount of power being lost .
The device must be calibrated and is independent of the cell temperature .
However , the sensitivity of all the walls must be the same to achieve accurate results .
Double cell comparison uses two nearly identical cells , one of which is active and the other is assumed to make no AP .
Heat production is based on the temperature difference between the two cells and accuracy depends on the two cells remaining identical in their properties .
An open cell allows the generated gases to escape .
A closed cell causes the gases to be converted back to water .
( b) Although only one value is given , frequently several different samples of palladium were reported to produce anomalous power ( AP ) .
The amount of anomalous energy ( AE ) is highly variable , depending on how long the active sample was studied .
( c) Calibration could have been unstable .
(d) Calibrated with internal heater and checked with Pt cathode and / or H2O based electrolyte
(e) Calibrated only with internal heater
( f) Mechanical stirring used
(g) Calibrated using only an inert cathode .
QUESTION #2 : CAN PROSAIC ERROR OR PROCESSES EXPLAIN THE EFFECT ?
An answer requires all possible errors be identified , something that is not always possible to do .
The major errors will be evaluated first .
All calorimeters need to be calibrated and various methods are used to do this .
A Joule ( resistive ) heater can be placed within the cell and a known amount of electrical energy applied .
A better method is to apply electrolytic power while using an inert cathode .
This method is sometimes possible while using a palladium cathode because bulk palladium frequently takes many days before AE is detected .
This delay provides an opportunity to calibrate the calorimeter by applying various amounts of electrolytic power to the cell before AP starts .
The calibration method used is very important when evaluating potential errors .
Several of the listed studies used more than one method .
Each calorimeter design has its own set of potential errors .
These errors can be evaluated in several different ways provided sufficient information is given in the publication , a condition that is seldom met .
One method uses statistics by assuming all errors are random .
However , most error is not random , but instead results from overlooked deficiencies within the apparatus producing a bias or off - set .
The difference being that random error produces an error band in which any change in energy is hidden , while an off - set results in apparent energy that may be anomalous or may be caused by error in the measurement resulting from a prosaic process .
A few such problems associated with the electrolytic method have been identified [ 10 - 16 ] .
Especially important are uncertain recombination [ 17 ] of D 2 and O 2 gases being generated within the cell , unrecognized temperature gradients [ 18 , 19 ] , and a variable thermal conductivity of the cell wall [ 20 ] , each of which is described below in more detail .
Many errors are completely avoided by using a flow - type , Seebeck - type , or the double - wall isoperibolic - type calorimeter containing a recombination catalyst .
These improved techniques do not suffer from errors attributed to early studies .
Rather than causing the anomalous effects to disappear , these improved methods are found to produce the same behavior as obtained using less sophisticated calorimetry , as can be seen in Table 2 .
Consequently , the effects have not gone away when better equipment is used , a condition that must be met before the popular concept of pathological science can be applied . [ 21 ]
Because P- F started the field , their work has been subjected to especially sharp analysis [ 11 , 14 , 22-31 ] .
Their study is no longer the only source of support for their claims because the effect has been duplicated many times using much better equipment , as described in a later section .
Nevertheless , the most recent evaluation concludes that their claims for AE are justified [ 32 ] based solely on their work .
The following prosaic explanations for the claimed AE have been suggested .
Release of hydrogen gas [ 33 ]
Deuterium gas , as it is released by the palladium , is proposed to carry away heat , thereby cooling the cathode and depositing this energy in the electrolyte where it might be mistaken for excess energy .
In addition , energy is then proposed to leak into the cell through the cooled cathode lead from the warmer outside .
Because all electrolytic cells are thermodynamically closed systems , energy used to compress the hydrogen ( deuterium ) within the cathode will exactly equal energy produced by its release .
No net energy will be generated under this condition .
In any case , an inert cathode would exhibit the same effect during calibration , thereby canceling the effect , should it be real .
Production of hydrogen gas [ 34 ]
Release of atomic deuterium from the Pd lattice is proposed to produce bursts of heat as it combines to form D 2 gas and as it reacts with any surface oxide .
This explanation is not possible because under steady - state conditions deuterium enters the palladium as fast as it leaves .
At most , this effect could only explain small bursts of energy , not steady production normally reported .
Also , no surface oxide remains on a Pd surface once electrolysis starts .
Recombination [ 17 , 35 ]
The importance of recombination was recognized by everyone in the field since 1989 .
Although recombining catalysts were not used at first , care was taken to measure the amount of D 2 O leaving the cell as D 2 and O 2 gas .
Most studies , including P - F , found this effect to be less than 1 percent .
In addition , subsequent studies have shown that recombination is only a problem when a very low applied current ( below 100 mA ) is used .[ 32 , 36-38 ]
In any case , most studies reporting AE now use an internal catalyst to convert all D 2 and O 2 back to D 2 O , thereby completely eliminating this source of potential error .
Release of stored stress [ 39 - 42 ]
Most samples of Pd have been annealed before their use , hence contain very little stress .
Stress is introduced into palladium when it reacts with hydrogen ( deuterium ) .
While this stress might be released suddenly by crack formation , thereby producing a burst of energy , such release can not account for the observed large , continuous production of AE under steady - state conditions .
Some studies have reported an amount of AE greater than an equivalent weight of TNT , an energy well outside of any possible energy storage mechanism .
Current fluctuations [ 43 ]
Bubble action is proposed to cause high frequency fluctuations in both current and voltage .
Because DC measurements are made , these AC components could be missed by the data acquisition system .
As a result , the amount of power applied to the cell would be too small compared to the amount being measured by the calorimeter , hence excess power would be proposed .
Such spikes on the applied DC voltage have been measured using a high frequency scope while AP was being produced and found to be less than 50 mV . [ 44 ]
In addition , the same missing power would occur when the cell is calibrated using a dead cathode or the Pd cathode before AP is generated .
As a result , the effect would cancel out .
Also , people who have calibrated using both an internal heater , which does not produce this AC component , and a dead cathode report excellent agreement between the resulting calibration constants , thereby suggesting this error is not present , as Holst - Hansen and Britz concluded [ 43 ] .
Peltier Effect [ 45 ]
A difference in Peltier coefficients between the metals used as cathode and anode is proposed to cause pumping of energy into the cell by applied current .
Two problems exist in this model .
The proposed mathematical formula leads to an unrealistic conclusion , i.e. that an infinite amount of heat can be introduced into the cell when the temperature difference between interior and exterior approaches zero .
The other problem is that the effect , if real , only becomes important when unrealistic differences in Peltier coefficients are proposed .
In any case , use of electrolytic calibration would subtract such heat from the final result , thereby canceling any effect .
Chemical reactions [ 46 ]
Excess heat is proposed to result from the formation of chemical compounds within the electrolyte caused by the electrolytic current .
The chemicals used in a typical electrolytic cell are all stable and do not interact chemically unless a current is applied .
This current can initiate various chemical reactions including reaction of D 2 with the cathode to form PdD , reaction of O 2 with the Pt anode to form PtO , reaction of Li with the cathode to form an alloy , and the rare formation of D 2 O 2 .
These reactions are very slow , involve very little energy , and are endothermic .
Such a chemical product would have to be more stable than the most stable compound known to exist in order to account for the observed energy .
No chemical product even close to this requirement has ever been found within an active cell .
Temperature gradients [ 14 ]
Temperature gradients are proposed to exist within the electrolyte , which causes the recorded temperature to be unstable .
As a result , EP based on this temperature would be unstable and potentially wrong .
Any cell design that uses the interior temperature to determine the loss -rate of heat is susceptible to this problem .
Normally , bubble action reduces this gradient to insignificant values during electrolysis . [ 20 , 47 , 48 ]
However , calibration using an internal heater can lead to unexpected error because no bubble action would be present to reduce the temperature gradient .
Therefore , all studies using only this method of calibration are suspect unless electrolytic current is applied during heater calibration , as was done in some studies including those of P-F .
Variable thermal conductivity of the wall [ 20 ]
A stagnant layer of fluid exists next to the cell wall and this layer affects the apparent thermal conductivity of the wall .
Because a single - wall isoperibolic calorimeter is sensitive to the thermal conductivity of the wall , changes in this stagnant layer , caused by mechanical stirring or convection currents produced by bubble action , change the calibration constant .
Fortunately , the calorimeter used by P - F lost most of its energy by radiation through the wall and by conduction through the lid .
Therefore , their values were not affected by this problem .
Some other studies have not been so fortunate .
Jahn - Teller effect [ 49 ]
Energy is proposed to be generated by D atoms dissolving in PdD , combining to form D 2 molecules within a new structure , and then leaving as D 2 gas .
To quote the author , " excess heat of cold fusion appears to be nothing more than the storage and release of the latent vaporization heat of heavy water " .
This process ignores the fact that the same amount of energy would be used to place D within PdD as would be released when the D 2 leaves .
In a closed system , under steady state conditions , energy can not be generated unless a permanent change takes place in either the chemical or physical structure .
For this explanation to apply , D 2 O in the electrolyte would have to change its properties by losing energy .
After sufficient time , this energy would be exhausted and the remaining D 2 O would have much different properties compared to fresh D 2 O .
No evidence for this change has ever been seen .
If this energy were stored during initial loading of the palladium cathode , the process would be seen as an endothermic reaction having a value equal to the amount of energy released later .
No such storage and release process has been seen in any study .
Errors in Calibration Constants [ 50 ]
The calibration constant of a flow calorimeter , or any type of calorimeter for that matter , is proposed to fluctuate such that periodic EP can be observed when a fixed value for the calibration constant is used .
This variation can take two forms .
If a calorimeter is stable , the constant will show random fluctuations around a mean , generated by minor variations in the measurement of temperature and applied power .
When a calorimeter is unstable , the constant will show a steady drift with time .
The assertion made here is that the actual sensitivity of a calorimeter will fluctuate even though the calorimeter appears to be stable , thereby generating periodic bursts of apparent EP .
This assertion has been applied to only one unique study [ 51 ] in which EP was found to result when the applied current was increased in steps over a range and then decreased in the same manner .
Presumably , changes in the calibration constant occurred at the exact moment when each of the seven such current scans was started and this change always resulted in similar behavior , i.e. a rising and then a falling EP .
While such coincidence can not be totally ruled out , the proposed error can not be applied to the many studies that report EP lasting for hours and days , with periodic calibrations being made during this time .
Although the processes described above apply only to the P- F method , no prosaic process has provided a satisfactory explanation for all positive results using the other methods ( Table 1 ) , especially when AE and NP are produced in the absence of applied power .
This does not mean such an explanation is not possible .
It only means that the probability of finding a prosaic explanation has been significantly reduced .
To make the challenge still more difficult , AE has now been detected under a wide range of conditions using many different calorimeters , all of which gave the same basic behavior .
This effectively rules out a single prosaic process .
We are now left with a situation such that several errors must occur , each giving the same apparent basic behavior regardless of the apparatus or method being used .
This is a very weak basis for believing error is the only cause of the observations .
QUESTION 3 : ARE REPRODUCIBLE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR OBSERVED ?
Presence of reproducible patterns within the data sets are as important as achieving reproducibility of the phenomenon its self .
Such patterns are based on AE being produced only under certain unique conditions by all studies .
For example , a pattern can be claimed if AE is only detected when the D / Pd ratio is above a critical value , or if nuclear products are always found after AE production , regardless of the method used .
Production of nuclear products will be discussed in Question # 6 .
Lack of space prevents each method listed in Table 1 from being described in detail .
Instead , only a few especially compelling investigations will be examined .
First , the P- F method will be described below , followed by a few other methods as answers to Question # 4 .
The work at SRI , lead by Dr. McKubre , studied the phenomena , first with $ 6 M provided by EPRI ( Electric Power Research Institute ) .
After this program was terminated , work was continued by IMRA ( Japan ) at nearly the same level .
A very small effort is now being funded by the US government .
Over the course of this work , several designs of flow - type calorimeters were used that share the following characteristics :
1 . The cells are sealed and contain a recombiner .
As a result , no gas leaves the cell .
Therefore , uncertainty in the amount of recombination is not an issue .
Successful action by the recombiner is monitored using different methods including change in gas pressure .
2 . The cells contain a heater , which maintains a constant inner temperature .
Power to this heater can be adjusted to compensate for any change in temperature caused by electrolysis or by anomalous processes .
This heater is also used to determine whether the power measurement , based on the flow rate and temperature change of a cooling fluid , is accurate .
Sensitivity better than ±0.01 W ( ±0.1 % ) is claimed .
3 . The electrolytic cell , its surrounding heater , and the cooling - fluid channels are all contained within a silvered , evacuated Dewar in order to isolate them from the environment .
4 . The whole assembly is immersed in a fluid bath , which maintains a constant environment of 30±0.003°C .
This bath is also the source of cooling fluid .
Consequently , most studies are done at a temperature above 30°C .
5 . A constant flow pump is used to circulate cooling fluid .
Flow rate is checked periodically by weighing the fluid passing through the calorimeter .
Better than 98 % of power produced within the cell is captured in this fluid .
6 . All aspects of the measurement are under computer control , which provides continuous monitoring , and redundant RTD sensors are used for temperature measurement .
7 . The deuterium content of the palladium cathode is determined by measuring its change in resistance .

FIGURE 2 . Relationship between anomalous ( excess ) power and current applied to a Pons - Fleischmann cell containing a Pd cathode and a D 2 O+LiOD electrolyte .
The study was done at SRI .
Nineteen samples of palladium were found to make AP with consistent results .
One consistent behavior is shown in Figure 1 as the relationship between AP and average composition of the cathode .
Figure 2 shows another pattern as the effect of applied current on AP .
These two behaviors are found to be produced by all samples of palladium used in this work and by all samples reported in the literature when the necessary measurements were made .
Variations in reported values are easily explained by the different shapes and sizes of the cathodes used , and by the amount of active material present on their surfaces .
In addition , the following behaviors are also seen by everyone who has made suitable measurements .
1 . The average D / Pd ratio must exceed a critical value .
This value differs somewhat between studies because only the average composition can be determined and the value depends on the method used and the shape of the cathode .
Typically , the value lies between D / Pd=0.85 and 0.90 .
Infrequently , compositions above this range are found to be dead for unknown reasons .
2 . The current must be maintained for a critical time .
This time is variable and presumably depends on how rapidly the surface can acquire the active structure .
The time is zero for thin layers of Pd while it can be as long as months for bulk palladium .
Failure to wait the necessary time is one reason some people have not seen the effect .
3 . The current density must be above a critical value .
Applied current determines the surface composition , hence the nature of the active structure .
A value above 150 mA / cm2 is usually found for bulk palladium .
No critical value appears to be necessary for thin layers of palladium .
4 . Inert palladium can sometimes be activated by addition of certain impurities to the electrolyte .
These impurities are found to help the surface achieve a higher deuterium content .
5 . The effect occurs in only a small fraction of samples , but more often in certain batches than in other ones .
In fact , all physical properties of palladium are found to be batch specific , making this metal highly variable in its general behavior , even in conventional applications .
These patterns of behavior add evidence that the observations are a real behavior of nature and not caused by error .
QUESTION #4 : CAN THE EFFECT BE PRODUCED USING VARIOUS METHODS ?
Eight other techniques have also produce AE besides electrolysis , two of which are described below .
Of course , some attempts to replicate these methods have failed .
Even successful studies have many failures before success is achieved .
As argued below with respect to the P- F method , failure only gives an insight when the reasons are known , not when the reasons are based on speculation .
Many of the reasons for failure using the P-F method are now known and will be discussed in Question # 5 .
Deuterium gas applied to finely divided palladium :
Prof. Arata { Note : Prof. Arata is the only physicist to be awarded the Emperor 's Prize in Japan for his contribution to the Japanese hot fusion program.} and Dr. Zhang ( Japan ) [ 52 - 55 ] developed a way to load finely divided palladium powder ( palladium - black ) with very pure deuterium and measured the resulting AE and NP .
The apparatus consists of a sealed palladium tube containing powdered palladium .
This is used as the cathode in an electrolytic cell containing D 2 O. Deuterium is generated at the cathode surface , diffuses through the palladium wall , and accumulates inside where it reacts with the palladium - black .
Consequently , electrolytic action is only used to generate very pure D 2 gas , in contrast to the P-F method .
These scientists find that after the D 2 pressure had increased to several atmospheres , AP is generated .
Anomalous energy production can be maintained for months and it is accompanied by helium and tritium generation .
This work has been replicated at SRI [ 56 ] using a flow - type calorimeter different from the one used by Arata and Zhang .
The relationship between the AP and applied power is shown in Fig. 3 , where the AE produced using H 2 O and D 2 O is compared .
Clarke et al. [ 57 ] failed to find He - 4 in a sample of the Pd - black used in the SRI study , but did detect He - 3 that resulted from the decay of tritium [ 58 ] .
Based on the decay rate , this tritium apparently was produced during the SRI study .
FIGURE 3 . Relationship between applied power and anomalous power produced by an Arata - type cell containing palladium - black using an electrolyte containing D 2 O or H 2 O .
This study was done at SRI with the help of Prof. Arata .
Dr. Case [ 59 , 60 ] explored a variation of this method by using a commercial catalyst consisting of finely divided palladium deposited on charcoal .
This material has the advantage that the isolated Pd particles will not lose their small size by sintering together when the material is heated , unlike particles in palladium - black which are in contact .
When this material is heated to about 250° C with a temperature gradient and about 3 atm of D 2 is applied , AP is produced along with helium .
This work has been replicated at least 5 times at SRI . [ 56 ]
The relationship between AP , based on two independent methods , and helium measured in the gas is shown in Fig .
4 . Helium concentration in the gas eventually exceeds 5.2 ppm , the measured concentration in the laboratory air .
Consequently , this helium can not result from leaks in the system .
Also , the initial catalyst was tested for absorbed helium and found to be essentially free of this element .
The implied energy for the helium producing reaction shown in the figure is an upper limit because some helium is retained by the catalyst .
When this helium is measured and taken into account , the value is consistent with the expected value of 23.8 MeV / helium .
FIGURE 4 . Relationship between the amount of anomalous energy and the amount of helium produced in a cell containing Pd on charcoal surrounded by D 2 gas .
This study was done at SRI with the help of Drs. Case and George .
These two methods show the same patterns of behavior , i.e. finely divided Pd produces AE and NP when exposed to D 2 , but not when exposed to H 2 .
As noted below , finely divided Pd also is found to make AE when it is applied to an inert cathode surface in a P - F cell . [ 61 ]
It is important to realize that success using these two gas - loading methods depends critically on being able to remove impurities from the surface of the small palladium particles , not an easy task .
Also , the presence of light hydrogen is expected to be a poison for the nuclear reaction , similar to its behavior in a P - F cell .
Proton conductor :
A number of semiconductors can dissolve a little hydrogen ( deuterium ) and become conducting by electromigration of hydrogen ions when the material is heated and a voltage is applied .
Because current is very small , the amount of applied power is much less than used for a P - F cell .
Use of deuterium is reported to result in AE and occasional transmutation .
Ordinary hydrogen shows no effect .
Mizuno et al . [ 62 , 63 ] made discs using a mixture of strontium , cerium , yttrium and niobium oxides , with platinum applied to opposite sides as electrical contacts .
Upon heating to 400 - 700 °C and introducing D 2 at 0.1 - 50 Torr , five out of fifty discs were found to make AE .
Gamma emission was observed and attributed to 197Pt formed from 196Pt by neutron absorption . [ 64 ]
Direct detection of neutron emission has not been consistent . [ 65 ]
Production of neutrons and subsequent activation of Pt might be caused by occasional cracking with the resulting fractofusion .
Consequently , the emitted neutrons may have nothing to do with an anomalous nuclear reaction .
With Mizuno 's help , Oriani [ 66 ] was able to duplicate production of AE .
A similar complex oxide was studied by Samgin et al . [ 67 ] and it also was found to produce AE .
Biberian et al . [ 68 ] applied the same method to LaAlO 3 and reported detecting AE .
Single crystals were not active .
QUESTION # 5 . WHY IS THE EFFECT SO DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE ?
Failure to replicate these claims is frequently attributed to errors in the successful work that are not present during the unsuccessful studies .
Thus , the failed studies are considered to be well done and correct , while successful studies are thought to be deficient in some way .
Ironically , while some famous failed studies were considered well done at the time , later analysis revealed actual production of anomalous energy . [ 69 - 73 ]
A better explanation attributes failure to various properties of the materials being used , which have nothing to do with error although some error is certainly present .
This explanation shifts attention away from possible sources of error and instead emphasizes how the cathode material was treated .
As will be shown below , this approach has considerable experimental support , especially for the P-F method .

Some of the methods listed in Table 1 are easily to reproduce and some are not .
In most cases , the reasons are not yet known .
Unfortunately , the method chosen by P- F has been especially difficult to reproduce because certain properties of palladium can not be duplicated from sample to sample .
For example , most of the time , this metal forms cracks when it reacts with hydrogen or deuterium [ 44 , 74 , 75 ] , a process that opens paths through which dissolved deuterium can escape as D 2 gas .
As a result , the cathode can not achieve the required high deuterium content .
Everyone who has studied the effect using bulk palladium has discovered certain batches to be more likely to work .
Successful material has been shown not to form such cracks .
One example of this experience is shown in Table 3 . [ 76 ]
Another example is provided by the experience of Storms [ 44 ] , Kobayashi et al . [ 77 ] , and Miyamaru and Takahashi [ 78 ] .
Each of these workers used palladium from the same batch prepared by Tanaka metals ( Japan ) and each found AE .
This palladium was especially free of cracks .
A subsequent batch containing many cracks was found to be dead by the same people .
Thus , when the same batches were studied using different equipment by three independent laboratories , the same behavior was observed .
FIGURE 5 . Effect of placing an active cathode in an electrolyte containing H 2 O .
The same calorimeter was used for both measurements .
This work was done at the author 's laboratory in Santa Fe , NM .
Minor impurities such as light water [ 79 , 80 ] , as shown in Fig. 5 , kill the effect .
This observation is important for three reasons .
First , it is hard to imagine how so little H 2 O in the D 2 O can remove those errors thought by critics to have produced an apparent excess energy before H 2 O was added .
Second , this effect means that p-d fusion does not contribute to energy production .
Third , this is one more reason why the effect has not been easy to duplicate .
Heavy water quickly absorbs light water from the atmosphere unless the cell is sealed , a rare precaution during early studies .
Dissolved impurity metals in the electrolyte can also quickly kill the effect .
In fact , commercial D 2 O has been found to contain up to 9 ppm of impurity , material that must be removed by distillation or by pre-electrolyzing with a dummy cathode [ 44 ] .
These observations suggest that the factors preventing duplication of the P- F effect are associated with the properties of bulk palladium and impurities within the electrolyte .
On the other hand , once a piece of palladium has made AE , most people find this particular piece of metal to be active every time it is studied , unless the surface layer is altered [ 81 ] or unless cracks begin to form , something repeated reloading will encourage [ 82 ] .
For example , Miles [ 83 ] took a piece of palladium found to be active in his laboratory at China Lake in the US to the NHE laboratory in Japan , where it again was found to be active .
Other people frequently find this kind of reproducibility within their own laboratories .
Thin layers of palladium deposited on an inert substrate make AE more easily than does bulk palladium . [ 61 , 84 , 85 ] .
Therefore , a person wishing to replicate the claims of P - F should use this approach .
Other electrode materials are less susceptible to their bulk properties , although surface conditions are still important .
[ 51 , 61 , 86-90 ] .
If anomalous energy is accepted as being real , the next question is :
QUESTION #6 : DOES AE HAVE A NUCLEAR SOURCE ?
Three types of answers are offered .
First , the amount of energy is too great to be explained by any other process .
This argument is weak because the amount of energy depends on how long the sample appears to make AP .
If an offset error is present , a large amount of apparent AE can be created simply by being patient .
Second , no chemical products have been found to accumulate in cells making AE .
This argument is stronger than the first one , but still relies on not finding something that available techniques might miss .
Third , nuclear products are seen to accumulate within the cell in amounts consistent with the amount of AE being measured .
This is the strongest argument , but the most difficult to demonstrate because very small quantities of material are involved , some of which might well come from conventional sources .
Possible products of a fusion reaction are neutrons , tritium , charged particles , gamma emission and 4He .
All of these nuclear products have been looked for and found .
Because the first two products result from " normal " fusion , they were frequently sought in early studies .
Recent studies have looked for elements resulting from transmutation reactions , a process that has the potential to produce a wide spectrum of nuclei .
Neutrons :
Because neutron emission is easy to detect , at least 500 attempts were made to find this product .
All of this effort has revealed that neutrons are not emitted from CANR cells in amounts consistent with the AE .
When neutrons are found , they are emitted when AE is produced and when it is not .
In either case , the measured energy is 2.54 MeV and up .
The behavior would suggest that fractofusion [ 91 - 94 ] is occurring within the deuterium containing metal .
This process occurs when a crack forms and generates a large voltage gradient .
This voltage can accelerate D+ ions and produce normal , high - energy fusion .
Because cracks form easily in palladium [ 75 , 95 ] , it is impossible to know whether the few detected neutrons are emitted only from the anomalous cold fusion reaction or result from localized " normal " fusion .
In addition , other reactions having nothing to do with fusion might also be the source under special conditions .
In any case , neutron emission , when it occurs at all , is from a minor reaction path .
Mizuno et al. [ 96 ] have proposed that a mixture of light and heavy hydrogen enhances neutron emission during the electrolytic process .
They observe most neutron bursts to occur after considerable electrolysis has taken place , when H 2 O has had a chance to enter the D 2 O electrolyte .
To test this idea , they loaded a Pd electrode in D 2 O and then transferred the cathode to a cell containing H 2 O. Neutron bursts frequently occurred shortly after electrolysis was started and when the cell voltage was increased , thereby providing more H 2 to the cathode .
The improved reproducibility and magnitude of neutron emission might explain why neutron emission is seen so infrequently when efforts are made to keep the electrolyte free of H 2 O .
However , this behavior is not inconsistent with fractofusion because loading with hydrogen , especially at high - applied voltage , will stress the material more than when deuterium alone is used , hence will produce more cracking .
However , if neutrons at 2.54 MeV are found to be absent , another process would be indicated .
Tritium :
Over 200 attempts have been made to detect tritium with about 24 reporting this product , sometimes at significant levels , but not enough to account for the AE .
Apparently , the tritium - producing reaction is rare and difficult to initiate .
Three particularly compelling results have been published using the P- F method , a low - energy gas discharge , and gas loading of palladium - black .
FIGURE 6 . Tritium concentration as a function of time found in a Pons - Fleischmann - type cell being electrolyzed at the indicated voltage .
Heavy - water was added to the electrolyte at the indicated times .
This work was done at Texas A & M University .
Dr. Chien et al. ( Texas A & M ) [ 97 ] measured the tritium content of an open electrolytic cell containing a Pd cathode and LiOD in heavy water .
They found the tritium content of the electrolyte was influenced by changes in the cell current ( overvoltage ) and was a linear function of time when conditions were constant , as shown in Fig .
6 . However , shaking the cell caused tritium production to stop .
It is hard to imagine how this simple act could influence tritium pickup from a prosaic source .
On the other hand , it suggests that tritium production is associated with surface features that are easy to shake off .
Taubes [ 98 ] claimed that tritium was being added by a student .
This accusation was not supported by an investigation at the university .
In addition , thirty - five tritium additions would be needed , each at precisely the correct time and in precisely the correct amount , a feat very hard to keep undetected at a university where people come and go at will .
Other people have suggested tritium was present in the palladium cathode and was slowly released by electrolytic action .
To counter this argument , Storms [ 82 ] used the same technique to study a sample of Pd known to contain tritium .
He found that tritium , which was dissolved in the metal , appeared in the evolving gas rather than in the electrolyte where it was detected by Chien et al .
This work demonstrated that the tritium claimed by Chien et al. could not result from tritium contamination .
The study by Storms also demonstrates that anomalous tritium originates at the surface where it can exchange with the surrounding electrolyte rather than being lost as DT gas , as would be the case if it formed within the bulk material .
In addition , a very complete analysis for tritium in palladium metal , obtained from many suppliers , shows that palladium from commercial sources simply does not contain tritium .
[ 99 , 100 ]
Tritium enrichment is also a possible source of increased tritium concentration because deuterium is lost faster from such cells than is tritium .
The enrichment factor is known [ 101 - 103 ] and can not account for all of the tritium found in this or other studies .
Dr. Claytor [ 104 , 105 ] and co-workers have studied tritium production at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for many years using a pulsed discharge method in low - pressure D 2 gas .
The voltage is too low to produce tritium by conventional processes .
Tritium is measured in real time using an ionization detector within the gas line and later as total tritium content by converting the gas to D 2 O. Tritium contained in the resulting D 2 O is measured using scintillation counting .
Both techniques are very sensitive and show good agreement .
A variety of alloys have been studied which show that tritium production is very sensitive to the material used for the cathode .
Although the amounts produced are small , no prosaic explanation has stood the test of detailed examination by many reviewers , both inside and outside the laboratory .
Arata and Zhang [ 106 ] as well as McKubre et al. detected He - 3 in the D 2 gas after excess energy was made .
This He - 3 was found to result from decay of tritium .
The amount of He - 3 combined with the decay rate showed that the tritium was created at the same time EP was being produced .
However , the amount of tritium was much too small to contribute significant energy to the process .
Each of these studies suggests tritium forms on nanosized particles .
Such locations being rare and difficult to form , tritium production is seldom detected .
Why an isotope like tritium , i.e. one containing excess energy , should form in this environment instead of the ground - state ( 3 He ) is a major challenge for any theory .
Helium :
If these products are not the source of AE , what is ?
Helium - 4 is claimed to result when AE is produced .
However , formation of 4 He is expected to generate gamma emission .
Gamma emission from a CANR cell , although detected sometimes at low levels , is not consistent with the amount of 4 He detected .
For this inconsistency to be resolved , the presence of 4 He needs to be proven .
Several problems make this difficult .
Air contains about 6 ppm of helium , making an air leak a possible source of anomalous helium .
Of course , a leak will not add this much helium to the contained gas unless all of the gas in the apparatus is air .
Clearly all of the deuterium could not be replaced by air without this fact being recognized .
Absence of argon in the gas eliminates an air leak as an explanation for detected helium .
Most studies have failed to detect argon in the D 2 gas .
Even preferential diffusion of
He through the walls would not result in the air concentration being achieved within the apparatus in any reasonable time .
Therefore , detecting He - 4 even close to the air concentration would be proof that the He resulted from some process within the apparatus .
A possible source of helium within the apparatus is that which is dissolved in or absorbed on the cell components .
Studies have shown that helium dissolved in palladium deeper than a few microns can not be removed unless the material is almost melted .
[ 107 ]
Therefore , this source is precluded when helium is found in a P - F cell .
Charcoal , on the other hand , can absorb helium at room temperature and above , and this can be removed by flushing with hydrogen .
Consequently , care must be used when examining a charcoal containing material for helium production .
Numerous samples of palladium have been examined for their helium content after having produced AE , with mixed success .
On the other hand , four studies have shown a quantitative relationship between helium found in the surrounding gas and AE production .
FIGURE 7 . Relationship between atoms of helium per watt - sec of energy and anomalous power generated in a Pons - Fleischmann cell .
Helium was measured in the generated gas and does not include helium retained by the palladium cathode .
This work was done at the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake and at SRI .
Miles et al . [ 108-110 ] , working at the Naval Air Warfare Center ( China Lake ) , recovered gases being generated in a P - F type cell while making AE and measured the amount of contained 4 He .
A double - wall isoperibolic calorimeter was used and gas was collected in metal flasks .
An earlier study [ 111 ] using glass flasks is ignored here even though the result is consistent with their latter work .
Six samples are reported to make AE along with helium at levels above background .
Five samples showed no AE and the helium concentration was at background .
Bush and Lagowski [ 112 ] repeated this study using a Seebeck calorimeter , a different stainless steel apparatus , and at a different laboratory ( SRI ) .
These results are compared in Fig. 7 . Jones and Hansen [ 113 ] criticized the Miles work for confusion in reporting some values , for not running proper controls , for poor calorimetry , and for not measuring possible recombination properly .
Their latter criticism is shown not to be valid in a previous section .
Miles responded first in a question and answer secession [ 114 ] and then in a formal publication .
[ 115 ]
Jones et al. [ 116 ] had the last word after much of Miles ' response was omitted by the journal .
While the issues were not resolved and remain clouded in misunderstanding , a relationship between heat production and helium production has a high probability of being real .
Gozzi et al. [ 117 , 118 ] monitored the real - time production of 4 He from an active cell using an inline mass spectrometer .
Although some problems with air leaks were acknowledged , they demonstrated a clear relationship between energy and helium production .
When these three studies are added to the helium - energy values reported by McKubre et al. , as shown in Fig. 4 , the reality becomes even stronger .
Apparently the nuclear reaction producing helium has an energy close to that expected from d-d fusion .
The insistence that gamma emission must accompany helium production is based on how this fusion branch behaves in a plasma .
Because the reaction d + d = 4He has two nuclei producing one nucleus , gamma radiation must occur to conserve momentum .
On the other hand , suppose the following reaction occurs in a lattice where the d concentration is very high [ 119 ] [ 120 ] :
d+d+d+d = { 8 Be} = 2 4He .
Such a reaction would not require gamma emission because 8Be would promptly decompose into two particles , each having 23.8 MeV .
Other , similar reactions can be proposed to avoid the need to emit gamma radiation .
This suggestion shifts the problem from requiring gamma emission , to accepting that such reactions can actually occur .
Evidence for such multibody interaction has been reported by Takahashi et al . [ 121 ] based on the energy of tritons emitted when titanium is bombarded by D+.
Transmutation : Transmutation describes a nuclear reaction involving nuclei heavier than hydrogen .
Such reactions occur when hydrogen or a heavier nucleus enters another heavy nucleus causing it to transmute ( change ) to another element .
Because the Coulomb barrier is very high for such reactions , significant energy is normally required .
For this reason , claims for such reactions in the CANR environment are surprising and difficult to explain without invoking prosaic processes or error .
If true , these observations imply that the Coulomb barrier , no matter how large , can be reduced to insignificant values by a process available within a solid .
Transmutation reactions have been reported to occur in all environments to which the CANR process has been applied .
The easiest method involves creating a plasma under water .
This can be done by applying sufficient voltage ( up to 150 V ) to form an arc between two carbon rods immersed in an electrolyte containing various salts dissolved in water [ 122-124 ] .
The method is reported to generate a magnetic precipitate in addition to various elements and is easy to duplicate .
A tungsten electrode can also be used [ 125 - 127 ] or the discharge can be made to occur in a cell made of zirconium [ 128 , 129 ] .
Each has been reported to generate elements not previously detected in the materials , sometimes with abnormal isotopic abundance .
The most complete study was undertaken by Prof. Miley [ 130 - 132 ] using electrolytic current applied to a nickel cathode in H 2 O - based electrolyte .
Figure 8 shows the rate of element formation as a function of atomic number .
Many of the observed elements also had an abnormal isotopic ratio .
Of course , some of these elements might have resulted from contamination or from errors in chemical analysis .
On the other hand , Ag and Cu exceed potential contamination by several orders of magnitude .
The number of elements found and the pattern shown by the data are hard to explain based on prosaic sources .
FIGURE 8 . Rate of element production in an electrolytic cell using a Ni cathode and a H 2 O - based electrolyte as a function of atomic number of the element produced .
This study was done at the University of Illinois .
Transmutation is claimed to occur in living systems where the process becomes especially difficult to believe or understand .
Indeed , people have advised me not to discuss this subject , as if a potential reader would be too immature to handle the intellectual conflict this discussion might cause .
Readers are warned to skip this section if such information would damage their open mind .
A scientist in Japan [ 133 -137 ] started the process to duplicate claims made popular [ 138 ] by Kervran [ 139 ] and published the results first in France .
He used modern analytical methods to study eight different biological cultures of bacteria and yeast , each made deficient in K , Mg , Ca , or Fe .
The growing cells are found to make the deficient element from the other elements present .
The following reactions are proposed :
23Na +16O = 39 K 23Na + 1H = 24Mg 39 K + 1H = 40 Ca 24Mg + 16O = 40Ca 28Si + 12C = 40Ca
Later , Russian workers started a similar study [ 140 , 141 ] .
This team first made cultures of three different bacilli and one yeast , all of which could live in either D 2 O or H 2 O .
The cultures were made iron - free , but contained a small amount of MnSO 4 .
After a suitable time , the presence of 57Fe was measured using the Mössbauer effect .
Iron 57 was only detected when both MnSO 4 and D 2 O were present in the cultures .
The proposed reaction is 55 Mn + 2D = 57 Fe .
The rate of growth was measured and was calculated to give no more than 50 mW to the growing media .
Of course , the culture containing H 2 O would be expected to make 56Fe , which would be invisible to the Mössbauer method .
It is interesting that Kervran [ 139 ] published a study over forty years ago in which MnSO 4 placed in a culture growing in H 2 O made iron that was easily observed .
Naturally , this work was ignored .
The Russian team has filed a patent for the process .
The team has now explored the reaction 23 Na + 31P = 54 Fe .
A time of flight mass spectrometer was used to determine the concentrations of reactants and product .
They report that a culture made deficient in iron would generate iron only when both Na and P are present .
QUESTION #7 : HOW CAN THE CLAIMS BE EXPLAINED ?
Objections to cold fusion being real rely on the following arguments .
First , a large application of energy is required to overcome the Coulomb barrier .
If a nuclear reaction should occur , the immediate release of energy can not be communicated to the lattice in the time available .
When such energy is released under " normal " conditions , energetic particles are emitted along with various kinds of radiation , only a few of which are seen by CANR studies .
In addition , gamma emission must accompany helium , and production of neutrons and tritium , in equal amounts , must result from any fusion reaction .
None of these conditions is observed during the claimed CANR effect , no matter how carefully or how often they have been sought .
Furthermore , many attempts to calculate fusion rates based on conventional models fail to support the claimed rates within PdD .
The atoms are simply too far apart .
Failure to discover just what the nuclear - active - environment really looks like is a major problem in answering some of these challenges .
A few observations suggest where to look .
When the electrolytic method is used , AE is produced on the surface within small , isolated regions . [ 84 , 142 ]
These regions heat up in a random fashion , thereby losing the required deuterium content , which stops further reaction .
Thousands of such local regions flash on and off , adding their resulting energy to the total .
This process is self - regulating and usually produces a smooth generation of heat energy .
Occasionally , a region will generate enough energy to cause local melting [ 143 , 144 ] .
Once in awhile , large bursts of total energy are observed .
The number of such regions on the surface determines just how much total power will be produced .
This description implies that power density in the active regions is extremely high and has no relationship at all to the often quoted power density based on the physical volume of the sample .
( Note : some browsers cannot display characters in the symbol font .
If betas do not appear in the following , read beta - PdD for b- PdD wherever it occurs in the following ) .
While the nature of these regions is still unknown , they are clearly not b - PdD [ 145 ] , as most people have assumed when the P- F method is used .
Not only is the active composition in excess of PdD 1.0 [ 146-148 ] , the upper composition limit for this phase , but deposition of various impurities makes the surface a complex alloy [ 149 -155 ] .
Neither the structure nor the composition of this alloy is known .
In fact , some nuclear - active materials may not contain palladium at all .
A growing number of materials , besides palladium , are found to be useful for the P- F method , with bulk palladium being the most difficult to make active .
Two conditions appear to be required : the ability of the material to acquire a high deuterium content and the size of the active regions .
The required size appears to be less than 1 µm .
A high flux of deuterium through the material also seems to be beneficial [ 156-158 ] , although not necessary .
The active material will be equally difficult to locate and identify when other methods , besides electrolysis , are examined .
In summary , the active material within a P - F cell is on the surface and located in very small , isolated regions .
Bulk properties have little relationship to the properties of these regions , which consist of a complex alloy having very little in common with b - PdD .
Very little progress will be made until the proposed models are applied to the real world rather than using the ideal environment within b - PdD .
In addition , bulk properties can not be used to support a model or to reject the claims .
Ordinary hydrogen produces both AE and NP using the same methods applied to deuterium .
Obviously , fusion can not be a source of either product .
In addition , the materials required to initiate anomalous effects are different between the two isotopes .
For example , palladium is found to be nuclear - active with deuterium while only nickel is found to be active with hydrogen .
As expected , the types of nuclear reactions are different , as well as the environments in which they occur .
This difference suggests several different mechanisms may be operating .
Such a possibility needs to be considered when evaluating the proposed models .
Once the environment has been created , what process might allow a nuclear reaction to take place ?
Only a few proposed mechanisms have been developed in sufficient detail to be useful or to allow an evaluation .
A useful model must address more than just the conditions thought to exist when the P- F method is used and must consider the following :
# 1. describe how the Coulomb barrier is overcome , # 2 . show how the released nuclear energy is distributed throughout the atomic lattice , # 3 . show why and how different environments produce different nuclear reactions , and # 4 .
recognize the unique characteristics required of a nuclear - active environment .
Proposed theories can be evaluated with respect to the initial assumptions , to the accuracy of the applied mathematics , and to how well the theory treats the above conditions .
Only the latter evaluation will be applied here .
Of course , many assumptions used to meet these conditions may not be considered reasonable .
This part of the evaluation is left for the reader , although a few evaluations at this level have been published .
[ 159 -161 ] .
The following discussion must , for space considerations , be very simple and omit many efforts to explain the effect .
The author apologizes in advance for giving so much hard work so little attention .
FIGURE 9 . Enhancement over the effect found at high energy for the reaction D(d , p ) T as a function of energy applied to D+ used to bombard the indicated targets .
This work was done at Tohoku University , Japan .
Enhanced Cross Section :
The observations imply a higher than expected cross-section for fusion at very low energy .
To explore this possibility , Kasagi et al . [ 162 ] bombarded various metals and compounds with deuterons of various energies down to 2.5 keV and measured how much enhancement was produced in the reaction D( d , p ) T , as shown in Figure 9 .
Apparently , an increase in cross-section does occur at low energy when the reaction occurs in a solid , in contrast to when the reaction is initiated in a plasma .
In addition , enhancement is greater in PdO than in a number of pure elements [ 163 ] , thereby showing that the nature of the chemical environment is important .
Because the solids were not expected to be nuclear - active under the conditions of the study , the measured cross-sections represent only a lower limit for what might be possible when the " correct " solid is used .
Other studies indicate that the branching ratio between tritium and neutron production might also change at low energy .
[ 164-166 ]
Once these possibilities are acknowledged , the next problem is to propose how the cross-sections might be increased at low energy by the surrounding atoms .
Neutron Formation : Neutrons are assumed either to be present in the lattice within a stabilizing structure [ 167 ] or are created by collapse of an electron [ 168 - 177 ] into the nucleus of a hydrogen or deuterium .
The latter collapse makes a dineutron .
[ 178 , 179 ]
The importance of a neutron presence is suggested by the unusual effects observed when an external neutron flux is applied to a CANR cell .
[ 180 - 184 ]
Apparently , the environment acts like a neutron amplifier .
This model answers only Requirement # 1 .
In addition , one might ask why more neutrons are not detected as they are being released or created within the cell , especially when thin cathodes are used ?
Fisher [ 185 ] [ 186 ] has proposed that large , stable neutron clusters can form and that these can attach themselves to normal nuclei to produce super - heavy atoms .
A small concentration of such atoms is proposed to be present in all matter .
Under the right conditions , these neutron clusters are released , thereby causing novel nuclear reactions .
The work of Oriani [ 187 ] supports the existence of super - heavy carbon in electrodes subjected to CANR processes .
Particle - wave Transformation : Talbot and Scott Chubb ( uncle and nephew ) [ 188-190 ] have explored the possibility of particle - wave conversion , a process known to occur at very low temperatures .
In this model , deuterons convert to waves in the correct environment and these waves interact to form a helium wave within the surrounding atomic lattice .
Once sufficient energy has been lost by the d -d- He wave packet , it becomes a 4 He particle .
In their model , a periodic lattice of suitable size containing a very high concentration of deuterium nuclei is required .
Helium already present within the structure and a deuteron flux are proposed to be beneficial .
Liboff [ 191 , 192 ] has also explored this theme in a different way .
This model answers Requirements # 1 , # 2 and # 4 very well , but answering # 3 requires some less attractive assumptions .
Also , one might wonder why the proton is not also converted to a wave and , as such , combine with a deuteron wave to make 3 He , an isotope not detected except as the decay product of tritium .
While not using the vocabulary of particle - wave conversion , Hagelstein [ 193 ] has arrived , after several detours , at a model he proposes answers all of the required conditions .
He assumes phonons can interact with the nucleus and these interactions can be at different sites in a lattice , yet coupled together to produce the observed result .
In this model , phonons provide the mechanism for coupling rather than wave formation of atoms .
Of course , a phonon , which is a mathematical construct used to describe thermal vibrations , must accumulate considerable energy either before reacting or within the nucleus [ 194 ] after reacting , two precesses that are hard to justify .
Resonance , Tunneling and Screening : Deuterons in a lattice experience thermal vibration and , by this process , might get close enough to interact with each other or with the palladium nuclei .
However , many calculations show that the atoms are too far apart in b - PdD to interact .
If this type of interaction is to occur , neutralization of the Coulomb barrier by surrounding electrons ( screening ) and / or enhanced barrier penetration using a process called resonance tunneling , as first suggested by Turner [ 195 ] , must be applied to the process .
Each aspect of this process has been addressed in different ways .
Agreement is far from universal that any variation on this theme , of which there are many , can explain the amount of AE observed .
Only a few will be described here to give a general understanding of the methods being applied .
Several people [ 196 , 197 ] [ 198 ] have reformulated a calculation of the Gamow factor which defines how repulsive forces change with distance between nuclei and determines how much " normal " tunneling might take place .
By applying a resonance process , a higher than expected fusion rate was calculated , consistent with the Jones [ 199 ] level of neutron emission , but not high enough to explain the P-F heat .
As noted above , the neutron flux measured by Jones may not have originated from a CANR process at all , but be caused by fractofusion .
Clearly , for such a theory to be useful , additional processes must operate .
Parmenter [ 200 ] comes to the conclusion that " tunneling is most likely when the energy of the deuteron pair most closely matches that of the 4He isomer .
Pulsed loading is suggested as a way to achieve this condition .
This process may operate unintentionally as the active regions experience changes in loading produced by bubble action .
However , this mechanism would not apply to the other methods .
Preparata [ 201 ] imagines a coherent plasma of electrons within the PdD structure that are able to off - set the charge at the nucleus .
He assumes b - PdD exists only in the range PdD 0.6 - 0.7 while another phase ( gamma ) , based on tetrahedral occupancy , forms at higher compositions .
Unfortunately , the model involves a faulty understanding of the Pd - D system [ 202 ] because tetrahedral occupancy has never been observed in this system [ 203-205 ] even when its presence was sought .
To add to the confusion , a previously designated gamma phase is seen only below 50 K at PdH 0.67 as an ordering of deuterium vacancies [ 206 ] .
The very large compositions reported for the surface of PdD , as noted above , suggests a new phase ( PdD 2 ) [ 145 ] to which the model might be applied .
Lo [ 207 ] has also explored this theme .
Exotic Particles : Several unusual particles are proposed to catalyze nuclear reactions .
Such an explanation may answer Requirement # 1 in an incomplete way but , in most cases , fails to address the other requirements .
However , the implications go well beyond the CANR effect if the claims are true .
Bazhutov et al. [ 208 -210 ] have proposed the existence of a heavy hadron ( 175 GeV / c2 ) called Erzion , which they have identified in cosmic rays .
In a similar manner , but independently , Rafelski et al . [ 211 ] visualize a stable , ultra heavy , negatively charged particle called X- to rain down from outer space .
These models do not address Requirements # 2 , # 3 or # 4 .
McKibben [ 212 , 213 ] proposes the existence of three sets of fractionally charged particles called subquarks ( 1.15 amu , charge = +e/6 ) , hemitrons ( 0.13 amu , charge =+e / 2 , and negative hemitrons ( > 0.13 amu , charge = - e /2 ) .
These are proposed to form into nuclei and mimic the properties of normal isotopes .
However , because these pseudo - nuclei are more unstable than their normal counterpart , they can enter into and catalyze nuclear reactions more easily .
This model concludes that nuclear - active material contains more of these pseudo - elements than does inactive material .
Why the pseudo - elements should be so highly localized and why such a long delay exists for the production of AE are not addressed .
Formation of proton or deuteron clusters : Dufour et al. [ 214 , 215 ] have observed unusual behavior when a low current - high voltage discharge occurs in H 2 or D 2 .
These authors have now developed a model based on clusters involving a large number of protons or deuterons combined with the required number of electrons .
These clusters , called hydrex and deutex , can bind to a nucleus , thereby lowering the Coulomb barrier for various nuclear reactions .
[ 216 , 217 ]
A variety of nuclear products have been found that depend on the materials placed in the discharge , as well as production of anomalous energy .
Matsumoto [ 218 ] also proposes a deuteron cluster ( Nattoh model ) in which the fusion reaction is thought to occur .
A new particle called Iton is proposed to be emitted from this reaction .
Very strange tracks are found in photographic film placed near an active cell , which support this and other interpretations .
[ 219 , 220 ]
These models answer only Requirement # 1
Formation of electron clusters : Millions of electrons are proposed by Shoulders [ 221 ] to form into clusters during any spark discharge .
These clusters interact with solids to produce local regions having very unusual properties .
This proposal is based on years of study , the details of which have yet to be published , although patents have been issued . [ 222 ]
When these electron clusters encounter a dielectric , they strongly interact to produce many effects including nuclear reactions .
This concept has been applied by Fox et al . [ 223-225 ] to a number of conditions used to initiate the LENR effect .
Lewis [ 226 ] has also proposed similar ideas .
Some of the strange tracks found in film placed near a CANR cell [ 220 ] may be produced by such charge clusters . [ 224 ]
3. CONCLUSION
A growing number of successful replications of anomalous energy using different methods are being reported .
This energy is clearly related to the nature of the environment and appears to be generated by various nuclear reactions .
Two questions need answers .
Do these observations show a real and novel feature of nature ?
If the observations are truly novel , then how does the nuclear active environment differ from ordinary matter , which is clearly inert ?
Which of the various observed nuclear reactions is favored also depends on the environment .
This being the case , materials science plays a role as important as does nuclear physics .
Evidence for the reality of the claims comes from three sources .
First , most of the methods that claim to produce anomalous effects have been duplicated , as noted in Table 1 and some have been replicated many times , especially the PF effect as listed in Table 2 .
As the reader can plainly see , this fact is in sharp contrast to popular perception [ 227 ] .
Nevertheless , replication is not always successful , requiring knowledge of the important variables and some luck in acquiring special materials .
Thanks to the persistence of a few workers , replication is now much easier than was initially the case .
Second , similar patterns of behavior have been observed by every investigator who bothered to make the necessary measurement .
As an example , a universal relationship exists between the average deuterium content of the cathode and the amount of AP observed using the P-F effect .
Third , a study of the D(d , p ) T reaction using conventional ion implantation techniques shows that the cross-section for the reaction becomes greater the lower the bombarding energy below 2.5 keV and it is sensitive to the chemical environment .
While the measured cross-section is too low to explain the observed EP , one might wonder what would be observed at energies near room temperature when a nuclear - active environment is used .
While many environments , including both metals and compounds , have been successful in hosting AP and NP production , the most successful common feature is the size of the active domain .
Crystals having dimensions in the region between micro- and nanometers appear to be the most active .
Unfortunately , these domains are frequently not part of the characterized bulk material , but are deposited by various processes on the surface .
For example , they can be deposited by electrolysis when the P- F method is used or by ion bombardment during gas discharge .
Once formed , these microregions need only to acquire deuterium or , in some cases , hydrogen to initiate a nuclear reaction .
In addition to size , a flux of hydrogen or deuterium appears to be necessary .
This flux can be generated using either a temperature or concentration gradient .
The presence of other elements in the active environment add complexity to the resulting nuclear products .
Apparently , even large Coulomb barriers appear to be overcome by processes currently being explored .
Although the mechanism is still not completely understood , no new physics appears to be necessary .
Nevertheless , nuclear behavior is quite different from that experienced when high energy is used to initiate such reactions .
Especially novel is the absence of radioactivity and energetic radiation , including neutron and gamma emissions .
The challenge is to find a rational explanation .
This explanation can not be found unless the observations are made known to the general scientific profession , thereby allowing a broad range of knowledge to be applied .
The large number of nuclear reactions being reported and the types of required environments give a particular challenge to theoreticians .
In contrast to conventional experience based on using high energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier by brute force , the CANR environment apparently uses a mechanism that can neutralize the barrier .
This more subtle method apparently is obscured when high energy is applied , this situation being like the difference between a rape and a seduction .
The problem is to identify the nature of these environments .
Up to now , almost all effort has been focused on explaining how the nuclear reactions can take place once the environment is created .
While this insight is important , it has not been much help in finding the best environments .
This approach needs to change if commercial applications are to be achieved and if the skeptical attitude is to change .
Everyone who has worked in this field has suffered an amount of professional rejection and personal attack well out of proportion to the scientific issues .
[ 228-231 ]
Professors Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann paid an especially high price at the hands of their fellow scientists .
This attitude has even extended to the US Patent Office .
With only a few exceptions , patents cannot be obtained in the US on this subject , although other countries issue patent protection on a routine basis .
This rejecting attitude has also been adopted by industry and by most levels of government , especially the U.S. Department of Energy .
In addition , a few individuals have repeatedly intervened to prevent an open and honest discussion of the subject , as described by Mallove and Rothwell [ 232 ] .
In view of the expected energy shortage , the threat of global warming , and the growing accumulation of nuclear waste , the present attitude needs to change [ 233 ] .
This phenomenon has the potential to solve several major problems if normal procedures for scientific discussion and study are allowed .
In spite of this general rejection , the American Physical Society , the American Chemical Society , and the American Nuclear Society are to be complimented for their willingness to permit discussion of this subject at their recent conferences .
Fusion Technology , a publication of the American Nuclear Society , edited until recently by George Miley , and the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry have been especially helpful in the past .
However , Physical Review B , Review of Modern Physics , Chemical Reviews , and J. Electroanalytical Chemistry turned down a request to publish this review .
Fusion Science and Technology ( formerly Fusion Technology ) , is also unwilling to publish papers on the subject .

Some think that the hype surrounding the Apple iPhone started in January of 2007 , but that 's not true .
The hype started many years ago , perhaps before creating such a device was even a twinkle in Steve Jobs ' eye .
After so many years of rumors about the mythical iPhone , so many fake ( or scrapped ? ) mockups , so many fake ( or scrapped ) names , and a brief experiment with the now - failed Motorola ROKR , Apple finally went ahead and launched the device that Apple fans have been craving since the beginning of time — or at least since Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and killed off the Newton .
SPECS AT A GLANCE : iPhone MANUFACTURER
Apple ( product page ) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Macintosh computer running Mac OS X 10.4.10 or later , USB 2.0 port , iTunes 7.3 ; Windows PC running Windows Vista or Windows XP SP2 , USB 2.0 port , iTunes 7.3 PRICE US $ 499 ( 4GB ) , US$ 599 ( 8GB )
And of course , to do something simultaneously predictable and shocking , the company called the device by its long - rumored , but never - quite - accepted nickname , the " iPhone . "
The iPhone is now out and promises to revolutionize the way we use our phones forever .
You do n't have to love it ; you do n't even have to like it .
You will , however , be witness to a great upheaval in the mobile communications business because of it .
Steve Jobs recently declared during an internal company meeting that he believes all phones will , some day , work the same way as the iPhone and that those who worked at Apple during the iPhone launch will be able to tell their grandchildren about it .
It appears as if Jobs truly believes in this product as a long - term revolutionary device , even if he does acknowledge that it does come with various flaws today .
Our iPhone review is rather large because we unleashed three ( and a half ) reviewers on it , all coming from different backgrounds .
We pooled our thoughts together , had a few fistfights and a squabble or two ( " Keyboard sucks ! "
" Does not ! " ) , and now present to you our full review .
Check out the outline beforehand , or just jump on in .

Define this , you nitwits
Snopes , the foremost online repository of urban legends , reports that the following email is making the rounds :
I do n't have a 1999 Random House unabridged handy , but I hope this one is true .
Received via email : Disgruntled Former Lexicographer
The following definition was discovered in the 1999 edition of the Random House dictionary .
The crafting of this definition was the final assignment of Mr. Del Delhuey , who had been dismissed after 32 years with the company .

23 .
I would like to take a trip to the seaside , where no one knows me .
24 . I would like to be walking on the beach when a beautiful woman passes by .
25 .
She would stop me and ask me what I did for a living .
26 . I would tell her I am a lexicographer .
27 .
She would say , " Oh , you wild boy . "
Exactly that , not one word different .
28 .
Then she would ask me to define our relationship , which at that point would be one minute old .
I would demur .
But she would say , " Oh please define this second for me right now . " 29 .
I would look at her and say , " Mutton . " 30 .
She would swoon .
Because I would say it in a slight Spanish accent , at which I am very good .
31 . I would take her hand and she would notice me feeling her wedding ring .
I would ask her whom she is married to .
She would say , " A big cheese at Random House . "
32 . I would take her to my motel room , and teach her the meaning of love .
33 . I would use the American Heritage , out of spite , and read all the definitions .
34 .
Then I would read out of the Random House some of my favorites among those that I worked on : " the " ( just try it ) ; " blue " ( give it a shot , and do n't use the word ' nanometer ' ) .
35 . I would make love to her according to the O.E.D. , sixth definition .

b. muttsam : sheep floating in the sea .
c. muttonheads : the Random House people .
As the Snopesters reveal , the above text is actually a humorous piece by Steve Martin , published in the " Shouts & Murmurs " section of the Oct. 11 , 1999 New Yorker .
It 's part of a large genre of urban folklore common to the digital era , in which authored bits of fiction become decontextualized from their sources and get circulated electronically as if they were factual .
Sometimes the fiction is intentionally misleading , as in the Belgian video about voices released from the grooves of ancient pottery ( an April Fool 's prank , as I described in a post last year ) .
In many other cases , a piece of satire loses its satirical context , leading credulous readers to believe that they 're enjoying a " strange but true " account of Microsoft error messages in haiku , a calamitous Bangkok piano recital , or Elizabeth Hurley 's pubic hair extensions .
Steve Martin 's piece works well in this genre , since it poses as the type of apocryphal story we 've all heard about : a disgruntled employee leaves behind a concealed bit of sabotage , be it a rattle in a Cadillac or hidden phallic artwork .
But Martin moves the sabotage narrative into finely wrought literary terrain , with the sad Mr. Delhuey joining the ranks of such thwarted dreamers as Walter Mitty and J. Alfred Prufrock .
( Apparently , no amount of literary flourishes can keep some people from disabling their irony detectors , at least when they 're reading their email . )
One line in particular struck the fancy of the writer Diane Ackerman , as she recounts in her book An Alchemy Of Mind :
When I got to definition 6 — " To wear a dog " — I began laughing spasmodically , and again at odd moments throught the day , whenever the image of wearing a live squirming mutt infiltrated my thoughts .
At dinner that evening , over curry , I tried sharing its humor with friends .
Only one of three got it , and she started laughing crazily , too , while the others seemed mystified by our apparent stomach cramps and bad taste .
On the basis of that single event , I conclude that humor is subjective .
I 'm more fond of the later definitions , with the vividly imagined world of those harmless drudges who toil anonymously in the lexicographical trenches .
Now that I 've joined that world , I can report that most lexicographers are n't all that Prufrockian .
Not that they do n't dream of finding someone who swoons at the definition of mutton .
( By the way , the sixth definition of the noun love in the Oxford English Dictionary is " the animal instinct between the sexes , and its gratification . "
Mr. Martin clearly did his homework . )

Years ago , the world 's corporate elite lusted over the wealth generated by the American economy .
So , they devised the concept of globalization and created multi-national ' free - trade ' packs such as NAFTA , WTO and GATS , which allowed them access to our markets to partake of our wealth .
Originally , it was done under the guise of restoring war - torn Europe and Asia , but these countries are now more than able to compete on their own without the help of " free - trade " .
But , yet these packs are still in play today , growing in number and power to the detriment of the American people .
Most Americans are aware of the economic devastation that the " free - trade " packs are doing to our country .
Disloyal corporate heads are displacing hundreds of thousand American workers and replacing them with imported cheap foreign labor or exporting their good paying jobs to countries with pools of near - slave labor .
Most of these Americans are then relegated to sub par jobs with their families in desperate straits .
Some are even left homeless , living in their cars .
Many of America 's brightest young people are bypassing college ( men in particular ) because of the massive number of high tech and science jobs being sent overseas or filled here with cheap foreign graduates .
It is heartbreaking to think of what could have been for many Americans if not for the evaporating opportunities brought about by globalization .
The formally great United States is being deindustrialized by globalization .
Since 1978 , 14,449 US companies have been sold to foreign buyers for a total acquisition amount of $ 1,777,738,035,222 .
These American industries could n't compete with the cheap goods protected by " free - trade " that were flooding US markets and as a result they failed and were bought up by the foreign firms with their profits from their US sales .
How many products stamped " made in America " have you seen lately in the stores ?
Ramifications include our cities being eroded by the mass exodus of their industrial base and our dependence on the rest of the world for our many needed goods , which has national security implications .
But it 's even more crucial for Americans to become aware that these " free - trade " packs are also undermining American sovereignty .
In the case of the WTO , Congress is prohibited from passing legislation that violates its bylaws .
In other words , our agreement with the WTO curtails what laws Congress is allowed to pass concerning US industrial policies .
The WTO is fixed so that each member country has only one vote with no veto powers for anyone .
Even though the United States is the benefactor , it only has equal footing with every developing country with cheap goods to dump on our markets .
Why ... switch the debate on Iraq from a " war on " an evil tactic ( e.g. , terrorism ) to a " war on " an evil culture ( e.g. Jihadism ) , of course !
And here we see the crux of the matter on this word shift :
Republicans are still working with campaign consultants pushing the fear frame as best path to the victory in 2008 , but they are increasingly aware that looking and sounding like George W. Bush is a one - way ticket to wikipedia obscurity , not the White House .
Tuesday night 's Republican " debate " on CNN was chock full of attempts by the candidates to say " Jihadism " and " Jihadist " as much as posible , often coupled with direct jabs at the competence of the Bush administration and -- no big shocker , here -- at the credibility of the Democrats .
Rather than dump that old Bush - Cheney bunk about a vote for the Democrats being a vote for nuclear annihilation by " terrorists , " many Republicans are framing the debate with a new word : " Jihadism . "
Now that trashing Bush on TV is de rigueur for GOP presidential wannabes , one might think that the right - wing rhetoric of fear and violence might fall by the wayside , too .
Guess again .
Criticizing Bush Means " Weak " and " Treasonous "
How to run a campaign that uses the same fear frame and also lashes out at George W. Bush for being an idiot is the challenge for the Republican presidential candidate -- and not an enviable one .
The difficulty lies in how the Republicans over the past 7 years have framed any criticism of Bush 's policies as a sign of " weakness " or " treason . "
But with polling that shows Bush will soon be less popular lung cancer , any Republican who does not step up and speak out against Bush will go down with the ship .
That is easy enough of a challenge for single - issue snowball 's - chance - in - Hell candidates like Tom Tancredo , Ron Paul , and Jim Gilmore .
All they have to do is voice their contempt for Bush as happened on Tuesday .
But for the candidates polling in the top or even in the middle of the pack , the challenge is not just to say why Bush is such a flop , but say it in a way that brings on board the whole authoritarian pack that might otherwise go into shock at the mere suggestion that Bush did something wrong .
Bringing on the word " Jihad " allows for just that kind of finesse because it picks up a widely accepted critique of Bush , while at the same time pushing the debate into an entirely new logic .
" We 're still at war , " it says , " But now we know it 's a war against ideology and culture - - a clash of civilizations -- not just a war against a deadly tactic . "
And this kind of turn to clash of civilizations actually does more than solve the problem of pushing fear and dissing Bush .
It forges a strong tie between the top- tier Republican candidates and the authoritarian intellectuals that make up the pundit class of the Republican party .
This is because right - wing thinkers like Dinesh D'Souzah have been arguing for some time now that the attacks on 9/11 were not in fact part of a the " global war on terror , " as Bush has been saying , but part of the global culture war that the right fought so effectively against Liberals since the 1980s .
Talking about " Jihadism " as the threat we face , opens the flood gates for every Republican to say that " liberals and terrorists " hate American culture and , subsequently , to claim as D'Souzah has that Democrats should not be elected because they are more concerned about the danger of the Republican party than the danger of Al Qaeda .
Shining a Light on the Tactic : Moving Beyond " Violence " In Public Debate
The challenge , then , for Democrats is not to get snookered by all the rapid talk about " Jihadism , " but to think big and keep framing the debate in terms of " all - over - the - board " and " smart " foreign policy .
But beyond that technical aspect of the discussion -- the aspect that answers the question , " How will we craft and run our policies ? " -- Democrats need to find a way to push the discussion to a level that includes the broad idea of protecting the American " way of life . "
What Democrats hold is a vision of America where the public square is not dominated by talk of violence .
As it stands , the Republican election campaign tactics over the past 7 years have injected so much talk of terrorism , Jihadism and nuclear destruction into the public square that -- with each passing day - - our public debate becomes more and more saturated with violence .
The grim irony of the past 7 years is that the worst actual violence in decades happened on American soil on September 11 , 2001 , but our public debate is far more dominated by talk and fear of violence today that it has ever been .
By doing so , the Republicans have failed on a very fundamental level .
By choosing to use fear as a tool for winning elections , the Republicans have poisoned public debate and brought on increasingly widespread cynicism .
Getting rid of corruption and incompetence when George W. Bush leaves office will allow us as a nation to return to a smart foreign policy , but unless we are willing to move past violent and fear - laced rhetoric in our public debate , we face a rising tide of cynicism that could rip this nation in two .
That is the bigger challenge that we all face -- not only here in contemporary America , but also in Iraqi and in future generations as well .
And so Democrats , if they want to gain and keep control of the debate on national security in this election , must be willing to frame their vision for a good foreign policy in terms of the much broader logic of restoring public discourse in America - - of turning back the rhetoric of violence unleashed in wave after wave , every time a Republican runs for office in a post - 9/11 campaign .
What To Expect In Response
Response to this new attempt by Democrats to talk about eliminating violence from public debate , will likely be met by Republican efforts to say that liberals worry more about Republicans than they do about " Jihadists . "
To that , the response should be to finish the thought for them ( my suggestion , here ) :
" And again , here we see the Republican doing whatever they can to push violent rhetoric to win votes by making us fearful .
America is tired of this .
We talk more about violence 7 years after the country was attacked than we did on September 12 .
The Republicans simply refuse to stop injecting violence and fear into public debate .
The American people are tired of it .
We want a foreign policy that 's smart and that works so that we do n't have to spend all our time talking about violence , not -- as the Republicans believe -- so that we can spend all our time tangled up in violent talk . "
On Tuesday , Russian President Vladimir Putin gave an hour and a half - long press conference which was attended by many members of the world media .
The contents of that meeting --- in which Putin answered all questions concerning nuclear proliferation , human rights , Kosovo , democracy and the present confrontation with the United States over missile defense in Europe --- have been completely censored by the press .
Apart from one brief excerpt which appeared in a Washington Post editorial , ( and which was used to criticize Putin ) the press conference has been scrubbed from the public record .
It never happened .
( Read the entire press conference archived here . )
Putin ’s performance was a tour de force .
He fielded all of the questions however misleading or insulting .
He was candid and statesmanlike and demonstrated a good understanding of all the main issues .
The meeting gave Putin a chance to give his side of the story in the growing debate over missile defense in Eastern Europe .
He offered a brief account of the deteriorating state of US - Russian relations since the end of the Cold War , and particularly from 9 - 11 to present .
Since September 11 , the Bush administration has carried out an aggressive strategy to surround Russia with military bases , install missiles on its borders , topple allied regimes in Central Asia , and incite political upheaval in Moscow through US - backed “ pro-democracy ” groups .
These openly hostile actions have convinced many Russian hard - liners that the administration is going forward with the neocon plan for “ regime change ” in Moscow and fragmentation of the Russian Federation .
Putin ’s testimony suggests that the hardliners are probably right .
The Bush administration ’s belligerent foreign policy has backed the Kremlin into a corner and forced Putin to take retaliatory measures .
He has no other choice .
If we want to understand why relations between Russia are quickly reaching the boiling - point ; we only need to review the main developments since the end of the Cold War .
Political analyst Pat Buchanan gives a good rundown of these in his article “ Does n’t Putin Have a Point ? ”
Buchanan says :
“ Though the Red Army had picked up and gone home from Eastern Europe voluntarily , and Moscow felt it had an understanding we would not move NATO eastward , we exploited our moment .
Not only did we bring Poland into NATO , we brought in Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia , and virtually the whole Warsaw Pact , planting NATO right on Mother Russia 's front porch .
Now , there is a scheme afoot to bring in Ukraine and Georgia in the Caucasus , the birthplace of Stalin .
Second , America backed a pipeline to deliver Caspian Sea oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey , to bypass Russia .
Third , though Putin gave us a green light to use bases in the old Soviet republics for the liberation of Afghanistan , we now seem hell - bent on making those bases in Central Asia permanent .
Fourth , though Bush sold missile defense as directed at rogue states like North Korea , we now learn we are going to put anti-missile systems into Eastern Europe .
And against whom are they directed ?
Fifth , through the National Endowment for Democracy , its GOP and Democratic auxiliaries , and tax - exempt think tanks , foundations , and " human rights " institutes such as Freedom House , headed by ex-CIA director James Woolsey , we have been fomenting regime change in Eastern Europe , the former Soviet republics , and Russia herself .
U.S. - backed revolutions have succeeded in Serbia , Ukraine , and Georgia , but failed in Belarus .
Moscow has now legislated restrictions on the foreign agencies that it sees , not without justification , as subversive of pro-Moscow regimes .
Sixth , America conducted 78 days of bombing of Serbia for the crime of fighting to hold on to her rebellious province , Kosovo , and for refusing to grant NATO marching rights through her territory to take over that province .
Mother Russia has always had a maternal interest in the Orthodox states of the Balkans .
These are Putin 's grievances .
Does he not have a small point ? ”
Yes -- as Buchanan opines --- Putin does have a point , which is why his press conference was suppressed .
The media would rather demonize Putin , than allow him to make his case to the public .
( The same is true of other world leaders who choose to use their vast resources to improve the lives of their own citizens rather that hand them over to the transnational oil giants ; such as , Mahmud Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chavez )
Even so , NATO has not yet endorsed the neocon missile defense plan and , according to recent surveys , public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic is overwhelmingly against it .
Unsurprisingly , the Bush administration is going ahead regardless of the controversy .
Putin cannot allow the United States to deploy its missile defense system to Eastern Europe .
The system poses a direct threat to Russia ’s national security .
If Putin planned to deploy a similar system in Cuba or Mexico , the Bush administration would immediately invoke the Monroe Doctrine and threaten to remove it by force .
No one doubts this .
And no one should doubt that Putin is equally determined to protect his own country ’s interests in the same way .
We can expect that Russia will now aim its missiles at European targets and rework its foreign policy in a way that compels the US to abandon its current plans .
The media has tried to minimize the dangers of the proposed system .
The Washington Post even characterized it as “ a small missile defense system ” which has set off “ waves of paranoia about domestic and foreign opponents ” .
Nonsense .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
As Putin said at the press conference , “ Once the missile defense system is put in place IT WILL WORK AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE ENTIRE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES .
It will be an integral part of the US nuclear capability .
“ For the first time in history --- and I want to emphasize this --- there are elements of the US nuclear capability on the European continent .
It simply changes the whole configuration of international security …..
Of course , we have to respond to that . ”
Putin is right .
The “ so - called ” defense system is actually an expansion ( and integration ) of America ’s existing nuclear weapons system which will now function as one unit .
The dangers of this should be obvious .
The Bush administration is maneuvering in a way that will allow it to achieve what Nuclear weapons specialist , Francis A. Boyle , calls the “ longstanding US policy of nuclear first - strike against Russia ” .
In Boyle ’s article “ US Missiles in Europe : Beyond Deterrence to First Strike Threat ” he states :
“ By means of a US first strike about 99 % + of Russian nuclear forces would be taken out .
Namely , the United States Government believes that with the deployment of a facially successful first strike capability , they can move beyond deterrence and into " compellence . " …
This has been analyzed ad nauseam in the professional literature .
But especially by one of Harvard 's premier warmongers in chief , Thomas Schelling -- winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics granted by the Bank of Sweden -- who developed the term " compellence " and distinguished it from " deterrence . "
… The USG is breaking out of a " deterrence " posture and moving into a " compellence " posture .
( Global Research 6-6-07 )
That ’s right .
The real goal is to force Moscow to conform to Washington ’s “ diktats ” or face the prospect of “ first - strike ” annihilation .
That ’s why Putin has expressed growing concern over the administration ’s dropping out of the ABM Treaty and the development of a new regime of low yield , bunker - busting nuclear weapons .
The “ hawks ” who surround Bush have abandoned the “ deterrence ” policy of the past , and now believe that a nuclear war can be “ won ” by the United States .
This is madness and it needs to be taken seriously .
The Bush administration sees itself as a main player in Central Asia and the Middle East --- controlling vital resources and pipeline corridors throughout the region .
That means Russia ’s influence will have to be diminished .
Boris Yeltsin was the perfect leader for the neoconservative master - plan ( which is why the right - wingers Praised him when he died ) Russia disintegrated under Yeltsin .
He oversaw the dismantling of the state , the plundering of its resources and state - owned assets , and the restructuring of its economy according to the tenets of neoliberalism .
No wonder the neocons loved him .
Under Putin , Russia has regained its economic footing , its regional influence and its international prestige .
The economy is booming , the ruble has stabilized , the standard of living has risen , and Moscow has strengthened alliances with its neighbors .
This new - found Russian prosperity poses a real challenge to Bush ’s plans .
Two actions in particular have changed the Russian - US relationship from tepid to openly hostile .
The first was when Putin announced that Russia ’s four largest oil fields would not be open to foreign development .
( Russia has been consolidating its oil wealth under state - run Gazprom )
And , second , when the Russian Treasury began to convert Russia ’s dollar reserves into gold and rubles .
Both of these are regarded as high - crimes by US corporate chieftains and western elites .
Their response was swift .
John Edwards and Jack Kemp were appointed to lead a Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) task force which concocted the basic pretext for an all - out assault on the Putin .
This is where the idea that Putin is “ rolling back democracy ” began ; it ’s a feeble excuse for political antagonism .
In their article “ Russia ’s Wrong Direction ” , Edwards and Kemp state that a “ strategic partnership ” with Russia is no longer possible .
They note that the government has become increasingly “ authoritarian ” and that the society is growing less “ open and pluralistic ” .
Blah , blah , blah .
No one in the Washington really cares about democracy .
( Just look at our “ good friends ” in Saudi Arabia , Azerbaijan , Uzbekistan , and Kazakhstan )
What they ’re afraid of is Putin ditching the dollar and controlling his own oil .
That ’s what counts .
Bush also wants Putin to support sanctions against Iran and rubber stamp a Security Council resolution to separate Kosovo form Serbia .
( Since when does the UN have the right to redraw national borders ?
Was the creation of Israel such a stunning success that the Security Council wants to try its luck again ? )
Putin does not accept the “ unipolar ” world model .
As he said in Munich , the unipolar world refers to “ a world in which there is one master , one sovereign ---- one centre of authority , one centre of force , one centre of decision - making .
At the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system , but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within . …
What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization . ”
He added :
“ Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems .
Moreover , they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension .
Judge for yourselves --- wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished .
More are dying than before .
Significantly more , significantly more !
Today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in international relations , force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts .
We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law .
And independent legal norms are , as a matter of fact , coming increasingly closer to one state ’s legal system .
One state and , of course , first and foremost the United States , has overstepped its national borders in every way .
This is visible in the economic , political , cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations .
Well , who likes this ?
Who is happy about this ?
In international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so - called issues of political expediency , based on the current political climate .
And of course this is extremely dangerous .
It results in the fact that no one feels safe .
I want to emphasise this – no one feels safe !
Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them .
Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race .
I am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security . ”
How can anyone dispute Putin ’s analysis ?
“ Unilateral and illegitimate military actions ” , the “ uncontained hyper-use of force ” , the “ disdain for the basic principles of international law ” , and most importantly ; “ No one feels safe ! ”
These are the irrefutable facts .
Putin has simply summarized the Bush Doctrine better than anyone else .
The Bush administration has increased its frontline American bases to five thousand men on Russia ’s perimeter .
Is this conduct of a “ trustworthy ally ” ?
Also , NATO has deployed forces on Russia ’s borders even while Putin has continued to fulfill his treaty obligations and move troops and military equipment hundreds of miles away .
As Putin said on Tuesday : “ We have removed all of our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia and put them behind the Urals ” and “ reduced our Armed Forces by 300,000 .
We have taken several other steps required by the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces Treaty in Europe ( ACAF ) .
But what have we seen in response ?
Eastern Europe is receiving new weapons , two new military bases are being set up in Romania and in Bulgaria , and there are two new missile launch areas -- a radar in Czech republic and missile systems in Poland .
And we are asking ourselves the question : what is going on ?
Russia is disarming unilaterally .
But if we disarm unilaterally then we would like to see our partners be willing to do the same thing in Europe .
On the contrary , Europe is being pumped full of new weapons systems .
And of course we cannot help but be concerned . ”
( This is why Putin ’s comments did not appear in the western media !
They would have been too damaging to the Bush administration and their expansionist plans )
Who Destroyed the ABM ?
Putin said :
“ We did not initiate the withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty .
But what response did we give when we discussed this issue with our American partners ?
We said that we do not have the resources and desire to establish such a system .
But as professionals we both understand that a missile defense system for one side and no such a system for the other creates an illusion of security and increases the possibility of a nuclear conflict .
The defense system WILL DESTROY THE STRATEGIC EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD .
In order to restore that balance without setting up a missile defense system we will have to create a system to overcome missile defense , which is what we are doing now . ”
Putin : “ AN ARMS RACE IS UNFOLDING .
Was it we who withdrew from the ABM Treaty ?
We must react to what our partners do .
We already told them two years ago , “ do n’t do this , you do n’t need to do this .
What are you doing ?
YOU ARE DESTROYING THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY .
You must understand that you are forcing us to take retaliatory steps . ” …we warned them .
No , they did not listen to us .
Then we heard about them developing low - yield nuclear weapons and they are continuing to develop these weapons . ”
We told them that “ it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low - yield nuclear weapons and lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons , and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe .
But they do n’t listen to us .
They are not looking for compromise .
Their entire point of view can be summed - up in one sentence : ‘ Whoever is not with us is against us . ’ ”
Putin asks , “ So what should we do ? ”
The present predicament has brought us “ the brink of disaster ” .
Putin : “ Some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want , regardless of the interests of other people .
Of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race as you pointed out .
But we are not the instigators .
We do not want it .
Why would we want to divert resources to this ?
And we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone .
But we must respond .
Name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation .
There are none .
We are not interested in that .
We are interested in having a good atmosphere , environment and energy dialogue around Russia ” .
So , what should Putin do ?
And how else can he meet his responsibilities to the Russian people without taking defensive “ retaliatory ” action to Bush ’s act of war .
By expanding its nuclear capability to Europe , all of Russia is in imminent danger , and so , Putin must decide “ precisely which means will be used to destroy the installations that our experts believe represent a potential threat for the Russian Federation ” .
( Note that Putin NEVER THREATENS TO AIM HIS MISSILES AT EUROPEAN CITIES AS WAS REPORTED IN THE WESTERN MEDIA )
Putin has made great strides in improving life for the Russian people .
That is why his public approval rating is soaring at 75 % .
The Russian economy has been growing by 7 % a year .
He ’s lowered the number of people living beneath the poverty - line by more than half and will bring it down to European levels by 2010 .
Real incomes are growing by an astonishing 12 % per year .
As Putin says , “ Combating poverty is one of our top priorities and we still have to do a lot to improve our pension system too because the correlation between pensions and the average wage is still lower here than in Europe . ”
If only that was true in America !
Russia now has the ninth largest economy in the world and has amassed enormous gold and currency reserves -- the third largest in the world .
It is also one of the leading players in international energy policy with a daily - oil output which now exceeds Saudi Arabia .
It is also the largest producer of natural gas in the world .
Russia will only get stronger as we get deeper into the century and energy resources become scarcer .
Putin strongly objects to the idea that he is not committed to human rights or is “ rolling back democracy ” .
He points out how truncheon - wielding police in Europe routinely use tear gas , electric - shock devices and water cannons to disperse demonstrators .
Is that how the West honors human rights and civil liberties ?
As for the Bush administration --- Putin produced a copy of Amnesty International ’s yearly report condemning the United States conduct in the war on terror .
“ I have a copy of Amnesty International ’s report here , which includes a section on the United States , ” he said .
“ The organization has concluded that the United States IS NOW THE PRINCIPLE VIOLATOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WORLDWIDE . ”
He added , “ We have a proverb in Russian , ‘ Do n’t blame the mirror if your face is crooked . ’ ”
Putin is fiercely nationalistic .
He has helped to restore Russia ’s self - confidence and rebuild the economy .
He ’s demonstrated a willingness to compromise with the Bush administration on every substantive issue , but he has been repeatedly rebuffed .
The last thing he wants is a nuclear standoff with the United States .
But he will do what he must to defend his people from the threat of foreign attack .
The deployment of the missile defense system will require that Russia develop its own new weapons systems and change its thinking about trusting the United States .
Friendship is not possible in the present climate .
As for “ democracy ” ; Putin said it best himself :
“ Am I a ‘ pure democrat ’ ?
( laughs )
Of course I am , absolutely .
The problem is that I ’m all alone --- the only one of my kind in the whole wide world .
Just look at what ’s happening in North America , it ’s simply awful --- torture , homeless people , Guantanamo , people detained without trial and investigation .
Just look at what ’s happening in Europe --- harsh treatment of demonstrators , rubber bullets and tear gas used first in one capital then in another , demonstrators killed on the streets …..
I have no one to talk to since Mahatma Gandhi died . ”
Well said , Vladimir .
Note to entrepreneurs hoping to build a business using illicit content : do n't grant extensive interviews ( complete with pictures ) to the Wall Street Journal .
That 's what a pair of aspiring hackers did back in April when they described how their service , YouTVPC , allowed users to watch streaming TV shows and movies without charge .
Now , the MPAA is cracking down on such sites , filing a lawsuit against both YouTVPC and Peekvid this week .
The case was filed Tuesday in a California federal court .
The gist of the suit is that businesses should not be allowed to prosper from illicit material , even if they do not host it .
Both YouTVPC and Peekvid provide access to some of the most popular video content in the world , but they do so by linking up other sites ( many of them outside the US ) where the content is stored .
This allows them to claim that they are doing nothing illegal , even though providing access to this unlicensed material is the extent of their business .
The MPAA has had enough and , as the sites have grown in popularity , has decided to take action .
Fortunately for the movie studios , both companies are based in the US and maintain servers in either Texas or Arizona , making them an easy legal target .
According to the MPAA , Peekvid currently draws more than 53,000 unique visitors every single day , and YouTVPC pulls in another 6,000 a day .
The lawsuit may also get into the matter of how such sites are financed .
It 's no secret in the industry that ads provided by reputable companies like Google and Yahoo commonly earn revenue for sites like Peekvid , and in fact the two sites targeted in the lawsuit both rely on advertising to pay the bills .
In a statement , the MPAA noted that the web sites " profit handsomely from a seemingly endless stream of third - party advertising pitches . "
In a notice on its site , Peekvid says that it " does not contain any content on its site , but is merely an index of available links on the Internet .
Peekvid is committed to an industry solution that will provide a mechanism to compensate artists that create the work you enjoy watching .
Peekvid would like to be part of the long - term solution . "
Good luck with that .
Imagine that someone created a web site with the sole purpose of allowing voters in one state to " swap " preferred candidates with voters from another state : would such a site count as illegal vote - tampering ?
The question is not hypothetical .
Several sites like this sprang up in advance of the 2000 presidential election and were promptly smacked down by legal threats emanating from the office of Bill Jones , California 's then Secretary of State .
Yesterday , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the legality of vote - swapping sites and found that Jones was wrong to threaten them with prosecution .
The practice is legal .
Voteswap2000.com and Votexchange2000.com were both set up in order to allow voters in " swing states " to swap votes with voters from " safe states . "
The idea here was that the swing state voters could still cast their ballots for a third - party candidate ( such as Ralph Nader ) without endangering the Democratic candidate ( Al Gore ) in their states .
Although Nader was in no danger of winning the presidency , votes were still crucial because his party hoped to exceed the five percent threshold for receiving federal election funds in the next campaign .
The arrangements were quite informal .
The web sites simply matched up interested voters and put them in touch via e-mail .
It was also a system based on trust , since there was no way to tell if the vote swap had actually been carried out .
Voteswap2000.com , the largest of the sites at issue here , signed up 5,041 users in only four days .
On that fourth day , it received a letter from California 's Secretary of State that informed the site operators , " Your web site specifically offers to broker the exchange of votes throughout the United States of America .
This activity is corruption of the voting process in violation of Elections Code sections 18521 and 18522 ... "
The site shut down almost immediately .
But the people behind the vote - swapping web sites then brought suit against California .
If anyone still requires evidence that the legal process can move slowly , consider that this case was filed on November 2 , 2000 .
After some back - and - forth between different levels of the court system , a district court eventually ruled in California 's favor , and the site operators then appealed .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the case , Porter v. Bowen , has just been released , and the court overturned the district court ruling , concluding that then Secretary of State Bill Jones " violated Appellants ' First Amendment rights " and that such vote - swapping mechanisms are constitutionally protected .
The court found that such activities involved the discussion of people 's opinions on political campaigns and on candidates , which are protected by the First Amendment .
Vote - swapping also differs from outright vote buying " which conveys no message other than the parties ' willingness to exchange votes for money . "
Vote - swapping conveys a clear political message about the nature of third - party campaigns in the US winner - take - all electoral system .
Eugene Volokh , commenting on popular legal blog The Volokh Conspiracy , agrees with this analysis .
He points out that people trade " something of value " for votes all the time without those actions becoming illegal , whether it be votes or endorsements .
The point , he says , is that " one ca n't simply equate trading votes for money with trading votes for other votes . "
Given the court 's ruling , it 's quite possible that we will see such sites again during the 2008 election .
Whether they will make any appreciable difference to the outcome remains to be seen .

The Watercone is an ingenious device that can take salty water and turn it into fresh water using only the power of the sun .
The nice thing about this device is it is bone simple , uses the sun instead of fossil fuel , and is cheap to make and easy to use .
The Watercone is surprisingly a cone , that you place over a pan of salty water ( or over a marsh , or any damp ground ) leave it out in the sun , water evaporates , the condensation trickles down the side of the cone , at the end of the day you flip it over , remove the cap at the top and drink the water .
This device has the potential to really do a lot of good for a lot of people .
So many people live in areas where the ground water has been polluted by salt incursion due to over pumping , or in areas that simply do n’t have large fresh water sources ( south pacific islands , sub - Saharan Africa , south - east Asia ) .
The Watercone is made from UV resistant plastic and they claim that it will last up to five years , after which it can be used to collect rainwater and funnel it into bottles .
They claim that on average one Watercone can produce one liter of water per-day .
I could image a whole fleet of these things for a village .
They float , so you could place them over a small pool of salt water and just collect fresh water all day .
At about 20 Euros it would pay for itself in a couple of months and provide potable water for the next 4 - 5 years .
It is also recyclable and non-flammable .
The Watercone website has some really interesting information and I highly recommend checking it out .
A great debate in linguistics is how much language influences thought .
In the world of computer science , I am firm believer in the theory .
Paul Graham , amongst many others , has nicely argued the yes side of the debate .
Many developers start off in statically typed languages like I did .
I learned to program using Pascal , did a bit of Assembly and then settled in with Pascal via Delphi .
The first dynamic language I used was Magik – it was quite a shock .
Since no one has ever heard of Magik , its a proprietary language used in the Smallworld GIS system that is quite similar to Ruby .
Magik had awful tools , no static type checking , no debugger , no GUI building tools , etc .
And no compiler , at least not in the sense I was used to .
First Impressions Can Be Misleading
Needless to say , my first impressions were less than enthusiastic .
Everyone kept telling me the environment was so much more productive , but I did n’t buy it .
I could churn out object pascal almost as fast , and Delphi ’s blazingly fast compiler and great tools made up for any difference .
I suppose people were comparing to C++ , where at the time you might as well have gone off and had several cups of coffee between each edit - compile - test cycle .
Or maybe to toy languages like AML ( another proprietary language from the GIS world ) .
Anyway , for beginners , the environment was just awful .
The library documentation was non-existent – if you wanted to know what a method did , you went and read the source code .
No sir , no fancy online hyper - linked context sensitive help files .
And the final nail in the coffin , the Magik IDE was an albatross called Emacs .
Emacs drove me too such distraction I went off and wrote my own IDE ( sorry , ten years have n’t changed my mind about Emacs , but I sure like VIM ) .
But I was paid to write Magik , so I wrote Magik .
After a rough start , things started looking up a bit .
It sure was nice not worrying about memory allocation and deallocation .
And having an interactive console , where you could poke around inside a running program , that sure was neat .
And then there were the truly weird things – like dynamically loading classes .
Even better , you could replace methods in an existing class by simply redefining them in another file ( we called it reopening classes , the term today is monkey patching ) .
And you could pass functions as parameters via the use of procs which were closures – although I did n’t know that at the time .
Stuck With Complexity
Almost ten years later , I find myself mostly programming in Ruby , Javascript and C .
Yikes , what happened ?
I ’m as surprised as anyone .
My take is that contrary to popular wisdom , a good language gets out of your way and lets you do what you need to .
This is quite counterintuitive .
Computer programs are pinnacles of brittle complexity – one tiny mistake in millions of lines of code brings the whole edifice crashing down .
The natural inclination is to make the walls of that edifice as thick and strong as possible .
Java is a great example of this line of thought , you can see examples of it throughout its design :
Use of static type checking
Polymorphism only through inheritance of classes or interfaces
Final classes
The forced use of exception specifications
The forced handling of exception specifications
Difficulty in modifying code at runtime
Strong encapsulation
Clunky reflection
These things make the language less malleable .
In return , the payoff should be more robust programs .
But do you really get that ?
My experience is no , but I would love to hear about any references to studies or research that can provide a definitive answer either way .
Trusting my experience , I do n’t believe programs written in Java ( or C++ , etc. ) are on average more robust than programs written in Python , Ruby , Smalltalk , Perl , etc .
So what has the loss of malleability cost you ?
Once again , my experience tells me quite a lot .
Given a reasonable sized program , I can guarantee you a few things :
It contains bugs
It ’s used in ways the designers and developers never imagined
It ’s execution environment is constantly changing
If you ’re stuck with a brittle edifice of complexity you do n’t want it to be a fortress complete with ten foot walls and surrounded by a serpent filled moat .
What you want is a building with an open floor pan where you can nudge a wall here , add one there and remove one over there .
In more concrete terms , if code is buggy then you want to be able to write up a patch , throw it in a directory somewhere , and have the application load it automatically replacing the invalid code .
Or closely related , you want to provide a simple mechanism to add in new functionality , just like Selenium does via its user user - extensions .js file .
Maybe you need to graft on a major piece of new functionality , such as adding support for serializing objects to JSON .
One approach is to open up the base Object class and add a new method , toJSON , just as Rails 1.1 did .
Or let ’s say you find yourself typing in the same boilerplate code over and over .
Why not write a method that tells the language to do this for you ?
Ruby and Rails are filled with this type of metaprogramming , just as Magik is and of course the granddaddy of the technique , Lisp .
Soon you ’re on the road to creating your own domain specific languages , one of the hot topics du jour .
Or maybe you need to retrofit Object X so that it can be processed by Method A which expects to be passed an Object A .
For some reason , Object X can not inherit from Object A .
So instead you leverage duck typing to add the needed methods to Object X .
These things are easy to do in some language , hard in others , and impossible in others .
Really , I Know What I ’m Doing
Mastering a skill requires mastering its tools – be it construction , sword fighting , cooking , bike riding , flying , etc .
The techniques above are some of the sharp tools of programming .
You can use them to quickly make mince - meat out of your problem – or , on not so good days , mince meat out of your fingers .
But when you make dinner tonight , I ’m guessing you ’re not reaching for the dullest knife in the drawer .
A.C.L.U. lawyers said they would urge public disclosure of the contents of the documents .
“ We intend to press for release of both of these documents , ” Jameel Jaffer , a lawyer for the group , said in a statement .
“ If President Bush and the Justice Department authorized the C.I.A. to torture prisoners , the public has a right to know . ”
A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to discuss the matter .
The documents had been sought by the A.C.L.U. in a suit filed in a New York federal court under the Freedom of Information Act .
The suit has previously led to the disclosure of thousands of documents from the Pentagon , the F.B.I. , the Justice Department and other agencies .
In the past , C.I.A. lawyers have sought to avoid any discussion of whether the agency had documents related to its interrogation and detention practices , the A.C.L.U. said .
The group added that the agency had said national security would be jeopardized if it were compelled to disclose in any way its involvement in interrogations .
In the C.I.A. letter , Mr. McPherson confirmed the existence of the documents but declined to release them , saying that essentially all of their contents were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act because release would damage national security and violate attorney - client privilege .
“ The documents are withheld in their entirety because there is no meaningful nonexempt information that can be reasonably segregated from the exempt material , ” he wrote .

Parsing C++ ( March 2001 )
Introduction
I recently became interested in parsing C++.
It ’s taken me quite a while to gather together various resources from the web , so I thought I ’d share my findings with the world in the hope that it saves someone else a bit of time .
I strongly recommend getting yourself a copy of The Design and Evolution of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup , creator of C ++.
It ’s an excellent book , and will give you an advanced understanding of why C++ is the way it is .
The best compiler book ( IMHO ) is Andrew Appel ’s Modern Compiler Implementation series .
It ’s much more modern and readable than some of the dated ‘ classic ’ texts .
Note : Since I wrote this , Mike Dimmick posted an overview of his attempt to parse C++ , which is well worth reading .
Also , there ’s a really good page at the VFiasco project .
Background
I ’ve been interested in writing a semi- automated refactoring tool for C++.
When I ’m developing software , I often have a simple refactoring idea , like “ I should rename this class ” , which turns out to be very fiddly and time - consuming to actually make happen .
It would involve renaming all uses of the class , renaming files , updating project files and documentation .
Other refactoring tend to get done by moving code around in a flurry of cut and pasting .
These are all error - prone .
So , I looked for a refactoring tool .
There ’s one for the Smalltalk language called the Refactoring Browser .
There ’s Xref - Speller which extends emacs to allow some refactoring of C , Java and YACC ( along with code completion and browsing ) .
There ’s Source Navigator , which is a source browsing tool not a refactoring tool , but it does generate a useful symbol table .
So , it looks like there is n’t a C++ refactoring tool already out there .
However , applying refactoring transformations is n’t tricky once you can parse the source .
Refactorings are described well in Martin Fowler ’s Refactoring book .
They are also described in a more formal way , useful for implementing them , in William Opdyke ’s PhD thesis .
Donald Robert ’s PhD thesis also covers the Smalltalk Refactoring Browser .
So , if we can parse C++ then refactoring is a Simple Matter Of Programming ( ha ! ) .
Let ’s find out how to parse C++.
( Incidentally , the refactoring tool wo n’t have to deal with some of the issues which make source - to - source transformations tricky - things like preserving comments and indentation structure .
The refactoring tool will internally produce a set of ed- like commands which are then used to patch the original files .
They could also produce the inverse set of commands to allow a refactoring to be undone later .
The refactoring tool need n’t reparse the change files , since it will know what changes have taken place and can update it ’s internal state directly ) .
Parsing C++
For general compiler / parsing information , I ’d recommend reading Andrew Appel ’s Modern Compiler Implementation ( in three different flavours - C , Java and ML .
I got the ML version because it ’s easier to see the wood for the trees in a declarative language ) .
The Dragon Book is the classic compiler reference , but it ’s not the best book in the world .
The first few chapters of the online PCCTS book make for a good introduction to parsing .
Finally , Ian Kaplan has a page which describes various options for writing parser .
The first obvious place to look for C++ parsing is in gcc .
It ’s a C++ compiler , so it must be able to parse C++.
However , it ’s not the best documented code in the world , and the various stages of parsing ( lexical , syntactic and semantic analysis ) are fairly tangled together .
It ’s also written in C , which is not the best language for a large , complicated program .
On the plus side , it definitely parses stuff fine , it ’s got good performance and it generates a symbol table .
Source Navigator operates by parsing the source code and entering a whole load of information into various database tables .
A source browser GUI then accesses these database tables to allow the user to browser the code .
The C++ parser in source navigator is quite scary and not very educational .
A few web searches turned up an YACC - compatible LALR grammar written Jim Roskind which parses an early version of C++ ( before namespaces , exceptions , templates and the bool type were added into the language ) .
This is accompanied by a very useful discussion of the ambiguities in the C++ language , and how various conflicts in the grammar were resolved .
This is just a grammar , and so does n’t build a full symbol table .
It also uses a ‘ hack ’ to help the parsing – enough semantic information is fed back to the lexer to allow the lexer to classify identifiers as either plain identifiers or typedef names , which makes parsing a bit easier at the expense of tangling the implementation a bit .
The next thing I came across was a C++ grammar for ANTLR .
ANTLR is a parser generator which works on predicated LL ( k ) grammars .
A predicated LL( k ) grammar differs from an LL ( 1 ) grammar in the following respects .
Firstly , it uses k symbols of lookahead .
Theoretically , this would make the parser much slower , but in practise it does n’t slow things down much .
Secondly , the choice of which production to use can be based on the next k terminals , and additionally , some syntactic predicate and / or a semantic predicate ( such as ‘ lookup the identifier in the symbol table and if it ’s a type then use this production ’ ) .
John Lilley ’s C++ grammar for ANTLR ( actually , a modified version of ANTLR ) supports all C++ features except namespaces .
It builds a symbol table as it parses , but it does n’t output an AST .
It ’s quite cleanly written , and the supporting code is readily understandable .
However , the grammar is n’t particularly understandable - particularly when ambiguities are resolved by fiddling around with the grammar .
( Along the way , I came across the paper “ A Modest Proposal : C++ Resyntaxed ” which proposed a different syntax for C ++.
It still expresses the same language ( ie. there ’s a 1 - 1 correspondance between traditional C++ source code and source code using the suggested syntax ) , but it ’s much much easier to parse .
For example , C declarations mimic their use ( “ int a ; ” is a declaration and the type of the expression “ a ” is int ) but this makes it hard for a parser to decide whether a sequence of tokens is a declaration or an expression .
The proposed syntax avoids this problem by adding the new ‘ type ’ keyword to all declarations , and having an entirely new way of describing types .
Somewhere in a parallel universe , all C++ is written in this way . )
The most useful bit of information which I ’ve found is Edward Willink ’s “ Meta - Compilation for C+ + ”
PhD thesis .
While the main focus is on providing meta-compilation support for C++ , a lot of the thesis concentrates on the difficulty of parsing C++.
Willink creates a useful tool for looking at grammars by extending regular expressions with a functional operator which allows you to express recursion .
Normally , you describe languages using a context - free grammar written in BNF .
However , it ’s not very easy to glance at a grammar and work out what ’s going on .
It ’s certainly quite difficult to work out if two parts of the grammar can generate identical strings ( which can make parsing difficult if it happens ) .
Using the extended regular expressions you can come up with a concise and easy to read description of parts of the language ( which typically fits on a single line ) which is easy to compare with other parts of the language .
This gives Willink a tool to examine the C++ language to find out which areas are ambiguous .
The other nice bit about this thesis is that it describes a way of parsing C++ which does n’t require the use of semantic information ( symbol tables etc ) in either the lexer or the syntax parsing stage .
All semantic analysis is delayed until a separate phase which is performed on the AST ’s generated by the syntax parsing stage .
This makes for a conceptually tidier implementation .
To do this , Willink does n’t actually parse for C++ in the syntax stage , he parses for a somewhat larger language of which C++ is a subset .
So , the syntactic parsing stage will accept all valid C++ programs , plus some additional programs which are not valid C++.
These ‘ extra ’ programs are easily detected during semantic analysis .
This split has two benefits .
Firstly , the implementation is cleaner since the lexer just lexes , the syntax analysis stage just analyses syntax , and the semantic analysis stage deals with all the semantic issues .
Compare this with gcc , where the lexer gets enough semantic information fed back to it to classify identifiers into seven classes , and where the syntax analysis stage has to therefore gather semantic information to feed back to the lexer .
There ’s a second benefit to delaying all semantic checks until after all parsing has been done - you have more information by this stage and so will be able to give more helpful error messages to the user if the parser encounters a badly formed program .
Finally , I ’ll mention one commercial C++ front end because they appear to be quite friendly towards non-commercial research .
The Edison Design Group sell a C++ front end which generates an intermediate representation , along with optional cross-reference information .
This is used in various research projects , including the Program Database Toolkit project .
I ’ve had a few emails recently asking about parsing C++ , so I thought I ’d update this page rather than repeat myself in private emails .
After lots of investigation , I decided that writing a parser / analysis - tool for C++ is sufficiently difficult that it ’s beyond what I want to do as a hobby .
Additionally , it did n’t feel like a worthwhile task in some respect .
Parsing a language does n’t need to be hard per se .
It ’s just that C++ inherited a whole lot of syntactic issues from C , such as the “ failed experiment ” of deliberately choosing to have declarations of variables look really like usages of these variables ( eg. “ int a [ 10 ] ” is a declaration , and therefore “ a [ 1 ] ” is an int ) .
Dennis Ritchie talks about this in the critique section of his “ History of C ” article , but to be fair to him , hindsight is 20/20 and probably had little idea that his pet project would end up being so successful !
Having said that , syntactic parsing of C++ is n’t particularly difficult .
The above difficulties mean that your C++ parser wo n’t be a shiny perfectly - elegant parser like you see in computer science textbooks , but they do n’t add too much difficulty to the process .
It ’s just a bit fiddly .
In contrast , other languages are dead easy to parse the syntax .
They have LALR ( or similar ) grammars and no fiddly extra cases .
You feed the grammar into yacc / antlr and , hey presto , you have an AST .
This is always present in my mind when think about C++.
It is C++ which make things difficult .
Why not code in another language which is more elegant and easier to parse .
Why struggle with Herculean labours against C++ when it ’s crippled by not being easily machine - processable .
We ’re programmers !
We write programs to do things for us !
If C++ itself is n’t amenable to being manipulated by programs , then why allow it to reside in your toolbox ?
Okay , I know that there are reasons .
For most of the last six years , I ’ve spent every weekday working on large C++ applications .
I would love automated tools to analyze and refactor my applications .
There are clearly lots of pragmatic reasons ( not to mention financial ones ! ) why being able to parse C++ is a good idea .
But do I want to spend years picking over tiny details in order to write a parser ?
The world will move on , and C++ will be a footnote in history .
There are some “ real ” problems out there in the field of programming languages , and these problems are much more attractive to me .
Back to the subject .
Parsing the syntax of C++ is the easy part of the problem .
Once you have an abstract syntax tree , you need to do semantic analysis to figure out which functions are being called and which variables are being referenced at each point in your program .
A call to “ foo ” somewhere in the application could refer to a top - level function called “ foo ” , or a method within the current class , or one of its ( possibly multiple ) base classes .
There could be several overloaded versions of “ foo ” with different argument types , possibly with some default parameters , in each of these places .
There may be some other “ foo ” ’s available which take arguments which are subtypes of the supplied arguments .
And on top of that , C++ allows implicit coercion between types , so the types of the arguments could get totally changed .
Your semantic analysis stage has to codify all of these rules , in the right order .
These rules are stated in the C++ language spec using English .
English is n’t a great language for being precise in .
Again , other language choose a different route .
Denotational semantics are a way of formally defining the meaning of a programming language .
They ’re not as easy to read as an English description , but they do give a formal unambiguous description of the language , which is very very useful when you ’re writing or testing a compiler .
Again , this is me writing with the benefit of hindsight .
Dennis Ritchie probably did n’t anticipate that his useful little language would be held up to such high standards .
But that ’s kind of my point .
A language written in the 70’s is bound to have flaws , when perceived from 2005 .
We ’re tried out lots of stuff in the intervening years , and we know more .
A car build in the 70’s might have a certain charm , but it ’s not going to be as fast / efficient / good as one built now .
Enough rambling .
I spent quite a lot of time looking at parsing C++ and decided , for mostly ideological reasons , that it was n’t the kind of problem that I wanted to spend ( potentially ) years of my life working on .
However , before I stopped I did contact EDG , who are a small commercial company who do nothing but sell language front - ends , mostly to the big players like Intel .
These guys have spent years writing these front - ends , poring over the standard documents and even making them work with vendor - specific language extensions .
The front end does parsing and syntax analysis .
They ’ve done all the hard work , so you do n’t have to .
They have created something with great value , and quite reasonably charge money for it .
Unfortunately , they want a one - off lump sum upfront for commercial users of their parser , rather than per-sale royalties .
And obviously , it would n’t be much use for an open source project .
However , Xref - tech clearly had the same idea around the same time .
They ’ve bought in the EDG frontend and are using it to extend their C refactoring tool so that it supports C++. I admire them for going the EDG route .
Parsing C++ is not an exciting problem .
EDG have done it already .
So buy EDG ’s product .
The end .
Open -source ?
Well , the EDG option is n’t available to you .
Richard Stallman would argue that the EDG option is bad , because we can’t read their source code and learn from it .
Well , I think you probably do n’t want to read their source code .
It ’s going to be full of special cases and warts , all of which are caused by the C++ language design itself .
It ’s not interesting code solving a Real problem , it ’s mostly noise .
If you want to read source code , pick something which solves an interesting problem and read that .
Unlike on commercial projects , where management and existing culture often impose a choice of tools and language on the development team , an open - source project has a free choice of language .
If you ’re working on stuff in your free time , why endure the pain of C++ and the lack of good tools ?
You wo n’t lie on your deathbed wishing that you ’d spent more time tracking down dangling pointer errors .
There are lots of other languages out there which are more fun to use and much easier to parse .
When I was younger , I used to enjoy all the little details of C ++.
It felt like useful knowledge , and to a certain extent it was , in that it lead to jobs .
But when I ’m programming for fun , I ’m not interested in the programming language .
It ’s a means to an end .
For me , the difficulty of parsing C++ is yet another nail in the coffin for a flawed language .
I choose to use other languages for my “ fun programming ” now .
But , having said all that , on Monday morning I ’ll be sitting on front of a 200 ( or so ) KLOC C++ application , cursing the historical accidents which lead to the popularity of such a hard - to - parse language .
So , please ignore all my above criticisms of the language and , if you are brave and persistent enough to write an open - source C++ parser and semantic analyzer , then I commend you !
The other interesting route is the Harmonia project .
They are actually solving a much harder problem - incremental parsing and semantic analysis of several languages .
But they do advertise that they ’ll support C++ Real Soon Now .
They presumably are n’t buying in EDG ’s frontend , since I do n’t think it ’ll meet their “ incremental ” criteria .
Their parser is a GLR parser ( yay , sensible choice !
Yacc is a historical artifact !
Let ’s move out of the 70’s ) .
However , they still have to solve the semantic side of the coin .
I ’ll be interested to see how they manage that .
If you are thinking of writing a C++ parser yourself , then use a GLR parser generator such as Elkhound and you ’ll save yourself lots of hassle .
The guy who wrote Elkhound is also writing a C++ parser ( including semantic analysis ) called Elsa , which can parse everything except STL headers it seems .
If you ’re interested in C++ parsing , it ’d be good to have a long look at this project .
Neanderthals died out about 29,000 years ago
Geneticist Svante Paabo and his team say they isolated the long segments of genetic material from a 45,000 - year - old Neanderthal fossil from Croatia .
The work should reveal how closely related the Neanderthal species was to modern humans , Homo sapiens .
Details were presented at a conference at New York 's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and reported by News@Nature .
It is a significant advance on previous research that has extracted mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) from Neanderthal ( Homo neanderthalensis ) specimens .
This genetic material is contained in structures that power cells ; and although the information it holds is very useful , it is more limited in scope than the DNA bundled up at the cell 's centre .
This nuclear DNA is what really drives an organism 's biochemistry .
Divergent code
So far , Paabo and colleagues have managed to sequence around a million base - pairs , which comprises 0.03 % of the Neanderthal 's entire DNA " catalogue " , or genome .
Base - pairs are the simplest bonded chemical units which hold together the DNA double helix .
The genetic material comes from a 45,000 - year - old male Neanderthal specimen found in Vindija Cave outside Zagreb , the News@Nature website reports .
DNA IN H. SAPIENS
The double - stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical components called bases Adenine ( A ) bonds with thymine ( T ) ; cytosine ( C ) bonds with guanine ( G ) Groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; there are about 2.9 billion base - pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes Written in the DNA are about 20 - 25,000 genes which human cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies
This might suggest that little interbreeding occurred between our own species and the Neanderthals .
Usually , DNA must be cloned in bacteria to produce large enough amounts to study .
But Professor Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and his team have used a novel sequencing method to decode the genetic material .
This involves using tiny wells to directly sequence DNA fragments in an emulsion .
However , the researcher is also working to extract and read Neanderthal DNA by the traditional method .
About 75,000 base - pairs have been sequenced this way so far .
They show that Neanderthals diverged from the evolutionary line that led to modern humans about 315,000 years ago .
Neanderthals lived across Europe and parts of west and central Asia from approximately 230,000 to 29,000 years ago .
It is unclear what factors led to their demise , but climate change and competition from modern humans may have played a role .
Besides defending quantum computing day and night , having drinks with Cosmic Variance ‘s Sean Carroll , and being taken out to dinner at lots of restaurants with tablecloths , the other highlight of my job interview tour was meeting a friendly , interesting , articulate divinity student on the flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia , who tried to save my soul from damnation .
Here ’s how it happened : the student ( call him Kurt ) was reading a Christian theological tract , while I , sitting next to him , was reading Russell on Religion .
( This is true . )
I sheepishly covered the spine of my book , trying to delay the inevitable conversation — but it finally happened , when Kurt asked me how I was liking ole ’
Bert .
I said I was liking him just fine , thank you very much .
Kurt then made some comment about the inadequacy of a materialistic worldview , and how , without God as the basis of morality , the whole planet would degenerate into what we saw at Virginia Tech .
I replied that the prevention of suffering seemed like a pretty good basis for morality to me .
“ Oh ! ” said Kurt .
“ So then suffering is bad .
How do you know it ’s bad ? ”
“ How do you know it ’s bad ? ”
“ Because I believe the word of God . ”
“ So if God said that suffering was good , that would make it good ? ”
I ca n’t remember Kurt ’s response , but I ’m sure it was eloquent and well - practiced — nothing I said really tripped him up , nor did I expect it to .
Wanting to change the subject , I asked him about his family , his studies , his job , what he ’d been doing in the vipers ’ den of San Francisco , etc .
I told him a little about quantum computing and my job search .
I mused that , different though we were , we both valued something in life more than money , and that alone probably set us apart from most people on the plane .
Kurt said it was fitting that I ’d gone to grad school at Berkeley .
I replied that , as a mere Democrat , I was one of the most conservative people there .
Finally I blurted out the question I really wanted to ask .
In his gentle , compassionate , way , Kurt made it clear to me that yes , I was going to roast in hell , and yes , I ’d still roast in hell even if I returned to the religion of my ancestors ( that , of course , being at best a beta version of the true religion ) .
In response , I told Kurt that when I read Dante ’s Inferno in freshman English , I decided that the place in the afterlife I really wanted to go was the topmost layer of hell : the place where Dante put the “ righteous unbaptized ” such as Euclid , Plato , and Aristotle .
There , these pre-Christian luminaries could carry on an eternal intellectual conversation — cut off from God ’s love to be sure , but also safe from the flames and pitchforks .
How could angels and harps possibly compete with infinite tenure at Righteous Unbaptized University ?
If God wanted to lure me away from that , He ’d probably have to throw in the Islamic martyr package .
San Francisco to Philadelphia is a five - hour flight , and the conversation ranged over everything you might expect : the age of the earth ( Kurt was undecided but leaning toward 6,000 years ) , whether the universe needs a reason for its existence external to itself , etc .
With every issue , I resolved not to use the strongest arguments at my disposal , since I was more interested in understanding my adversary ’s reasoning process — and ideally , in getting him to notice inconsistencies within his own frame of reference .
Alas , in that I was to be mostly disappointed .
Here ’s an example .
I got Kurt to admit that certain Bible passages — in particular , the ones about whipping your slaves — reflected a faulty , limited understanding of God ’s will , and could only be understood in the historical context in which they were written .
I then asked him how he knew that other passages — for example , the ones condemning homosexuality — did n’t also reflect a limited understanding of God ’s will .
He replied that , in the case of homosexuality , he did n’t need the Bible to tell him it was immoral : he knew it was immoral because it contradicted human beings ’ biological nature , gay couples being unable to procreate .
I then asked whether he thought that infertile straight couples should similarly be banned from getting married .
Of course not , he replied , since marriage is about more than procreation — it ’s also about love , bonding , and so on .
I then pointed out that gay and lesbian couples also experience love and bonding .
Kurt agreed that this was true , but then said the reason homosexuality was wrong went back to the Bible .
What fascinated me was that , with every single issue we discussed , we went around in a similar circle — and Kurt did n’t seem to see any problem with this , just so long as the number of 2SAT clauses that he had to resolve to get a contradiction was large enough .
In the study of rationality , there ’s a well - known party game : the one where everyone throws a number from 0 to 100 into a hat , and that player wins whose number was closest to two - thirds of the average of everyone ’s numbers .
It ’s easy to see that the only Nash equilibrium of this game — that is , the only possible outcome if everyone is rational , knows that everyone is rational , knows everyone knows everyone is rational , etc. — is for everyone to throw in 0 .
Why ?
For simplicity , consider the case of two people : one can show that I should throw in 1 / 2 of what I think your number will be , which is 1 / 2 of what you think my number will be , and so on ad infinitum until we reason ourselves down to 0 .
On the other hand , how should you play if you actually want to win this game ?
The answer , apparently , is that you should throw in about 20 .
Most people , when faced with a long chain of logical inferences , will follow the chain for one or two steps and then stop .
And , here as elsewhere in life , “ being rational ” is just a question of adjusting yourself to everyone else ’s irrationalities .
“ Two - thirds of 50 is 33 , and two - thirds of that is 22 , and … OK , good enough for me ! ”
I ’ve heard it said that the creationists are actually perfectly rational Bayesians ; they just have prior probabilities that the scientifically - minded see as perverse .
Inspired by conversations with Kurt and others , I hereby wish to propose a different theory of fundamentalist psychology .
My theory is this : fundamentalists use a system of logical inference wherein you only have to apply the inference rules two or three times before you stop .
( The exact number of inferences can vary , depending on how much you like the conclusion . )
Furthermore , this system of “ bounded inference ” is actually the natural one from an evolutionary standpoint .
It ’s we — the scientists , mathematicians , and other nerdly folk — who insist on a bizzarre , unnatural system of inference , one where you have to keep turning the modus ponens crank whether you like where it ’s taking you or not .
Kurt , who looked only slightly older than I am , is already married with two kids , and presumably more on the way .
In strict Darwinian terms , he ’s clearly been more successful than I ’ve been .
Are those of us who can live with A→B or B→C or C→not ( A ) but not all of them at once simply evolutionary oddities , like people who have twelve fingers or ca n’t stand sunlight ?
Most free X. Org graphic drivers are based on Mesa , which is a free OpenGL specification implementation .
However , while OpenGL is already in Version 2.1 the Mesa implementation only supports version 1.5 .
This is to change soon – but OpenGL will make new releases as well .
Graphics in Linux has several problems and issues : first of all there is only Intel providing real free graphics drivers – but Intel does not build high - end graphics hardware .
Second , Microsoft did its usual monopoly homework , and everyone talks about DirectX 10 – it becomes harder to port graphics apps between Windows and Linux because on Windows you most certainly want to use DirectX .
Third there is OpenGL itself : the development stagnated for quite some time and the current OpenGL API does not support all the new cool hardware things out there .
Fourth , and that is something I realized just few hours ago , the OpenGL implementation for Linux , Mesa , does only provide an OpenGL implementation for Version 1.5 – although OpenGL 2.0 was introduced almost three years ago .
The first problem might see changes in the future : Nvidia always provided advanced graphics drivers for the Linux community , and AMD at least said it would like to solve issues somehow .
The second problem is more difficult : it depends on how well OpenGL evolves in the future .
If the API is well implemented with Windows and if there are impressive features and such things available which are appealing to developers on the Windows platform these might prefer OpenGL again instead of DirectX .
But to achieve that goal the OpenGL people really have to do their homework .
This is somehow related to the third problem : OpenGL itself .
Version 2.0 was released in autumn 2004 , version 2.1 was released last year .
This year we will see two releases at once : one release in the 2.x branch – and a 3.0 release .
First one that is coming out soon is Longs Peak ( OpenGL 2.x ) , which is a major clean - up of the code after almost a decade and a half of nothing else but stacking numerous extensions together .
This API is supposed to arrive in summer timeframe , most probably July .
Approximately three months after that , Mount Evans ( OpenGL 3.0 ) will run specifically on hardware born after November 8th , 2006 .
You ’ve guessed it correctly , we are talking about DirectX 10 - class hardware , bringing all the features of unified 3D architecture to the world of OpenGL .
This means that OpenGL will get all cool features as well – eventually .
I hope that this move is not too late , and I really hope that this will bring more people to use OpenGL again .
This is crucial as soon as it comes to porting applications to Linux or any other operating system .
But to use all these cool features there must be drivers available who actually implement these features .
Nvidia and ATI / AMD provide Linux drivers ( and Windows drivers of course ) implementing OpenGL in version 2.1 ( Nvidia ) or 2.0 ( ATI / AMD ) .
However , the free implementation of OpenGL , Mesa 3D is only at version 1.5 – which was released 4 (! ) years ago .
This is depressing somehow
However , the current development version of Mesa , version 6.5.3 is in a good state and a new version , v7.0 featuring OpenGL 2.0/2.1 support is expected soon :
Mesa 7.0 is expected to follow shortly .
Shortly can be anything , but to me it sounds like we see OpenGL support this summer .
The question is afterwards : how fast will the drivers pick up the implemented support for the new API ?
I can only hope that they are already targeting at the new Mesa release .
And there is another question : how ling will it take to take on with the next OpenGL releases ?
4 years are just too much time for the fast developing graphics market .
But having a look at the Mesa news it looks more like that the main development was done in recent months , meaning that the development sped up , compared to the time before .
This would mean that there is now an active development community behind Mesa .
And if that is true chances are that we will see OpenGL 2.x and 3.x support soon in Mesa .
In any case , the new Mesa will be released soon .
And since it will be the first main release after 3 years we can expect a lot of news overage , maybe even an interview or two and quite some information about the road map of Mesa and even OpenGL .
I just hope Mesa will update their homepage till then , it looks horrible at the moment 😉
WHEN rancher Dean Baker and his three grown sons gathered for their regular 6:30 a.m. coffee klatch a few years ago , the topic went beyond the usual cow - calf talk .
Should they fight or sell out ?
Three hundred miles to the south , Las Vegas ’ determined water czar , Pat Mulroy , was laying ambitious plans to pump rural Nevada groundwater to her booming city of dancing casino fountains and new housing tracts .
One branch of the $ 2 - billion - plus pipeline project would reach into the high desert valley straddling the Utah border where the Baker family has ranched for half a century .
As Baker remembers the family meeting , it did n’t last long .
“ It was unanimous , without any question . ”
They would fight .

Battles over water in the West are always about something more .
At their most elemental , they are about survival .
As Baker sees it , the Nevada water war threatens to reprise the unhappy scene in California ’s Owens Valley , which dried up decades ago after Los Angeles drained it .
And , like L.A. 's legendary water engineer , William Mulholland , Mulroy sees the distant water as the key to her city ’s future .
The struggle pits a neon - lighted big city against scrub - crusted cattle country , a tart - tongued immigrant against a slow - talking third - generation rancher , a vision of the New West against the values of the old .
MULROY is one of Nevada ’s most powerful public officials , a Democrat who is periodically mentioned as a potential gubernatorial candidate .
She is on a mission to make up for the historic slight her adopted state suffered when Colorado River flows were split among the seven basin states in the 1920s .
At the time , Las Vegas was little more than a dusty railroad stop , so Nevada received the smallest river share in the lower basin .
It is on that comparatively meager portion that the Las Vegas Valley relies for 90 % of its water .

“ The Nevada state engineer had no vision , ” Mulroy says , bristling at the long - ago snub .
“ And we ’re just going to accept that as our manifest destiny in a state where we ’re the economic hub ? ”
She leans forward in a big office chair , carefully made up and clad in a sharply tailored pantsuit .
She is intense and emphatic .
Her tone provides a glimpse of the tough , smart water boss known for blunt negotiating tactics .
After she became general manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District , Mulroy consolidated her power in 1991 by persuading local water agencies to stop competing against one another and form a strong regional entity , the Southern Nevada Water Authority , which she has since also headed .
She found a powerful ally in Nevada ’s Democratic Sen.
Harry Reid , now majority leader , who included a free right - of - way for the pipeline in a public lands bill .
Last year , not long before the Nevada state engineer held hearings on part of the groundwater proposal , Mulroy warned that if he did n’t approve the pumping , growth in the Las Vegas Valley would grind to a halt within a decade .

She pointedly noted in a newspaper interview that the “ governor can remove the state engineer and appoint a new one , ” a comment she later insisted had been taken out of context and was not the threat it appeared to be .
Colorado River politics have been compared to those of the Middle East , but without the guns -- an analogy that partly explains Mulroy ’s long staying power .
Her youthful ambition was to work for the U.S. State Department .
She grew up in Germany , the daughter of an American father who was a personnel officer for the U.S. military and a German mother who survived three Allied bombing raids and went on to do housekeeping and translation for American generals .
Her father was a stickler for language -- she speaks without a trace of an accent -- and Mulroy always wanted to live in the U.S.
She got her chance when a University of Nevada - Las Vegas dean who knew her program head at the University of Munich offered her a senior scholarship and a teaching assistantship to pursue a master ’s in German literature .

“ That was my ticket , ” she says .
“ So I packed up all my belongings , and on Aug. 24 , 1974 , I landed at McCarran International Airport . ”
She arrived at night , checked into a motel and encountered her first round bed and mirrored ceiling .
The next morning she peered out the window , expecting Sahara - like sand dunes .
Instead she found herself in the land of kitsch .
“ I was in shock .
The whole thing was like an out - of - body experience . ”
Except for a brief doctoral stint at Stanford cut short by financial pressures , she has stayed in Las Vegas , first working for Clark County government and then the Las Vegas Valley Water District .
She married a native Nevadan , with whom she has two college - age children .

“ It just became home , ” says Mulroy , 54 .
“ I had grown to appreciate its quirkiness and how different it is . ”
Las Vegas receives an average of 4 inches of rain annually , making it the driest metropolitan area in the country .
But rather than embrace the desert , the city famously lured visitors and residents with a fantasy land of golf courses , casino fountains and sprawling pool complexes .
In the early 1990s , Mulroy defiantly proclaimed that as long as farmers continued to pour water on cotton fields in the desert , there was no reason for Las Vegans to give up their pools and lawns .
She has since mellowed on that point .
“ I ’ve learned a lot , ” she says .
“ If you do n’t learn something in 13 years , God help you . ”

Though she defends the casinos ’ showy water use as vital to the Strip ’s economy , her agency now has one of the country ’s most aggressive outdoor water conservation programs .
It pays homeowners and businesses to rip out lawns and replace them with xeriscaping , reducing water consumption even as Clark County ’s population -- now at almost 1.9 million -- continues its dizzying climb .
Mulroy admonishes that “ how we live in the desert has to change dramatically ” and shows off a state - of - the - art community complex the Southern Nevada Water Authority is building to promote water - thrifty ways .
But she insists conservation alone wo n’t sustain Las Vegas ’ growth .
And an ongoing drought in the Colorado basin undermined her plans to acquire surplus river water in the coming years .
So she returned to a groundwater plan shelved in the early 1990s amid statewide protests .
The pared - down project would take water from Snake Valley in White Pine County and six other basins along a 300 - hundred - mile line running north of Las Vegas .
Advertisement
The project is under review by the state engineer , who has yet to hold hearings on Snake Valley , where Baker lives , but is expected to decide soon on a neighboring basin .
Comparisons to Los Angeles ’ water grab in the Eastern Sierra incense Mulroy , whose agency has bought full - page ads in White Pine County newspapers , assuring locals they are protected by environmental laws .
She has repeatedly promised to adjust the pumping if it starts to affect local supplies .
But even if she wins , Mulroy does n’t see the rural groundwater slaking Las Vegas ’ thirst .
Eventually , she says -- and she concedes it may take decades of political wrangling -- Las Vegas will pay for ocean desalination plants on the California or Mexican coasts and exchange that water for a larger share of the Colorado River .

BAKER can’t imagine why anyone would want to live in Las Vegas -- or any city , for that matter .
“ I think it ’s sad -- the population , the lack of open space , ” he says .
Baker once stood toe - to - toe with Mulroy , arguing in a blistering Las Vegas parking lot .
“ She has a little bit of a reputation for letting her mouth run away with her , ” he says archly .
He worries about her political influence and does n’t think she can keep her promises .
Still , he says , “ I get madder at the attitude of Las Vegas .
They think they have a right to whatever Nevada has . ”
He is 67 , a four - times - married Republican whose fashion sense runs to out - of - style aviator glasses and plaid shirts .

His family ’s 12,000 - acre cattle operation is worth a fortune -- a broker recently offered him $ 20 million on behalf of a real estate investor .
But his house , decorated with an “ Enjoy Beef for Health ” sign , is the size of a Brentwood garage and located behind a gas station .
“ It ’s a matter of values , ” Baker says .
“ As long as I ’m warm and well - fed , personal things do n’t count ....
If it was just about money , we ’d just sell to the Southern Nevada Water Authority . ”
His farmer grandparents settled in Delta , Utah , 100 miles to the east , nearly a century ago .
In the 1950s , his father started working on an alfalfa seed ranch in Baker -- a speck of a town that just happened to share their name -- and later bought the operation .
The family acquired more acreage and is now the biggest private landowner in Snake Valley -- which , like the rest of Nevada , is mostly owned by the federal government .
In college , Baker dabbled in premed and civil engineering and wound up with a business degree from the University of Utah .
But by his second year , he knew he wanted to return to the ranch .

Baker and his sons -- he also has an attorney daughter who lives in Palo Alto -- irrigate 5,000 acres of feed crops and pasture , sell hay to Las Vegas horse owners and California dairies and run 2,000 cows with their calves on federal scrubland and irrigated meadows .
The county gets only about 9 inches of rain a year .
Baker ’s water comes from streams and wells fed by mountain snowmelt and underground aquifers , including an ancient one underlying much of the Great Basin in Nevada and western Utah .
Baker knows from local experience the harm groundwater pumping can do .
“ This trough was always full , ” he says , tramping over a light winter snow to an old livestock watering area at Needle Point Spring , just over the state line in Utah .
Advertisement
Ever since 1939 , when the Civilian Conservation Corps developed the spring from a seep , Needle Point reliably filled a beat - up trough and an adjacent pond frequented by livestock and wild horses .
Then one summer day in 2001 , Baker got a call from federal land managers : A dozen wild horses had died of thirst nearby .
The spring level had dropped a couple of feet , just enough to stop the flow of water .
The likely cause , a federal scientist concluded , was another rancher ’s increased pumping to irrigate fields a mile away .
“ This is clear documentation of what pumping does to a well , ” Baker says , brandishing a paper with a graph line that traces Needle Point ’s decline .
“ There ’s not enough water to do what they want to do . ”
Advertisement
In neighboring Spring Valley , ranchers have reaped millions selling their land and water rights to Mulroy ’s agency .
The county to the south , Lincoln , cut a water deal with her .
But in Snake Valley , where greasewood flats stretch up to a namesake mountain range studded with juniper and pinyon pine , and where cattle outnumber people , the Bakers and their neighbors have dug in their booted heels .
They are a contrary bunch : longtime ranchers , the occasional polygamist family , a small Christian community that runs a dairy and liberal Democrats attracted by the place ’s lean beauty .
“ To have it sucked dry and basically destroyed , for what ?
It ’s not a good trade - off -- more Las Vegas and less space , ” says Jo Anne Garrett , 82 , who moved here from California more than three decades ago and built a glass - and - timber house in the shadow of 13,000 - foot Wheeler Peak .
Advertisement
Two years ago , voters in the 9,500 - resident county -- the entire population could fit into the Strip ’s MGM Grand Hotel -- ousted two commissioners for being too willing to deal with Las Vegas .
In local parades , pumping foes tow a flatbed trailer with a huge water bucket painted with the warning : “ Keep your pipes out of our aquifer . ”
The rest of the time , the bucket is parked in front of the Border Inn , a combination motel / convenience store / bar / gas station / cafe run by one of Baker ’s ex-wives .
With a glint of pride , Baker relates how a water official allied with Mulroy expressed frustration at his continued lack of interest in a deal .
“ I thought you were just negotiating , ” the man told him .
“ I do n’t know what ’s wrong with you . ”

University of Utah physicist Orest Symko demonstrates how heat can be converted into sound by using a blowtorch to heat a metallic screen inside a plastic tube , which then produces a loud tone , similar to when air is blown into a flute .
Physicists have developed a way to turn heat into sound and then electricity , suggesting a new way to effectively recycle waste energy .
“ We are converting waste heat to electricity in an efficient , simple way by using sound , ” said the scientist who led the effort , Orest Symko of the University of Utah .
“ It is a new source of renewable energy from waste heat . ”
Symko ’s recycling devices are cylinder - shaped “ resonators ” that fit in the palm of your hand .
Each cylinder contains a stack of material with a large surface area — such as metal or plastic plates , or fibers made of glass , cotton or steel wool — placed between cold and hot heat exchangers .
When heat is applied , the heat builds to a particular threshold where hot , moving air produces sound at a single frequency — like air blown into a flute .
“ You have heat , which is so disorderly and chaotic , and all of a sudden you have sound coming out at one frequency , ” Symko said .
The sound waves then squeeze what is called a piezoelectric device ( “ piezo ” means pressure or squeezing ) .
The pressure created produces an electric voltage .
Symko says it is similar to when you hit your " funnybone " or the nerve on outside of your elbow , thereby generating that weird , painful pinch , which is actually an electrical nerve impulse .
Symko plans to test the devices within a year at a military radar facility and the University of Utah ’s hot - water - generating plant .
( The U.S. Army funded the study in hopes the technology can be used to create a portable source of energy . )
Symko expects these devices could be used within two years as an alternative to the photovoltaic cells that currently convert sunlight into electricity , and could also provide a new way to cool laptops and other computers , and a to generate electricity from the heat released by nuclear power plant cooling towers .

What color is the cosmos ?
Planets , nebulae , and galaxies appear wan and faint when eyed through a backyard telescope .
But researchers using imaging techniques show us a much more chromatic view .
That 's right , the colors in many familiar photographs of the cosmos are fake .
For more than 20 years , space agencies have embellished images of the heavens .
Some of the images have to be enhanced : Photos assembled from wavelengths beyond the eye 's perception have no color , so researchers paint them any way they choose .
Venus , for example , has invisible cloud patterns that show up in infrared photos ; NASA depicts them in orange and blue .
Similarly , X - ray detectors reveal invisible galactic structures .
Researchers color - code these features according to wavelength or temperature .
Courtesy Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen ( ASU ) and NASA
False color , for the sake of drama , got a lot of reinforcement when the giant outer planets were photographed during the Voyager mission in the late 1970s and 1980s .
Researchers intensified color and contrast to maximize detail , and the media fell in love with the brilliant images .
When Voyager 2 reached Neptune in 1989 , the previously pale planet was promoted to sky blue with red tinges .
Uranus was -- and still is -- presented as lime green .
No scientific principles justify these embellishments ; Uranus is featureless .
Without detail to enhance , the planet needed a rich new color to get the attention of the press .
Likewise , Mars has been painted circus red instead of pale pumpkin .
And Jupiter 's yellow - white bands and light pink Red Spot have been tweaked to orange and candy - apple red .
Colorization is not confined to images from deep - space probes .
Consider the celebrated 1995 Hubble photo , dubbed Pillars of Creation , by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen of Arizona State University .
This vivid image of the Eagle nebula 's spirelike columns has graced the covers of astronomy magazines and has been made into a hit poster .
Through amateur telescopes these faint gas clouds appear gray and unexciting .
Larger instruments sometimes show such nebulae as pale green because the retina responds to that tint in dim light .
By contrast , photography brings out a dominant red emitted by the Eagle 's hydrogen atoms .
The universe is well stocked with these lovely cherry - red nebulae , thanks to hydrogen 's omnipresence .
But such unvarying red can become tiresome after the first few thousand light - years of cosmic inventory .
To avoid such monochromaticity , astronomers took separate pictures of the Eagle through different filters .
Coloring each image with brilliant tints and bleeding them together yielded the spectacular hues of the Pillars of Creation .
Hester says his celebrated Hubble picture was merely intended to bring out scientific detail .
The real Eagle nebula , he surmises , would look ghostly faint with pale , feeble colors .
He calls his work an " artistic rendering of what the scientist sees . "
Such artistic license is so commonplace that the presented universe bears little resemblance to the real thing .
Instead , we have a cosmos in designer colors .

This essay is for people who , in web years , are older than dirt .
More specifically , if there was a period of time in which you programmed in a language which did not have garbage collection , then I mean you .
For most people these days , that means that you had some experience with a language named C .
It is a pretty safe bet that — despite your deep technical background — you find that you have some genetic defect that makes it completely impossible for you to understand articles with titles like Continuations Made Simple and Illustrated .
And for some reason , that bothers you .
If so , then maybe this article is for you .
Think of yourself as a frog .
Prepare to be boiled .
Local Variables
Let me start with something far , far , away from continuations .
Something that you should be comfortable with .
It should bring back memories of battles you heroically fought , and mostly won , long ago .
This example is in C :
#include < stdio.h > int* f( int n ) { int result = n + 1 ; return &result ; } main ( ) { int * n1 = f ( 1 ) ; int * n2 = f ( 2 ) ; printf ( " %d
" , * n1 ) ; }
OK , now let ’s walk through this program .
First a function named f is defined .
It takes in one argument , an integer named n .
It adds one to that value , and stores the result in a local variable named result .
Finally , f returns the address of result .
At this point , any self respecting compiler should issue a warning .
In fact , gcc does exactly that :
test.c :
In function 'f ' : test .c:5 : warning : function returns address of local variable
The problem is that local variables are stored on the stack .
And when f returns , it pops the stack , making this memory available for other uses .
In this program , main calls f twice .
Once with a value of 1 and once with a value of 2 .
Quite likely , the second call will use the exact same storage layout as the first call , meaning that the first result will be overlaid .
In fact , on my machine , this is exactly what happens .
When I compile and run this example , I get the following result :
3
If you now look around , you will notice that all the tadpoles that never really programmed in C have jumped out of the pond .
ByValue vs ByReference
The above example could be fixed by using malloc .
Of course , this would introduce a leak , so calls to free would also have to be added .
Are n’t you glad that you are now programming in a language with garbage collection ?
Even so , there still are quirks that will snare the unsuspecting programmer .
For this pair of examples , I will use JavaScript .
If you like , you can run these in your favorite web browser .
< script > var v = 5 ; function f() { v = v + 1 ; return v ; } var x = f( ) ; x = x - 2 ; document.write ( f( ) ) ; </ script >
In this script , v starts out at 5 .
Function f is called , and v gets incremented , and the result gets returned and stored in a variable named x .
That variable is then decremented by two .
Then f is called again , v get incremented again , and the result is printed .
When I run this I get
7
Now , lets change this example slightly .
< script > var v = [ 5 ] ; function f ( ) { v [ 0 ] = v [ 0 ] + 1 ; return v ; } var x = f ( ) ; x [ 0 ] = x [ 0 ] - 2 ; document.write(f ( ) [ 0 ] ) ; </ script >
The only difference between this script and the first script is that v is an array of length one .
However , this difference is significant , because arrays are allocated on the heap , so v is really just a reference to the array .
And after the first call , x is a reference to the same array , so when the value at index 0 is decremented by two , this affects the value referenced by v .
Sure enough , when I run the new script , I get
5
Inconsistent ?
Yes .
Strange ?
Yes .
But generally , this does n’t cause too much problems .
In any case , you avoid SEGVs as things allocated on the heap never go out of scope .
They simply become eligible to be reclaimed when there is nothing left which references them .
If you are still with me , you do n’t realize it yet , but you are about to become dinner .
Frames
Let ’s recap .
While a stack can be seen as a consecutive sequence of bytes , in most languages there are either conventions ( which are not enforced ) or policies ( which are ) which prevent a function from “ popping ” off more data than they pushed onto the stack .
In other words , each active scope ( e.g. , a function ) is separated from one another much in the same way as the little bars that you put in between groceries on the conveyor belt in line separate each person ’s purchases .
A procedure call pushes the return address ( the address of the instruction after the call instruction ) onto the stack , along with any arguments , and creates a new frame .
A return statement uses this information to set the Instruction Pointer and Stack Pointer back to what it was as the point of call .
Within the procedure , arguments and local variables may be located based on their offset from the start of the stack segment .
Hashes
Everything so far has been very traditional computer science .
Now , let ’s start to diverge from that a bit .
Instead of viewing a stack as a contiguous sequence of bytes , let ’s view a stack as a linked list of frames .
And instead of viewing a frame as a contiguous sequence of bytes , let ’s substitute a dictionary or hashtable .
Now instead of knowing that this data resides at a predetermined offset in the frame , you would look up x simply by looking up “ x ” in the frame ’s hash table .
In case you did n’t notice , this organization of frames is more oriented towards dynamic languages .
callcc
Now , let ’s revisit the notion of a procedure call with this organization of frames .
A procedure call creates a new frame , and stores the current context ( consisting of both the instruction pointer and the stack pointer ) in the new frame .
The syntax for creating a new frame and storing the current context into a global variable named $ cc in Ruby is :
callcc{|$cc|}
The syntax for returning to this exact point , restoring both the instruction pointer and stack pointer , is :
$ cc.call
This is naturally called a continuation , as you are continuing where you left off .
At this point , you are probably feeling a little bit disoriented .
But go back and reread the above few paragraphs and examples .
Other than the last examples being in a foreign language , all the words make sense .
You are probably wondering “ is that all there is ? ” and “ what ’s the big deal ? ” .
If so , the answers are “ pretty much yes ” , and “ read on ” .
One thing to note here is that as long as $ cc retains its current value , the stack frame it refers to can not be reclaimed by garbage collection .
Frames themselves are not automatically freed upon encountering return statements ; instead they are subject to garbage collection .
Simply by “ continuing ” at a prior point in the execution , and creating a new continuation , call “ stacks ” become arbitrary trees .
Generators
At this point , discussions generally veer off into either contrived or complicated examples .
Let ’s instead take a simple example where the machinery for continuations is not quite so raw and exposed : Python generators .
Here is an example that prints Fibonacci numbers less than 1000 :
def fib ( ) : yield 0 i , j = 0,1 while True : yield j i , j = j , i+j for n in fib ( ) : if n>1000 : break print n
Instead of return statements , the fib function uses yield statements .
This yields one number at a time out of the inexhaustible supply of Fibonacci numbers .
The caller simply invokes that continuation as many times as desired , and all program state ( instruction pointer , local variables ) are restored , and the fib function starts back up where it left off .
Once the loop is exited , the state if the fib function is eligible for reclaiming .
Cool , eh ?
If you try to recode this without continuations , you will find that you will need to return a “ token ” which contains all the relevant state , and that token will need to be passed back in on subsequent calls .
That ’s pretty much what is happening under the covers .
( Note : you may be tempted to use global variables instead .
Do n’t .
Your code would no longer be reentrant , and if there were two callers , they would get confused ) .
Cocoon
Now let ’s look at a web application , this time in JavaScript .
A single function implements the entire form based application that involves the display of three ( or four , depending on the options selected ) web pages .
This is accomplished via the cocoon .
sendPageAndWait primitive .
This style of programming is quite different than the resource oriented approach advocated by REST .
Some , however , find it to be more intuitive .
This hearkens back to the days in Basic when you coded things like
10 print " Enter your name " 20 input a$ 30 print " Hello , " ; a$ ; " ! "
When the computer got to the input statement , the operating system would suspend your program until the user provided an input .
At which point , your program would be paged back into memory and would pick up exactly where it left off .
SAX
A SAX parser is an example of a task that could be recast as a generator .
It consumes an InputSource byte by byte and occasionally emits startElement , endElement , characters and other events .
After each event , the parser picks back up where it left off .
While this organization is convenient for parser writers , many consumers find XML Pull Parsers easier to deal with .
Judicious application of continuations allows both constituencies to be satisfied .
From the user of the library ’s perspective , they are using a pull parser .
From the person who codes up the SAX handler , each event simply invokes a continuation .
There is no memory bloat like you see with DOM style parsers .
Everybody is happy .
UI
Event programming , in general , is for wizards .
These wizards live and breathe events .
But even they regress every once and a while .
You can tell when this happens when you see a modal dialog box .
With User Interface Continuations , even scripters can become £ 337 h4x0r UI gods .
Without a modal dialog box in sight .
Closures
Consider the following JavaScript :
var msg = " Hello , world ! " ; setTimeout ( function ( ) {alert ( msg ) } , 1000 ) ;
The use of setTimeout is common in JavaScript based animation .
The first parameter is a function to be invoked .
The second parameter is the number of miliseconds to wait until this string is executed .
The question you should be asking yourself is “ in which context is this function to be evaluated ? ”
In particular , how does JavaScript go about looking for the value of msg ?
The answer is simple : in the current context .
This , it turns out , is a closure , continuation ’s more general cousin .
Wrapped up in a nice neat little package .
Continuations are bookmarks — they tell you where to pick up after you last left off .
Closures are simply the current lexical stack — they represent the current local context and its immediate parent , recursively .
Classes
If the notion of a nested set of scopes residing on the heap seems foreign to you , it really should n’t .
Here ’s an example in Java :
public class Scopes { class Outer { class Inner { void alert ( ) { System.out.println(msg ) ;} } String msg = " Schweet ! " ; Inner inner = new Inner ( ) ; } Outer outer = new Outer ( ) ; public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
String msg = " Bogus ! " ; ( new Scopes ( ) ).outer.inner.alert ( ) ; } }
Epilogue
One thing that people do n’t often tell you about continuations is that they do n’t actually resume exactly where you left off .
After all , if they did , you would end up in an infinite loop .
The only thing that is really restored is a few pointers .
Everything that resides on the heap , or is stored externally in places like files and databases , remains unaffected when you invoke a continuation .
But like the ByValue or ByReference discussion above , this does n’t cause problems very often .
In fact , it generally works out pretty much the way you would like it to , without you having to worry about it .
When you realize this , you realize that there really is no magic in continuations .
Sure , more things are put on the heap , but there are ways to optimize this .
Oh , and by the way , you probably taste like chicken right about now .

The first image of Earth ever taken from another planet was made on may 8 , 2003 by Mars Global Surveyor while orbiting Mars .
A year later , Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took the first image ever taken of Earth from the surface of a planet : a spot in the martian horizon . ( distance : 1.500 million kilometers )
On september 15 , 2006 , Cassini spacecraft took this picture while it was nearly 1.5 billion kilometers ( 930 million miles ) from Earth . ( distance : 6.000 million kilometers ) Pale Blue Dot " is a famous Voyager 1 photograph of planet Earth , showing it situated against the backdrop of the Solar System , as well as the title of a book by astronomer Carl Sagan that was inspired by the photo .

If I called the police and said that my neighbor was intending to attack me , and that this neighbor has all sorts of guns hidden in his house , and I had everyone in my family swear that all of this was true , that would be a terrible thing to do , especially if it were n’t true .
What if I constantly called him on the telephone and insulted him and hired people to throw rocks at his house every once in a while , would make me some kind of whack job ?
If I wrote stories about that neighbor and had others write stories about him and printed them in the media so that everyone could see what kind of a man he was ( or what kind of man I wanted them to think he was ) , would that be right ?
Now suppose that I convinced the police that this man was such a menace that they actually sent in a SWAT Team and invaded his home because of the mistaken belief in the story that I told them about the weapons cache he had , and in the process of raiding his house the man thought it was a home invasion and actually fired at the SWAT Team , killed a cop , and in the confusion the man ’s wife and one of his children were shot and killed .
When the scene finally settled down and the police realized that I had made the entire thing up so that I could get rid of my neighbor and buy his business , what do you suppose would happen to me ?
Do you believe I should be charged with murder because of the stories that I told that culminated in one cop dead and two people gunned down by the police ?
I believe that the District Attorney would convene a Grand Jury and charge me with murder and a laundry list of felonies and I would probably spend the rest of my days in prison .
If I ever had the good fortune to get out of prison , I am sure that my neighbor would have also charged me in a Civil Court and would have taken everything that I owned , so I would most likely return to nothing .
If this were to happen , most people would have no pity for me and just about everyone would have said that I got what I deserved .
Let ’s take the same set of circumstances and attribute them to George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein .
The armed forces invaded Iraq and found no Weapons of Mass Destruction and Iraqi soldiers and civilians died , and are still dying along with our own soldiers for something that was started on a lie .
Why has n’t Bush been charged with a crime ?
The facts are coming to light now are that Bush and Cheney both knew that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction .
What ’s the difference between what they did , and what would have happened with me if I did that to my neighbor ?
You tell me .
Is he exempt from the standards set by the law because he is The President of the United States ?
Can he lie to the American people with impunity and force a war with another country predicated on lies ?
Is this legal ?
I have heard that we should impeach the President and the Vice President and let the World Court ( or The International Court of Justice ) at the The Hague , charge him under international law .
I do n’t believe that we should let the rest of the world do our dirty laundry .
I believe that this is an American problem that should be decided by Americans .
I also believe that if he broke the law , that both he and the rest of his regime that prosecuted the case for war with lies and facts that could not be substantiated should be prosecuted without delay .
This nation cannot afford to have an Executive Branch that uses American foreign policy to gain an advantage monetarily for themselves and their business partners .
I believe that the reason that Bush wanted to remove Saddam was to stop him from flooding the market with oil and to institute these “ Oil Laws ” that the United States is pressuring Iraq to accept that gives Big Oil 75 % of the oil reserves in Iraq .
This amounts to trillions of dollars , as most geologists now feel that Iraq has the largest oil reserves on the planet .
This is n’t heavy crude such as the oil from Venezuela ; this is light sweet crude that brings top dollar for its purity .
This is oil that can be used for plastics , fertilizers , fuel , and also to keep the people that control it , rich for decades .
Today he commuted “ Scooter ” Libby ’s sentence .
Since “ Scooter ” worked with this “ regime ” is that legal ?
If Bush would n’t have commuted Libby ’s sentence I would have been surprised .
Of course he ’s going to take care of his own .
This investigation as far as I know is still ongoing in the case of who exactly gave up Valerie Plame ’s name .
Once Libby was in jail , there is no telling what kind of evidence he would have given up to be free again .
I ’m sure Bush took this into consideration .
Meanwhile , we still have a question that is unanswered here .
If someone knowingly makes a false report to the authorities , should n’t that person be charged with a crime ?
I think so and there are others that think so .
I ’ll keep you posted ; this is n’t close to being over .
Faking an English accent has always been an American pastime , whether Americans are trying to sound fancy or just making fun of a culture that 's foreign and different .
But how can this be achieved over a medium without voices ?
Well , it 's simple if you follow these fun and easy rules !
1. Be an American
This is a necessity .
No matter how hard English people try , they cannot fake an English accent , just like Americans cannot fake an American one .
2 . Do not change your spelling habits
It is impossible to say how many promising English accents were ruined by overly impetuous chatters who decide to spell out words how the English pronounce them .
That is pure stupidity !
Americans do not spell cabinet ' cabnit ' .
Think about it .
3 . Learn the words that the English spell differently
Here 's a whole Entry on British - English spelling .
Or , if you are lazy , follow this rule of thumb .
If a word is more than five letters long and contains the letter ' o ' place a ' u ' directly after the 'o '.
Also , substitute ' re ' for 'er '.
4 . Know the common words that the English substitute for real words
' Trousers ' are substituted for ' pants '
' pants ' for ' underwear '
' lift ' for ' elevator '
' pub ' for ' bar '
' football ' for ' soccer '
' flat ' for ' apartment '
' full stop ' for ' period '
5 . Use the word ' w **k ' and 'w****' as expletives
Real English people ( apparently ) never do , but it sounds good .
You can also pick up some other derogatory English slang , calling someone a ' plonker ' for instance .
6 . Do not back down
The person confronting you could be faking an accent as well .
Tell them to ' Bloody Sod Off ! ' - that works quite well .
7 . If all else fails , pretend you are drunk
They will not find this odd .
8. Use Cockney Rhyming Slang
You will never see someone who speaks Cockney rhyming slang online so you can feel safe to use it freely .
To type in ' Cockney ' , simply misspell a great deal of words and speak gibberish .
If you do find a speaker of Cockney , refer to rule seven .
9. Watch Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch
Repeat until you understand what all the characters are saying .
10 . Say ' really ' and ' you know ? '
This is not stereotypical , but is actually used quite commonly .
Do not say ' ya know ? '
You 're trying to sound English , not Canadian .
11 . Address the audience in your greetings
Call them ' mate ' , even if you do not wish to mate with them , ' luv ' , even if you do not love them , or ' guv ' nor ' , even if they are not an elected official .
12 . Find a good English - sounding screen name
If you cannot think of one , use a fairly unknown English actor , or , better yet , a character they play .
Or , shorten a normal sounding name and add ' Z ' at the end , ie Gary becomes Gaz , Darren becomes Daz .
13 . Last but not least , do not say Cheerio !
This a major faux pas , so avoid it at all cost .
No real Englishman has ever said ' cheerio ' this century .
And those not in this century rarely use chatrooms .
You will get caught .
So avoid this , no matter how tempting .
Well , that 's about everything .
Follow these rules and you should have every American believing you are as English as ' tea and crumpets ' .
Apple ’s announcement that finishing the iPhone would come at the cost of a delayed release of Mac OS X Leopard set off a flurry of bizarre responses from Apple detractors always on the lookout for ways to bulldoze the company 's mountains into minor molehills .
The previous article asked : Has Leopard fallen into a Copland - Vista Conundrum ?
This one examines the idea : W ill Leopard miss a magical window of opportunity left open by Vista ?
Reader Schininis observed : “ I think Apple has the luxury of being in the drivers seat right now with the timing of their operating system delivery .
It seems obvious to me now that the delay decision was helped along by Vista 's total lack of WOW .
“ If Apple had to react to Vista , they probably would have moved things along .
But , why deliver Leopard now , when there is no pressure to react to Vista ?
“ Vista , all on its own , is weak .
Apple can afford to let Vista be weak a few more months while they sneak in even more features than they thought they could .
This way as we head into the important back - to - school and Christmas seasons , Apple will be able to make Vista look like an over ripe banana ... mushy with a bad smell . ”
Weak Sales of Windows Vista .
Consider the impact Vista has had after being thrown into the bleak , six year chasm stretching from Windows XP .
Rather than serving up fat sales to desperate customers , Microsoft has been left to stretch the truth to suggest that Vista sales are not in really in the toilet .
Reader Andrew Sheridan sent a link to a Blackfriars ’ Marketing article by Carl Howe , who pointed out how Microsoft is juicing its revenues : “ Microsoft achieved record breaking earnings during the Vista launch quarter by taking money out of its assets , not through amazing sales of Vista and Office . ”
“ As a point in contrast , ” Howe wrote , “ Apple Inc. has been launching a lot of products over the last nine months and has added almost $ 2 billion to its balance sheet and assets in the same period that Microsoft 's assets dropped $ 6 billion . ”
On top of weak sales , factor in the interrelated , peripheral problems Microsoft is dealing with as it ties its future success to the languishing Windows Vista :
• poor strategic direction • dependance upon a faltering monopoly position • reliance upon the media to cover up reality • a failing business plan
Here ’s how those factors relate to Microsoft , and how they have played out for other companies in the past .
Poor strategic direction : Microsoft wo n’t be the first corporation to fail spectacularly .
There are many long lists of companies and organizations that lost their influence and position by executing a series of poorly timed blunders .
A recent example is Quark .
This Quark is Bananas .
Back in September of 2005 , the article Is Microsoft Vista the new Quark ?
compared the fate of Windows Vista to Quark Xpress in a historical overview of the protracted efforts by Quark and Microsoft to deliver the next generation of their software products .
Despite being firmly entrenched among graphic design users , Quark made a series of poorly timed mistakes that cost the company customers , credibility , and leadership within its industry .
Quark had bet against Apple 's prospects for Mac OS X , delivering a Classic - only release just as Jaguar 10.2 was setting a new direction for Mac users .
Quark then insulted its customers with two half - capacity , full price upgrades which featured more innovation in DRM copy protection than in actual usability .
To inflame the already problematic situation , Quark also decided to delegate both its development and customer support overseas .
50 Ways To Leave Your Vendor .
Irate customers were left talking to third rate call centers that coolly explained without using any words that Quark was a cheap company hoping to make fat profits off its loyal customers by shortchanging them in every way possible .
This is not a good strategy for retaining customers .
Quark ’s customers did n’t all immediately leave .
Just as PC users in 2002 with a lot invested in Windows software were commonly unable to jump ship to Linux or Power Macs , Quark 's customers in 2002 were in many cases also forced to just hold their nose and pay Quark for the weak updates that were delivered years late .
Dependance upon a faltering monopoly position :
For many years , Quark enjoyed a near monopoly position in desktop publishing software -- aided in part by the sub-industry of third party Quark eXtensions .
It rather arrogantly took advantage of its own customers using that monopoly leverage .
The problem for Quark was that its distant rival Adobe was delivering a new competitor into the ring : InDesign .
In particular , Adobe capitalized on Quark 's weak position with Mac OS X .
The timing could n't have been worse for Quark ; its users were not just tempted to jump ship but were actually pushed overboard by Quark ’s poor strategic direction just as Adobe was floating out its InDesign lifeboats .
Having a monopoly position allowed Quark to abuse its customers for a while , but it did n’t last long .
Companies that do n’t take care of their customers end up old and alone .
Monopoly power appears to be a strength , but it really becomes a weakness because it offers a luxurious world that cultivates poor strategic direction .
The Luxurious World of Monopolies .
The core problem with monopolies is that , while they offer the illusion of a unilateral control , they also create vacuums of innovation .
When an industry leader sits back to comfortably enjoy its wealth on the backs of its customers , it stops serving their needs and fresh upstarts are given the opportunity to steal away that business .
In 2000 , Microsoft began relaxing to enjoy its monopoly position crafted during the 90s ; during that previous decade , Bill Gates ' blustering created the impression for the media that Microsoft was the standards bearer of all technology and the pace setter of all trends in the tech world .
From that powerful position , Microsoft had the luxury of idly coasting on its users for years .
Microsoft certainly is n't the first company to do something like this ; coasting is actually the default behavior for all companies that hit their stride without knowing what to do next .
Reliance upon the media to cover up reality :
The weakness of power not only cultivates poor strategic direction , but also tends to focus attention on covering up mistakes in the media rather than solving the actual problems .
This just makes things worse , particularly when that subterfuge is later exposed .
Interestingly , part of the downfall of monopolies comes from the delayed discipline of reality checks offered by the media , which tends to cheer on the gratuitous sloth of former glories long after any celebration is deserved .
The Delay of Media Momentum .
Counter - intuitively , t he media is just not very good at pointing out that the emperor has no clothes ; once enough children point it out for them however , the embarrassment becomes a great story and the press begins beating up the same celebrated darlings they once revered as untouchable .
Apple 's fall from grace in the mid 90s provides a great example .
Few mainstream media outlets actually pointed out that the meek Mac System 7 and the slow trickle of minor updates that followed it in the early 90s were not the best Apple could have delivered .
The media simply did n’t understand the details in play .
It was n't until things were obviously out of control around 1995 that the press turned from its near worship of Apple to constant ridicule of the now beleaguered company .
The Media Slackline .
In reality , Apple had begun making serious mistakes in the late 80s under the direction of John Sculley and Jean Louis Gassée .
It was n’t until a half decade later that those errors had compounded into results that the media could recognize .
Conversely , even after a revitalized Apple turned things around , it still faced years of scorn from naysayers still stuck in the habit of repeating criticisms of Apple they assumed to be popular , fashionable , and safe to repeat ad nauseam .
Only in the last couple years has it become common to hear from writers with the intellectual honesty and capacity to understand that circumstances have changed in the tech industry .
Technical ignorance among reporters exaggerates the delayed media momentum and results in ‘ conventional wisdom ’ trailing reality , in some cases by many years .
The beleaguerment of Apple was rooted in the late 80s , but only reached full tilt media coverage as the problems were beginning to be solved ; delayed criticisms are still occasionally heaped on the company years after it has established strong leadership and proficiency across its operations .
That same delayed media momentum is just now detecting the blood left in the water by the thrashing Microsoft , which has been hemorrhaging billions in its failed consumer electronics initiatives for years , and faces increased pressure from the competition that threatens its OEM monopolies and their automatic revenue streams .
Ineffectual Reality Revisionism .
Rather than working to solve its core problems , Microsoft ’s executives have been feeding the media false information at regular intervals to distract from reality :
• misleading sales reports • unrealistic sales estimates • fearful uncertainty about Linux • assaults on the yet unreleased iPhone
Since Microsoft has no real answers and can’t execute its own plans , it has to resort to seeding the media with talking points that create the illusion that everything is well : revenues are up again , Xbox units are selling , Linux is still scary , the iPhone wo n’t in any possible scenario meet the needs of customers .
Microsoft ’s real problems have long been contained by an uncritical media parroting the press releases they are fed ; that ’s beginning to change however as the crisis signs become increasingly difficult to ignore .
Prophetic Hints of the Vistapocalypse .
The real problems plaguing the disappointing launch of Vista did n't originate earlier this year when Microsoft pushed it out , but were rooted way back into the 90s .
Microsoft faced impossible challenges in solving the security and architectural problems it had accumulated during the development of NT , problems that were well known to everyone who did n't get their information from industry writers repeating the same tired set of “ known ” stories .
Failing business plan :
In addition to the technical problems growing within Windows development , Microsoft also faced the cancer eating at its basic business plan : the absurd idea that third party PC makers were going to happily work to make Microsoft rich forever was not only uncritically repeated by the press , but also used as an attack against the beleaguered Apple .
The media insisted that Apple was dying , not because it had failed to deliver products users wanted and needed , but because Apple was n't copying Microsoft .
In their simple world , the obvious answer to fixing Apple was for it to emulate Microsoft , which was making billions of dollars just cranking out the software sold by OEM PC makers .
Outlook Not So Good .
There were warning signs that disputed this conventional thinking however .
PCs kept falling in price , but Microsoft 's Windows kept getting more expensive .
How long was that scenario going to maintain itself ?
Additionally , emerging threats from the entirely free Linux and other open source projects were challenging the basic idea that Microsoft had some unquestionable lock on owning the PC software business .
The intrinsic absurdity that any company could perpetually ride capitalism with high prices and low quality products should have caused at least some question in the minds of the press , but little was offered .
Nobody wanted to look foolish when Microsoft was indisputably making huge profits .
Surely things could not be headed towards trouble if things are okay right now .
The same refusal to report the obvious was also a reason why the tech world spun out of control and then tanked in 2001 : everyone was afraid to say how stupid the dot com “ new economy ” was , because people were quite obviously making lots of money .
Everything we knew about economics could be safely doubted .
Avoiding every opportunity to recognize and publicly criticize the real problems of a powerful entity does not result in greater strength but rather in weakness .
In 2001 , Microsoft itself admitted that its software licensing business plan had a uncertain future when it released the Xbox video game console and established a hardware business without any OEM licensing .
Instead of Apple copying Microsoft , Microsoft was copying Apple 's business of selling complete , integrated products .
Half a decade later , the media still does n't seem to clearly hear the deafening wail of Microsoft 's internal problems .
If the company is performing this badly with the gushing support of the media , imagine how rapidly things will sour once the truth begins to be incessantly reported by the press ?
Visterrible Troubles .
Among Microsoft 's various other underreported crises was the conspicuous delay of Longhorn / Vista .
Not only was the next major version of Windows itself slipping , but Microsoft 's reputation for being able to at least deliver something at regular intervals slipped as well .
It was n't just that Microsoft could n't deliver upon its intended goals , but that those goals were no longer the goal posts everyone was talking about or working to copy .
Just like Quark , Microsoft was shooting holes it its own feet as a new competitor began running circles around it .
In Microsoft ’s case , it was Apple delivering the next generation of desktop operating system technologies .
Mac OS
X stole away the attention and the leadership role that previously appeared to belong to the Windows dynasty installed by Bill Gates .
Apple 's Mac OS
X vs Vista was beginning to look awfully similar to Adobe 's InDesign attack on Quark .
It did n't matter that Quark was going to survive or that InDesign was n't an appropriate tool for all Quark users , only that Quark 's crown had been knocked off and that all everyone wanted to talk about was the new InDesign .
Similarly , Vista can hardly be mentioned without a comparison to Mac OS X : not the future promised in Leopard , but the existing Tiger , which is now two years old .
Vista 's most obvious new feature is its look , which borrows heavily from Mac OS X , both conceptually and technically .
Vista 's graphics are very much a ‘ me too ’ version of Apple ’s six year old Quartz graphics engine .
The Recovery that Did n’t Materialize .
Throughout 2006 , analysts were telling us that PC sales were depressed in anticipation of Vista , and that the growth of the Mac , which far outpaced the growth in PC sales across the board , was a temporary phenomenon .
Once Vista shipped , they assured us , consumers would flock to the safe choice offered by Microsoft and its many third party OEM PC makers , and the brief blip of Mac interest would be relegated back into obscurity .
That did n't happen .
Instead , even during the winter sales period when Microsoft offered free coupon updates to Vista for PC buyers , sales of PCs remained disappointing .
Even worse , once Vista went on sale at retail , consumers did n't seem to care at all , despite the small fortune Microsoft dumped into weeks of publicity .
Microsoft was left to cook its accounting just to offer up the suggestion that Vista sales compared favorably to the sales of Windows XP at its launch in 2001 , when they most certainly did not .
In the months following Vista 's release , things have only gotten worse , as the realization sinks in that the vast majority of Enterprise users are just wiping off Vista to install their standardized internal version of Windows , while home users are demanding that Dell sell them the familiar Windows XP .
The only thing worse than starting a party late is throwing a party where nobody comes .
Windows of Opportunity .
Do Vista ’s problems represent a narrow opening of opportunity for Apple to pounce ?
Hardly .
Apple has been working to advance Mac sales from multiple angles for years , and Microsoft has been regularly offering tepid products that present similar windows of opportunity .
Last years ' release of Tiger for Intel , a nearly invisible accomplishment , helped to double Mac sales over the numbers sold just two years ago .
Apple continues to outmatch the growth of PC makers by a large margin , and the growth of Mac sales is now even outpacing iPod growth year over year .
Wags who liked to say that Apple 's beleaguered Mac was only still around as a curiosity while the company turned itself into an iPod vendor are looking mighty foolish .
Their invention of the iPod Halo , an idea created to mock as wishful thinking , turned out to be the only thing they really got right .
The iPod did help sell Macs , and now both are selling iTunes downloads and Apple TVs and soon , the iPhone .
In contrast , the Windows Monopoly did next to nothing for the :
... all of which have been resounding failures as products .
The Many Angles of Success .
Following another strong earnings report , Apple 's current position demonstrates that its fate does n't rest in one product or a monopoly position established out of fortunate timing .
Apple is doing well because it is serving the needs of its customers .
Some examples :
• Apple 's products are competitively priced ; last fall 's iPod dramatically undercut the Zune , killing Microsoft 's hopes of making any money on it at all .
• It has established the cutting edge in film and video work with the Final Cut Pro suite ( more on that later ) ; Microsoft 's efforts in that field have been tepid .
• Apple has established its name as a top consumer brand ; Microsoft avoids mixing its name and its Windows brand with the Xbox and Zune marketing because neither is a particularly hot brand to consumers .
• Apple 's stores are embarrassing the retail industry with their exceptional performance .
Microsoft is left to push its products , including Vista , through independent retailers , a factor that helped to kill the Zune .
Mac vs PC vs Vista .
While many Mac users are holding their breath for Leopard , there are not shocking limitations in Tiger that the competition is putting to shame and which demand desperate solutions .
Additionally , Vista is n't just a simple rival to Mac OS X , but rather competes against the Mac product as a whole .
Apple 's current Macs running
Tiger not only offer a strong alternative to Vista PCs , but can even run Windows for the users who have a need for that .
Microsoft simply does n’t compete directly against the Mac.
Instead , it is left sitting on the sidelines cheering on Dell and HP , both of which have been outpaced in growth by Apple .
Dell has stumbled and HP has grown largely by discounting prices .
Both are looking at price concessions from Microsoft and cheaper options to Windows , at a time when Vista costs more than ever .
What ’s the Rush ?
The idea that Apple needs to rush to release Leopard in order to have something to position against Vista is simply a fallacy .
It would be a mistake for Apple to push out Leopard early and gain the reputation of putting unfinished products in the hands of customers .
While I 'd like to have Leopard running on my Mac , I 'd rather have a frustration free experience with Tiger now and look forward to a solid release of Leopard later in the year than have reason to endlessly complain about how rushed and problematic Leopard is .
Also recall that Vista is n't the only product Microsoft offers that Apple is competing against .
Apple has three new irons in the fire that already directly take on Microsoft products , including Vista :
• Apple TV is a competitor to Media Center , one of the main consumer features rolled into Vista .
• The Airport Extreme is an alternative to Microsoft 's still undelivered Windows Home Server products .
• The iPhone offers such an credible threat to the entire Windows Mobile family that Microsoft executives are screaming denials in their sleep .
Does Apple need to rush out Leopard to prematurely replace the bang up job Tiger is already doing to advance Mac market share ?
Nope .
Does Apple need to immediately distract itself from firing its first three weapons of 2007 against the monopoly position of Microsoft ?
That sounds like a bad idea , too .
Apple is aiming each bullet with precision to make sure each hits squarely on its intended target .
Two of those bullets have already left the chamber .
So what about the iPhone : it it worth holding up Leopard ?

Twenty - four members of Cuba ’s national fencing team , many of them teenagers , also boarded Cubana Airlines Flight 455 in Port of Spain , wearing the gold and silver medals they had just won at a tournament in Venezuela .
The plane was to stop briefly in Barbados and Jamaica before taking them home to Havana .
Some twenty minutes after takeoff , Ricardo pushed the rigged camera under his seat and walked to the rear restroom , where he hid an explosives - packed toothpaste tube .
He was nervous , sweating heavily , and somehow jammed the door , trapping himself inside .
A stewardess tried to pry the door open .
Unsuccessful , she recruited the plane ’s copilot , who kicked it loose , according to a passenger who disembarked with the two young men in Barbados .
Nine minutes after leaving Barbados , the pilot radioed distress .
“ We have an explosion on board , ’’ he told the control tower .
“ We ’re descending fast .
We have a fire on board . ’’
He asked permission to return to the airport .
Then came a second , deafening blast .
“ Hit the water , Felo !
Hit the water ! ” the copilot cried , as the plane started plunging .
We have a total emergency ! ” the pilot shouted , and then the signal went dead .
Sunbathers at Barbados ’s Paradise Hotel watched in horror as the DC - 8 dived into the sea .
All seventy - three people on board were killed : fifty - seven Cubans , six exchange students and a young family from Guyana , and five North Koreans .
Ricardo hailed a taxi at the airport in Barbados , and he and Lugo took a meandering trip through Bridgetown , at one point asking the driver to pull over so they could watch a plane pass overhead .
Around 1:15 p.m. , they checked into the Bridgetown Holiday Inn , room 103 , under false names .
Ricardo immediately placed a call through the front desk and left a message with Luis Posada ’s secretary in Caracas .
He then called his girlfriend , who worked at Posada ’s detective agency , and asked her to relay a message to her boss .
“ We ’re in a desperate situation and need help , ” he said .
Then he added , using a predetermined code , “ The bus was fully loaded with dogs . ”
His next call was to a “ Señor Paniagua , ” the nom de guerre of Orlando Bosch , the legendary anti-Castro militant , then living in Caracas .
He did n’t get through .
Ricardo was convinced a Cuban agent had seen him in the lobby ; after a heated discussion , he and Lugo changed hotels .
They took a walk by the sea to calm their nerves , but as word of the bombing buzzed among the locals , a panic - stricken Ricardo tossed a small package , which may have contained the detonator , into the sea and declared that they had to leave Barbados immediately .
On the short hop back to Trinidad , Ricardo alternated between euphoria and tears as he downed shots of whiskey .
Seventy - three !
More than the Jackal ! ” he boasted , comparing himself to Carlos the Jackal , the Venezuelan terrorist then at the height of his fame .
“ Now I ’m the one who has the record , because I ’m the one who blew up that thing . ”
Later he broke down , saying : “ Damn it , Lugo , I ’m desperate and feel like crying .
I ’ve never killed anyone before . ”
Just put it in the damn object !
The Perl Program Repair Shop book , despite outward appearances , is coming along .
A few months ago in Pittsburgh I gave a talk about someone 's module that I did n't think was very well - written , for various reasons .
Up to that point , the book had been about a lot of small - scale stuff : repeated code , unnecessary variables , making two passes over a data structure when only one was necessary , C - style for loops , and such .
But unlike the previous examples , this one had been written by someone who was actually competent .
So the problems I found were competent - programmer examples , rather than incompetent - programmer examples .
I need some more chapters of that kind of examples , or the book will not be of much interest to competent programmers .
What kind of mistakes do competent programmers make ?
They make a lot of errors of object - oriented design .
This module 's purpose was to emulate some Java library that lets you register an " observer " of an object .
Let 's say that the " observer " object is a Guard , and the object it is observing is an " Alarm " .
The idea is that the Alarm object registers the Guard as being an observer of the Alarm , and then whenever the Alarm calls a notify_observers method , the notify method in the Guard object is called back .
Actually the Java people did n't make the names that sensible ; instead of notify_observers calling the notify method in the observers , it calls the update method .
Why was n't notify_observers called update_observers , then ?
I dunno .
It 's Java .
You want me to explain Java ?
Okay , so for each Alarm A you need somewhere to store the list of observers of A .
Where do you put that ?
The author of the module put it in a global hash .
I do n't think it 's immediately clear that this was a mistake .
But I do think it was a mistake .
Big problems arise ; the module had a lot of bugs , mostly related to garbage collection .
As a result of putting the Guard objects into this hash , they are never garbage collected .
Well , not quite .
The author used a weak reference in the hash , so the objects there are garbage collected .
Weak references are one of those technical solutions that fits really well into the formula " A programmer had a problem .
So he used weak references .
Then he had two problems . "
( Non -greedy regexes are another example .
Some people say Perl itself is an example . )
Weak references do solve a couple of very specific problems , mostly having to do with caching .
For anything else , they turn out to be a bigger problem than the thing you were trying to solve .
In this case , the weak references cause this delightful problem : my $ alarm = Alarm -> new ( ) ; $ alarm->add_observer ( Guard ->new ) ; $ alarm->notify_observers ( " I like pie ! " ) ;
Failed to send observation from ' Alarm=HASH ( 0x8113f74 ) ' to '' :
Ca n't call method " update " on an undefined value at lib / Class / Observable .pm line 95 .
See , the Guard that is observing the Alarm is immediately garbage - collected .
We could prevent the fatal error here , but that would n't solve the problem , which is that that Guard should not be garbage collected as long as the Alarm is still extant , because it is supposed to be watching the Alarm .
This was only one of several problems caused by this design , to store the observers in a global hash .
Some of these could possibly be avoided if Perl were a better language , but others I think not .
My suggestion here was the following advice :
Whenever you 're trying to store information about an object , there is a right place to store it and a wrong place to store it .
The right place : inside the object .
The wrong place : anywhere else .
Rationale : What is an object ?
It 's a place where you store all the pertinent information about some entity .
So here we have some pertinent information about this entity , the alarm , namely the list of guards who are watching it .
Where should we store this information ?
Well , we have this data structure , the Alarm object , which is supposed to store all the pertinent information about the alarm .
The list of guards is part of this , so that 's where it should go .
Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem .
Now , this choice may be obvious , but it has a fair share of problems too , which is why I think the other programmer might not have made it .
The add_observers method in the base class of Alarm is called upon to add the Guard to the list of observers of the Alarm .
If the list of observers is stored in the Alarm object , add_observers must make some assumptions about how the Alarm is implemented .
But it turns out that once you start thinking about it , the problems turn out to have fairly simple solutions .
For example , the base class needs to know what list to append the Guard to .
It could assume that the list will be stored in $ alarm ->
{Observers} , but that 's iffy : it assumes that the Alarm will be made from a hash , it assumes that that hash key is not used for something else , and so on .
So instead , you give Alarm a method that returns a reference to the array in which the Guard is supposed to place itself .
Normally , that method is inherited from the base class itself , and returns a reference to $ self ->
{ Observers} , but the Alarm class can override that if it needs to .
It can even get back the original global - variable implementation by overriding the method to return a reference to an element in a global hash .
To summarize , both designs appeared to have significant technical problems , but the problems in the design I suggested turned out to be a lot easier to solve well then the problems that arose from the design that the author chose .
At least in this example , the advice that object data should be stored in the object turned out pretty well .
( Cynical advice to people wishing to become famous experts : phrase your advice so that it sounds inevitable .
Anyone wishing to argue against advice like object data should be stored in the object will have an uphill battle , and risks looking like an idiot . )
Now today I was in the shower , thinking about this other piece of software I wrote recently , in which I was having , surprise , a garbage collection problem .
The software is a module that is intended to provide lightweight access to flat - file databases , which is something that has been inexplicably overlooked by CPAN .
You use the module like this : my $ db = Flat File -> new ( FILE => ... , FIELDS => [...] , ... ) ; my @red = $ db ->lookup ( color => " red " ) ; $ red [ 0 ] -> set_color ( " blue " ) ; # paint it blue $ red [ 1 ] -> delete ;
The elements of @red are Record objects , and the Record methods like set_color and delete need to call back to the FlatFile object that represents the database , to inform it that records have been modified or deleted .
So each Record object needs a pointer back to the database to which it belongs .
The way I implemented this was to have a class variable in the Record class , $ Record : : DB , which contained the database object .
But then the database object is never garbage - collected , which means it is never finalized , which means that changes to the database are not automatically written to the disk when the database object becomes inaccessible , which means that you have to call $ db -> flush to make sure the changes are written out , which opens the possibility that you will forget , and the module will bugger your database with a badger .
What I realized in the shower was that I had better take my own advice , that object data should be stored in the object .
If the source database is a pertinent piece of information about a record , then I had better store the source database as a piece of member data in the record object , and not try this stupid thing involving a global variable .
If the advice is good , this will be a better design .
I have n't done it yet , so I 'm not sure .
But it certainly looks like a better design .
I want to say I do n't know why I used the global variable in the first place , but I do know : my original design for the record object was that it had nothing in it but the data from the record ; no metadata at all .
The data members were named after the fields in the database , so there was no namespace left over for metadata .
That did n't work out too well , and although I resisted putting metadata into the record objects long enough to screw myself regarding where to store the owning database and some other stuff , I eventually got backed into a corner and had to redesign the object to have space for metadata .
But the effects of original misdesign persisted , because I was still storing a bunch of the object 's metadata in stupid global variables , until I took that shower .
That 's two successes so far for my advice , which is two good signs .
Now all I need is a good counterexample .
Every piece of advice in this book is going to have a counterexample .
That 's the big problem with computer programming advice books : no counterexamples .
But that 's another article for another day .

Married for 65 years , they seemed the epitome of a loving couple .
But shortly after this picture was taken , Herbert Powell stabbed his wife to death .
He claimed it was to end her agony from arthritis .
Here , their son tells a very different story ...
To residents in the tranquil South Devonshire village of Strete , Herbert Powell and his wife Irene appeared to be the perfect couple .
Married for 65 years , they were often spotted strolling hand in hand as they filled their lives with gardening , social engagements and the local church .
They were popular with villagers , and their enduring relationship was considered a heartwarming , and rare , example of lasting love .
But two years ago , their neat one - bedroom bungalow became the scene of a brutal crime when Herbert killed 86 - year - old Irene .
Scroll down for more ...
While no one is sure of the provocation , it is known he beat his wife - who was virtually blind - with a rolling pin and stabbed her in the heart with a kitchen knife .
He also slit their cat Digger 's throat , and then placed a selection of photographs of the couple 's two children in Irene 's lifeless hands before fleeing the scene .
Last month , after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , Herbert Powell was sentenced to three years in prison .
In court , he claimed he'd committed a ' mercy killing ' because his wife wanted to die to escape the pain of her crippling arthritis .
The fact he 'd already served 19 months in custody and was ruled not a danger to the public by the judge at Plymouth Crown Court meant he was able to walk free and return home .
Given Herbert 's great age of 89 and failing health , it is difficult not to feel for him as he returns to eke out what will most likely be a lonely existence for the rest of his days at the home where the bloodstains have still not been removed from the walls and floors .
Today , however , the Mail can reveal an astonishing and disturbing postscript to this tragic story .
Herbert 's son Rod , 62 , has broken his silence to insist that his father 's freedom is an ' outrage ' .
He paints a very different picture of the man who was described in court by the judge as having an ' uneventful life ' until the moment he killed his wife .
Any sympathy towards his father , says Rod , would be utterly misguided .
In fact , he is n't convinced his father does , or will ever , feel any remorse , even as he sets about cleaning up the bloody evidence of the killing .
' My father is , and always has been , a violent man with black moods , ' says Rod , who runs a property company in Canada and is married to Roni , 61 , a civil servant .
' When I heard that the villagers had described my parents as a " loving and devoted " couple , I almost could n't believe they were talking about the same people .
' He can put on a show in public , but my whole family lived in fear of my father , and my mother - like all victims of domestic abuse - was left a shell of her former self .
' The judge ruled my father is not a danger to the general public , but if provoked there is no predicting what he 'll do - as he 's proven by killing my mother .
He may be 89 , but I am not fooled by his little old man act . '
A year ago , Rod wrote a heartfelt letter to his father expressing his feelings - the only contact he has had with him since his mother 's death a year previously .
It reads : ' This is only the culmination of 61 years of living in fear for me , not to mention Mum .
In the event of your trial , you need to know that I will give evidence for the prosecution .
When you die , I will not attend your funeral .'
In fact , Rod insists that when his father does die , he will ' dance on his grave ' .
That would be , he says , a fitting goodbye to a man who has made his family 's life a misery for more than six decades .
' As a child , I recall always feeling afraid of my father , ' says Rod , who grew up in Harrow , North London .
' There was constant tension in the house , numerous loud arguments and I always felt a great concern for my mother , who was a housewife .
' My father , who at the time was a metallurgist , had such an unpredictable temper that you never knew where you stood with him .
WHEN he lost his temper , it was like a bomb going off .
He regularly hit me across the face , even in public , for the smallest of things , such as not being good at maths or getting home late .
' There were certainly no outward displays of love and affection towards my younger sister and I .
' In fact , he seemed to delight in humiliating me .
He often put me down in public , and in front of my friends .
And he liked frightening me , too .
I remember him telling me that if I did not behave , he would send the Red- legged Scissor Man to cut me up in the middle of the night - something that gave me terrifying nightmares for many years .
' My mother , like so many victims of an abusive relationship , led a life in which she simply tried to survive .
' On one occasion , when I was about ten years old , my sister and I were woken in the middle of the night by the sound of her screaming and him shouting .
' We rushed downstairs to see father , his eyes bulging with rage , raising an iron fire poker over mother 's head while she cowered beneath him .
My sister and I were holding hands and totally terrified .
We simply yelled at them to stop . '
Later , when Rod referred to the
incident , his mother laughed it off and said his father had been trying to kill a mouse they 'd spotted in the kitchen .
However , Rod believes that he and his sister 's arrival in the room saved her from what would have been a vicious beating .
' Given what she went through , and the fact she lived in constant fear , I do n't know why my mother did n't leave , ' says Rod .
' But she was a very traditional woman who believed marriage was for life .
She was brought up never to question her husband . '
In 1965 , at the age of 20 , Rod left home , got a job in the City and married his first wife .
He continued to see his parents several times a year .
' By that point , my relationship with my father was reduced to paying lip service only , and I consciously avoided seeing either of my parents because I just found it all too stressful , ' he says .
' Because of the constant tension , my strategy was to avoid my parents as much as possible . '
In 1980 , tragedy struck the family when Rod 's sister died following a routine operation .
SHORTLY afterwards , his parents retired to Dartmouth .
Rod , having divorced after five years , settled down with Roni , who was to become his second wife , and her two children from a previous relationship , and saw his parents only once a year .
' I did n't want Roni or my stepchildren to witness one of my father 's tempers , ' says Rod .
' And it was obvious nothing had changed .
' I remember one occasion when I visited them to help my father assemble a new kitchen .
For no apparent reason , he suddenly dropped his tools , turned to me and started into an enormous rage against my mother , even though she was n't there .
' He was red in the face and his eyes were bulging .
I cannot recall the words he used , but the impression I got was one of total hatred .
' Although I never considered that one day he might go as far as killing her , the depth of his rage was frightening .
I never told my mother about his outburst , and afterwards he acted as though nothing had happened . '
In 1990 , Rod and his wife moved to Canada , where his wife was born .
Over the following years , Rod gained the impression that , with age , his father 's temper was finally beginning to subside .
Indeed , by the time of his parents ' 60th wedding anniversary in September 2001 , Rod even dared to hope that perhaps there was a chance of a more fulfilling relationship with his father .
' I returned home for the celebrations , and although my father did lose his temper at one point because we went to the wrong church for the blessing , we had a fairly nice time and chatted and laughed together like a normal family would .
' Mum , for her part , was by then virtually blind , but still seemed full of life .
She proudly showed off her flower arrangements , telling me she 'd done them all by touch and smell .
' Afterwards , we spoke regularly , but I mostly talked to my mother .
It was always difficult to talk to my father unless it was about the weather or the garden . '
In fact , that visit was to be the last time Rod saw his mother alive .
One Friday in November 2005 , he received a fax at work telling him to call his aunt or the police immediately .
' My first thought was that Dad must have crashed the car , but when I called my aunt she said there was no way she could break the news gently .
My father had killed my mother and I must get home as soon as possible .
' I was stunned and dumbfounded .
The room started spinning and I started shaking .
I felt in a total daze .
' By the time I got home , two local policemen were waiting .
They 'd been sent to break the news .
I was told that Dad had been found slumped at the wheel of his car , reeking of whisky , after crashing into a wall 100 yards from the house .
The police took his keys from him and went to the house to discover Mum , and the cat , dead .
' I heard that my father was telling the police it was a mercy killing to put Mum out of the pain caused by arthritis - but I never believed that for a moment .
She was n't the sort to complain about anything .
Mentally , even at 86 , she was as bright as a button and never failed to miss out on the village gossip .
Besides , if he was
putting
Mum out of her misery , why did he have to butcher the cat as well ?'
Two days after his mother 's killing , Rod and his wife returned to Britain to identify her body .
His father was already in custody .
The sight of his mother 's injuries , says Rod , left him in no doubt of the violence of the attack .
He is quick to point out that were it truly a kind of compassionate euthanasia , there are surely many more humane ways to go about ending a life than with a knife to the heart .
In February 2006 , while in Britain for his mother 's funeral , Rod considered seeing his father for the first time .
' I wanted to confront him about what he'd done , but in the end the authorities would n't let me visit him .
And the more I thought about it , the more I felt I could n't bear to see him anyway .
' Mum was cremated that week and her ashes buried next to her sister .
Many people turned up from the local village and all were very puzzled by the way she 'd met her end .
They 'd all seen my father as this sweet old man .
Only my family and I knew differently . '
In March this year , Herbert Powell went on trial .
Rod had already given a damning police statement in which he detailed his father 's violent nature .
But he was never given the chance to air his views in court .
Within hours , the trial was halted when the judge indicated the medical evidence was too contrasting to enable her to direct a jury .
While the defence argued Powell was not sane of mind and had suffered a stroke , the prosecution said he was clear minded and knew exactly what he was doing .
The judge then accepted Powell 's guilty plea to manslaughter .
' I could n't see my father 's face from the public gallery , but I remember sitting in court listening to his voice and feeling totally disassociated to him , ' says Rod .
' I had no feelings for him whatsoever .
If he'd been found guilty of murder , he would have been the oldest person in Britain to be convicted - and I did n't want that stain on our family history .
BUT likewise , as his plea was accepted , I honestly felt as though he'd got away with it .
Even so , I hoped manslaughter would be enough to see him sent to prison for the rest of his life . '
Days later , Rod visited his parents ' bungalow for the first time .
' I knew it had n't been cleaned , and I thought going there and seeing the crime scene would be traumatic , ' says Rod .
' Actually , it was n't as upsetting as I 'd expected , although seeing Mum 's blood everywhere did confirm to me the brutality that had been used .
I stayed a few nights and sorted out paperwork , sleeping in the living room . '
Last month , sentencing of Herbert Powell finally took place .
' I was horrified when the 19 months he'd spent remanded in custody was considered adequate and he was just let loose , ' says Rod .
' I did n't attend the sentencing , but I heard that someone drove him home afterwards .
To be honest , I wish they 'd made him walk . '
It is clear Rod is still haunted by his mother 's death .
Last October , the stress of what happened became too much and he suffered a breakdown .
He was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrome .
He now has counselling once a week .
' What 's awful about a brutal killing like this is that once it 's happened to your family , you 're stuck with it for life , ' says Rod .
' You can never forget about it or move on .
' My life has been irrevocably changed through no fault of my own .
The fact it was my father who killed my mother only makes it even harder to come to terms with .
' I have no idea what the future will bring , but there is one thing that I am sure of .
I will never forgive my father for what he 's done .
I never want to talk to him again . '
WHEN I WAS a little girl in a convent school , the nuns impressed on me the power of setting a good example .
These beloved teachers are no longer around to instruct the president and his family , so I recommend that the Bushes learn from Mark Twain , who said : “ Always do right .
This will gratify some people and astonish the rest . ”
My suggestion comes after the White House announcement earlier this month that Jenna Bush , one of the president ’s twin daughters , is writing a book on her all - expenses - paid trip to Panama , where she worked for a few weeks as an intern for UNICEF .
Jenna
Bush is quoted as saying she will donate her earnings from her book to UNICEF , a commendable gesture , considering her father ’s net worth of $ 20 million .
But while the 25 - year - old makes the rounds of TV talk shows this fall in a White House limousine , dozens of her contemporaries will be arriving home from Iraq in wooden boxes .
In Britain , Prince Harry is insisting on going off to Iraq — even as his country is reducing its troop commitment .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt showed how the power of good example could also be powerfully good politics .
When he led the country to sacrifice in World War II , his children enlisted and his wife traveled to military bases to counsel and comfort the families of soldiers .
Newsreels showed the president ’s four sons fighting with the Marines in the Pacific , flying with the Army Air Forces in North Africa and landing with the Navy at Normandy .
Soon other public figures followed suit — movie stars ( James Stewart and Clark Gable ) enlisted and sports heroes ( Joe DiMaggio and Hank Greenberg ) went off to war .
The contrast between FDR ’s good example during wartime and that of George W. Bush is stark and sad .
The Bush family rallies to the political campaigns of its scions and spends months on the road raising money and shaking hands to put their men into public office .
In fact , the public image of their cohesive family — the pearl - choked matriarch surrounded by progeny and springer spaniels — helped cinch more than one presidency for the Bushes .
Yet now , when its legacy is most in peril , the family seems to be squandering its good will on a mess of celebridreck .
The president tells us Iraq is a “ noble ” war , but his wife , his children and his nieces and nephews are not listening .
None has enlisted in the armed services , and none seems to be paying attention to the sacrifices of military families .
Until Jenna ’s trip to Panama , the presidential daughters performed community service only when mandated by a court after they were cited for underage drinking .
Since then they have surfaced in public during lavish presidential trips with their parents , bar - hopping outings in Georgetown and champagne - popping art openings in New York .
The first lady , so often lauded for her love of literacy , has not been seen in the reading rooms of veterans ’ hospitals .
The president ’s sister , Doro , publicly picketed Al Gore ’s last days in the vice president ’s mansion as he awaited the Supreme Court ’s decision on the Florida recount of 2000 .
Yet she has been strangely absent from publicly supporting her brother ’s war .
The presidential nieces and nephews also have missed the memo on setting a good public example .
Ashley Bush — the youngest daughter of the president ’s brother , Neil , and Neil ’s ex-wife , Sharon — was presented to Manhattan society at the 52nd Annual International Debutantes Ball at the Waldorf Astoria .
Her older sister , Lauren , a runway model , told London ’s Evening Standard that she is a student ambassador for the United Nations World Food Program , but she would not lobby her uncle for U.S. funds .
Her cousin , Billy Bush , chronicles the lives of celebrities on “ Access Hollywood . ”
“ Uncle Bucky , ” as William H.T.
Bush is known within the family , is one presidential relative who has profited from the Iraq war .
He recently sold all of his shares in Engineered Support Systems Inc. ( ESSI ) , a St. Louis - based company that has flourished under the president ’s no -bid policy for military contractors .
Uncle Bucky told the Los Angeles Times that he would have preferred that ESSI , on whose board he sits , was not involved in Iraq , “ but , unfortunately , we live in a troubled world . ”
The only member of the Bush family to show the strains of our “ troubled world ” is former President George H.W. Bush , who shed tears recently while addressing the Florida Legislature .
The elder Bush was talking about son Jeb ’s gubernatorial loss in 1994 .
Jeb , who was later elected , tried to console him .
But the sobs of Bush 41 seemed to be more about his older son’s “ noble ” war .
Perhaps the father ’s sadness sprang from his own experience fighting in what his parents called “ Mr. Roosevelt ’s war ” — the good war — the war that saved the world from tyranny .
He enlisted at 18 to fly torpedo bombers .
He flew 58 missions in two years and returned home a war hero .
Since then , no one in his large family has seen fit to follow his sterling example of service and patriotism .

The summit will hear that summer rainfall may drop by more than half in the south and east of the country , causing acute water shortages and seriously damaging farms .
...
The papers say that scorching summers will become increasingly frequent with global warming , with " very hot Augusts " - such as in 1995 - happening once every five years by 2050 .
Less rain will fall , and more moisture will evaporate from the soil , causing droughts .
On a Monday morning discussion on Nancy Pelosi ’s Syrian misadventure , NPR talk show host Diane Rehm sneered at the idea of a " so - called liberal press " when some national newspapers were harshly critical of Pelosi ’s bungled remarks abroad .
( It 's about nine minutes into the show if you want to hear the audio . )
She asked her guest John Podesta , the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton :
REHM : John , as you well know , there ’s been a great deal of criticism about the so - called " liberal press . "
How do you account for the fact that so many newspapers as cited here this morning came out very critically against Nancy Pelosi ?
PODESTA : Well , I do n’t know that you know , the Washington Post editorial page , let alone the Wall Street Journal editorial page , I would characterize , particularly on the Middle East , as being liberal .
This exchange emerged after another guest , Georgetown professor Robert Lieber , cited critical editorials in The Washington Post and USA Today after he blasted Pelosi 's belief in a Syrian peace juggernaut :
The trip was a major blunder because of what she said publicly .
She described the road to Damascus as the road to peace , when the reality is Assad of Syria is perhaps the major supporter of terrorism in the region :
In Lebanon , where his people are said to be responsible for the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri ; and for other actions by their secret services in Iraq , where the largest number of foreign fighters , al - Qaeda insurgents and others , come through the Syrian border ; and in Israel where leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are headquartered in Damascus .
The notion that Syria was ready for peace , that she could provide quote , " good offices , " and so forth , was a blunder , and whatever the domestic political consequences here at home , and we do n’t know if there are any , the diplomatic consequences and the signals it sends to the region are very unfortunate for the American national interest .
Rehm 's show airs from the studios of WAMU at American University in Washington , DC , and airs on more than 100 NPR affiliates across America and on NPR Worldwide .
WASHINGTON , July 11 — About 3 p.m. Tuesday , Senator John McCain ducked off the Senate floor , entered the Republican cloakroom and took out his mobile phone .
Just hours after accepting the resignation of his two top campaign aides , he was making a conference call to his top fund - raisers to urge them to keep up the fight .
The call , however , may only have exacerbated an already tough week for Mr. McCain .
Senate ethics rules expressly forbid lawmakers to engage in campaign activities inside Senate facilities .
If Mr. McCain solicited campaign contributions on a call from government property , that would be a violation of federal criminal law as well .
There is no evidence that Mr. McCain has made a habit of making such calls or otherwise exploiting his office for political gain , and he is hardly the first lawmaker to call a donor from under the Capitol dome .
But he made the call as he was in the spotlight because of the staff shake - up , sagging poll numbers and disappointing fund - raising of his Republican presidential primary campaign .
It was the kind of technical mistake that seasoned aides — like the ones his campaign is now letting go — are supposed to prevent .
[ Note : this is part of a webwide series of blog posts about compact fluorescent lightbulbs .
January is the darkest month of the year in the Northern Hemisphere ( December might be a bit darker , but with all the candles , trees and dropping balls , we work hard to light it up ) .
To fight off the darkness , bloggers everywhere are invited to create a post with their own riff on why CF bulbs are cheaper , better politically , harder to market or just plain cute .
Your choice .
If you trackback here , I ’ll post your link in a future post and / or you can add your link to this lens , which donates all royalties to Ecotrust ] .
So , why have only 6 % of all US households installed even one CF lightbulb ?
It ca n’t be the economics .
After all , a typical CF bulb saves the user more than $ 66 over its lifetime .
Count the bulbs in your house , multiply by 66 …
It ca n’t be the environmental impact .
CF bulbs actually reduce the amount of mercury in the environment , because even though there ’s a tiny amount of mercury vapor in each bulb , the amount of coal production they cut down more than makes up for it .
Add to that the hundreds of pounds of greenhouse gases they reduce … ( if you had to buy and bring home the gases with each purchase , I think it would make a difference in the the relative sales ) .
And it ’s not the geopolitical impact either .
If we switched all our bulbs , we could stop importing oil altogether .
Without giving up one Hummer .
So , why are people apparently immune to the benefits .
I mean , why wo n’t we even try one of the bulbs ?
Ready ?
It ’s because of everything you ’ve already read on this page .
Lightbulbs are often the one and only home improvement most people ever make .
Even tenants and college students install lightbulbs .
Installing a lightbulb is so simple that it ’s even the topic of an entire genre of jokes .
( Ten points if you recognized the picture and the joke that goes with it . )
Lightbulbs are simple .
Lightbulbs come in simple packaging .
They represent a trivial decision .
You need a sixty watt bulb , you buy one .
Cheap , please .
CF lightbulbs , on the other hand , did n’t used to be cheap ( they used to cost $ 10 .
Now it ’s $ 2 ) .
Far worse than that , they come in horrible packaging , packaging that belies the entire point of the exercise .
Installing a CF lightbulb is n’t jokeworthy .
It ’s harder .
CF lightbulbs have a story problem , plain and simple .
They need to stop looking so weird , being so expensive and being so hard to open .
Either that , or we could just grow up , suck it up and deal with it .
( And they ’re cheaper ( much cheaper ) now too . )
If you buy three or four and hate them , well , hey , it ’s your choice .
But if your office and your home do n’t have a bunch yet , it ’s a little bit of a bad joke , is n’t it ?
Sometimes , just because a marketer has a story problem it does n’t mean it ’s worth giving up .
I posted an article " The Future of ( Natural ) Gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin ? " a few months ago , suggesting that the numbers suggested for Western Canadian gas in the NRCan report " Canadian Natural Gas Review of 2004 & Outlook to 2020 " were exceedingly optimistic , basing that conclusion on both National Energy Board Scenarios and actual events .
I did not expect that the next NRCan report in the series would reflect this view , but it has since come out , and its contents prompted me to look further back in the series and then to look at how other official and unofficial assessments were changing .
Reserves and Resources

Comparison of the WCSB( Western Canada Sedimentary Basin ) pie charts in these two diagrams shows that 142 Tcf of " Contingent Reserves " have suddenly vanished .
This brings the amounts allegedly still there much more in line with other estimates ( National Energy Board 's and mine ) in my earlier article .
I was curious to see what had been suggested in earlier reports .
Prior to the 2002 review , only the established reserves were reported , but since then figures have been given for other categories of resource ( all in Tcf , 1012 cubic feet ) .

The main points of interest are the explicit splitting of Undiscovered into Conventional and Unconventional parts in the 2005 report , and the abrupt appearance and disappearance of the " Contingent Reserves " .
They were only " there " for two years .
Government agencies are generally the last to acknowledge a problem .
The most recent NRCan report is quite remarkable in that it includes many of the warning signals one usually reads about elsewhere :
Despite record drilling in 2005 , North American production was down 2 % for the year and Canada ’s reserves - to - production ratio remains relatively flat at 9.3 years of production .
Throughout the 1990’s , WCSB natural gas production enjoyed a period of positive growth with limited additional wells .
For example , from 1992 to 1998 , production increased 4.4 Bcf /d with relatively flat drilling levels .
However , since 2000 , an increasing number of wells are required to increase production marginally .
For example , in 2005 , over 18,000 wells were drilled and production increased 0.1 Bcf /d .
Sable Island natural gas production appears to have peaked in 2001 at 190 Bcf .
In 2005 , Sable production declined 5 % from 2004 levels to 139 Bcf .
It is expected that the addition of compression to producing wells in 2007 will temporarily increase production .
More than half of the estimated conventional resource base has already been produced from both the WCSB and the US Lower 48 .
( page iii ) ( page 12 ) ( page 13 ) ( page 13 ) ( page 18 )
The disappearance of the 142 Tcf of Contingent Reserves passes without comment except for this :
Contingent resources are known to exist , but are not marketable on account of their remoteness or lack of means to bring the gas to market .
Therefore , the WCSB does not have any contingent resources .
The lack of comment is perhaps appropriate , since the appearance of the 122 Tcf two years earlier also went without remark .
Given , though , that this much gas would be worth something like $ 1,000,000,000,000 at current prices , either event would surely be expected to have some economic consequences .
The Canadian Gas Association recently produced a report on the Canadian gas supply .
One cannot accuse the CGA of being as even - handed as NRCan .
The report is determinedly upbeat :
Canada 's total remaining natural gas resources are estimated at 375 to 530 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) .
This is equivalent to about 55 to 80 times current production and 110 to 155 times domestic consumption .
The lower end of this range is reasonably consistent with the NRCan total for all areas .
Maybe they found the disappearing 140 Tcf somewhere for the upper figure .
This pales into utter insignificance when compared with estimates of what might be there :
According to PTAC there is more than 4000 tcf of combined unconventional gas in place in Canada , with the upside ranging closer to 30000 tcf .
PTAC is Petroleum Technology Alliance Canada .
Their report on unconventional gas may be obtained here ( big PDF ) .
The CGA does admit to a slight problem :
While natural gas resources are abundant , North America is experiencing a tight supply / demand balance .
With North American production moving towards more remote and unconventional sources , all else being equal , overseas gas supplies will become more competitive .
Predictions of Future Production
Other sources , including Alberta 's Energy Utilities Board do not give as rosy an impression of the Canadian gas situation :
High levels of drilling for gas in recent years have prevented a sharp decline in Alberta ’s production and reserves but lower prices since the spring of 2006 , followed by a drop in drilling , have prompted the EUB to forecast a 2.2 % decline in production this year .
In its supply outlook to 2016 , the EUB expects Alberta ’s gas production will decline by an average of 2.5 % a year even though CBM production is expected to rise to some 593 bcf a year by 2016 .
New pools being found are smaller , show lower initial production rates and steeper decline curves .
A recent Ziff Energy Group study predicts that total Canadian gas production will fall by just over 20 % in the forecast period to 2015 to 13.1 bcf per day from about 16.6 bcf a day in 2006 .
There ’s no quick - fix solution to the many challenges facing western Canada ’s natural gas producers and the current negative economic conditions plaguing the sector are likely to worsen before financial metrics improve , Ziff Energy Group Vice - President of gas services Bill Gwozd said recently .
“ Operating costs have spiraled up .
It ’s tough to get people to do the actual projects .
The big challenge the producers are facing is the new drilling , new product coming onstream .
They ’re looking at $ 9 ( per mcf ) in rolled - in costs , ” Gwozd said while addressing a forum at the Calgary Petroleum Club .
This hardly squares with the abundance described by the Canadian Gas Association .
Coal Bed Methane production is included in the EUB 's projections , and is not expected to provide anywhere near enough gas to stem the decline .
The National Energy Board produces many reports on Canadian natural gas .
The last short - term gas deliverabilty report came out in October 2006 , but an update was issued in May 2007 , to reflect reduced drilling activity in 2006 and 2007 .
Here is the diagram that shows the predicted outlook for Canadian gas deliverability with three different drilling scenarios :
This shows a major event - the Canadian natural gas supply peaked in 2006 .
The production predicted in last year 's report ( grey line ) was not attained because there was reduced drilling .
The solid orange line is now considered the " most likely scenario " or " reference case " for the future :
In the reference case of this update , average annual Canadian gas deliverability is expected to be 476 million m3/d ( 16.81 Bcf /d ) in 2007 and 464 million m3/d ( 16.38 Bcf / d ) in 2008 .
Going down ...
Coal Bed Methane
Much of the hope for future supply rests on Coal Bed Methane .
Canadian production is just getting started , and is included in the forecasts above .
Let 's look at the history of US CBM production :
( Diagram from most recent NRCan gas report )
Production may not have peaked yet , but that from the most prolific states already has .
How much longer will it be before decline of overall US CBM production sets in ?
Arctic Gas
So , how about the future of gas from the Arctic ? :
A new much higher cost of $ 16.2 - billion for the Mackenzie Gas Project to bring Canadian Arctic gas to southern markets has put the project in doubt since it now needs a favourable government fiscal regime to make it economic .
Even then , it would n't be in operation for a while :
Assuming all approvals are in place in 2009 , the earliest the proponents expect to be able to start construction would be the summer of 2010 , when contractors would start shipping materials by barge to location along the Mackenzie river .
This means the earliest date the pipeline could be onstream is 2014 .
It does n't look too good for Alaskan gas either ( report from May , with analysis by Andy Weissman ) :
ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson told reporters after the company 's annual meeting Wednesday that the $ 16.2 billion price tag for the delayed Mackenzie Valley pipeline is too expensive without more government subsidies .
" We are now in a situation where it 's not economic at current costs , " Tillerson said in an article published by The Globe and Mail .
" It may just be that the project is going to have to wait for a different cost environment . "
Weissman said Mackenzie - planned to begin production in 2014 -- is the smaller of two major pipeline projects on the drawing board - the other is a natural gas pipeline to be built next to the existing Alaskan oil pipeline .
Given ExxonMobil 's comment on Mackenzie , it 's unlikely either pipeline will be built , he said .
LNG Imports
Well , what about LNG ?
If LNG is to come to the " rescue " , it must come from somewhere .
Things do n't look very bright on that front either .
Here is Chris Skrebowski , writing on new LNG production capacity :
The reluctance of companies to commit to building new capacity appears to stem from two prime influences .
The first is the rapid inflation in construction costs , which is reported to have reversed all unit costs reductions in the last 20 years .
This means new liquefaction trains will have markedly higher unit costs than recently built ones .
The second uncertainty is the market reaction to high prices .
There has been a tendency to believe gas demand is unresponsive to price .
This belief in the low price elasticity of gas demand has been undermined by the gas demand falls seen in 2006 in the US , Chile , Austria , France , Hungary , the Netherlands , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia , Russia , Switzerland , the Ukraine , the UK and the Philipinnes .
Although special circumstances may account for some of these declines , the general view is that gas prices may have reached the point where demand is impacted .
As a result of these two concerns , virtually all LNG projects not underway are currently being reassessed .
The existing LNG cpacity in the USA has n't been close to being saturated , at least up to the end of 2005 :
( Diagram from most recent NRCan gas report )
One wonders if the enthusiasm for building more ports to receive gas will last , either in Canada or the US , if existing ones are n't near capacity and the supply is in doubt .
Conclusion
The summary of all this can be short .
It is unlikely that the total natural gas supply available in North America ( including imports ) will ever again be as high as it now is .
Get used to using less .
At 4 p.m. on June 8 , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa issued a terse statement announcing that he and his wife , Corina , were separating after 20 years of marriage .
Two hours later , Telemundo television anchor Mirthala Salinas delivered the story to her Spanish - language viewers on the Friday evening news .
“ The rumors were true , ” she declared of the split after an introduction that described the story as a “ political scandal ” that had left “ many people with their mouth open . ”
What Salinas , 35 , did not say in the newscast was that she was the other woman .
She and Villaraigosa , 54 , had been in a relationship even though she had previously been the political reporter assigned to cover local politics and the mayor .
On Tuesday , prompted by a report in the Daily News of Los Angeles , Villaraigosa officially confirmed what had long been whispered around City Hall .
“ I have a relationship with Ms. Salinas , and I take full responsibility for my actions , ” he said at a news conference after a swearing - in ceremony for school board members at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion downtown .
By late afternoon , the Channel 52 anchor had issued her own confirmation .
“ I first got to know the mayor at a professional level , where we went on to become friends , ” she said .
“ The current relationship grew out of our existing friendship . ”
Salinas said that although she and the mayor “ are both public figures , I hope that everyone can understand and respect my desire to maintain my privacy when it comes to personal relationships . ”
Villaraigosa ’s admission cast a fresh shadow over his own personal conduct :
He has two adult daughters born out of wedlock and his wife filed for divorce in 1994 over a separate affair for which he later publicly apologized .
They eventually reconciled .
It may also have damaged his carefully crafted image as a family man , something he has reinforced over the years by appearing with his family in campaign literature and -- until this week -- on the city ’s website .
And it is unclear how the political fallout will treat one of the region ’s most recognizable figures .
The revelation also raised ethical questions about Salinas ’ decision to become involved with a politician she was covering as a journalist .
Several media analysts condemned the relationship as a conflict for her and the mayor and suggested that Salinas ’ bosses should have taken immediate action to remove her from handling any Villaraigosa coverage .
“ There really is no question that this is unacceptable , ” said Kelly McBride , ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg , Fla .
“ You ca n’t sleep with your sources .
This one sort of transcends the boundaries in any ethical newsroom . ”
Telemundo executives defended Salinas and noted that she had been moved in August 2006 from her political beat to cover general assignment stories and serve as a backup anchor .
“ Mirthala Salinas is one of our most respected reporters and a great professional , ” said Manuel Abud , Telemundo ’s general manager in Los Angeles .
“ Telemundo is fully committed to journalistic excellence .
Every day we strive for the highest standards of journalistic ethics and make every effort to protect our objectivity and avoid possible conflicts of interest . ”
Villaraigosa , who called Salinas a “ consummate journalistic professional , ” said she decided about a year ago that “ our friendship had grown to a point where it was necessary to inform her management that she should n’t cover me .
She did that .
And they agreed . ”
The Times traced their relationship back at least 18 months .
In November 2005 -- four months after he was sworn into office -- Villaraigosa was seen one evening by a resident of the Sherman Oaks condominium complex where Salinas lived at the time .
Jean Rouda recalled pulling into the garage about 9 p.m. and seeing Villaraigosa standing alone and buzzing to get into the building .
Rouda said she recognized the mayor and was surprised that he had no security guards and that there was no limousine parked nearby .
She said she and her niece entered the lobby , where they encountered Villaraigosa , who was wearing a dress shirt and slacks , and was carrying bags of takeout food and a bottle of wine .
The two women and Villaraigosa got into the elevator .
He extended his hand to Rouda and introduced himself as Antonio .
“ I look at him and go , ‘ I know who you are .
I know who you ’re going to see .
Tell her I say hi , ’ ” she recalled .
Rouda said she was certain that Villaraigosa was visiting Salinas because everyone else in the 15 - unit complex was “ older and Jewish ” except for her .
“ I knew he was not going to visit an elderly Jewish woman with wine and food , ” she said .
Rouda , a self - described news junkie , said she recalled the chance encounter because it was the night before the funeral of Rosa Parks in Detroit , which she saw reported on television and noticed that Villaraigosa had attended .
Rouda said that at the time , she chose not to tell anyone about meeting the mayor because she thought it was a private matter .
She spoke only after Times reporters contacted her recently .
Salinas subsequently moved to another condo in Studio City .
In the meantime , Villaraigosa and Salinas crossed paths professionally over the next year .
On March 20 , 2006 , Salinas was in New York to cover Villaraigosa , who was visiting Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss education reform .
Three months later , she went to Sacramento to cover Villaraigosa as he stumped for legislation to give him some control over Los Angeles ’ public schools .
Salinas covered a news conference and appears alongside the mayor in pictures taken by a Times photographer .
One of the photographs was published in the newspaper and caught the attention of Villaraigosa ’s staff , who knew of their building relationship and privately worried that word of the affair might leak out .
Then in September 2006 , Villaraigosa played a direct role in the medical care of Salinas ’ mother , Yolanda Avila Fernandez , who was being treated for cancer at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , according to sources familiar with her case .
The mayor consulted with doctors on a regular basis and appeared in Fernandez ’s hospital room with her family on the eighth floor of the complex ’s north tower , serving as an emotional anchor and an unofficial spokesman for Salinas and her siblings .
Fernandez was eventually transferred to USC / Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center east of downtown , where a doctor described the mayor as “ a model citizen . ”
Fernandez died Jan . 4 . Two days later , Villaraigosa flew to Phoenix to attend weekend memorial services for her at the Greer - Wilson Funeral Home .
“ He did come for services , ” said Eddie Lopez , the funeral home ’s general manager .
“ I remember him being there . ”
All along , Villaraigosa and his aides remained silent about the relationship .
Then in late January , rumors about the Villaraigosas ’ shaky marriage escalated after a local Internet blog reported that the mayor and his wife had separated .
In an interview with The Times , Villaraigosa denied the report , which was fueled by the fact that he had stopped wearing his wedding ring , a point cited in the blog item .
Aides said Villaraigosa , who had lost weight , stopped wearing the ring because it was slipping off .
He was wearing it during the interview .
The last time Villaraigosa spoke publicly about his personal life was June 11 , when he held a news conference to talk about the split with Corina Villaraigosa .
At the time , he would say only that he felt a “ personal sense of failure ” about the breakup and hoped everyone would respect his family ’s privacy .
The next day , she filed for divorce .
But speculation continued to build about Salinas , whose name and picture appeared on Internet blogs , along with allegations that she was pregnant .
Asked Tuesday whether Salinas is pregnant , Villaraigosa said : “ I can tell you emphatically that that question is outrageous and the answer is no , she is not pregnant . ”
Villaraigosa is not the first politician to be linked to Salinas .
Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez , ( D - Los Angeles ) , confirmed in a recent interview that he dated Salinas in 2003 when he was divorced from his wife ; the two have since reunited .
Nunez is a longtime Villaraigosa friend and political ally .
Salinas has worked as a radio and television journalist in Los Angeles and Phoenix for more than 13 years , according to her Telemundo biography .
She covered the political beat until she disclosed her relationship with the mayor .
Her duties were then expanded to include general assignment stories and working as a backup anchor , according to a statement from the station and company spokesman Alfredo Richard .
She has been filling in as the anchor on the 6 p.m. news for the last few months while the regular anchor , Lucia Navarro , is on maternity leave .
Salinas did not anchor the broadcast Tuesday night but did appear in file footage in Telemundo ’s report on her relationship with Villaraigosa .
Laura Castaneda , an associate professor of professional practice for the USC Annenberg School of Journalism , criticized Telemundo for allowing Salinas to report on the mayor in any respect , saying it was “ completely inappropriate ” for the station to let Salinas announce the mayor ’s breakup with his wife .
“ I think Telemundo is going to have to really take a hard look at this , ” said Castaneda , who has conducted research about Spanish - language media . "
It does n’t reflect well .
Telemundo has no excuse . ”
On Tuesday , most members of the City Council either declined to comment on Villaraigosa ’s confirmation or said that it was his own business .
That contrasted with hundreds of readers who left comments on The Times ’ website , with some agreeing that it was a private matter while others arguing that it showed a lack of integrity .
“ He has no right to privacy in this matter as he already made a public spectacle of his family values on many occasions , ” one reader wrote .
Another reader posted the opposite .
“ I do n’t care who he sleeps with , I care how he runs the city . ”

Brian May ( left ) handed over his thesis to Professor Paul Nandra
May recently carried out observational work in Tenerife , where he studied the formation of " zodiacal dust clouds " .
The subject forms the basis of a 48,000 - word thesis for Imperial College , London , where 60 - year - old May studied before becoming a rock star .
" It 's been the longest gap year ever , " May said .
" It was a tough decision back then to leave my studies for music . "
But the star said that at the time , his " passion for music was stronger " .
" I 'm so proud to be here today , " he told BBC London .
" Astronomy has always interested me .
I used to love sitting at home and watching Sir Patrick Moore on the Sky at Night . "

The guitarist is scheduled to discuss his thesis with the examining board on 23 August , his spokesman said .
The results should be known some time shortly after that date .
" If I fail I will fail big time , " May said .
" It will be a very public failure with all this press . "
The rock star is also preparing a concert to mark the inauguration of a telescope at the Observatory of the Roque de Los Muchachos in La Palma in the Canary Islands , where he completed his studies last month .
May recently co-authored a book with Sir Patrick Moore
" Nevertheless , as a fan of Queen , I am glad that he left science temporarily , " he added .
May made his first astronomical observations for his thesis at the Observatorio del Teide in Tenerife in 1971 , before his rock career took off .
He recently published a book on astronomy with The Sky at Night presenter Sir Patrick Moore .

Northern Ireland 's Sesame Street is coming soon
Sassy , fluffy and forever cute , Sesame Street , the popular American children 's television series will soon be brought to you , courtesy of the letters N and I ... for Northern Ireland .
The educational children 's show which features fluffy puppet stars helps teach pre-schoolers their numbers and words .
The New York - based company are seeking proposals from production companies and industry professionals for the television production of a local adaptation of Sesame Street .
It will be developed and produced in Northern Ireland and broadcast by BBC - NI .
But in an area where " cookie " means slightly off the wall and never a custard cream , could the " Bikkie Beastie " replace the big blue Cookie Monster ?
And , given the excitement surrounding a whole new era in Irish politics , could Bert 'n Ernie transform into Ian 'n Bertie ?
Kofi Annan says Sesame Street promotes understanding
Children and adults everywhere are looking forward to losing their hearts to little red Elmo with a Ballymena accent or big green Oscar living in a local wheelie bin .
International versions of Sesame Street are given their own Muppets to reflect local issues .
In the Egyptian adaptation , girl Muppet Khokha ( Peach ) wants to be an astronaut or a doctor and serves as a female role model .
The South African version of the popular children 's TV series has an HIV - positive character called Kami to encourage acceptance of people living with the virus .
The sheer popularity of Sesame Street has attracted celebrities and some controversy for the show .
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan , and US first ladies Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton , are among the leaders to have appeared on the show .
And in the Middle East , Israeli and Palestinian show makers have tried to keep a fine balance by writing sequences which combine both Jewish and Arab Muppets .
There have been reports that show has also been put to unlikely uses by US interrogators in Iraq .
In 2003 , it emerged they had tormented captives with the Sesame Street theme music in an attempt to make them talk .
Sesame Workshop 's Beatrice Chow , however , called this an " unfounded rumour " .

' Dark horse ' Paul : ' The majority of Americans are with me ' David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Monday May 21 , 2007 Print This Email
This ' Dark horse ' presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) believes that " that the majority of Americans are with me , " regarding his harsh insurgent attacks on President Bush 's Iraq policies .
During CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer host John King asked Paul a hypothetical question , in reference to the war in Iraq : " If China took back Taiwan today , you say go to the Congress , or does the president not have the authority as commander in chief ? "
" Absolutely he does not have the authority , " Paul said .
" Where does he get it ?
You ca n't go to war without Congressional approval .
And that 's not a threat to our national security .
That 's something internal affairs .
Why should we send hundreds of thousands of Americans to die in a civil war ? "
Paul added , " I mean , are we over in Russia right now over Chechnya ?
I mean , it would n't make any sense .
Did we go to war over Hong Kong ? "
" We should follow the Constitution and the advice of the founders , " Paul continued .
" Do n't go looking for dragons to slay .
I mean , why should we go and provoke and look for trouble ?
We should talk to people , negotiate , be diplomatic and trade with people . "
Paul also blasted criticism that he is n't " Republican enough . "
" I support the Republican platform better than any other candidate , I am convinced of , " Paul insisted .
" Take out the platform .
They 're for less government .
They 're for personal liberty .
We ran on our program in 2000 for a humble foreign policy . "
Paul asked incredulously , " How can anybody say I 'm not Republican ?
I 'm the most conservative member of the Congress .
I vote for the least amount of spending and the least amount of taxes , and they say I 'm not Republican enough ? "
" I mean , why do n't you challenge that side rather than challenging me and feed into the frenzy that say get rid of the reporter , get rid of the person delivering the information rather than dealing with the information , " Paul added .
" Non-intervention is a real political victory .
We cannot win as Republicans next year if we just continue to dig our heels in , send more men and women over there to die on a policy that has failed . "
Paul said that " Republicans are scared to death to face up to the truth .
And my job is to make them face up to it and show them that the majority of Americans are with me , not with the current foreign policy that we 're following . "
" Low in the polls but certainly shaking and stirring things up in the Republican race , " CNN's King remarked at the end of the interview .
The following video is from CNN's Late Edition .
Full transcript of Paul interview : # KING : The ten Republican presidential candidates squared off in South Carolina this week .
And although he 's languishing in the polls , Texas Congressman Ron Paul managed to grab a big share of the attention .
He joins us now live from Houston .
Congressman Paul , thanks for joining us .
Let 's show our viewers right away the moment in that debate which captured so much attention and became such a flashpoint .
You were speaking , and the former New York City mayor , Rudy Giuliani , jumped in .
Let 's listen .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) PAUL :
They attack us because we 've been over there .
We 've been bombing Iraq for ten years .
GIULIANI : That is an extraordinary statement , as someone who lived through the attack of September 11 , that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq .
I do n't think I 've ever heard that before , and I 've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) KING : Now , Congressman Paul , the mayor asked you to withdraw that statement , and you did not .
I want to walk through that .
You firmly believe , sir , that because of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East , including the first Persian Gulf war , that we invited , is that -- would that be the word you would use , we invited the 9/11 attacks ?
PAUL : Well , it 's not so much like it's a subjective belief .
It 's just an evaluation of the facts .
If you study the people who understand the Middle East , like Michael Scheuer and others , and look at the 9/11 Commission report , that 's the evidence they provide that was one of the excuses .
One of the strongest statements for the position I hold comes from no other than Paul Wolfowitz , who said right after we invaded Iraq that this was a major , major event because we could take our troops out of Saudi Arabia , recognizing that was the motivation for recruiting for Al Qaida and their motivation for their hatred toward us .
So there 's a lot of evidence .
I do n't think we should deal with the subjective .
I think we should deal with the objective position of whether or not those who really understand the Middle East support what I had said .
KING : Well , let me ask you more broadly about your views on foreign policy then .
Obviously , you believe the United States should have a limited role in the world , especially in terms of projecting military force .
So , if Kim Jong
Il rolled south into South Korea today , should the United States intervene ?
PAUL : Well , it depends on what the Congress says .
We certainly should n't do what we did in -- under the Truman administration , go in under our U.N. resolution .
You go to the Congress and find out if it 's a threat to our national security .
I personally would think right now that it is n't a threat to our national security .
I want to make a point , though , that if we were n't over there , I think Korea would be unified like South Vietnam or Vietnam is unified .
They have railroads now opened up between the two .
They want to share information .
KING : Let me jump in .
I do n't want to solve the problems of the Korean peninsula today .
I do want to get your views on foreign policy .
Let me give you another example .
If China took back Taiwan today , you say go to the Congress , or does the president not have the authority as commander in chief ?
PAUL : Absolutely he does not have the authority .
Where does he get it ?
You ca n't go to war without Congressional approval .
And that 's not a threat to our national security .
That 's something internal affairs .
Why should we send hundreds of thousands of Americans to die in a civil war ?
I mean , are we over in Russia right now over Chechnya ?
I mean , it would n't make any sense .
Did we go to war over Hong Kong ?
We should follow the Constitution and the advice of the founders .
Do n't go looking for dragons to slay .
I mean , why should we go and provoke and look for trouble ?
We should talk to people , negotiate , be diplomatic and trade with people .
We do much better trading with Vietnam than we did with fighting with them , and we lost 60,000 men there .
It makes so much common sense and is so appealing to the majority of Americans .
Let me tell you , I really believe that .
KING : You have received some criticism .
Some say you are the person who does n't belong in a Republican debate .
You were a past libertarian candidate for president , of course .
You have views that are out of what many would think of the mainstream , at least in today 's Republican Party .
I want to read you some of the criticism that came out after this last debate and ask you to respond to the politics of it .
These are some comments made of your performance .
Here 's Roger Simon writing in The Politico : " In terms of the presidency , nobody cares what Ron Paul says , perhaps not even Ron Paul . "
Gloria Borger writing in U.S. News and World Report : " Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , who gives new meaning to the question asked by Ross Perot 's former running mate , Admiral James Stockdale : ' Who am I ?
Why am I here ? ' " And in The Daily News of New York , an editorial : " Ron Paul , whose performance Tuesday proved him the Sanjaya of the political arena . "
What do you make of the critics who say , why is this guy in a Republican debate ?
If he wants to run , run as the Libertarian .
PAUL : Well , I would ask you why you pick out three when I could find you probably 1,000 that contradict exactly what you say .
I would say that I 'm more Republican than they are .
The Republican tradition is always to win on the peace position .
Democrats have always won or , you know , got us into war .
We got out of Korea with Eisenhower .
We got out of Vietnam with , eventually , with Nixon .
We ran on a peace program in the year 2000 .
No world policemen , no nation - building , humble foreign policy .
Peace is a positive message , not a negative message .
You do n't win by -- politically , you do n't win .
There 's a strong tradition of non-intervention in the Republican Party .
That is the American position .
That is the constitutional position .
That is the very strong advice from the founders .
So when they attack me and say , silence Ron Paul , they 're saying silence the constitution , silence the advisers , the founders of the country , silence our platform , close down the big tent , make it narrow .
And as long as you agree with a foreign policy that is failing , then it 's OK to be a Republican .
I do n't buy into that , and neither do the American people .
KING : Let me jump into what comes next .
You 're about 1 percent in the polls , and many say , whether they agree or disagree with your views , there are many who say at some point you need to have fewer candidates on the stage for these debates to be meaningful .
The chairman of the Michigan Republican Party says he 's going to try to get you -- and perhaps others , but you specifically -- pushed out of future debates .
He said of you : " I think he would have felt more comfortable on the stage with the Democrats in what he said last night and I think he is a distraction in the Republican primary , does not represent the base of the party , does not represent the party . "
That 's Saul Anuzis , the chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Michigan , who says , among other things , he thinks you do n't deserve a spot on the stage .
Will you continue to be in the Republican debates and at some point , forget your name for a second , forget your candidacy , should they be winnowed down to fewer candidates ?
PAUL : Well , why do you pick that statement that has been discredited and removed ?
The chairman of the Michigan party now has withdrawn that .
He has given up on that .
Why do n't you let the people decide ?
Why do you want to eliminate democracy ?
Why stomp out the grassroots candidate and only reward those with $ 100 million that get money from the special interests ?
That 's not very democratic .
I support the Republican platform better than any other candidate , I am convinced of .
Take out the platform .
They 're for less government .
They 're for personal liberty .
We ran on our program in 2000 for a humble foreign policy .
How can anybody say I 'm not Republican ?
I 'm the most conservative member of the Congress .
I vote for the least amount of spending and the least amount of taxes , and they say I 'm not Republican enough ?
I mean , why do n't you challenge that side rather than challenging me and feed into the frenzy that say get rid of the reporter , get rid of the person delivering the information rather than dealing with the information .
Non-intervention is a real political victory .
We cannot win as Republicans next year if we just continue to dig our heels in , send more men and women over there to die on a policy that has failed .
That is the issue .
Republicans are scared to death to face up to the truth .
And my job is to make them face up to it and show them that the majority of Americans are with me , not with the current foreign policy that we 're following .
KING : Congressman Ron Paul of Texas , Republican candidate for president .
Low in the polls but certainly shaking and stirring things up in the Republican race .
Congressman , thanks for joining us today on " Late Edition . " #
New documentary traces mismanagement , poor decisions in post- invasion Iraq Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This Dozens of people are dying daily .
Roadside bombs kill American soldiers and Marines .
Al Qaeda fighters have infiltrated parts of the country .
The Iraqi government is not meeting benchmarks associated with President Bush 's recent " surge " in troops .
The war in Iraq clearly is not going well , and calls for US troops to come home are growing ever louder .
A new documentary , to be released later this month , asks a simple question :
How did we get to this point ?
The film , No End in Sight , an advance copy of which provided to RAW STORY , focuses mostly on the mismanagement by ill - informed US officials overseeing the post - combat occupation , rather than delving too deeply into the misinformation fed to the American people in the run-up to war .
Through interviews with former administration officials , military members , journalists and scholars , No End in Sight returns to the months following the US invasion .
It shows how decisions made by Bush , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and their acolytes have created the disastrous situation that exists on the ground now .
A clip of the film , which is reproduced below exclusively on RAW STORY , shows just how far off the administration was in its initial estimates on how the war and its aftermath would be handled .
Army Col. Paul Hughes recalled former Defense Department spokesman Lawrence DiRita promising to have all but 25,000 - 30,000 troops out of Iraq by the end of August 2003 .
" I heard him say that , in a room full of people , " said Hughes , who was director of strategic policy for the US occupation in 2003 .
" And I turned to my colleagues and I said , ' This guy does n't know what he 's talking about .
It 's physically impossible . ' "
More striking than the myopic expectations within the Defense Department are the shortsighted decisions made by those overseeing Iraq 's reconstruction , especially the US - sponsored Coalition Provisional Authority .
The film identifies three fateful decisions by then - CPA head Paul Bremer that laid the groundwork for the insurgency US troops continue to fight four - and - a - half years after the war 's start .
First , Bremer reversed the decision of Gen. Jay Garner , who had been overseeing Iraq 's reconstruction prior to his arrival , to form an interim Iraqi government .
More fateful was his decision to remove former members of the Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath Party from their positions in government .
" De-Ba'athification was so deep that we were n't able to get the government running as efficiently as we should have as fast as we should have , and you had a lot of disenfranchised Ba'athists , " Garner says as the film shows clips of out - of - work Iraqis marching in the streets .
Bremer 's " most explosive " decision , according to the film , was disbanding the Iraqi military and intelligence services , which rendered unemployed 500,000 armed men who helped create an insurgency rather than working to prevent one .
Hughes recounts in the film having to send away former Iraqi soldiers who wanted to help American troops because of the policy .
He recalled the effects of that order on American troops .
" Five days after Bremer issued his order , we were fare - welling Jay Garner because he was going to leave Iraq for good , the next day .
We had two Humvees on the highway heading out from the Green Zone and they were ambushed and two soldier were killed , " Hughes said .
" And that was , in my mind , when the insurgency began . "
The film is set to be released July 27 .

Genetic tests have established that a white woman who gave birth to black twins after an unprecedented in - vitro fertilisation mix - up in Britain is their biological mother , a court said today .
A black man whose sperm might have been used by mistake instead of sperm from the woman 's husband has also been identified .
The black man and his wife were receiving treatment at the same state - run fertility clinic , the court statement said .
The case has attracted a barrage of publicity since coming to light earlier this month , prompting the government to launch an investigation to find out how the mix - up occurred .
The huge potential of agricultural soils to reduce greenhouse gases and increase production at the same time has been reinforced by new research findings at NSW Department of Primary Industries ’ ( DPI ) Wollongbar Agricultural Institute in Australia .
Trials of agrichar - a product hailed as a saviour of Australia ’s carbon - depleted soils and the environment - have doubled and , in one case , tripled crop growth when applied at the rate of 10 tonnes per hectare .
Agrichar is a black carbon byproduct of a process called pyrolysis , which involves heating green waste or other biomass without oxygen to generate renewable energy .
Tim Flannery is a major advocate of agrichar and pyrolysis .
In The Bulletin magazine , Flannery recently ranked “ fostering pyrolysis - based technologies ” fourth among his five steps for saving the planet , because they convert crop waste into fuel and agrichar which can be used to enhance soil fertility and store carbon long - term .
NSW DPI senior research scientist Dr Lukas Van Zwieten said soils naturally turn over about 10 times more greenhouse gas on a global scale than the burning of fossil fuels .
“ So it is not surprising there is so much interest in a technology to create clean energy that also locks up carbon in the soil for the long term and lifts agricultural production , ” he said .
The trials at Wollongbar have focused on the benefits of agrichar to agricultural productivity .
“ When applied at 10t / ha , the biomass of wheat was tripled and of soybeans was more than doubled , ” said Dr Van Zwieten .

“ This percentage increase remained the same when applications of nitrogen fertiliser were added to both the agrichar and the control plots .
“ For the wheat , agrichar alone was about as beneficial for yields as using nitrogen fertiliser only .
And that is without considering the other benefits of agrichar . ”
Regarding soil chemistry , Dr Van Zwieten said agrichar raised soil pH at about one - third the rate of lime , lifted calcium levels and reduced aluminium toxicity on the red ferrosol soils of the trial .
“ Soil biology improved , the need for added fertiliser reduced and water holding capacity was raised , ” he said .
The trials also measured gases given off from the soils and found significantly lower emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide ( a greenhouse gas more than 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide ) .

NSW DPI environmental scientist Steve Kimber said an added benefit for both the farmer who applies agrichar and the environment is that the carbon in agrichar remains locked up in the soil for many years longer than , for example , carbon applied as compost , mulch or crop residue .
“ We broadly categorise carbon in the soil as being labile ( liable to change quickly ) or stable – depending on how quickly they break down and convert into carbon dioxide , ” he said .
“ Labile carbon like crop residue , mulch and compost is likely to last two or three years , while stable carbon like agrichar will last up to hundreds of years .
“ This is significant for farmer costs because one application of agrichar may be the equivalent of compost applications of the same weight every year for decades .
“ For the environment , it means soil carbon emissions can be reduced because rapidly decomposing carbon forms are being replaced by stable ones in the form of agrichar . ”
Unfortunately , agrichar is not widely available .
BEST Energies Australia , a company involved with NSW DPI in the trials , has a pilot plant at Gosford which is producing minimal amounts for research purposes .
“ We are hoping the technology will take hold and pyrolysis plants will be built where there is a steady stream of green or other biomass waste providing clean energy that is carbon negative , ” Dr Van Zwieten said .
“ But until pyrolysis plants are up and running , the availability of agrichar for farmers will be scarce . ”
Under the Bush administration 's theory of creating regional stability by supporting islands of democracy , leaders in Somaliland say it should be a shoo - in for official recognition as Africa 's newest nation state .
Instead , this breakaway republic , which declared independence from Somalia in 1991 , is marooned in diplomatic limbo .
Having not yet achieved statehood , it is without access to formal trade agreements or international financial institutions such as the World Bank .
" The international community has abandoned us , " says Hussein Ali Nur , editor of the weekly English - language Republican newspaper published here in Somaliland 's capital , Hargeisa .
" America talks about supporting democracy , but everything is distorted by the fight against terrorism .
Our success is overshadowed by [ US ] strategic interests in Somalia . "
During the last 16 years , as Somalia has torn itself apart , Somaliland 's leaders have disbanded a guerrilla movement , drafted a constitution , and held multiparty elections .
Development consultant Mark Bradbury , who monitored parliamentary elections in 2005 , says the republic performs as well as , if not better than , other countries in the region , such as Ethiopia and Eritrea , on public participation in the democratic process and freedom of speech .
Said Noor , the foreign minister , goes one step further : " We have created a modern , African parliamentary system .
It 's a model for the region . "
The house of representatives is directly elected and the upper house , the house of guurti , is composed of clan elders .
Both houses are based on ethnic power - sharing quotas .
Bradbury says the arrangement has helped to foster stability by accommodating traditional social structures .
While Somalia is fractured by tension between numerous clans , Somaliland is more homogenous – dominated by one single clan , the Isaq .
This social cohesion has played a large part in defining Somaliland 's sense of identity and promoting the notion of a separate future .
But not one country has endorsed its claims of sovereignty .
Political scientist Roland Marchal at the Center for International Studies and Research in Paris says the US – and the rest of the international community – may well support Somaliland to achieve independence in the long run , but " timing is everything .
What 's to be achieved by recognizing a breakaway region in the middle of a bloody and protracted civil war ? "
For now , the US State Department seems content to follow the lead of the African Union , which says it 's focused on resuscitating failed states such as Somalia – not breakaway republics .
Some African analysts believe Somaliland 's independence could form part of a future peace deal within a solution for the whole of Somalia – but fulfilling Somaliland 's ambition prematurely could undermine Somalia 's fragile Transitional Federal government ( TFG ) , still fighting to establish control over the capital , Mogadishu .
A former British protectorate , Somaliland achieved independence in 1960 , but quickly joined with former Italian territories to form Somalia .
" We jumped too soon , " says Mr. Noor .
" It was a mistake . "
Key posts in the new unity government went to southerners from Mogadishu , and Somalilanders rapidly felt excluded .
Their mounting resentment gave birth to a rebel movement that Somalia 's dictator , Said Barré , attempted to crush .
His bombing raids of the main urban centers in 1988 killed 50,000 people and left Hargeisa in ruins .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misstated the date of the bombing raids . ]
Mr. Barré was ousted in 1991 , starting the civil war in Somalia that is still raging – but Somalia 's implosion was Somaliland 's moment of opportunity .
Now its population of 3 million Sunni Muslims wants nothing more to do with rule from Mogadishu .
Noor , a former guerrilla , says that memories of Barré 's repression are still so bitter that " any political leaders who agreed to reunification would be killed one by one by our own people . "
Bradbury thinks foreign diplomats could learn a lot from Somaliland 's experience of reconciliation and reconstruction .
He notes that Somaliland " has made huge strides with minimal outside interference , and that has n't been allowed to happen in Somalia . "
While the international community maintains a close interest in Mogadishu 's future , Bradbury is concerned that Somaliland is not strategically important enough for foreign governments to invest the time and resources required in recognizing and sustaining independence .
" Paradoxically , " he says , " that may have contributed to its achievements to date . "
Frequent readers of this Blog know that I have been using a new kind of software to help track hidden aspects of the business cycle , both for our customers and for my own interests .
The working theory here is that the data you can get from government and industry reporting agencies are no longer inherently honest – that they are perhaps a bit cooked to lessen the down side and the up side .
Not because of some vast Illuminati / Freemason conspiracy , but because it makes good business and political sense for them to do so .
That was one reason for creating systems like Hardtack – to report the numbers and let you make up your own mind if they are good or bad for you and your families .
We have already reported on the housing market , and the mortgage melt down in what has been called “ Sub Prime ” , and the next shoe to drop being “ Alt - A ” , typically high value loans or other situations that took it outside the conforming funding limits .
While these future trends will provide a nasty drag on an otherwise good economy , the real rot lies with a fundamental re-training and re-conditioning of the US consumer over the past decade or so .
To put it bluntly – consumers no longer spend according to their income , but according to their credit lines .
This has lead to an enormous expansion in consumer credit , and most families no longer budget to spend the amount they make minus a percentage set aside for savings .
Rather they look at how much the can afford to spend each month servicing debt , and they spend until they run out of debt service money .
If you ever wondered how people were affording new Hummers , 3 week vacations to Fiji every year , this can explain it .
If you are a throw - back and set aside at least 10 % of your income for saving and spend the rest , you may have wondered what you were doing wrong .
Enter the housing boom .
The housing boom ( or bubble ) could never have gotten to where it has without it ’s power supply – a huge bloated bubble in credit .
During the height of the madness people were outbidding each other on properties $ 600 K and up .
Not an army of lawyers , doctors or .com millionaires , but regular working people .
They would only do this because they had very little “ real ” money of their own in the game , and they had financing that would let them afford the monthly payment or a while , and get the house they always wanted .
Meanwhile , people who bought before the craziness were encourages to leverage their property , extracting cash for whatever reason ; rational or hedonistic .
A case in point – one of my neighbors has decided to sell his house .
It ’s a nice little house in a nice little area .
He bought it in the mid 90 ’s for around $ 120 K .
Now it is on the market for $ 390 K , which seems to me to be an amazing price for 1200 Square Feet of California .
He has been on the market a month with no serious offers .
If he were eager he could lower his price , but sadly he cannot .
He is mortgaged and HELOCed up to over $ 350 K .
This is no different than seeing consumer spending soar month after month several percentage points faster and higher than income growth .
When you see that , you know the American public is taking on more debt .
There is only one way this can end – badly .

Iran is secretly forging ties with al - Qaida elements and Sunni Arab militias in Iraq in preparation for a summer showdown with coalition forces intended to tip a wavering US Congress into voting for full military withdrawal , US officials say .
" Iran is fighting a proxy war in Iraq and it's a very dangerous course for them to be following .
They are already committing daily acts of war against US and British forces , " a senior US official in Baghdad warned .
" They [ Iran ] are behind a lot of high - profile attacks meant to undermine US will and British will , such as the rocket attacks on Basra palace and the Green Zone [ in Baghdad ] .
The attacks are directed by the Revolutionary Guard who are connected right to the top [ of the Iranian government ] . "
The official said US commanders were bracing for a nationwide , Iranian - orchestrated summer offensive , linking al - Qaida and Sunni insurgents to Tehran 's Shia militia allies , that Iran hoped would trigger a political mutiny in Washington and a US retreat .
" We expect that al - Qaida and Iran will both attempt to increase the propaganda and increase the violence prior to Petraeus 's report in September [ when the US commander General David Petraeus will report to Congress on President George Bush 's controversial , six - month security " surge " of 30,000 troop reinforcements ] , " the official said .
" Certainly it [ the violence ] is going to pick up from their side .
There is significant latent capability in Iraq , especially Iranian - sponsored capability .
They can turn it up whenever they want .
You can see that from the pre-positioning that 's been going on and the huge stockpiles of Iranian weapons that we 've turned up in the last couple of months .
The relationships between Iran and groups like al - Qaida are very fluid , " the official said .
" It often comes down to individuals , and people constantly move around .
For instance , the Sunni Arab so - called resistance groups use Salafi jihadist ideology for their own purposes .
But the whole Iran- al - Qaida linkup is very sinister . "
Iran has maintained close links to Iraq 's Shia political parties and militias but has previously eschewed collaboration with al - Qaida and Sunni insurgents .
US officials now say they have firm evidence that Tehran has switched tack as it senses a chance of victory in Iraq .
In a parallel development , they say they also have proof that Iran has reversed its previous policy in Afghanistan and is now supporting and supplying the Taliban 's campaign against US , British and other Nato forces .
Tehran 's strategy to discredit the US surge and foment a decisive congressional revolt against Mr Bush is national in scope and not confined to the Shia south , its traditional sphere of influence , the senior official in Baghdad said .
It included stepped - up coordination with Shia militias such as Moqtada al - Sadr 's Jaish al - Mahdi as well as Syrian - backed Sunni Arab groups and al - Qaida in Mesopotamia , he added .
Iran was also expanding contacts across the board with paramilitary forces and political groups , including Kurdish parties such as the PUK , a US ally .
" Their strategy takes into account all these various parties .
Iran is playing all these different factions to maximise its future control and maximise US and British difficulties .
Their co-conspirator is Syria which is allowing the takfirists [ fundamentalist Salafi jihadis ] to come across the border , " the official said .
Any US decision to retaliate against Iran on its own territory could be taken only at the highest political level in Washington , the official said .
But he indicated that American patience was wearing thin .
Warning that the US was " absolutely determined " to hit back hard wherever it was challenged by Iranian proxies or agents inside Iraq , he cited the case of five alleged members of the Revolutionary Guard 's al - Quds force detained in Irbil in January .
Despite strenuous protests from Tehran , which claims the men are diplomats , they have still not been released .
" Tehran is behaving like a racecourse gambler .
They 're betting on all the horses in the race , even on people they fundamentally do n't trust , " a senior administration official in Washington said .
" They do n't know what the outcome will be in Iraq .
So they 're hedging their bets . "
The administration official also claimed that notwithstanding recent US and British overtures , Syria was still collaborating closely with Iran 's strategy in Iraq .
" 80 % to 90 % " of the foreign jihadis entering Iraq were doing so from Syrian territory , he said .
Despite recent diplomatic contacts , and an agreement to hold bilateral talks at ambassadorial level in Baghdad next week , US officials say there has been no let - up in hostile Iranian activities , including continuing support for violence , weapons smuggling and training .
" Iran is perpetuating the cycle of sectarian violence through support for extra-judicial killing and murder cells .
They bring Iraqi militia members and insurgent groups into Iran for training and then help infiltrate them back into the country .
We have plenty of evidence from a variety of sources .
There 's no argument about that .
That 's just a fact , " the senior official in Baghdad said .
In trying to force an American retreat , Iran 's hardline leadership also hoped to bring about a humiliating political and diplomatic defeat for the US that would reduce Washington 's regional influence while increasing Tehran 's own .
But if Iran succeeded in " prematurely " driving US and British forces out of Iraq , the likely result would be a " colossal humanitarian disaster " and possible regional war drawing in the Sunni Arab Gulf states , Syria and Turkey , he said .
Despite such concerns , or because of them , the US welcomed the chance to talk to Iran , the senior administration official said .
" Our agenda starts with force protection in Iraq , " he said .
But there were many other Iraq - related issues to be discussed .
Recent pressure had shown that Iran 's behaviour could be modified , the official claimed : " Last winter they were literally getting away with murder . "
But tougher action by security forces in Iraq against Iranian agents and networks , the dispatch of an additional aircraft carrier group to the Gulf and UN security council resolutions imposing sanctions had given Tehran pause , he said .
Washington analysts and commentators predict that Gen Petraeus 's report to the White House and Congress in early September will be a pivotal moment in the history of the four - and - a - half - year war - and a decision to begin a troop drawdown or continue with the surge policy will hinge on the outcome .
Most Democrats and many Republicans in Congress believe Iraq is in the grip of a civil war and that there is little that a continuing military presence can achieve .
" Political will has already failed .
It 's over , " a former Bush administration official said .
A senior adviser to Gen Petraeus reported this month that the surge had reduced violence , especially sectarian killings , in the Baghdad area and Sunni - dominated Anbar province .
But the adviser admitted that much of the trouble had merely moved elsewhere , " resulting in spikes of activity in Diyala [ to the north ] and some areas to the south of the capital " .
" Overall violence is at about the same level [ as when the surge began in February ] . "
Iranian officials flatly deny US and British allegations of involvement in internal violence in Iraq or in attacks on coalition forces .
Interviewed in Tehran recently , Mohammad Reza Bagheri , deputy foreign minister for Arab affairs with primary responsibility for Iran 's policy in Iraq , said : " We believe it would be to the benefit of both the occupiers and the Iraqi people that they [ the coalition forces ] withdraw immediately . "

What change has made the most difference in making you effective ?
Mmmm …tough question .
Ironically , I think having less time available for discretionary projects has made me more effective in the areas of my life that I choose to spend time in .
So get married , have kids and take a job that keeps you busy all the time : it ’ll make you more effective !
Brendon Connelly from Slacker Manager ( rss )
This seems counterintuitive , but I guess it makes sense .
Having more stuff to do should help force you to be more efficient .
The two - minute rule I learned from reading David Allen ’s Getting Things Done .
If a task takes less than two - minutes to do , do n’t put it off , just do it .
Chanpory Rith from LifeClever ( rss )
This is a pretty powerful tip based around the idea that switching contexts is often more expensive ( timewise ) than the actual task at hand .
Getting up early .
I started getting up at 4:30 – 5:00 am for a job I had about 10 years ago .
My work schedule was 6:30 am to 3:00 pm , and when I left that job for a “ 9 - to - 5 - er ” I kept the habit of getting up early in order to get a few things done before I went to work , while the house was quiet .
I have kept that up for the past 8 years and since I have started my “ Getting Things Done ” practice my productivity has skyrocketed in those early morning hours .
Before I go to bed I make a list of things that I ’d like to accomplish when I get up , and then I am able to get started on my Next Actions while the coffee is brewing .
Those 90 minutes are typically my most productive of the entire day .
Stephen Smith from HD BizBlog 1.2 ( rss )
I find myself switching back and forth between getting up early and staying up late .
When I ’m doing programming , I find that I get more done late at night after everyone else has gone to sleep .
I think this is because I will tackle difficult problems that will take an undetermined amount of time .
Late at night I know I wo n’t be interrupted if it takes 1 hour or 4 hours .
When I try to do these types of projects during the day , I end up getting frustrated because 45 minutes into it , I ’m interrupted and basically have to start again .
Projects that take a specified amount of time work well for me in the morning .
So getting up at 5 to exercise for 45 minutes or read for an hour works great .
Realizing that my brain is not as effective as I ’d like to think it is .
For the longest time , I was confident I could process and remember everything : despite the fact that I forgot appointments , double - booked appointments , missed much of what I need to do , and more .
Once I acknowledged that I needed a system to keep me on track , I became much more effective and efficient at what I did .
In spite of that realization , this is still the most challenging area in my personal productivity .
It does n’t take much for me to forget to use my systems .
Then , as things drift out of control , I have to force myself back to the basics .
Ian McKenzie from Ian ’s Messy Desk ( rss )
Getting things out of your head and on to paper is what I consider the most useful concept from GTD .
It is amazing how much cognitive noise we carry around in our heads .
It is no wonder we have trouble concentrating when 50 % of our attention is tending to random things in the background .
48 Minutes of focused work time ( singletasking )
John Richardson from Success Begins Today ( rss )
John ’s idea of focusing on a task for 48 minutes and then taking a 12 minute break by doing something else is a good one .
I think we all tend to under estimate the value of taking breaks and giving our brains a chance to process and deal with things subconsciously .
I think the biggest thing has been finding a long - term goal I ’m passionate about ( building a popular website ) and constantly working on it .
Actually doing something is the biggest part .
We can hope and pray all we want , but nothing happens until you start doing , get some results , and adjust accordingly .
Doing also gives your mind something focus on instead of worrying about the future and other stuff you ca n’t control .
John Wesley from Pick the Brain : An Analytical Approach to Self Improvement ( rss )
Having a good idea is easy .
Executing the idea is where most people fail .
With my clients , I generally give them my ideas and recommendations for free , but I charge for execution .
This is quite a bit different from what most other consultants do and lets me standout from the crowd .
Some people develop a habit of executing ideas .
The more they do the easier it becomes .
Many people develop a habit that is the opposite of this and become less and less effective at actually doing .
Understanding my values .
For example , learning is very important to me , so I know that time spent reading versus time spent lounging around is more effective for me because it makes me feel more fulfilled .
Alvin Soon from Life Coaches Blog
I think defining your values is one of the more difficult things in life .
We are so conditioned to just repeat cultural values instead of really defining what is valuable to us as individuals .
Setting specific goals that tie back to the things I most value in life , and following my gut .
Combining focus with intuition is very powerful .
Tony D. Clark from Success from the Nest ( rss )
Intuition is not something I feel I ’m particularly good at following .
I am still learning to differentiate between intuition and wishful thinking .
Reading .
Not just RSS feeds and tips posts ( not to be too self - deprecating … ) but actual books .
The kind made with paper .
Books are a window into the collective knowledge of the world .
Although I ’m not a believer that one idea can change everything , reading would come close .
Going from reading several books a year to several books a month has to be my most profitable change .
Scott Young from Scott H Young ( rss )
I once took a job and moved across the country because it would let me spend more time reading –even though it involved taking $ 30,000 per year cut in pay .
Most of the people I greatly respect from history invested a considerable amount of time reading .
With the easy availability of content on the internet , it is easy to forget the value of reading actual books .
The amount of intellectual effort that goes into writing a 300 page volume is considerably more than what is required to write a bunch of 300 word blog post .
As far as developing your brain , the depth of thought required in reading a well written book is considerably more than spending an equivalent amount of time reading blog entries on the same topic .
I ’ve learned that to be productive , I have to “ create ” blocks of time in which I can zone in and get things done .
The environment needs to be conducive but more importantly , my mindset has to be singularly focused on one task at a time .
Eventually it just adds up to a productive state that you “ tap into ” on a daily basis .
Mike St. Pierre from The Daily Saint ( rss )
With the recent addition to our family , I ’m learning to redistribute my work schedule in order to move tasks that require concentration to blocks of time where I can focus .
Without question , the birth of my first child .
The presence of a human being totally dependent on me and my good choices made me realize that I needed to look more carefully at my behaviors in life , and I ’ve never looked back .
Because of this new perspective on life , I actually wound up with much more on my plate , but somehow still having at least as much free time as I had before – I just eliminated things that were dragging me down .
Trent Hamm from The Simple Dollar ( rss )
With our little girl , I ’ve found that we ’ve replaced much of our entertainment with just watching the baby smile . :)
Trent ’s comment brings up an important point .
Sometimes it is easier to re-evaluate things when we ’ve gone through big changes in our lives .
Even smaller things like rearranging your office can help force you to see your processes and organization in a new way and make improvements that would n’t have been obvious before .
Forcing myself to make a decision every single time I touch something .
Laura Stack , MBA , CSP from The Productivity Pro(R ) ( rss )
This goes back to the idea of context switches being expensive .
When you pick something up there is a certain amount of time that is spent figuring out what the item is and running through a list of possible next steps .
If you decide to put it back down , you ’ll have to run through the same process again the next time you pick it up .
Multiply this by the hundreds of things that come across your real and virtual desktop and you can lose a lot of time doing the same thing over and over again .
Finding a job I love .
When you do n’t love your job , you have given up 75 % of your life to misery .
I love working for Wise Bread .
Everything I do for it gives me an adrenalin rush .
I would probably work on Wise Bread for free , but luckily my partners have decided to pay me anyway .
That old advice “ find something you love and then try to make a career out of it ” is often ignored .
People think it is impractical and childish .
But I ’m the living proof that it can happen .
Will from Wise Bread ( rss )
When parents are advising their kids on choosing a career , they usually say to go to college so you can get a job that pays well .
I think we’d be far better off telling our children to go to college to figure out what they love , so they can choose a job that they will enjoy doing for the rest of their life .
Practice !
Whenever I want to get better at something I practice and that makes all the difference .
Susan Sabo from Productivity Cafe ( rss )
It is easy to get so focused on our tasks that we forget to work on improving our skill at those tasks .
A small investment in developing our skills can pay off with big dividends .
5 hours spent reading a book on how to better utilize your operating system and practicing those skills can easily save you 50 hours over the next 12 months .
It would have to be the utter ubiquitousness of paper and pen .
Pretty much anytime , day or night , I have a pen and small notebook or index cards in my pocket for capture .
In the past , there was n’t a day that went by when I would n’t either have an idea or be reminded of a task and forget it minutes later .
Now , whenever anything comes to me ( and I mean anything ) , it gets quickly scrawled down and lobbed into my in - basket for later processing .
Gone are the days of trusting my own fallible psyche as a reliable storage medium .
Brett Kelly from Cranking Widgets ( rss )
I have a friend who keeps a pen and paper next to the bed .
At night he frequently gets brilliant ideas and write sthem down .
In the morning he is usually perplexed by his random written notes that do n’t seem to make any sense at all . :)
I think a lot of people try to use computers and PDAs with the idea that they will replace paper .
I have yet to see any type of note taking apparatus that can even remotely compete with a pen and notebook .
I usually carry some 3×5 cards with me for quick notes and lists .
Starting something and finishing it .
I used to start lots of projects without concentrating on finishing , hense I would end up with loads of projects on the go at once .
Now , if I start a next action I will make sure as much as possible to get it done in one session .
That way I can get it off my mind and stop worrying about it .
James from Organize IT ( rss )
This comes back to the idea of execution .
As others have mentioned , I think an important component of this is to create the right size task .
In software development , one of the most productive styles of programming is to start off by creating something that works –even if it only implements a small portion of the final features .
The next step is to modify it into something that works with a few more features .
This approach is useful for other types of projects as well .
By consistently doing smaller projects and completing them you can build a habit of finishing which will be very valuable as you take on more challenging tasks .
Starting a blog .
Being a decent blogger is hard work , and it reinforces skills that are important for other areas of life : relationships , communication , quality writing , unique ideas , etc .
It ’s also forced me to manage my time more efficiently and set strong priorities .
At the same time , I ’ve gained great friends , made awesome connections , and learned a ton .
Andrew Flusche from Legal Andrew ( rss )
One of the benefits of writing for Productivity501 is that it forces me to think much more deeply about by personal productivity and organization .
If I want to learn about a new area , one of my first steps would be to start a blog on the topic .
In addition the practice of writing on a regular basis is very beneficial no matter what your field .
Learning to thrive on change itself , so that I am continually creating , tweaking , discarding , and reinventing .
Deciding that change is good for me has helped me banish my sacred cows , and has cured me of both procrastination and perfectionism .
When you love experiments and pilots , you consider everything a work in progress , keeping you open - minded and far more nimble .
Rosa Say from Managing with Aloha ( rss )
A lot of people hate change simply because it means hard work .
However the amount you learn from going through change is so much more than what you ’ll learn from doing the same thing you ’ve always done .
The most important change that has made the most difference in making me effective in life is a combination of going back from digital to analog ( pen and paper ) and implementing David Allen ’s action management methodology “ Getting Things Done ” ( GTD ) .
GTD allows me to keep a feeling of relaxed control and the use of paper allows me to be more creative and flexible , making me more effective as a result .
gtdfrk from Getting Things Done ( rss )
I ’ve found it very interesting how many people are moving back to paper .
Around 2002
I decided to get a PDA that would meet my needs .
After trying 4 or 5 different models and brands , I gave up and went back to paper for the next 4 years .
I ’ve finally found a combination PDA / Phone that works for me , but I ’ve learned to only use it for things where it really makes sense ( addresses and telephone numbers ) and use paper for everything else .
Knowing my life purpose .
Knowing my life purpose gives me clarity and meaning in life .
It becomes far easier for me to assess everything I encounter in life ; I can figure out what to do and what not to do relatively easily .
Donald Latumahina from Life Optimizer ( rss )
This ties in nicely with the suggestions of defining your values .
When we do n’t have a clear idea of our values and purpose , our default behavior is to try to be busy .
Just being exposed to the possibility of a system for self - management has facilitated a tremendous shift for me .
In my case , influences include the works of David Allen , Kerry Gleeson , Stephanie Winston , and Chris Crouch .
I call what I do “ WorkFlow 101 , ” which reflects my perspective that these days ( with tremendous information overload and too much to do ) , we all need a way to manage ourselves in work and life , but that we ’ve often not had the opportunity to learn such a system .
As a result , we either define ad hoc methods that provide a small bit of relief , or we rely on outdated methods from the age of phones and faxes , not email and IM .
Matthew Cornell from Idea Matt ( rss )
Those author ’s names have been added to my reading list .
I think there is a lot of value in creating a system , but I think people tend to blindly follow a particular method instead of really figuring out what works best for their particular situation .
Spending some time studying a bunch of different systems and taking the parts that are most relevant to your personal situation seems like a good approach .
First , I have a personal productivity system that works well for me .
Second , I have a belief system that helps me to focus on the present moment and approach every challenge in life with a certain level of mindfulness and compassion .
Third , and this may seem incongruous with item number two , but it is not , skillful use of the three greatest productivity tools ever imagined – The Trash Can , The Delete Key , and The Word “ No ” .
Patrick Rhone from Patrick Rhone ( rss )
Ah the trash can . :)
I think this is where a lot of productivity systems break down because they let you track a bunch of minutia that you should n’t be worrying about .
Having a task list of 3 to 7 items is far more productive than a list of 50 things that need done .
Learning the discipline to say no to things that would be “ good ” to do in order to focus on the things that are most important is very difficult .
Tracking my work output .
Using a daily review helps me to uncover those pesky areas of my life that are n’t quite as productive .
By seeing trends in my own productivity , I can see what works and what does n’t .
Now , I do n’t make a daily todo list , but rather just track what I got done .
It ’s a little scary sometimes how much time I waste on stupid things . ;)
Glen Stansberry from LifeDev ( rss )
I have played around with software that measures how much time you spend in each application and on each document on your computer .
It can be pretty insightful to see how your time is actually distributed at the end of the day .
What Glen describes is very similar to Benjamin Franklin ’s method for self improvement .
He had a list of “ virtues ” and at the end of each day he would note his success or failure at achieving each one .
Realizing you ca n’t do everything at the same time without losing effectiveness .
Frank Meeuwsen from
What ’s the Next Action ( rss )
The people who define their daily success based on achieving 1 to 3 tasks usually seem to get much more done than people who attempt to accomplish 30 or 40 tasks each day .
I think some of this comes down to the idea that if you take care of the really important stuff , the trivial tasks will kind of fall into place .
We are far more effective when we realize that multitasking is harmful and give our complete concentration to one task at a time .
It is without question thinking positively and acting upon those thought .
I think a lot of people think if we think positively our lives should change , that ’s not going to happen .
We think positively and act positively as well .
Taking action on my thoughts is the biggest change I have made in doing anything in my life .
Steven Aitchison from Change Your Thoughts ( rss )
Steven makes a good point here .
It is n’t just what we think .
It is what we do .
However , if we are n’t thinking productively , we wo n’t act productively .
No more cable TV has freed up MANY hours in my day .
Phil Gerbyshak from Make It Great ! ( rss )
Most people will benefit from reducing their television watching habits .
Canceling the $ 30 to $ 50 spent on cable television can save you money and time .
Focusing on one thing at a time and NOT multi-tasking .
Multitasking makes everything take longer and it ’s not done as well .
It also makes you more susceptible to distractions .
Becoming less of a perfectionist , but I ’m still working on it !
Reducing Distractions – Letting calls go to voicemail when I ’m working on something important .
Turning off email notification .
Ariane Benefit from Neat Living ( rss )
Email notifications are one of my biggest pet peeves .
I do n’t understand why people think it is a good idea to have that turned on .
The change that has helped me most is to make the productivity process as visual as possible .
I ’m still working on this too .
Rosemary Hon from Daily PlanIt ( rss )
This is an interesting idea .
I ’m curious what types of things Rosemary does to make things visible .
I guess I need to spend some more time over at the Daily PlanIt . :)
When I left my corporate job .
I am a much more free thinking , creative type person and my job was stifling every last bit of expression I could muster .
Since I left , I have started another blog , gotten back into writing , taken on more hobbies and am 150 % happier and more productive than I was before .
David from My Two Dollars ( rss )
Working for yourself should be a sure fire way to increase your productivity .
I think happiness is n’t considered nearly enough when it comes to how effective we are .
I finally realized that I am very busy , but not as productive as I want to be .
Admitting there ’s a problem is the first step !
Now that I know that I have a tendency to do the easy , even boring stuff first , I can try to take steps to combat this procrastination tendency .
GTD Wannabe from GTD Wannabe ( rss )
The problem with being overly busy is that it can keep you from noticing that you are n’t actually getting much done .
Simply changing the way I manage my inbox .
This includes the implementation of one of the most effective tools I have ever run across … the 2 minute rule .
If it will take less than two minutes to respond or complete a task … do it now .
Jason Echols from Blackbelt Productivity ( rss )
This is something I am still working to improve .
Simplifying , without a doubt .
I realized that I was trying to do too much , and that I was wasting my time on stuff that nobody would care about in a week .
Truth is , only a few of the tasks we do have lasting importance — focus on those and eliminate the rest .
Leo Babauta from Zen Habits ( rss )
It is amazing how much stuff we can stop doing with little or no consequence . :)
I have to keep asking myself “ what happens if I just do n’t do this . ”
Many times I find I ’m wasting time doing stuff that really does n’t need to be done .

What comes after usability ? »
Reverse - engineering user reviews
Which would you rather hear a user rave about in a review ... your product or your company ?
How should they describe you ?
I 've seen a lot of startups analyze their competitor 's bad reviews ... to look for opportunities where the competitor 's product or company is screwing up .
But we can learn even more from analyzing the good reviews .
This little exercise has made a huge difference for us , and it might help you too .
The homework assignment we give our new authors before they come to a bootcamp workshop is this :
1 ) Write your ideal review -- the detailed review you 'd most like to see from a user .
2 ) Analyze the positive ( in this case , 5 - star only ) reviews of one of the other books in the series then analyze the positive reviews of the closest competitor for that book .
( Make sure you pick one that has at least 40 reviews to get more data ) .
3 ) Describe how closely each set matches your ideal review , and what the differences are .
4 ) Describe any differences between the two sets .
We believe this homework has been been the single most important part of our process , although we often do a several - hour debrief / discussion about what they come up with .
And of course when we 're done with the exercise , the rest of our effort is in figuring out what to do to cause us to get those ideal reviews .
YOUR CHALLENGE
Try doing just # 1 , right now .
I mean it , stop and write your ideal user review .
Make it detailed , at least a few paragraphs .
Think about it .
I 'll wait .
*
*
*
*
*
*
I 'll trust that you 've done it ; )
Now , did your ideal user review focus on the product or the company ?
What did they talk about ?
SECRET ANSWER C
I 'm sure most of you already know that the question was a trick .
We do n't want our users talking about the company or the product .
All that matters is how they feel about themselves as a result of interacting with our product .
How they feel about us has little impact on whether they 'll become loyal ( let alone passionate ) users .
All that matters is what we 've helped them do or be .
So , when you analyze user reviews , look for first - person language .
Look for the word " I " .
Do a statistical analysis on the number of times users talked about something they were able to do as a result , rather than a run-down of oh - how - great - this - company - is .
View your competitor 's positive reviews the same way .
For us , we look for other book - specific things as well .
For example , we analyze the number of times reviewers use the author 's first name vs. last name vs. both , and then we compare that to our competitors .
I 'll leave you to consider why that matters to us .
We also look for more emotionally - tinged language .
HAVE YOUR EMPLOYEES DO THIS EXERCISE
Everyone connected with your product or service should sit down and write their ideal user review .
And if it 's nothing but raves about how fabulous the product or company is , there 's a problem .
In our case -- with technical learning books -- an author with a goal of what readers will think about the book or the author can lead to a book that 's bad for the user ( too advanced , too much content , etc . )
If you 're creating something to win awards , or to impress people , or to gain praise and recognition , that might lead to an award - winning , impressive product that leaves the user behind .
I hear a lot of companies claim to care about what the user thinks , but they 're still focused on what the user thinks of them or the product .
I do n't want people to praise us .
I want them to thank us for helping them earn the praise of others .
I mean it .
Have your employees do this exercise .
Count the number of times the employee 's ideal review includes the word " I " ( or rather , does NOT include the word " I " ) .
It 's enlightening .
[ bonus link : Tom Asacker has a lot of great things share on this topic .
Including books . ]
[ And yes , I know I 've talked about this exact thing before , but hey -- it 's a whole new year .
And a new picture ! ]

Damn , that was good !
You nailed the whole " You " ( your users ) v. " Me " ( your company , product , etc ) challenge perfectly .
But without your direction regarding what the USER will say about how this affects their life , most people doing this exercise wo n't go further than some myopic , " Me " - focused riff on how great their company is .
What a kick - ass start to the year .
Nice job !

Posted by : John Windsor | Jan 5 , 2007 1:54:53 PM
I think the idea behind this is great , but I wonder if people who do n't think they 're creative writers will get the point quickly .
It seems to me that some people might get annoyed by the trick question aspect .
So I might approach it this way : ( 1 ) Have everyone in the group write a review of a product of any kind they really like .
( 2 ) Share those reviews as a group , and see if the group will come to the decision that the more personal ones are the most positive .
Then go through the homework assignment , with employees who have discovered the point for themselves .
( And who 'll go home saying " guess what I figured out at work today " instead of " my boss had this really cool idea ... " ) :-)
Posted by : Joe | Jan 5 , 2007 2:30:14 PM
John : what 's up with the 8 inches we got here !?
They told us to expect 2 , but I woke up to , well , the same thing you did .
Joe :
Yes , I think you have a good point and I like your version of the exercise .
I guess it really depends a lot on the kind of product .
I actually do n't ask the " trick " question when I do this ( i.e. would you rather hear about the company or the product ) , I just did it here to be difficult .
; )
But having THEM figure out that the personal ones are better -- even if they do n't yet realize the kinds of things they 're picking up on ( in other words , " We like these three better but we do n't know why ... " ) is a great idea .
That by itself would be very very useful if you 're working with a group , for sure .
thanks
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jan 5 , 2007 3:03:33 PM
Great trick !
I bought into the excercise ( because I really trust what you say and know what it will make my product better ) , sat down and started to write , and said " Hey , this is n't a review , this is a user story . "
Boy was I relieved to read the rest of the post . :)
I put myself in the mindset of two people -- both a " woman on the street " Amazon reviewer and a magazine style reviewer , and found that the reviews I remembered tended to be first person as well .
( So it works better for getting new customers , too ! )
Posted by : Sara Brumfield | Jan 5 , 2007 3:37:46 PM
Good idea .
Reading this also made me think this exercise could be applied to how copy is put together for marketing " collateral . "
Be it a brochure or a product description page on a site .
It would be interesting to see how that would work .
I suspect you 'd get more " here are the activities / tasks this product can help you with " vs. " now with 55 more features ! "
Or you could just make your site a wiki and let your users write your product pages for you . :)
Posted by : Matthew Oliphant | Jan 5 , 2007 3:46:59 PM
Hey Sara , while you 're here ... ; )
I 'm very intrigued with your Dressr thing , so can you tell me more or point me to a post that describes it in more detail ?
It sounds fun , whatever it is !
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Jan 5 , 2007 3:48:01 PM
That is a great idea !
At work right now I 'm trying to think of some activities to get engineers / managers at my company thinking more about the users and this is perfect food - for - thought .
So , thanks for the idea !
I just might use it . :)
Posted by : Natasha | Jan 6 , 2007 7:42:09 AM
This is an excellent idea .
It 's also very thought provoking to me .
I just read a study on how the use of language identifies your users .
( http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/papers/male-female-text-final.pdf for the paper , http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/magazine/10WWLN.html?ex=1061784000&en=843e4c97d49a9f82&ei=5070 for the NYT version )
For me , it looks like the characteristics of your ideal user review coincide with a " female " style of writing .
What to make of it ?
I have no idea .
I just thought this is an interesting coincidence - maybe you will be able to make more of it ;)

I had to read and re-read this a couple of times , go away , digest , regurgitate , read again and then get that ah - ha moment .
It could not have happened at a better time as I 've been invited as an advisor on a certain project .
I do n't think the organisation in question would want to go with me because I 've been super critical of them in the past .
But then I decided to take your idea on board and turn it into something I 'd want to say to the org in question .
There 's a reason .
I do n't know if they 're listening and if they are , whether they 're silently seething or pining to say something .
We 'll see .
In the meantime , thanks for making me think .

This is exactly the sort of feedback I 've learned to look for from my clients .
I knew I was starting to get things right when clients stopped saying nice things specifically about me and started talking about how my results helped them make smart business decisions .
It 's not about me ( down ego , down ! ) but about what I can help my clients to achieve .

They actually are not user reviews , they look more like talking and praising the company or the product .

Scientists at the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility can tell whether marijuana confiscated in a traffic stop in Fairbanks likely came from Mexico or the Matanuska Valley .
They 're also working on a way to determine whether it was grown indoors or out .
A few more years and enough samples and they hope to have something even more precise : an elemental fingerprint that could tell police where and under what conditions a sample of marijuana was grown .
" There are scientists already doing this for drugs like heroin and cocaine , " said Matthew Wooller , Alaska Stable Isotope Facility director .
" The potential is there for being able to do this for marijuana as well . "
The key lies at the atomic level .
Of particular interest to Wooller and his colleagues are the stable isotopes of four elements : carbon , oxygen , nitrogen and hydrogen .
Isotopes are atoms of elements that have the same number of protons and electrons but different numbers of neutrons .
A stable isotope is one that does n't decay over time .
Those additional or missing neutrons in an isotope slightly alter the mass of the atom , allowing scientists to use a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer to separate the light isotopes from the heavy ones and form a ratio for each sample .
That ratio can tell scientists about the sample and its origins .
" The marijuana holds a signature of the environment that it used to be grown in , " Wooller said .
" It is laid down in time and preserved in the materials that make up a plant . "
advertisement
For example , oxygen and hydrogen ratios can reveal information about the water a plant used while growing and , as a result , where it was grown .
Water in Alaska and other high latitudes generally has a larger proportion of light oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes than water from locations at lower latitudes .
Carbon tells another story , he said .
It can offer information on whether a plant was grown outdoors or inside .
Nitrogen could provide even more information .
The testing at the UAF facility is novel because , for each sample , scientists are taking the isotopic signatures of four elements , rather than for just a single one , Wooller said .
" We have the potential to create a precise chemical fingerprint . "
The marijuana research began approximately two years ago and was initially supported by a grant from the University of Alaska President 's Special Projects Fund .
The UAF Police Department provided the lab samples of marijuana confiscated locally .
" We started off running samples of unknown origin , " Wooller said , noting that even those samples yielded some surprising results .
Scientists initially assumed that most of the samples would show that they had been grown in Alaska rather than being imported from the low latitudes .
advertisement
" In fact , what we saw is there are samples that are almost certainly grown in high latitude , " he said .
" Then you had marijuana that was clearly grown at lower latitudes . "
Since then , the project has expanded beyond samples of unknown origin .
The federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the Alaska Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Enforcement have started providing samples from grows in Alaska .
Wooller hopes that , with enough of those samples , he can create a marijuana isotope map for Alaska and beyond , which could eventually allow scientists to match unknown samples with known growing locations .
The project has potential to help police on multiple levels , according to Investigator Stephen Goetz at the UAF Police Department .
From an evidentiary standpoint , it could tie a growing operation to marijuana seized on the street , he said , and offer evidence of both the production of marijuana and its distribution .
" The common denominator that people use as their defense is that ( they ) are growing it for their personal use only , " Goetz said .
If marijuana seized from a dealer , for example , matched that growing operation , it could counter such a defense , he said .
It could also help the state 's drug enforcement officials track the trafficking patterns of marijuana by comparing where the marijuana was grown to where it is seized , Goetz said .
" It could , theoretically , focus law enforcement 's efforts on where to look for ( growing operations . ) "
In order to get the method to that level , though , Wooller said he needs time , money and many more samples of marijuana , either from known locations or that are grown in a laboratory , such as the state crime lab , under controlled conditions .
" We need more data , " Wooller said .
" We need more analyses of marijuana samples from known locations so we can create these base marijuana isotope maps . "

ON a Sunday morning a few months back , I interviewed my final Harvard applicant of the year .
After saying goodbye to the girl and watching her and her mother drive off , I headed to the beach at the end of our street for a run .
It was a spectacular winter day , bright , sunny and cold ; the tide was out , the waves were high , and I had the beach to myself .
As I ran , I thought the same thing I do after all these interviews :
Another amazing kid who wo n’t get into Harvard .
That used to upset me .
But I ’ve changed .
Over the last decade , I ’ve done perhaps 40 of these interviews , which are conducted by alumni across the country .
They ’re my only remaining link to my alma mater ; I ’ve never been back to a reunion or a football game , and my total donations since graduating in the 1970s do not add up to four figures .
No matter how glowing my recommendations , in all this time only one kid , a girl , got in , many years back .

A narrow beam of light sweeps over Herbert Hoover 's doughy face and through the tiny holes of a spinning disk in Washington D.C.
The live image snakes some 200 miles on telephone wires to Whippany , New Jersey , then 22 miles by wireless to New York City where observers see the tiny but unmistakable figure of the future U.S. president , speechifying at 18 frames per second in the orange glow of a 2 × 2.5 - inch neon lamp .

" Television , a scientific dream ever since the telephone was perfected , has at last been realized , " enthused an Indianapolis Star news report of the event , which made history on April 7 , 1927 as the first public demonstration of a long distance TV broadcast .
Eighty years later , as television undergoes its latest evolution from analog to digital , it 's illuminating to consider how little of this early experiment resembles what we now think of as TV .
The picture tube had yet to be invented .
The device used by AT&T Bell Laboratories research leaders Herbert Ives and Frank Gray was mechanical .
The feat was accomplished with technologies that more closely resemble a fax transmission than a modern TV broadcast .
Today , once again , TV is evolving into something new and hardly recognizable to generations raised on its earlier incarnations .
The structured world of analog over - the - air programming that brought American families together in the living room has been shattered .
In its place has emerged a new form of unbounded digital video , endlessly permeable and reprogrammable .
" Traditional TV wo n't be here in seven to 10 years , " says Kim Moses , co-producer of CBS ' popular Ghost Whisperer , who has just launched a short - form version of her own show online .
" It 's changing so fast that I do n't know if it 's even going to be that long . "
On the 80th anniversary of the first long - distance TV broadcast , the industry that evolved out of it is under siege .
Old rules — defining who , where and what to watch — are collapsing , making room for new ideas and talent on air and online .
In other words , television has never been stronger .
Programs like HBO's The Sopranos have reinvigorated TV as entertainment and even art .
Completely new forms are breaking out online .
Perhaps , most surprising of all , octogenarian TV is once again one of the most potent catalysts for technological innovation .
Today , people own more TVs , of different kinds , than ever before .
According to Nielsen Media Research , the share of U.S. households with more than one TV set has gone from 60 percent in 1990 to 92 percent today , with 51 percent of people owning three or more sets .
High - definition sets measuring up to 200 inches are now available , while mobile phones , iPods and other devices that play video on the go are increasingly common .
In total , U.S. consumers spent $ 20 billion on televisions in 2006 , and another $ 24 billion on home - video rentals and purchases , according to figures from the NPD Group and the Digital Entertainment Group .
What 's on screen and how it gets there is also expanding rapidly .
According to Nielsen , the average consumer now has access to 104 traditional TV channels , the first year that figure has passed the century mark .
About 12 percent have digital video recorders like TiVo .
But many are also finding new ways to watch , downloading from iTunes , buying or renting DVDs , tapping on - demand services or even streaming episodes online on the networks ' own websites .
" What 's really happened is the disintegration of the traditional programming supply chain , " says Ross Rubin , director of industry analysis for the NPD Group .
" TV has become more of a portal into a wide range of video sources than an integrated device and service . "
TV's prodigious contributions to culture , politics , entertainment and technology have been overshadowed in recent years by the massive innovation unleashed by the PC industry .
But TV 's impact on all of the above is undeniable , and it is once again poised to shatter old paradigms .
AT&T's Ives went on to help develop an approach for color TV , a two - way videophone system , and a means of sending video signals over coaxial cable .
He also won the Congressional Medal of Merit for work on night - vision goggles during World War II .
The cathode ray tube — the technology of the traditional box — was ultimately adapted for use in radar , a war - time project that attracted some of the best scientific minds of the era and was far more important to the Allied victory than , say , the atomic bomb .
Innovation in the 1950s came as consumers first bought TVs en masse , as color emerged and as producers drew on earlier radio and stage models to create enduring classics like I Love Lucy and Twilight Zone .
More tech - driven reinvention followed in the 1980s .
The rise of cable TV and the spread of the VCR ended the networks ' monopoly on the living - room set .
The resulting competition for consumers helped create classic broadcast programming such as The Cosby Show and Hill Street Blues , and lasting cable franchises like HBO , CNN and MTV .
Cable TV in United States continues to create enormous new business opportunities , having laid the basic groundwork for much of the nation 's broadband internet infrastructure .
Diebold Inc. has been unable to sell its electronic voting subsidiary , and has slashed its full - year revenue expectations for Diebold Election Systems due to controversy surrounding e-voting security , the company said Thursday .
Diebold has also established a new structure for its e-voting business , allowing it to operate more independently , the company said in a release .
The e-voting business is changing its name to Premier Election Solutions , and an independent board of directors will oversee the renamed subsidiary , Diebold said .
" Rapidly evolving political uncertainties and controversies surrounding state and jurisdiction purchases of electronic voting systems " have hampered Diebold 's attempts to sell its e-voting business , the company said in the release .
Diebold has been trying to sell the elections unit for more than a year , said Mike Jacobsen , a company spokesman .
Diebold has not ruled out selling off all or part of the e-voting business in the future , he added .
Those same factors led Diebold to lower its full - year revenue expectations for the elections business by about US $ 120 million , down from previous full - year revenue guidance for the e-voting business of $ 185 million to $ 215 million .
In recent years , Diebold Elections Systems has been one of the main targets of critics who question e-voting security , and several security experts have shown vulnerabilities in e-voting systems .
Researchers hired by the state of California found security problems in all e-voting systems they tested , including Diebold 's , the state said in a report released in July .
Earlier this month , California Secretary of State Debra Bowen said the state would require additional security features for several e-voting systems , including Diebold's .
With the new security requirements , the state recertified e-voting systems from Diebold and two other manufacturers .
The moves in California played a small part in the decision to restructure the business unit and lower revenue expectations , Jacobsen said .
" This is a cumulative effect , " he added .
" There 's a lot of activity in a lot of states . "
State reviews of e-voting systems have " slowed down the big purchases " from local voting jurisdictions , he said .
In addition , competing bills in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have created uncertainty among potential buyers , Diebold said .
CIA running black propaganda operation against Iran , Syria and Lebanon , officials say

Some intelligence sources more wary of covert Pentagon operations
The Central Intelligence Agency has received approval at least twice in the last several years to conduct an information war against several countries in the Middle East , including Iran , Lebanon and Syria , according to current and former intelligence officials .
In addition , the Bush Administration has been running operations out of the Defense Department that are not subject to Congressional oversight , intelligence sources say .
These programs appear murkier , and have included support for an alleged terrorist group in Iran .
A recent ABC News report revealed that President George W. Bush had signed a presidential finding giving the CIA the authority to conduct non - lethal covert operations against Iran .
Former and current intelligence sources tell RAW STORY , however , that there have been at least two presidential findings over the past few years which have empowered the agency to run an open - secret information war against Iranian interests , mainly leveraging resources and assets within the United States and France . 
Although the resources  people , groups , organizations  were not identified , sources say that they are not terrorist organizations or groups using violent tactics to achieve their goals .
 It 's a propaganda operation ,  said a former intelligence case officer who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the information .
 It is not new or aggressive ,  the source added , explaining that the operation has been going on for some time and has Congressional funding and oversight .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano would not comment about the allegations made in the ABC report or discuss the existence of the presidential findings identified to RAW STORY .
 The CIA does not , as a matter of course , publicly discuss allegations of covert action , whether the assertions are wrong , right , or somewhere in - between ,  Gimigliano said .
 That 's one reason why the term covert action still exists . 
 But it 's important to remember that , through the Congress , there is vigorous oversight of secret intelligence activities ,  he added .
According to current and former intelligence officials , the various presidential findings are not limited to Iran .
Several countries within the Middle East  including Syria and Lebanon  as well as groups such as Hezbollah , are being targeted through what sources call black propaganda efforts .
Iran is being targeted by the CIA 's activities with a pro-democracy  message , sources say , and the agency is supporting overt pro-democracy  groups .
The programs particulars are highly classified .
Intelligence sources stress , however , that the groups being used are rather mainstream and the operations are almost entirely restricted to information warfare .
Sources would not identify what mechanism was being employed to distribute the propaganda , if it included news media , individuals or organizations , or whether that information was seeping back into domestic news reports .
One former intelligence case officer did explain that the CIA 's program is operating largely outside of the Middle East and is aimed at identifying potential allies , as well as using already existing well known groups through whom information can be delivered .
The type of information and the groups  and organizations  involved were not identified .
ABC News may have reported the presidential finding as new because of the recently passed massive intelligence budget .
Under the bill , roughly $ 50 million was appropriated for the  Democracy Fund and the  Broadcasting Board of Governors ,  both earmarked for Iran operations .
Sources close to the Select Senate Committee on Intelligence would not discuss any aspect of the CIA program or comment on anything relating to the presidential findings .
 This is an area I simply cannot get into ,  said one source .
Pentagon operation supporting terrorist group kept from Congress
RAW STORY has also learned that the Pentagon is continuing to conduct more aggressive black operations , approved by the National Security Council and the Office of the Vice President .
Current and former intelligence officials would not identify new specific covert programs running out of the Pentagon , though sources stressed these are far riskier and more truly covert operational activities against Iran than the activities of the CIA .
These operations started almost immediately after the Iraq war and have continued for several years .
Because they can be considered part of a military operation , they are not subjects to the same requirements for Congressional authorization as the activities of the CIA .
The majority of these efforts to destabilize Iran through a covert war of aggression have been carried out by the Department of Defense , largely steered by the Office of the Vice President and by then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
A series of RAW STORY reports has identified some of the off book  or black operations running out of the Pentagon over the last several years .
In 2003 , the Defense Department began working with terrorist and dissident groups in an effort to destabilize Iran , bypassing traditional intelligence channels .
One of the assets the Pentagon used was a terrorist organization known as Mujahedeen-e Khalq ( MEK ) , which was being run in two southern regional areas of Iran , including a Shia region where a series of attacks in 2006 left many dead and hundreds injured .
These activities have often been guided by the same individuals whose actions during Iran - Contra were the reason for a 1991 law on covert activities which for the first time clearly defined covert activities and how their oversight should be handled .
During Iran-Contra , the Reagan White House  via the National Security Council  sold weapons to Iran , an avowed enemy of the United States , and used the money to fund various terrorist and dissident groups , collectively called the Contras , to fight a proxy war against the government of Nicaragua .
Sources say that MEK has been used for intelligence collection , an activity which has traditionally fallen under the CIA .
The administration also appears to be looking the other way as groups such as MEK commit acts of violence .
Intelligence sources interviewed for this article all expressed concern over the lack of attention to the Pentagons covert activities .
Some believe illegal activities like those of the Iran - Contra days are now being hidden under the loophole of traditional military activities  to avoid Congressional oversight .
Steven Aftergood , director for the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy , says this loophole exists in Congressional oversight with regards to military covert activities .
CIA covert actions have to be authorized by a written presidential finding , which must be provided to Congress ,  Aftergood said .
 By contrast , DOD operations , including clandestine or covert operations , are not subject to this procedure .
 As a result ,  he added ,  there may be a temptation to opt for a purely military action to take advantage of the loophole in congressional notification requirements . 
Covert economic warfare may not be limited to CIA
Another former intelligence official said that the CIA has been cleared to target Iran 's economic interests , but that the approval is limited to non-aggressive activities .
The CIA has been empowered to put economic pressure on Iran ,  the former intelligence officer stated , but would not elaborate on what the meaning of pressure is .
Yet some suggest that the economic element of the covert program is either far more aggressive or is being attributed to the CIA when in fact another agency may be running it .
Foreign intelligence sources say that economic pressure is aimed at Iran 's oil - rich economy , with US efforts serving to persuade financial institutions , oil companies , and international investment interests to pull out of Iran and even drop already existing energy projects .
These sources cite the example of an unnamed company that is being denied financing for energy projects inside Iran by international banks , indicating that many more such examples exist .
Other possible forms of pressure would include less subtle activities , such as intercepting supply convoys and confiscating equipment .
Foreign sources are not sure if this covert activity is in fact part of the CIA program .
The Department of Defense did not respond to comment on this story .

In this summer of angst and grim foreboding about what further assaults against common sense and common decency the Bush administration might inflict upon the people of the world , how many times during the day do those of us -- still possessed of mind , heart and conscience -- take pause , hoping we 've seen the worst of it , then , fearing we have n't yet , attempt to push down the dread rising within us , so that we might simply make it through the day and be able to rest at night ?
Accordingly , those who have been paying attention are aware that the outward mechanisms of martial law are in place .
We shudder knowing that Bush has issued an executive decree that grants him dictatorial power in the event of some nebulously defined national emergency .
In addition , the knowledge nettles us that a vast network of internment camps bristle across the length of the U.S. , standing at wait for those who might raise objections to the fascistic fury unloosed by the American empire 's version of the Reichstag fire .
Moreover , a closer look would reveal that the inner processes by which an individual begins the act of acceptance of authoritarian excess -- the mixture of chronic passivity , boredom , low grade anxiety and unfocused rage inherent in the citizens / consumers of the corporate state that primes an individual for fascism -- have been in place for quite some time within the psyches of the American populace , both elites and hoi polloi alike .
Although , do n't look for torch - lit processions thronging the nation 's streets and boulevards ; rather , look for a Nuremberg Rally of couch - bound brownshirts .
Instead of ogling the serried ranks of jut - jawed , SS soldiers , a contemporary Leni Riefenstahl would be forced to film chubby clusters of double - chinned consumers , saluting the new order with their TV remotes .
In the contemporary United States , the elation induced by the immersion of one 's individual will to the mindless intoxication of the mob might only be possible , if Bush seized dictatorial control of the state while simultaneously sending out to all citizens gift certificates to Ikea .
After the catastrophes spawned by the rise of European fascism in the 1930s , a number of brilliant , original thinkers ( including Hannah Arendt , Roberto Freire , Wilhelm Reich , and R. D. Laing ) set out to study the phenomenon in order to learn how future calamities might be prevented .
Although the methodologies and conclusions of these thinkers varied , each noted that alienation and dehumanization festered at the core of the death urge of fascism .
Nowadays , in contrast , the elites of the corporate media have proven themselves useless in this regard , believing , as they do , they constitute the thin line between the rabble at large ( me and you ) and the chaos begot by freedom .
At present , mega - churches attract alienated suburbanites .
Right - wing talk show hosts misdirect their listeners alienation towards so - called illegal " aliens " and exploit their audience 's sense of powerlessness ( created by the rigged system of corporate capitalism ) against elitist liberals ( who themselves , ironically , benefit from the present system and who only want to change it to the degree that their own privilege will not be affected -- in other words , not at all ) .
Combine the above with the American character trait of being hostile towards introspection and it becomes evident that the present disaster has been building for quite a while now .
And it can ( and most likely will ) get worse -- far worse .
Most Americans alive today have been trained since birth to adapt to and serve the corrupt corporate structure by means of the shunning of critical thinking and have been conditioned to be in constant ( empty ) motion or in the thrall of mass media distraction .
We have been taught that passivity is for losers , yet we find ourselves nearly powerless before the corporate / consumer / military / police / entertainment state .
In this way , we serve our corporate masters ; it serves the corpocracy that the lower orders refuse meaningful self - awareness .
If one were to glimpse one 's own illusions , then it follows one might begin to question collective delusions , and this would upset the social order .
Those who have studied the dangers of authoritarian rule have advised us to be wary of people who carry an inner emptiness .
Of course , these unfortunates yearn for the void to be filled .
But with their hearts and minds mortared closed , what makes it through the self - constructed prison is loud , stupid , and fascistic .
At present , what penetrates is : Fundamentalist Sermons on Armageddon , violent video games , the empty spectacle of steroid - induced professional sports hype , the lethal fantasies of American exceptionalism , the exercise in Rock and Roll imperialism that U.S. foreign policy has become .
In short , all the banal Sturm and Drang necessary to pierce those protective walls and penetrate the pervasive inner emptiness .
When the people of a culture have been conditioned to worship power -- but feel powerless -- there 's trouble ahead .
The elites must displace the public 's rage by a demagogic sleight - of - hand such as the demonization of marginalized groups .
In the US , we 've been inundated by years of state and commercial propaganda that has degraded and demonized the country 's permanent underclass by the labeling of them as welfare parasites and career criminals .
It has been noted that the mindset , methods , and procedures of America 's punitive , profit - driven prison - industrial complex was a prototype for the systemic cruelty of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib ; furthermore , it is a given that those institutional affronts to human decency will have served as prototypes for the methods and procedures that will be practiced upon those who are swept - up in the purges and detainment mania following the declaration of martial law in the United States .
We push this knowledge away from us , fearing we will be paralyzed by its crushing implications .
Worse , what is nearly impossible to admit is , most likely , the system crushed us long ago .
Apropos , R. D. Laing averred that being able to adapt and function within an insane , authoritarian system renders one for all practical purposes insane -- only insane in a manner acceptable to a power mad ruling elite .
This is the knowledge we push down , every hour of everyday .
Otherwise , we would be driven to admit outright that the system has crushed our individual hopes , aspirations and yearnings .
We must , at all costs , keep these feelings concealed ; otherwise , we might be compelled to contemplate what we have forsaken , what passions and truths we have traded away for the false sense of security that the corporate order offered us when we tacitly agreed to surrender what was most sacred , vital and alive within us .
One psychological manifestation of this phenomenon is the incessant chanting of that mantra of the American corporate workforce : " I 'm not my job .
I 'm not what I do all day long . "
For a moment , meditate on the calamity implicit in such a sentiment .
Because
If we cannot locate and engage our true selves during our waking hours , then who the hell are we anyway ?
This is a profoundly troubling circumstance .
Moreover , if we 've condemned our daylight selves to a void of non-being , what then remains of us ?
We experience this dislocation of the life force as a sense of nebulous dread .
Everything , these days , the architecture and accouterment of our lives seems so fragile and unreal ; it feels as if everything could just fly apart at any given moment .
The world and our place in it seems so flimsy : an empire built of eggshells ; it could all shatter in an instant .
Living on credit , the house of cards of the real estate market , jobs evaporating , most of us languishing only a couple of paychecks away from ruin :
The empire is coming undone .
As it is , it seems the nation is only being held together with hydrogenated fat , wheat gluten , over - extended credit and particleboard .
Ergo , there is one law the lawless Bush administration and their keepers from the plundering class cannot flout : the second law of thermodynamics .
They wo n't be able to claim executive privilege to avoid the consequences of negative entropy .
In a similar vein , we , the underlings of empire , stand helpless before the prevailing madness .
Individual reason rarely acts as a countervailing force to stem a drowning tide of cultural cognitive dissonance .

If police state tactics fail to alleviate a sense of anxiety , then we must construct more detainment camps , more maximum security prisons , enact more federal death penalty statutes .
" Bring back the electric chair ; being put to sleep , like stray pets , is too good for the traitors , " the mob will rage .
That 's the solution , but ( cognitive dissonance being what it is ) we need to go bigger -- we need an electric sofa -- yet , bigger still -- an electric dining room set !
" Aahh . . . the smell of deep - fried dissidents in the morning . "
And over the smoking corpses , let us pray .
We need to pray for . . . what ? . . . more prayer .
These prayers would work , the homicidally faithful will insist , if every single doubter was induced to drop to their knees and pray .
Hence , we need prayer in the public schools .
We need prayer on public transportation .
We need prayer in public restrooms !
Animus , ignorance , and magical thinking are a tragic mix and , I 'm afraid , that vintage of mind is the hideous wine of our times .
The social criteria that gives rise to fascism is in place in the U.S. and those in positions of power have a strong interest in seeing things remain that way .
All we can do is what folks ( a minority ) have always done . . . exile or resistance .
In my opinion , both are honorable .
The other options are varying degrees of " little Eichmann[ism ] " --

They will avoid you , fire you , curse your name from the darkness of their inner abyss , but this will solve the problem of dependance on them and you 'll be forced to live by other means .
Generally , one is more adaptable than one believes .
Keep yourself as healthy and as sane as possible : we 're going to need you around after the inevitable collapse of the present system .
Also , beware of those reductionist demons of the mind who diminish the soul - making possibilities of " mere " words .
The acts of writing and reading are seen as passive ; to crackpot realists , these activities seem useless , unproductive -- the feckless indulgences of a class of the thin - wristed effete .
Accordingly , Americans have all but ceased reading .
Worse , they displace their feelings of self - loathing borne of their own corporately induced passivity upon writers and thinkers .
If the tenets of democratic discourse are to survive , it is imperative that writers and thinkers begin to engage in a passionate defense of themselves against the kvetching armies of crackpot realists that have encircled and laid siege to our collective hearts and minds .
But do n't expect to be lauded with praise for the effort .
It 's doubtful our adversaries will be moved by our entreaties :
There can not be a rapprochement with reality for those who have never had a relationship with it in the first place .
Yet verbal imagery and depth - inducing insights are the DNA of compassionate engagement .
It is not a coincidence that George W. Bush is an inarticulate oaf .
Conversely , there are many things in this world that require being touched by words , for there are occasions when words alone can suffice to take us deep and lift us up and serve to ameliorate our alienation .
It is in this spirit that I offer the above words to you .

This paper is an addendum to Pettyjohn , et al .
` Continuations from Generalized Stack Inspection ' , Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming .
In this article , I provide more detail about the transformation than was possible in the SIGPLAN paper .
Please refer to the SIGPLAN paper for a more complete set of references .
Introduction
This paper describes a technique for implementing first - class continuations in languages that do not support stack inspection and manipulation .
The technique involves modifying procedures ( or methods ) such that they are able to co-operatively participate in the creation and use of first - class continuations .
The transform differs from continuation - passing - style in that the call / return stack continues to be the primary mechanism for representing continuations ; a heap representation of the continuation is only constructed when necessary .
This may result in better performance than CPS - conversion for those programs that make only occasional use of first - class continuations .
This technique was first described by F�nfrocken [ F�nfrocken98 ] as a mechanism for saving and restoring the transient ( stack - based ) state of a computation .
Sekiguchi , Sakamoto , and Yonezawa [ Sekiguchi01 ] generalize this to a mechanism for implementing continuation operators .
Tao [ Tao01 ] uses this code transformation in the context of mobile and distributed systems .
This paper presents a refinement of Sekiguchi , et al. [ Sekiguchi01 ] .
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with other techniques for implementing first - class continuations [ Baker94 ] [ Clinger99 ] .
The goal of this paper is to familiarize Scheme implementors with this technique .
Transformation Steps
Many popular languages provide no means for a procedure or method to access its continuation .
A procedure always has access to its own dynamic state .
This suggests that a procedure or method could be augmented to save its own state as part of the process of capturing a continuation .
A reasonably simple transformation may be performed on the procedure body that , when combined with the appropriate external support code , allows continuations to be used in a first - class manner .
The steps used to transform the code are shown here as source - code transformations in the C# language [ ECMA334 ] , but analagous transforms could be done in Java [ Java ] or at a bytecode level .
These transforms are similar to ones that many compilers already perform .
It may be possible to adapt an existing compiler to use this technique with a fairly small amount of effort .
This transformation preserves the calling signature of a procedure , but it augments the behavior of the procedure when a continuation is to be captured .
Interaction with code that has not been transformed will still be somewhat problematic .
On the other hand , the transformation is applicable to intermediate level code such as a Java .class file .
If it is necessary for transformed and untransformed code to interoperate , a technique such as continuation barriers may be used .
Step 1 : Assignment Conversion
Capturing and re-instating a continuation will cause variables to be unbound and rebound perhaps multiple times .
Variable bindings that are part of a lexical closure must not be unshared when this occurs .
Assignment conversion [ Kranz86 ] may be used to ensure the correct behavior of the transformed code .
This is not an issue in languages that do not provide lexical closures .
Management of shared variable bindings is an orthogonal issue so the examples given below will omit this step .
Step 2 : ANF Conversion
Syntax for compound expressions is one of the defining features of a higher - level computer language .
Compound expressions abstract away the details of control flow and temporary values , in other words , the continuation .
To save the continuation we will require access to those temporary values and detailed knowledge of the control flow within a procedure .
Converting the code into A - normal form [ Flanagan93 ] gives names to the temporary values and linearizes the control flow by replacing compound expressions with an equivalent sequence of primitive expressions and variable bindings .
A complete definition of an A - normal form of C# or Java is beyond the scope of this paper , but once converted to A - normal form the code will exhibit the key property that all procedure calls appear either as the right - hand side of a binding form ( in C# or Java , this is syntactically a statement that assigns to a fresh variable ) or as the expression element in a return statement .
In other words , the result of any procedure call is either immediately bound to variable or immediately returned .
Introducing explicit variables for temporaries is necessary in order to save the values , and linearizing nested expressions makes the control flow explicit , but there is another important effect of converting to A - normal form that is not so obvious .
Languages like Java or C# make a strong distinction between statements — program constructs that are sequentially executed and return no value — and expressions — hierarchical program constructs that compute a value .
This distinction is even present at the bytecode level : evaluation of expressions cause a change in the depth of the stack whereas evaluation of statements do not .
Flow control constructs such as loops and exceptions are usually statements , but procedure and method calls are expressions .
Control must be returned to that procedure in order for it to assist in saving the continuation .
Unfortunately , returning control to the procedure deallocates a portion of the very continuation we are attempting to save .
We can , however , synthesize a procedure that would have the same effect as the now absent continuation if we can reason about what that effect would have been .
Once the code is converted to A - normal form , the continuation of a procedure or method call will always be a binding ( or assignment ) to a fresh variable .
We arrange for an equivalent binding to take place as the first action performed by the synthesized procedure .
// Unconverted code int fib ( int x ) { if ( x < 2 ) return x ; else return fib ( x - 2 ) + fib ( x - 1 ) ; } // A - normal conversion int fib_an ( int x ) { bool temp0 = x < 2 ; if ( temp0 ) return x ; else { int temp1 = x - 2 ; int tem p2 = fib_an ( temp1 ) ; int temp3 = x - 1 ; int temp4 = fib_an ( temp3 ) ; return temp2 + temp4 ; } }
It is important to convert any implicit method calls that may occur as a result of type casting .
// Original expression long foo = ( long ) ( 1.0 + fib ( 6 ) ) ; //
After A - normal conversion int temp0 = fib ( 6 ) ; double temp1 = ( double ) temp0 ; double temp2 = 1.0 + temp1 ; long foo = ( long ) temp2 ;
Temporary variables must not be introduced for those procedure or method calls that appear as the immediate expression part of a return statement .
// Original form return fib ( fib ( x ) ) ; // Incorrect A - normal conversion int temp1 = fib ( x ) ; int tem p2 = fib ( temp1 ) ; return temp2 ; // Correct A - normal conversion int temp1 = fib ( x ) ; return fib ( temp1 ) ;
To keep the examples below concise , subexpressions that can be evaluated without a method call will be considered primitive and will not be converted .
// A -normal conversion int fib_an ( int x ) { if ( x < 2 ) return x ; else { int temp0 = fib_an ( x - 2 ) ; int temp1 = fib_an ( x - 1 ) ; return temp0 + temp1 ; } } // Takeuchi function with A - normal conversion int tak_an ( int x , int y , int z ) { if (! ( y < x ) ) return z ; int temp0 = tak_an ( x - 1 , y , z ) ; int temp1 = tak_an ( y - 1 , z , x ) ; int temp2 = tak_an ( z - 1 , x , y ) ; return tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; }
Step 3 : Live Variable Analysis
It will be necessary to note what variables are live at each continuation .
We are only interested in those variables that are live after a procedure or method call returns .
Those variables that are last used as arguments to the procedure or method call are no longer live .
Step 4 : Procedure Fragmentation
When reinstated , a continuation proceeds from the point at which it was captured .
Methods and procedures have a single entry point at the beginning .
We create a number of procedures each of which has the effect of continuing in the middle of the original procedure .
Because we converted the code to A - normal form , the fragments will always begin with the statement following the assignment associated with a method call .
The arguments to each fragment will be the free variables needed by that fragment .
Each procedure fragment will make a tail - recursive call to the next fragment .
Fragmenting the code may result in a performance decrease from the introduction of so many interprocedural boundaries .
Inlining the fragments will reduce the number of interprocedural boundaries at the cost of increasing the code size .
One possible compilation strategy is to collect the fragments in a single procedure and use a dispatch table to select the correct point .
Fragmentation also replaces iteration constructs with procedure calls .
This will be of concern if there is no mechanism for tail - recursion , but this will be addressed below .
// After A - normal conversion and fragmentation int fib_an ( int x ) { if ( x < 2 ) return x ; else { int temp0 = fib_an ( x - 2 ) ; return fib_an0 ( temp0 , x ) ; } } int fib_an0 ( int temp0 , int x ) { int temp1 = fib_an ( x - 1 ) ; return fib_an1 ( temp1 , temp0 ) ; } int fib_an1 ( int temp1 , int temp0 ) { return temp0 + temp1 ; } // Takeuchi function after A - normal conversion // and fragmentation .
int tak_an ( int x , int y , int z ) { if (! ( y < x ) ) return z ; int temp0 = tak_an ( x - 1 , y , z ) ; return tak_an0 ( temp0 , x , y , z ) ; } int tak_an0 ( int temp0 , int x , int y , int z ) { int temp1 = tak_an ( y - 1 , z , x ) ; return tak_an1 ( temp1 , temp0 , x , y , z ) ; } int tak_an1 ( int temp1 , int temp0 , int x , int y , int z ) { int temp2 = tak_an ( z - 1 , x , y ) ; return tak_an2 ( temp2 , temp1 , temp0 ) ; } int tak_an2 ( int temp2 , int temp1 , int temp0 ) { return tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; }
Step 5 : Closure Conversion
A continuation will be composed of a series of frames .
Each frame is closed over the values of the live variables at the point where the continuation was captured .
Each frame also has a method that accepts a single value ( the argument to the continuation ) and invokes the appropriate procedure fragment .
These classes would be automatically generated if the underlying language were to support anonymous methods .
For example , anonymous delegates in C# could have been used .
The C# compiler implements anonymous delegates through a mechanism of closure conversion where the compiler generates a class to close over the free variables in the delegate .
abstract class ContinuationFrame { abstract object Invoke ( object continue_value ) ; //
Other members omitted .... } class fib_frame0 : ContinuationFrame { //
Live variables for fib_an0 minus the one assigned // by the continuation .
int x ; // Constructor fib_frame0 ( int _x ) { this .x = _x;} // Restart method override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return fib_an0 ( ( int ) continue_value , this .x ) ; } } class fib_frame1 : ContinuationFrame { //
Live variables for fib_an1 minus the one assigned // by the continuation .
int temp0 ; // Constructor fib_frame1 ( int _temp0 ) { this.temp0 = _temp0;} //
Restart method override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return fib_an1 ( ( int ) continue_value , this .temp0 ) ; } } class tak_frame0 : Continuation Frame { int x ; int y ; int z ; tak_frame0 ( int _x , int _y , int _z ) { this .x = _x ; this .y = _y ; this .z = _z ; } override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return tak_an0 ( ( int ) continue_value , x , y , z ) ; } } class tak_frame1 : Continuation Frame { int temp0 ; int x ; int y ; int z ; tak_frame1 ( int _temp0 , int _x , int _y , int _z ) { this .
temp0 = _temp0 ; this .x = _x ; this .y = _y ; this .z = _z ; } override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return tak_an1 ( ( int ) continue_value , temp0 , x , y , z ) ; } } class tak_frame2 : Continuation Frame { int temp1 ; int temp0 ; tak_frame2 ( int _temp1 , int _temp0 ) { this .
temp1 = _temp1 ; this .
temp0 = _temp0 ; } override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return tak_an2 ( ( int ) continue_value , temp1 , temp0 ) ; } }
Step 6 : Code Annotation
The fragmented code is now annotated so that it can save its state in the appropriate continuation frame .
When control is returned to the procedure , it must either perform its normal computation or construct its part of the continuation being saved .
Wrapping each procedure call with an exception handler is probably the most perspicuous way of annotating the code .
Another way would be to create a distinguished return value or to have a special global flag that indicates that a continuation is to be captured .
Exception handling appears to perform best when capturing continuations is a rare occurrance compared with normal procedure calls .
Whatever method is chosen , when the procedure is required to save its state it allocates the appropriate frame structure and adds it to the state being accumulated .
The procedure then returns control to its caller ( by returning the special value or rethrowing the exception ) indicating that a continuation capture is in progress rather than a normal return .
The following code illustrates how each call is annotated by using exceptions .
Note that the calls in tail position ( those that appear as the expression in a return statement ) are not annotated .
// After A - normal conversion , fragmentation , // and annotation .
int fib_an ( int x ) { if ( x < 2 ) return x ; else { int temp0 ; try { temp0 = fib_an ( x - 2 ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new fib_frame0 ( x ) ) ; throw ; } return fib_an0 ( temp0 , x ) ; } } int fib_an0 ( int temp0 , int x ) { int temp1 ; try { temp1 = fib_an ( x - 1 ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new fib_frame1 ( temp0 ) ) ; throw ; } return fib_an1 ( temp1 , temp0 ) ; } int fib_an1 ( int temp1 , int temp0 ) { return temp0 + temp1 ; } // Takeuchi function after A - normal conversion // and fragmentation .
int tak_an ( int x , int y , int z ) { if (! ( y < x ) ) return z ; int temp0 ; try { temp0 = tak_an ( x - 1 , y , z ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new tak_frame0 ( x , y , z ) ) ; throw ; } return tak_an0 ( temp0 , x , y , z ) ; } int tak_an0 ( int temp0 , int x , int y , int z ) { int temp1 ; try { temp1 = tak_an ( y - 1 , z , x ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new tak_frame1 ( temp0 , x , y , z ) ) ; throw ; } return tak_an1 ( temp1 , temp0 , x , y , z ) ; } int tak_an1 ( int temp1 , int temp0 , int x , int y , int z ) { int temp2 ; try { temp2 = tak_an ( z - 1 , x , y ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new tak_frame2 ( temp1 , temp0 ) ) ; throw ; } return tak_an2 ( temp2 , temp1 , temp0 ) ; } int tak_an2 ( int temp2 , int temp1 , int temp0 ) { //
No try / catch annotation needed here return tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; }
Step 7 : Support Code
Once annotated , the procedures and methods will have the ability to save their own part of the continuation .
The code must be run within an additional framework that can collect the pieces , construct an object that models the continuation , and turn a continuation model back into an actual continuation .
The set of frames that are collected as the SaveContinuationException is propagated can be considered a model of a partial continuation .
A real and complete continuation must be constructed from this model in order for it to be used .
We start by capturing a continuation that we will use as the root continuation .
When we need to restore a continuation we will return to the root continuation before beginning the restoration process .
The root continuation acts as the join point of all other continuations .
Since all code using first - class continuations must run in the dynamic context of the root continuation , establishing this continuation should be among the very first actions a program performs .
// Defines the Thunk type as a method of zero arguments .
public delegate object Thunk ( ) ; public class Continuation { //
Private inner class class WithinInitialContinuationException : Exception { public
Thunk thunk ; public WithinInitialContinuationException
( Thunk thunk ) { this .
thunk = thunk ; } } public static object EstablishInitialContinuation
( Thunk thunk ) { while ( true ) { try { return InitialContinuationAux ( thunk ) ; } catch ( WithinInitialContinuationException wic ) { thunk = wic .
thunk ; } } } // Definition of class Continuation to be continued ...
The WithinInitialContinuation method accepts a thunk and invokes it in a context where the initial continuation will receive the value .
It accomplishes this by a throw to a handler in EstablishInitialContinuation .
EstablishInitialContinuation will just keep invoking thunks until one of them actually returns a value .
// Definition of class Continuation continues ... static object InitialContinuationAux
( Thunk thunk ) { try { return thunk ( ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { Continuation k = sce.toContinuation ( ) ; throw new WithinInitialContinuationException ( delegate { return k. Reload ( k ) ; } ) ; } } // Definition of class Continuation to be continued ...
The definition of InitialContinuationAux looks intimidating at first , but it 's function is fairly straightforward .
It 's purpose is to catch any SaveContinuationException that is thrown and build the final continuation object .
The continuation object needs to be restored , but the restored continuation should be rooted at the initial continuation .
We therefore wrap the restore code in a thunk ( the anonymous delegate ) and throw the WithinInitialContinuationException .
The reason that the continuation also appears as an argument to the Reload method will be explained shortly .
Frames are saved in order from most recent to least recent , following the last - in / first - out discipline enforced by the stack .
This is a problem because captured frames will be duplicated if they are part of more than one continuation .
This could lead to a change in the order of space growth of the process .
When saving a continuation , we should save the frames in the reverse order .
When restoring a continuation , we should arrange for subsequent continuation capture to use the saved frames when possible .
We do this by placing in each saved frame a linked list of the frames that are less recent than it .
The second time a frame is saved , it will append the linked list rather than construct a new copy of the frame .
The entire list of frames is not known , however , until they have all been collected .
A Continuation will contain the list of frames .
When the continuation is constructed , the newly captured frames , which have been collected in the reverse order , will be appended to the list of any previously captured frames .
Each new frame will be modified to hold a pointer to the list of prior frames .
// Definition of class Continuation continues ...
FrameList frames ; public Continuation ( FrameList new_frames , FrameList old_frames ) { //
The new frames do n't know what the continuation is below them .
//
We take them one by one and push them onto the old_frames // while setting their continuation to the list of frames below .
frames = old_frames ; while ( new_frames != null ) { Continuation Frame new_frame = new_frames.first ; new_frames = new_frames.rest ; if ( new_frame.continuation != null ) throw new Exception ( " Continuation not empty ? " ) ; new_frame.continuation = frames ; frames = new FrameList ( new_frame , frames ) ; } } // Definition of class Continuation to be continued ...
Restoring a continuation involves recursively restoring each frame .
The code in Continuation has little to do :
// Definition of class Continuation continues ... object Reload ( object restart_value ) { //
Reverse the frames in order to reload them .
FrameList rev = FrameList.reverse ( frames ) ; return rev.first .
Reload ( rev.rest , restart_value ) ; } // Definition of class Continuation to be continued ...
Once reloaded , the continuation expects to have a value returned to it .
The restart_value will be provided to the final frame after it is loaded .
( This value will be the continuation itself if the reload is caused by a continuation capture .
The user visible method CallWithCurrentContinuation is the only method that initiates a continuation save , so the newly created continuation is returned as the result of saving that continuation . )
CallWithCurrentContinuation simply starts a the entire process going .
The continuation frame it creates for itself is unusual in that it calls the receiver function that the user passes in .
// Definition of class Continuation continues ... static void BeginUnwind ( ) { throw new SaveContinuationException ( ) ; } class CWCC_frame0 : ContinuationFrame { ContinuationReceiver receiver ; public CWCC_frame0 ( ContinuationReceiver receiver ) { this .
receiver = receiver ; } public override object Invoke ( object return_value ) { return receiver ( ( Continuation ) return_value ) ; } } public static object CWCC ( ContinuationReceiver receiver ) { try { BeginUnwind ( ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new CWCC_frame0 ( receiver ) ) ; throw ; } //
Should never get here .
return null ; } } //
End of definition of Continuation class .
The FrameList is a simple linked list .
The SaveContinuationException contains two frame lists and provides methods for manipulating them .
Rather than recursively building up a nested exception structure , we mutate the SaveContinuationException as we save the continuation .
This may avoid a large amount of recomputation in the underlying system ( it makes a measurable difference on some CLI platforms ) .
public class SaveContinuationException : Exception { public FrameList new_frames ; public FrameList old_frames ; //
Push a single new frame .
public void Extend ( Continuation Frame extension ) { this .
new_frames = new FrameList ( extension , this.new_frames ) ; } //
Tack on a pile of old frames .
public void Append ( FrameList old_frames ) { this .
old_frames = old_frames ; } public Continuation toContinuation ( ) { return new Continuation ( new_frames , old_frames ) ; } }
As mentioned earlier , continuation frames are loaded recursively .
Because the code has been transformed in the above manner , we know that each frame is awaiting the return value of a procedure or method call and will assign or bind that value to a variable .
Upon reloading a frame we recursively reload the more recent frames and again wait for them to return a value .
But suppose another continuation is captured before the value arrives ?
Since the more recent frames have pointers to the less recent ones , and since we can rely on them to append the shared frame list to the SaveContinuationException , we do not wrap the recursive call to Reload with an exception handler .
Once we begin to execute code within the procedure fragment associated with this continuation , this frame becomes the point at which the shared list of frames ends .
Thus the call to the procedure fragment should be protected by an exception handler that appends the old frames to the SaveContinuationException .
public abstract class ContinuationFrame { public FrameList continuation ; public object Reload ( FrameList frames_above , object restart_value ) { //
The continutation for the call to Reload is the expression // continuation of this assignment followed by the subsequent // try / catch block .
//
This call does * not* have to be protected by a try / catch // because we have not made any progress at this point .
When we Invoke // the continuation function , we need to establish a try / catch in order // to tie this continuation in to the new frames about to be // created .
object continue_value = ( frames_above == null ) ?
restart_value : frames_above.first.Reload ( frames_above.rest , restart_value ) ; try { return this .
Invoke ( continue_value ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Append ( continuation ) ; throw ; } } public abstract object Invoke ( object return_value ) ; }
The complete code is attached as an appendix .
Note that anonymous delegates are not yet standard C# , but named delegates may be used instead .
Java programmers will need to create a Thunk interface class .
Tail Recursion
In the above code we are very careful to avoid wrapping procedures calls in tail position .
If we erroneously wrap the tail call within the Takeuchi function , it becomes obvious why we should not .
We again start with the A - normal transformation , but we transform the call within the return statement as well as the others :
// Takeuchi function with incorrect A - normal conversion int tak_an ( int x , int y , int z ) { if (! ( y < x ) ) return z ; int temp0 = tak_an ( x - 1 , y , z ) ; int temp1 = tak_an ( y - 1 , z , x ) ; int temp2 = tak_an ( z - 1 , x , y ) ; // Erroneous introduction of unneeded temporary int temp3 = tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; return temp3 ; }
The fragmented program is mostly the same , but we have the additional fragment shown here .
int tak_an2 ( int temp2 , int temp1 , int temp0 ) { int temp3 = tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; return tak_an3 ( temp3 ) ; } int tak_an3 ( int temp3 ) { return temp3 ; }
The frame class associated with tak_an3 is this :
class tak_frame3 : ContinuationFrame { tak_frame3 ( ) {} override object Invoke ( object continue_value ) { return tak_an3 ( ( int ) continue_value ) ; } }
And the final annotated code for tak_an2 is :
int tak_an2 ( int temp2 , int temp1 , int temp0 ) { int temp3 ; try { temp3 = tak_an ( temp0 , temp1 , tem p2 ) ; } catch ( SaveContinuationException sce ) { sce .
Extend ( new tak_frame3 ( ) ) ; throw ; } return tak_an3 ( temp3 ) ; }
Notice that the continuation frame tak_frame3 has no instance variables .
There are no free variables beyond the continuation variable in tak_an3 .
tak_an3 is obviously just the identity function .
But more importantly , the Invoke method within the continuation frame tak_frame3 is also the identity function .
While this makes no difference in the computed value , the code that creates continuations will carefully link in these excess frames and the code that restores continuations will splice identity frames back into the stack .
This wastes both time and space .
Removing the identity continuations ( and their associated frames ) when possible is simply tail recursion .
Continuations saved using this method will elide out the frames in tail position .
This method is asymptotically safe - for - space .
By occasionally capturing continuations , we can provide tail - recursive behavior even if the underlying machine does not .
The replacement of iteration constructs with tail - recursive calls during the fragmentation phase is much less of a problem .
To make this a feasible mechanism for implementing tail recursion , enough frames need to be recovered per unload / reload cycle to justify the cost of unloading .
Exception handling is typically quite a bit slower than normal function call / return , so it would be necessary to amortize the cost over hundreds or thousands of method calls .
If stack space is sufficiently large , there may be no need of other tail recursion techniques .
Advantages and Drawbacks
This method provides a mechanism by which first - class continuations may be used without incurring much overhead in the more common situation where they are not used very much .
Code that has been converted as above does not typically exhibit a large decrease in performance .
ANF conversion makes little impact on the performance because the compiler must perform a similar transformation anyway .
The virtual machine model may keep explicit local variables segregated from compiler temporaries , but the actual implementation is likely to store them both in the stack .
( And were there a significant difference , an optimizing compiler could change locals to temporaries or vice versa . )
Procedure fragmentation is likely to introduce overhead , but as noted above , the fragments are only used when continuations are reinvoked .
Inlining the fragments in the main body of the code will essentially eliminate the performance overhead at the cost of a fixed factor of space overhead .
( Inlining every fragment would be proportional to the square of the number of fragments , but inlining the main path would only be double . )
Closure conversion will introduce a number of extra classes and methods , but these methods will not be frequently used .
The runtime overhead should be small , but there will be an increase in code size proportional to the number of code fragments .
Code annotation introduces a number of try / catch blocks .
This , too , will increase code size proportional to the number of code fragments .
Inlined fragments will duplicate the try / catch blocks and have additional size overhead .
The runtime overhead of a try / catch block depends greatly on whether an exception is thrown .
The overhead when no exception occurs is quite small , and may be zero if the virtual machine optimizes this case .
On the other hand , throwing an exception may be very expensive — perhaps several decimal orders of magnitude more than a normal return .
Code that infrequently captures first - class continuations should therefore be comparable to un-converted code in performance , but it may be larger by some amount .
Code that frequently captures first - class continuations may perform quite poorly if the cost of exception handling cannot be amortized over a sufficient number of normal call / return cycles .
Comparison with other methods
CPS conversion
The advantage of this technique over continuation - passing - style conversion is that the continuations of the underlying language still serve as the implementation for Scheme continuations in the large majority of cases .
This technique shares a drawback with continuation - passing - style conversion in that all code that participates in continuation capture must be converted .
A pending method that has not been converted will not save its frame when necessary and the resulting continuation model will be incomplete ( and useless ) .
Cheney on the MTA
Baker 's “ Cheney on the MTA ” technique , used by Winkelmann 's Chicken compiler [ Winklemann ] and in version 1.0 of the REBOL language , is often suggested as a possible means to implement first - class continuations in Java or on the CLR .
Baker 's technique relies on the ability to allocate objects on the stack .
By never returning from a method call , the technique guarantees that a stack - allocated object has indefinite extent .
Neither the JVM and the CLR support the necessary stack - allocation operations .
While the CLR offers the ability to create references to stack - allocated objects , it prohibits stack allocated objects from containing such references : a single continuation frame could be modeled , but a chain of them cannot .
It would , of course , be possible to allocate these objects in the heap , but the main benefit of Baker 's technique — bypassing the heap for short - lived continuations — would be lost .
Future Work
While it seems that the above method correctly implements first - class continuations , a convincing formal proof using operational semantics has not yet been produced .
The method appears to be asymptotically safe - for - space , but a formal description of the space characteristics for all cases would be very useful .
It 's obvious that long chains of tail calls will be collapsed , but not obvious that individual calls repeatedly taken from the same continuation — a tail - recursive loop implemented via continuation operations — exhibits provably safe - for - space behavior .
The implementation described above essentially “ copies the stack ” .
Clinger , et al. , report that hybrid stack / heap implementations that involve lazy copying or using the stack as a cache perform much better than simple stack copying .
Adapting the above technique to a hybrid stack / heap model would be useful .
This technique requires no support from the underlying virtual machine .
Some other techniques for first - class continuations require substantial modification of the underlying virtual machine .
If there are some trivial or minor changes to the virtual machine that will accelerate or enhance the performance of this technique , it is more likely that those would be adopted by the larger community that makes little or no use of first - class continuations .

Lobsters are odd creatures .
Despite their strange , even grotesque appearance and their nickname as the " cockroaches of the sea , " lobsters are a tasty delicacy enjoyed by humans around the world .
But lobsters are also quite sophisticated critters .
A lobster 's two claws can come in several different forms ( crusher and cutter , two crushers or two cutters ) .
It has four spindly antennae and sensing hairs that allow it to smell amino acid in its prey .
And that prey could be a lot of things : lobsters eat up to 100 types of animals and , occasionally , plants .
They 're even known to munch on one of their vulnerable lobster brethren , though that 's more common in captivity ( it 's also why captive lobsters have rubber bands on their claws ) .
Lobsters sometimes bury their food and eat it over several days .
They use teeth located in their stomachs , eat their molted shells ( full of calcium ) and can shed appendages if attacked , wounded or surprised , only to regenerate them later .
Finally , lobsters live in a hierarchy and it's the females who do the courting .
But there 's one lobster fact that trumps them all : lobsters show no apparent signs of aging .
They do n't slow down or become weaker or more susceptible to disease .
They do n't get infertile -- older lobsters are actually more fertile than younger ones .
Most lobsters seem to die because of something inflicted upon them and not because a body part failed or broke down .
They 're such hardy creatures that scientists are n't even sure how old lobsters can get .
Add in that lobsters grow throughout their lives , and one has to ask :
Is it possible that a lobster born before Napoleon and as heavy as an NFL lineman is chowing down on the sea floor ?

Since lobsters never stop growing , lobster age is generally determined by size , though they can grow at different rates depending on the environment .
A one - pound lobster ( the minimum size that can be eaten legally ) is usually 5 to 7 years old , but lobsters raised in 70 - degree water have reached two pounds in less than two years .
The largest lobster on record weighed about 44 pounds .
Presumably , the larger lobsters get , the more competition they face for food resources and the more attention they 'll attract from predators .
That could make life difficult for a mega - lobster .
Professor Jelle Atema of Boston University , who has studied lobsters for decades , wants to test the animal 's limits .
Right now , he has a 15 - pound lobster living in a cage , free from predators and pathogens .
Even in these idyllic conditions , it will be years before Professor Atema 's lobster approaches any records .
We may have to check in with Professor Atema , or his successor , in a few decades to see how the monster lobster measures up , but in the meantime , let 's consider why lobsters live so long and get so big , and what this means for other animals , including humans .

The US marines have faced controversy in Iraq and at home
A spokesman described the video as " clearly inappropriate " and contrary to the standards of the marines .
The marines said they did not know immediately if the film was genuine .
The lyrics caught on video refer to the shooting of Iraqi civilians , especially children , by insurgents and then how a marine responds , opening fire himself .
As the bullets began to fly , the blood sprayed from between her eyes , and then I laughed maniacally
Song lyrics
Haditha : Cover-up ?
The marines are currently embroiled in controversy over the deaths of 24 civilians in the Iraqi town of Haditha last year .
' Inappropriate '
The four - minute song includes graphic descriptions of killings , real or imagined .
Dressed in a green T - shirt and military style trousers and boots , a man sings : " I grabbed her little sister and put her in front of me .
" As the bullets began to fly , the blood sprayed from between her eyes , and then I laughed maniacally . "
Marines spokesman Lt Col Scott Fazekas said : " The video that was posted anonymously is clearly inappropriate and contrary to the high standards expected of all marines . "
Asked whether the singer was a real marine , Mr Fazekas said it was impossible to know : " I can't tell .
In looking at it , it could be anywhere , it could be anybody . "
No decision had been made on whether to launch a formal investigation , the spokesman said .
Most parents , doctors , policy makers and teachers have something in common .
Their primary source for information on obesity and nutrition is the news .
The sheer volume of reports , even in professional circles , urgently presenting an “ Obesity crisis doomed to bring catastrophic repercussions if we do n’t act now ! ” has reached such extremes , that increasingly more experts are speaking out and calling for people to carefully reexamine what they believe and look at the evidence .
Most people believe , for example , that there is a shocking epidemic of childhood obesity .
They believe it must be true because they see the media ’s picture of enormous fat children eating junkfood diets and plopped in front of the TV .
Those headless adults of extreme size are believed to represent the obesity crisis among adults , too .
Even the professional literature can be indistinguishable from the mainstream news in its portrayal of obesity .
This is the post that got the ball rolling .

I 've stepped into my last eyeglasses store .
I 've been wearing glasses since junior high , and the prices have gotten outrageous .
The last pair I bought at LensCrafters , in 2004 , set me back about $ 300 and never fit properly -- even after multiple trips back .
They broke the last week of October . .
I 've had my eye on , and nearly purchased a pair of Silhouettes a few months back .
They were the titanium hingeless variety .
I priced them out at a couple of stores and with AR ( anti- reflective ) lenses with scratch - resistant coating , I was looking at about $ 500 .
I do n't claim to be the smartest guy in the room very often , but no way in hell was I going to buy into that .
The best deal I could find in a store for a pair ( in a non-welfare frame ) approached $ 270 -- without AR lenses .
That would not do either .
There had to be a better alternative .
I decided I was going to find the Silhouettes online .
I already knew what I wanted and they'd have to be much less online .
I googled -- and found them -- for $ 410ish .
Not good enough .
I went back to my search results .
You know how google has the ads on the right side ( of course you do ) ?
I ignore them almost all the time .
For some reason ( my empty wallet ? )
I decided to click a link to Zenni Optical ( a.k.a. , and I kid you not -- 19dollareyeglasses.com ) .
Zenni had a couple of titanium , hingeless frames .
I priced them out .
I decked them out with AR coating ( $ 4.95 compared to $ 50 + in the stores ) , a clip - on sunshade ( $ 3.95 versus $ 70 in the store ) and went to the optional higher - index ( thinner ) lenses .
Total ?
$ 81 .
The downside ?
A couple of things ... they might take a month to arrive and I really had no idea on the quality .
I tend to be an overly cautious buyer .
I 'll buy , but not before I research the hell out the options and alternatives .
Put another way , I 'm an informed shopper .
The markup on eyeglasses frames can routinely be 1000 % !
Yes that was one - thousand percent .
Screw that noise .
For $ 81 , I could risk it , but not before an hour perusing the most - excellent ( if not sparse ) , EyeglassRetailersReview.com .
Zenni got decent reviews , so I ordered on October 26th .
They arrived on Thursday , November 9th and they appear to be perfect .
The lens quality and fit is excellent .
Was I done ?
Nope .
A whole new world had been opened up to me .
I decided I needed to hedge my bets .
I ordered an even cheaper pair from Goggles4u.com also .
This was a cheaper , very different , style frame .
With lenses ( they do n't offer an especially high - index lens ) , they came to $ 25 ( and that includes AR , UV , and anti-scratch coatings ! ) .
I decided to up the ante a bit and add the photochromic treatment ( Transistions -- darken in the sun , clear indoors ) , after all I 'm testing this out and $ 61 is hardly excessive for a pair of glasses .
These arrived on Wednesday , November 8 ( 12 days ) .
For the price , I could n't be happier .
They look great and the lenses are perfect .
The fit and finish is not of the same quality , but they 're really nice just the same .
Without question , I 'll order from each of these places in the future .
The prescriptions are tack sharp , the selections are better than the stores and the prices are incredible .
Eyeglasses for less than a pair of shoes ?
Yes , please .
UPDATE : I got a comment from an optician -- and responded to it here .

Mr. Bloomberg was described as conflicted about a national run , intrigued by the possibility of winning the presidency but telling friends that he would not run unless he was certain that he could win .
And he did not want to go down in history as a spoiler who contributed to the defeat of a Democrat like Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , he has told friends .
Image Ester Fuchs , a former Bloomberg adviser who remains close .
Credit ... Ruth Fremson / The New York Times
“ He will not run to be a spoiler , ” said Ester Fuchs , a special adviser to Mr. Bloomberg in his first term who remains close to the administration .
Even if Mr. Bloomberg in the end does not run , he is now assured of a platform to speak out on national issues and the country ’s political climate , a stage that would fortify him as he enters what is normally the lame - duck portion of his term .
That national platform , coupled with Mr. Bloomberg ’s vast wealth , means that he does not have to rush to make a decision .
The first deadline for filing petitions to qualify for a state ballot is next May in Texas .
Aides involved with other campaigns said they could see a long - shot situation in which Mr. Bloomberg might enter the fray , particularly if the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates emerge as nominees after long and bloody primaries .
“ Is it possible ? ” asked Joe Trippi , who managed Howard Dean ’s campaign in 2004 and is now a senior adviser to John Edwards ’s campaign .
“ Yes , I think it is .
The hardest thing is making sure you are on the ballot , and he has the resources to do it .
The threat of him being in and being a real actor is real , and you have to take that seriously . ”
It 's been 30 years .
I have n't gone out of my way to avoid it , but I never quite found the time to watch it , either .
Mostly , I have n't thought about it at all .
But , well , it 's been 30 years .
Tomorrow , in fact , it will have been exactly 30 years since it first lit up the silver screen .
Time to see Star Wars .
So I did .
I watched it with a friend , a veteran of many viewings .
She knew I wanted to approach this with fresh eyes and an open mind , so she was careful to keep her opinions to herself .
Still , I knew where she stood .
The fact that she owned the DVD told me what she thought of the movie .
Every now and then as we watched , when I ’d turn to her with a bemused expression , she 'd simply smile and say nothing .
A pity that Princess Leia did n't show my friend 's restraint .
Geez Louise , what a harpy .
To say I went into the movie clueless , though , would n't be accurate .
You can't have lived in this world for as long as I have without being exposed to some of the fallout from this pop-culture phenomenon .
Just like you can't avoid being exposed to radiation from time to time .
So , you can kind of see where this is going .
First , though , let me tell you what I liked :
I liked Alec Guinness .
He could make the reading of a grocery list entertaining .
Come to think of it , he almost did that here .
The music .
A good musical score can work wonders , conjuring emotions that would otherwise be absent in the film .
John Williams earned his Oscar here .
And the special effects were pretty good for their time , were n’t they ?
Actually , they still hold up .
And I know that ’s very important to a movie - going culture that values pyrotechnics over plot and character and good writing .
Speaking of which …
It was a movie made a long time ago , in a galaxy apparently lacking even one competent screenwriter .
I ’ve heard dialog that clanked before , but I have n’t seen writing this lame since Deep Throat ( another flick with some pretty good special effects ) .
No wonder Guinness bailed out after the first movie .
When you ’ve played Col. Nicholson in Bridge on the River Kwai and Prince Feisal in Lawrence of Arabia , donning the threadbare cosset of a washed - up Jedi knight and swapping sophmoric banalities with third - rate actors must have been a severe shock to the system .
Sometimes , no paycheck is big enough .
OK , I promised myself not to judge this movie as high art .
Clearly it was n't intended to be that .
As a couple of hours of mindless entertainment , it 's ... harmless .
But to have burrowed itself so deeply into the American cultural consciousness ?
That bothers me .
Are we really the simpletons H.L. Mencken said we were ?
( Rhetorical question . )
Here was my takeaway from Star Wars :
· Uncouth , venal , wisecracking Americans exist in every corner of the universe .
For reasons that escape me , they ’re tolerated wherever they go .
· Jewish princesses seem to travel well , too .
In this case , she really was a princess .
· Even when he ’s spewing bile , James Earl Jones has a great voice .
· It ’s possible to go from being a whiny , spoiled , self - involved teenager to a crack fighter pilot capable of taking down the Death Star with absolutely no training whatsoever .
I know , I know … it was in the kid ’s genes .
· Big fat guys who look like bikers can cut it in the Rebel air force .
· There are bars in San Francisco with more interesting characters .
· Nice try on the quasi-SS uniforms worn by the Empire guys .
The Nazis had better tailors , though .
· Bad writing is bad writing , and bad acting is bad acting .
And ever the twain shall meet .
At least in Hollywood .
· No matter how great an actor Alec Guinness was , he could n’t have saved this picture .
No one could have .
· Annie Hall was the deserving recipient of best picture for 1977 .
· George Lucas ' best movie ?
American Graffiti .
· As I said up top , I can understand the pop culture ripple effect from this movie .
I will never understand the flood .
· I should have waited for the 50th anniversary .

Facebook Some call it " phantom vibration syndrome . "
Others prefer " vibranxiety " — the feeling when you answer your vibrating cellphone , only to find it never vibrated at all .
" It started happening about three years ago , when I first got a cellphone , " says Canadian Steven Garrity , 28 , of Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island .
" I 'd be sitting on the couch and feel my phone start to vibrate , so I 'd reach down and pull it out of my pocket .
But the only thing ringing was my thigh . "
Though no known studies have analyzed what may cause spontaneous buzzing , anecdotes such as Garrity 's ring true with the public .
Spurred by curiosity , Garrity , a Web developer , described the recurring false alarms on his blog .
The response was not imaginary :
More than 30 cellphone users reported that they , too , experienced phantom vibrations .
" I ended up hearing from a lot of people who said , ' Hey , the exact same thing happens to me , ' " Garrity says .
" And it was somewhat comforting , because it made me think I was n't insane , after all . "
Some who experienced recurring phantom vibrations wondered whether the phenomenon had physical roots :
Was it caused by nerve damage or muscle memory ?
But experts say the false alarms simply demonstrate how easily habits are developed .
Psychologically , the key to deciphering phantom vibrations is " hypothesis - guided search , " a theory that describes the selective monitoring of physical sensations , says Jeffrey Janata , director of the behavioral medicine program at University Hospitals in Cleveland .
It suggests that when cellphone users are alert to vibrations , they are likely to experience sporadic false alarms , he says .
" You come armed with this template that leads you to be attentive to sensations that represent a cellphone vibrating , " Janata says .
" And it leads you to over - incorporate non-vibratory sensations and attribute them to the idea that you 're receiving a phone call . "
Alejandro Lleras , a sensation and perception professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , adds that learning to detect rings and vibrations is part of a perceptual learning process .
" When we learn to respond to a cellphone , we 're setting perceptual filters so that we can pick out that ( ring or vibration ) , even under noisy conditions , " Lleras says .
" As the filter is created , it is imperfect , and false alarms will occur .
Random noise is interpreted as a real signal , when in fact , it is n't . "
Phantom cellphone vibrations also can be explained by neuroplasticity — the brain 's ability to form new connections in response to changes in the environment .
When cellphone users regularly experience sensations , such as vibrating , their brains become wired to those sensations , Janata says .
" Neurological connections that have been used or formed by the sensation of vibrating are easily activated , " he says .
" They 're over - solidified , and similar sensations are incorporated into that template .
They become a habit of the brain . "
Cellphone company spokesmen , meanwhile , say they are not aware of any consumer complaints about phantom vibrations .
Cellphones cannot sporadically vibrate on their own , says Mark Siegel of AT&T , formerly Cingular Wireless .
" Perhaps in the mind of the cellphone user only , " he says .
But Rob Whitehouse , vice president of communications at University Hospitals , insists the phantom vibrations he experiences each day are simply proof of how important constant communication is .
" It 's some psychological expression of my need to always be connected , " he says .
" It 's like when e-mail first came out , and we constantly checked our inboxes , because getting a new message was so exciting .
" I like that better than ' I 'm crazy , ' anyway . "

A report published by Chatham House said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had removed Iran 's main rival regimes in the region .
Israel 's conflict with the Palestinians and its invasion of Lebanon had also put Iran " in a position of considerable strength " in the Middle East , said the thinktank .
Unless stability could be restored to the region , Iran 's power will continue to grow , according to the report published by Chatham House
The study said Iran had been swift to fill the political vacuum created by the removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
The Islamic republic now has a level of influence in the region that could not be ignored .
In particular , Iran has now superseded the US as the most influential power in Iraq , regarding its former adversary as its " own backyard " .
It is also a " prominent presence " in its other war - torn neighbour , Afghanistan , according to Chatham House 's analysts .
The report said : " There is little doubt that Iran has been the chief beneficiary of the war on terror in the Middle East .
" The United States , with coalition support , has eliminated two of Iran 's regional rival governments - the Taliban in Afghanistan in November 2001 and Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq in April 2003 - but has failed to replace either with coherent and stable political structures . "
The thinktank said the west needed to understand better Iran 's links with its neighbours to see why the country felt able " to resist Western pressure " .
" The US - driven agenda for confronting Iran is severely compromised by the confident ease with which Iran sits in its region , " said the report .
Western countries , led by the US , are locked in a bitter dispute with Iran over its nuclear programme .
Iran , the world 's fourth largest oil exporter , says it will not give up what it says is its right to peaceful nuclear technology .
The west suspects Tehran is developing nuclear weapons .
The thinktank said : " While the US and Europeans slowly grind the nuclear issue through the mills of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations security council , Iran continues to prevaricate , feeling confident of victory as conditions turn ever more in its favour . "
The report added the country was " simply too important - for political , economic , cultural , religions and military reasons - to be treated lightly " .
One of the report 's authors , Dr Ali Ansari , reader in modern history at the University of St Andrews , told Radio 4 : " The United States needs to take a step back and reassess its entire policy towards Iran and work out , first of all , what does it want and how is it going to achieve it , because at the moment everything is rather like putting a sticking plaster on a fairly raw wound , and it is not really actually doing much at all . "
A 9/11 toxic dust whistleblower , a ground zero hero and one of the individuals influential in the release of documents proving a government cover - up that deliberately put police , firemen and rescue personel at risk , has been raided by a New York SWAT team - who ransacked his home for three hours after he was arrested .
Major Mike McCormack is a hospital technician and civil air patrol pilot who worked the ground zero site for eight days after the collapse of the twin towers .
He is one of the real heroes of 9/11 and was the man who found the American flag that was later displayed as a token of unity atop the rubble .
Within hours McCormack was coughing up black mucus and within days he was coughing up blood as the toxic dust that was deliberately covered up by the EPA poisoned his lungs along with all the other rescue workers , police and firemen who were being used in photo ops by Bush and his cronies while their very livelihoods were being endangered by a government cover-up .
McCormack now suffers from an extreme respiratory sensitivity , has a 5 - millimeter metal nodule in one lung and has been forced to give up his passion of scuba diving .
McCormack is part of an organization lobbying Congress to demand a response from the federal government to the toxic dust cover - up and just compensation for the heroes of 9/11 who were deserted by their own government while the Bush administration had the audacity to use the attacks to fulfil a pre-determined political agenda by exploiting the unity created by the events of that day .
McCormack now describes himself as " permanently ill " as a result of the " death sentence " that was imposed on him via the toxic dust cover - up and sees it as only a matter of time before he " takes the dirt nap , " just as some of his friends who worked with him at ground zero have already done .
McCormack currently occupies a high position of employment in security with the federal government which at the moment he prefers not to divulge .
He has many friends who were affected by the ground zero toxic dust , including New York City police and state troopers .
McCormack was part of the anniversary ceremonies on September 11 2006 and provided many hand - shaking photo - ops for numerous politicians , before returning to his family home in Pennsylvania that night .
McCormack returned to his New York home the next morning in preparation to visit ground zero once again .
On the morning of September 12 , McCormack 's tenant opened the door to see half a dozen detectives outside who began asking questions and demanding to search the building .
The detectives did n't have a warrant and needed McCormack 's signature to conduct the search .
Having nothing to hide and wanting to assist the police , McCormack signed the paper and the detectives entered the house .
" Three minutes later as I 'm walking out of my office with one of the detectives , I have a federal SWAT team that comes in .... men in black and all of a sudden they have 9 millimeter handguns and MP5 machine guns aimed at my head , " McCormack told the Alex Jones Show .
McCormack was ordered to leave the building as the 15 - strong Darth Vader like SWAT team members verbally abused him and commenced ransacking his house for up to three hours " like a cyclone . "
The reason for the raid was said to be as a result of a complaint that the odor of chemicals was smelled coming from the house .
McCormack was essentially being treated as a potential terrorist .
McCormack had mistakenly left a legally owned unloaded gun in the trunk of his car before traveling back from Pennsylvania .
Thinking that the 48 hour out of state law applied he planned to return the gun to Pennsylvania the next day .
Not wanting to take the gun down to ground zero he felt the safest place to put it would be the house .
The gun was subsequently discovered by the SWAT team .
Through a selectively enforced loophole McCormack is now being charged with illegal possession of a weapon because he took the gun out of state .
" The detective who arrested me told me that he had actually seen my photo in New York Newsday that past Thursday - he knew that I was a ground zero hero and the bottom line is finding that weapon unloaded - running the numbers - knowing the gun was legal if he was a decent human being he would have said ' give me 24 hours I will mail it to your house in Pennsylvania where it 's legal - you have your permit ' , " said McCormack .
During the course of the raid , the SWAT team members and detectives interrogated McCormack on his possession of gas masks and biochemical protection suits , despite the fact that these are standard inventory for an individual in McCormack 's line of work and despite diplomas hanging on his wall describing government training in biochemical casualty programs .
The SWAT team also accused McCormack of making chemicals in his barbeque grill .
McCormack 's tenant , who questioned the officials ' behavior during the raid , was " taken to federal jail and nobody has heard from him since , " according to McCormack .
McCormack believes the set - up and the raid are a direct reaction to his activism in helping get the EPA documents that proved the toxic dust cover - up released .
" I said shame on all of them .... yesterday I was recognized as a national hero .... they chose to humiliate me .... they basically flushed my life down the toilet for no reason whatsoever , " said McCormack - who is now shunned by his neighbors and treated as a dangerous criminal , with the local authorities going to the lengths of moving the location of an elementary school bus stop which was outside of his house .
Another reason for the raid may have been McCormack 's increasing awareness of aspects of the 9/11 official story that do n't add up .
McCormack described the comments of individuals who were at ground zero when President Bush visited in the days after the attack .
" Numerous firemen were telling me that they heard numerous secondary explosions all over the building - these guys are seasoned firefighting professionals - a lot of them have military backgrounds and they 're not stupid . "
" Everybody on the planet knew that not only was the World Trade Center hit - it was totally wiped out , " said McCormack .
McCormack said that around 75 % of police , firemen and rescue personnel that he had personally spoke with now believe there is a cover - up pertaining to 9/11 and that many had been threatened that " if they ever open their mouth their pensions are at risk . "
McCormack said that friends of his had also personally been involved in the construction of FEMA internment camps in Washington DC and New York .
BBC investigative reporter Greg Palast was recently charged with " threatening infrastructure " after videotaping a Katrina victims camp in Louisiana and Exxon Mobil 's Baton Rouge refinery - the charge has now thankfully been dropped .
McCormack said the government had " abandoned " the heroes of 9/11 and that " when Alex tells you this is Nazi Germany , you best believe it , " describing the events as " part of the new world order . "
Mike McCormack appreciates any help and legal support as he fights the charge against him .
His home number is 631-886-1622 .

Home -- Campaigns -- Coca -Cola Fact Finding Team on the Coca - Cola Company 's Franchisee Bottling Plant in Sinhachawar , Balia , Uttar Pradesh , India
Illegal Dumping of Sludge at Coca - Cola Bottling Plant - An Environmentally Responsible Company ?
Fact Finding Team
Twenty Residents of Sinhachawar Village , Balia District , Uttar Pradesh Gopal Krishna , scholar from Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health , JNU , New Delhi Nandlal Master , Lok Samiti , Rajatalab , Varanasi Amit Srivastava , India Resource Center , San Francisco , USA Introduction Sinhachawar is a village in Sinhachawar panchayat ( village council ) in Ballia district in the state of Uttar Pradesh .
Ballia district is one of 70 districts of this state in the Azamgarh Division .
Bhojpuri , a dialect of Hindi , is the language of Ballia .
It is part of the parliamentary constituency of Mr. Chandra Shekhar , former Prime Minister of India .
Fact Finding Survey
On May 24 , 2007 , the Fact Finding Team visited the village of Sinhachawar , in Balia district in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh .
Sinhachawar is located about 140 kms east of Varanasi .
Members of the village , including the head of the gram panchayat ( village council ) , Mrs. Chinta Devi , invited us to share their problems with a local bottling plant on the outskirts of the village manufacturing Coca - Cola products .
We attended a community meeting at a school just adjacent to the bottling plant .
Some fifty villagers , including twenty women , attended the meeting .
They briefed us about the problems with the bottling plant .
Following the community meeting , we walked around the bottling plant to witness the conditions around the plant .
The Brindavan Bottlers Limited , a company owned by the Ladhani Group of Companies , operates the bottling plant in Sinhachawar .
The Ladhani Group of Companies is the single largest bottler in India for the Hindustan Coca - Cola Beverages Private Limited , a subsidiary of the Atlanta based Coca - Cola company .
The Brindavan Bottlers Limited has entered into a franchisee relationship with the Hindustan Coca - Cola Beverages Private Limited , and is a franchisee - owned bottling plant .
The plant only manufactures Coca - Cola products .
Explaining the close ( and dynamic ) relationship between the franchisee and the Coca - Cola company , the Coca - Cola company states : " All Indian bottlers of Coca - Cola Company , whether franchisee or company owned , have signed SIBA ( Standard International Bottlers Agreement ) which is renewed on a periodical basis .
The Bottlers Agreement is uniform across the world and in India and both the Franchisee and the company owned Bottler execute a similar agreement .
The Coca Cola Company has only one Quality System for its entire bottling systems ( Company Owned & Franchisee Owned ) around the world .
The control mechanism includes issuing Quality , Environment & Safety standards , conducting review and assessments , diligently monitoring the operations on an on going basis .
The Company has a franchise manager for Franchisees and Regional Technical & Quality Managers who ensures constant monitoring .
The Company also provides technical assistance and training to the people and system capability . "
Survey Observations Illegal Appropriation of Land Illegal Dumping of Waste Water Concerns 1 . Illegal Appropriation of Land
Public Access Road Reclaimed by Community
The primary concern of the villagers was that the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant had built its premises partly on land that included commonly held land of the gram sabha ( village assembly ) .
The gram sabha is essentially the community , and more specifically , those persons within the community over 18 years of age who are eligible to vote in local village council elections .
The villagers informed us that the bottling plant has illegally occupied about 1.5 acres of gram sabha land , and they are demanding that this land must be returned .
On December 9 , 2005 , in an attempt to completely cordon off the plant premises , the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant established a gate across a road that belongs to the community .
The closing of the public road is an illegal act .
The act by the bottling plant was an attempt to enclose the two premises of the plant that lay on either side of the public road into a single enclosed area .
Illegal Dumping of Sludge at Coca - Cola Bottling Plant On December 11 , 2005 , the Sinhachawar panchayat ( village council ) passed a resolution opposing the placement of the gate by the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant that blocked public access to the road .
The same day , community members converged upon the blocked road and removed the gates that were blocking public access .
As of today , the public road remains open , and when walking on the road , one is literally walking through the bottling plant premises , with land to the left and right both utilized by the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling company .
2 . Illegal Dumping of Waste After the community meeting , we were taken for a walk around the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant , including a walk through the public road that had been reclaimed by the community .
To the left of the public road we noticed the presence of what seemed to be the effluent treatment plant .
The effluent treatment plant was clearly not in operation , even though the bottling plant was under operation and producing Coca - Cola products .
Carelessly Scattered Sludge at Coke Bottling Plant
In and around the effluent treatment plant , we noticed large amounts of white and black solid waste scattered , including some in plastic bags .
Many of the bags were torn , and the solid waste was scattered on the ground .
From our experience in confronting Coca - Cola bottling plants in the past about the indiscriminate dumping of their solid waste , we recognized the solid waste to be the sludge from the ( currently non-operational ) effluent treatment plant .
This sludge has been declared to be hazardous by the Indian government authorities .
The British Broadcasting Corporation has also found such waste to be toxic in other plants .
In 2003 , in response to the growing campaign against Coca - Cola , the Central Pollution Control Board of India surveyed eight Coca - Cola bottling plants in India and tested the sludge at all these facilities .
The Central Pollution Control Board found all the sludge at all the Coca - Cola bottling plants it surveyed to be containing dangerously high levels of heavy metals ( Lead , Cadmium , Chromium ) , and ordered the Coca - Cola company to treat its sludge as industrial hazardous waste .
The presence of the sludge in such a carelessly discarded manner is a clear violation of environmental laws in India .
In particular , the dumping of such hazardous waste violates the Hazardous Wastes ( Management and Handling ) Rules , 1989 from the Ministry of Environment and Forests .
Prior to the Central Pollution Control Board order , the Coca - Cola bottling plants in India were simply discarding their sludge as if it were common household waste , and in some instances , even provided their toxic sludge to farmers around their bottling plants as " fertilizer " .
We also walked to the back of the bottling plant , and we noticed a continuous flow of water coming from the bottling plant into a canal just adjacent to the bottling plant .
The canal feeds into the river Ganges .
We also noticed agricultural land adjacent to the bottling plant completely waterlogged with wastewater coming for the bottling plant .
Wastewater from Coca - Cola Bottling Plant Flooding Farmland
We were deeply perturbed to note the indiscriminate discharge of wastewater from the bottling plant .
The wastewater from the bottling plant that is likely to contain pollutants , particularly because the effluent treatment plant was inoperative .
The pollutants leach into the groundwater as well as pollute the agricultural lands - making the land unfit for agriculture and the water unfit for agriculture as well and consumption .
All bottling plants in India that produce Coca - Cola products use and generate hazardous materials .
As per Indian environmental regulations , all bottling plants must clearly post at the plant 's entrance the quantity and kinds of hazardous waste being used and generated by the bottling plant - as per the Supreme Court of India 's order of October 14 , 2003 .
This information must also be updated regularly on the board at the plant premises entrance .
When we arrived at the main entrance to the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant , we were met by some persons from the factory , one of whom went inside the premises to return promptly with a gun , and making sure that it was visible to us .
The display of gun had the intended effect - the entire group decided to back off .
We also noticed that the plant entrance did have the board announcing that the plant generated hazardous materials .
However , there was hardly any information on the board .
In fact , under the first category - which should state the amount of hazardous materials used in their raw materials - the bottling plant had permanently painted " Zero " in Hindi .
The incomplete ( or rather completely empty of data ) board at the entrance of the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant is in violation of Indian environmental laws .
3 . Water Concerns
Incomplete and Illegal Disclosure of Hazardous Waste Information
Our visit to the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant in Sinhachawar coincided with a day that saw the temperature soar to 46 degrees centigrade ( 117 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Such temperatures are not unusual in the area .
The community complained immensely of drying up of hand water pumps , as well as drying up of water wells .
When questioned whether this was relatively new or whether they had experienced this in the past , the community members were emphatic that the trickling from the hand water pumps and the drying up of the wells were more severe after the commencement of the operations of the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant .
The community members also informed us that the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant was in operation irregularly .
When we visited , the plant had been in operation for only a week , according to community members .
Due to growing public awareness , the consumption of the soft drink seems to have reduced considerably .
Recommendations Based on the interactions and discussion with the villagers of Sinhachawar , along with our observations in Sinhachawar , we make the following recommendations :
The Coca -Cola franchisee owned bottling plant in Sinhachawar operated by Brindavan Bottlers Limited must shut down immediately to prevent any further risk to the community and the environment as a result of the indiscriminate dumping of waste by the bottling plant .
The Central Pollution Control Board must initiate an investigation into the bottling plant 's operations immediately , and assess the level of pollution caused by the bottling plant .
The Central Ground Water Board must act immediately to assess the water conditions in the area , both quantitatively and qualitatively .
The District Magistrate of Balia must act immediately to open an inquiry on whether gram sabha lands have been appropriated illegally by the bottling plant .
If and when the Coca - Cola franchisee owned bottling plant is found to be in violation of any laws in India , it must be criminally held liable .
The Coca -Cola franchisee owned bottling plant must be held accountable for all damages it has incurred in the area and should be held responsible for the costs involved in the remediation of the area .

• Mercedes terrorists were ' off the radar '
• Police hunt for Iraqis on the run
• CCTV footage may be unclear
MI5 fear the gang behind the attempt to set off car bombs in London 's West End are an " off - the - radar " cell with no previous links to terrorism .
They are concerned that the gang , now at the centre of a massive international manhunt , have evaded the anti-terror net which has foiled every plot in Britain since the July 7 London bombings in 2005 .
On Friday , two cars laden with petrol and gas were discovered in adjacent streets , apparently primed to cause mass devastation .
Scroll down for more
Police and forensic teams were painstakingly dismantling the cars , looking for anything that might led them to the terrorists .
But Whitehall sources voiced concern that MI5 had no warning of an imminent attack .
The Security Service fear their lack of intelligence points to an unknown ' cleanskin ' home - grown group or an international terrorist cell allowed to slip into Britain from abroad .
The discovery of an " off - the - radar " cell would call into question Britain 's entire anti-terrorist strategy , which has seen millions of pounds of extra cash spent on internal security and a massive expansion of MI5 's manpower .
Despite huge amounts of information on potential terror plots being sifted by MI5 , sources say they picked up no warning of the plan to plant devices in two Mercedes cars , one of which was left directly outside a busy nightclub .
The cars , packed with nails , petrol and gas cylinders , failed to explode .
But despite having 1,600 terror suspects under investigation nationwide , only chance averted a tragedy .
The first bomb was discovered after ambulancemen attending to an injured late - night reveller spotted smoke or gas vapour pouring from a parked car .
A second device , left in another Mercedes parked in an adjacent street , was found only after the car was towed to a police pound because it had been parked illegally .
US sources claimed the bombs failed to go off despite repeated calls to mobile phones rigged to trigger the devices .
Senior Scotland
Yard sources said the two cars contained a " gold mine " of evidence that could provide vital clues from DNA and fingerprint evidence .
Sources said the vehicles provided the best hope of tracking the bombers .
The frantic activity came amid reports from US law - enforcement officials which claimed that British police had a " crystal - clear " image of the man who drove the Mercedes towards the Tiger Tiger nightclub in Haymarket .
The officials , quoted by ABC News , claimed the man bore a " close resemblance " to an associate of terrorist mastermind Dhiren Barot , who was jailed for life in Britain last November .
But British investigators insist they are still desperately trying to clean up the CCTV footage from the cameras , which they hope will show one of the bombers parking his car .
They say the raw footage is " what you would expect from a camera monitoring a street at night , with faces far from distinct " .
One of Barot 's plans was to park limousines packed with gas canisters under high - profile buildings .
But the British sources said while there were some similarities between the Barot plot and this failed attack , there was " nothing else to link them at this stage " .
Whitehall sources admitted they feared the individuals behind the attack might be the nightmare scenario - genuine " cleanskins " .
" If there is no trace then this means the terrorism situation in the UK is much worse than we have believed and everything we have been doing - the expansion of MI5 - will have to be reassessed , " said a highly placed source .
The British sources also revealed that one theory was the terrorists may have been sent from abroad to launch the latest attacks .
Police were still hunting an Iraqi , suspected of plotting similar attacks , who went on the run on June 18 while under a British control order restricting his movements .
The man , who can not be named for legal reasons , is part of a six - man cell linked to Al Qaeda in Iraq and went missing from his home near Manchester .
He was the second of his group to abscond from a control order .
Last August , Bestun Salim also absconded .
Security officials now believe he has left Britain .
The six Iraqis had been living under control orders since autumn 2005 .
They were arrested after an MI5 - led surveillance operation .
Whitehall sources have claimed they were in the final stages of planning attacks , possibly involving car bombs .
Instead of charging the men in open court and exposing sensitive intelligence , the Government imposed control orders , effectively confining them to their homes for 18 hours a day .

,
One of the reasons I started this blog was that I was concerned that constant media coverage of " militant Islam , " " Islamic extremists , " and the like , while undeniably important , might obscure a threat much closer to home - Christian extremism .
American politics was dominated by a neoconservative cabal , influenced by biblical literalism , Christian premilleniumism , militarism , and imperialism .
I soon discovered that these neocons had close ties to the Christian Reconstructionist Nationalist , and Dominionist movements .
The more I learned , the more convinced I became that the danger was real .
Nevertheless , I was unprepared for the intensity of hatred and intolerance I found as I dug deeper into Christian extremism .
Most of all , I was unprepared for Christian terrorism .
Just like we distinguish between Muslim extremists and terrorists on the basis of their behavior ( e.g. , terrorism involves actual or threatened violence ) , we can distinguish between Christian extremists and Christian terrorists .
When I think of Christian terrorism , I first think of those who bomb family medical clinics , murder doctors , etc. ( e.g. , Paul Hill ) .
This seems to be the most common form of terrorism linked to Christians .
But there are others with other preferred targets .
Some examples include : There are many more incidents which would fit here , as well as other less clear cut examples .
Some would consider pastors molesting child congregants to be a form of terrorism , and others would cite the outrageous war on science as a possible contender .
Christian terrorism is a real concern , reminding us that Muslims do not have a premium on religiously - inspired aggression .
Opposing Christian extremism remains a worthwhile goal , but one which must not overlook the even more sinister reality of Christian terrorism .

1 Introduction
Cooperation between independent agents depends upon establishing a degree of security .
Each of the cooperating agents needs assurance that the cooperation will not endanger resources of value to that agent .
In a computer system , a computational mechanism can assure safe cooperation among the system 's users by mediating resource access according to desired security policy .
Such a mechanism , which is called a security kernel , lies at the heart of many operating systems and programming environments .
I claim that the lambda - calculus can serve as the central component of a simple and flexible security kernel .
The present report supports this thesis by motivating and describing such a lambda - calculus - based security kernel and by giving several lines of evidence of the kernel 's effectiveness .
The W7 security kernel1 consists of the call - by - value lambda - calculus with a few simple extensions to support abstract data types , object mutation , and access to hardware resources .
Within W7 , each agent ( user or subsystem ) has a separate evaluation environment that holds objects representing privileges granted to that agent .
Because environments ultimately determine availability of object references , protection and sharing can be controlled largely by the way in which environments are constructed .
The effectiveness of W7 as a security kernel is demonstrated through three lines of evidence :
its ability to address certain fundamental security problems that are important for cooperation ( Sections 2.2--2.3 ) ; a structural correspondence with familiar operating system kernels ( Section 2.4 ) ; and the success of Scheme 48 , a complete implementation of the Scheme programming language built on W7 , as a basis for secure , robust , and flexible programming systems ( Section 3 ) .
1.1 Security Kernel Based on Lambda - calculus
The lambda - calculus is a calculus of functions , and is concerned with how computations are abstracted and instantiated and how names come to have meanings .
W7 is a lambda - calculus of procedures , which are generalized functions capable of performing side effects .
Procedures correspond to what in an operating system would be programs and servers .
Side effects include access to input and output devices and to memory cells .
It is through side effects that communication , and therefore cooperation , is possible .
However , side effects can be harmful .
For example , a computer - controlled robot arm can easily hurt a person who gets in its way .
The purpose of a security kernel is to allow control over access to objects .
The challenge in designing a security kernel is not to support sharing or protection per se , but rather to allow flexible control over the extent to which an object is shared or protected .
One way in which the lambda - calculus and W7 provide protection is through closure : a procedure is not just a program but a program coupled with its environment of origin .
A procedure cannot access the environment of its call , and its caller cannot access the procedure 's environment of origin .
The caller and callee are therefore protected from one another .
Sharing is accomplished through shared portions of environments , which may include procedures that allow still other objects to be shared .
To address a number of authentication and certification problems , W7 includes an abstract data type facility .
( Usually this term refers to type abstraction enforced through compile - time type checking , but here it means a dynamic information hiding mechanism . )
The facility is akin to digital signatures : a subsystem may sign an object in such a way that the signed object may be recognized as having been definitely signed by that subsystem .
In particular , a compiler might use a particular signature to mean that the signed procedure is one that is " harmless " ( in a technical sense ) and is therefore safe to apply to fragile arguments .
1.2 Scheme 48
Scheme 48 is a complete Scheme system that tests W7's capacity to support safe cooperation .
Scheme 48 was a major design and implementation effort and therefore constitutes the heart of the project .
Section 3 gives an overview of Scheme 48 , but most of the information on it is to be found in the related reports [ 13,23 , 6 , 19 ] .
A large amount of engineering goes into making a practical programming environment , and in Scheme 48 security has been a concern in nearly every component .
Major facilities whose design has been shaped by security concerns include the following :
The module system [ 19 ] .
Modules are truly encapsulated , just as procedures are , allowing them to be shared safely .
The macro facility [ 6 ] .
Macros are also closed , like procedures .
This allows a form of compile - time security in which a module may export a macro while protecting objects used in the macro's implementation .
Dynamic variables .
Information can be communicated from caller to callee through an implicit dynamic environment .
However , a dynamic variable must be accessed via a key , and such keys can be protected .
A major theme running through the design of Scheme 48 is avoidance or minimization of shared global state .
For example , the virtual machine ( byte - code interpreter ) has only an essential minimum set of registers ; there are no registers that hold global symbol tables or environment structure as there is in most Lisp and Scheme implementations .
Another example is in the run-time system modules , which never alter global state ( in Scheme terms , no top - level variable is ever assigned with set ! ) .
Data structures manipulated by these modules can be instantiated multiple times to avoid conflict over their use .
Finally , the success of Scheme 48 ( and therefore of W7 ) is demonstrated by its use in a number of applications .
These include the programming environment for the Cornell mobile robots , where Scheme 48 runs with no ( other ) operating system support [ 23 ] , and a secure multi-user environment that runs on workstations .
2 The Security Kernel
This section is an exposition , starting from first principles , of the problem of secure cooperation between independent agents .
It describes a simple idealized security kernel that addresses this problem .
The presentation is intended to show the essential unity of security concerns in operating systems and programming languages .
The idealized kernel is based on a graph of encapsulated objects .
Accessibility of one object from another is constrained by the connectivity of the object graph and further limited by object - specific gatekeeper programs .
The kernel enables the natural construction of a variety of mechanisms that support secure cooperation between agents .
In particular , an agent can securely call an untrusted agent 's program on a sensitive input .
The kernel is similar to those of the capability - based operating systems of the 1970's [ 15 , 34 ] .
The main differences are that this kernel is simpler , more abstract , and more clearly connected with programming language concepts than are classical capability systems .
2.1 Safe Computer - Mediated Cooperation
The participants in a cooperative interaction carry out a joint activity that uses or combines the resources that each provides .
Resources might include energy , information , skills , or equipment .
Each agent relinquishes control to some extent over the resources that the agent brings .
If the agent values a resource , relinquishing control over it is dangerous , because the resource may come to harm or may be used to cause harm .
To assure a resource 's safety when control over it is relinquished , it is desirable for an agent to be able to dictate precisely the extent to which control is relinquished .
A trusted intermediary can be helpful in this situation .
The resource is handed over to the intermediary , who performs actions as specified by the recipient subject to restrictions imposed by the source .
A computer system may be useful in a cooperation not only because of the resources it may provide ( programmable processor , memory , network communications , programs , and so on ) , but also because of its potential to act as a trusted intermediary .
The agent providing a resource can dictate use restrictions in the form of a program , and the resource 's recipient can specify actions to be performed with the resource in the form of a program .
Program invocation therefore plays a critical role in computer - mediated cooperation .
But when a program is untrusted ( as most programs should be ! ) , invoking it is fraught with peril .
The invoking agent puts at risk resources of value , such as inputs and the use of parts of the computer system .
Similarly , the agent who supplied the program may have endowed it with ( access to ) resources of value to that agent , so those resources are also put at risk when the program is invoked .
Consider the following scenario :
Bart writes a program that sorts a list of numbers .
Being a generous fellow , he gives this useful program to Lisa , who has expressed an interest in using such a program .
But Lisa is hesitant to use Bart 's program , since Bart may have arranged for the program to do sneaky things .
For example , the program might covertly send the list to be sorted back to Bart via electronic mail .
That would be unfortunate , since Lisa wants to sort a list of credit card numbers , and she would like to keep these secret .
What should Bart and Lisa do ?
There are two distinct approaches to solving the safe invocation problem --- that is , the general situation in which each agent in a cooperation has resources that should be protected when one agent 's program is invoked in a context ( inputs and computer system ) given by another agent .
In the first approach , the program runs in a limited computing environment , one in which dangerous operations ( such as sending mail ) are prohibited .
In the second approach , the second agent rejects the program unless it bears a recognized certificate of safety .
The next two sections look at the two approaches .
2.1.1 Limited Environments
One way to avoid disclosure of the numbers ( an instance of the confinement problem [ 14 ] ) would be for Lisa to isolate a computer running Bart 's program , making it physically impossible for the program to do any harm .
This would require detaching the computer from the network , removing disks that should not be read or written , setting up a special network or disk for transmitting the inputs and results , and so on .
These measures are inconvenient , time - consuming , and expensive .
They are also crude ; for example , it should be permissible for Bart 's program to fetch information from the network or disks , but not write information .
This selective restriction would be impossible using hardware configurations .
The basic idea is sound , however .
The trick is to ensure that all accesses to sensitive resources are intercepted by a special supervisor program .
The supervisor program checks the validity of the access attempt and allows it to go through only if it should .
The most straightforward method by which this is achieved is through the use of an emulator .
An emulator is a program that mimics the role that the processor hardware usually plays in decoding and executing programs .
For instructions that are always safe , the emulator simulates the hardware precisely ; for dangerous instructions , the supervisor program is invoked .
Use of an emulator makes programs run slowly , so a more common alternative is the use of a special hardware feature available on many computers called " user mode " .
When the processor is in user mode , all dangerous operations are preempted , causing the supervisor program to be invoked .
The supervisor program runs in an ordinary ( non-user or " supervisor " ) mode , so it may implement whatever protection policy it likes .
Here is how safe program invocation might be accomplished using an architecture with user - mode support :
The invoker runs the program in user mode , telling the supervisor program which operations are to be permitted .
The supervisor program monitors all potentially dangerous operations , refusing to perform operations that are not permitted .
When the program is done , it executes a special operation to return to supervisor mode .
2.1.2 Screening and Certification
Another way to avoid disclosure of her list of numbers would be for Lisa to screen Bart 's program to verify that it contains no dubious operations ( such as calls to the send - email program ) .
This would probably require her receiving the program in source form , not as a binary ; the program would have to be of modest size and written in a language familiar to Lisa .
She would also need access to a compiler and time on her hands to run the compiler .
But even if Lisa were willing and able to go to this trouble , Bart might be unwilling to give the source program to her because it contains information that he wants to keep secret , such as passwords , material subject to copyright , trade secrets , or personal information .
This dilemma could be solved with the help of a trusted third party .
There are many different ways in which a third party might help ; the following is a variant of the screening method suggested above that does n't require Lisa to obtain Bart 's source program .
Suppose that Bart and Lisa both trust Ned .
Bart gives his source program to Ned with the instructions that Ned is not to give the source program to Lisa , but he may answer the question of whether the program is obviously harmless to run .
( " Obviously harmless " could mean that the program uses no potentially harmful operations , or it could be a more sophisticated test .
Because harmlessness is uncomputable , any such test will be an approximation . )
Lisa obtains the machine program as before , and asks Ned whether the machine program is obviously harmless to run ; if he says it is , she runs it with assurance .
In the screening approach , the agent invoking the program rejects it unless it bears a recognized certificate of safety .
Following this initial check , invoking the program is just as simple as invoking any fully trusted program .
There is no need for an emulator program or user - mode hardware support .
Here is how safe program invocation might be accomplished using the screening approach :
The invoker checks to see whether the program is definitely restricted to operations permitted by the invoker .
The invoker refuses to run the program if it appears to use any unpermitted operations .
If not , the invoker runs the program on the real machine .
Harmful operations need n't be prevented , since they wo n't occur ( if the certifier is correct ) .
Screening has the drawback that some cooperation is required from the person supplying the program .
He must go to the trouble of obtaining certification , and perhaps even change the program so that it is certifiable .
2.2 A Simple Kernel
A security kernel is the innermost layer of an operating system or programming language , the fundamental component responsible for protecting valued resources from unwanted disclosure or manipulation .
Isolating the security kernel from the rest of the system helps to ensure reliability and trustworthiness .
Simplicity is important in a kernel because the simpler the kernel , the more easily it can be tested and verified .
What follows is just one of many ways to define a security kernel .
This design , which I 'll call W7 , is intended to be suitable for use in either an operating system or a programming language .
W7 might also be seen as a theory of security that can be used to describe security in existing programming languages and operating systems .
W7 organizes the computer 's resources into a network of logical entities that I 'll call objects2 .
Objects are the basic units of protection in W7 .
A link in the network from one object to another means that the second is accessible from the first .
The objects to which a given object has access are its successors , and the objects that have access to a given object are its predecessors .
Objects may be thought of as representing particular privileges , capabilities , or resources .
For example , an object might represent the ability to draw pictures on a display , to transmit messages over a communications line , to read information from a data file , or to run programs on a processing element .
New nodes enter the object network when a running program requests the creation of a new object .
In order to avoid the dangers of dangling references ( links to deleted nodes ) and memory leaks , object deletion is left in the hands of the kernel .
The kernel may delete an object as soon as there is no path through the network to it from the current computation .
Absence of such a path is detected by an automatic mechanism such as reference counts or garbage collection .
There are several different kinds of objects .
These will be introduced as they are needed in the presentation .
2.2.1 On the Choice of Notation
In order to elucidate the kernel design and describe its consequences , it will be necessary to present specimen programs , and for this purpose I must choose a notation --- that is , a programming language .
The choice is in principle arbitrary , but is important because it affects the exposition .
If I were most interested in comparing W7 to currently popular and familiar security kernels in operating systems , I would present my examples as programs that perform kernel operations in the traditional way , using system calls .
Programs would be written in an Algol - like language , or perhaps in a machine - level language such as C .
This would be a viable approach , since there is nothing in the theory that precludes it ( see Section 4.3.3 ) .
However , this approach makes some of the examples awkward to write and to understand .
Particularly awkward is the frequent case where in creating a new object , a program must specify a second program .
Most traditional languages do n't have a good way for a program to specify another entire program .
Even given such a notation , the division of labor between the language and the security kernel might be difficult to tease apart .
For this reason I prefer to use a notation in which kernel operations have natural forms of expression .
The language of the Unix " shell " approaches this goal since program invocation has a natural syntax , and operations on programs and processes are more concise than they would be in Algol or C .
However , I would like to go a step further in the direction of languages with integrated kernel support , and use a version of Scheme [ 7 ] in which all Scheme values , including procedures , are identified with objects known to the W7 kernel .
ML [ 16 ] would have been another reasonable choice of language .
2.2.2 On the Notation
To avoid confusion with other Scheme dialects , I 'll refer to the small dialect of Scheme to be used in examples as " Scheme - " The grammar given in Figure 1 summarizes Scheme - .
E stands for an expression .
E ::= var | ( lambda ( var ... ) E ) | ( E E ... ) | constant | ( if E E E ) | ( begin E ... ) | ( let ( ( var E ) ... ) E ) | ( let var ( ( var E ) ... ) E ) | ( arith E E ) | ( cons E E ) | ( car E ) | ( cdr E ) | ( null ?
E ) | ( pair ?
E ) | ( list E ... ) | ( symbol ?
E ) | ( eq ? E E ) | ( new - cell ) | ( cell - ref E ) | ( cell - set ! E E ) | ( enclose E E ) | ( control E E ) arith ::= + | - | * | / | < | = | > Figure 1 : A grammar for Scheme
The meaning of most of the constructs is as in full Scheme .
The first group of constructs is Scheme - 's lambda - calculus core : variable reference , procedure abstraction ( lambda ) , and application .
Each of the second group of constructs ( if , etc. ) has a special evaluation rule .
The third group is a set of primitive operators .
In every case all of the operand expressions are evaluated before the operator is applied .
Most of these are familiar , but a few require explanation :
A cell is a mutable object with a single outgoing access link ( field ) .
( new - cell ) creates a new , uninitialized cell , ( cell - ref cell ) returns the object to which cell currently has a link , and ( cell - set ! cell obj ) redirects cell 's outgoing link to obj .
The enclose operator takes a program and a specification of a successor set and converts them to a procedure .
enclose might be called on the output of a Scheme - or Algol compiler .
Its details are unimportant .
See Section 2.2.4
The control operator controls hardware devices .
For example ,
( control keyboard ' read - char )
To reduce the complexity of the exposition , pairs will be assumed to be immutable , and eq ? will be assumed to be applicable only to symbols and cells .
I 'll use the term value to describe integers , booleans , symbols , and other entities that carry only information , not privileges .
Whether or not values are considered to be objects is unimportant .
2.2.3 Procedures
The W7 kernel is principally concerned with procedures .
Every procedure has an associated program .
The procedure 's program can access the procedure 's successors and use them in various operations .
Access is not transitive , however : access to a procedure does not imply the ability to access the procedure 's successors .
Any such access is necessarily controlled by the procedure 's program .
In this sense , the procedure 's program is a " gatekeeper " that protects the procedure 's successors .
The primary operation on a procedure is application to an argument sequence .
When a procedure is applied to arguments ( which may include other objects or values , such as integers ) , its program is run .
In addition to the procedure 's successors , the program has access to the arguments .
It may use any of these objects , but no others , in making new objects or in performing further applications .
Applications are written in Scheme - using the syntax
( procedure argument ... ) .
f
( f x y )
x
y
The essential source of security in W7 is that a procedure 's program is absolutely limited to using the procedure 's successors and the objects that are in the application 's argument sequence .
Scheme - lambda - expressions are a concise notation for specifying procedures .
When a program evaluates a lambda - expressions , a new procedure is created .
The new procedure 's successors are the objects that are the values of the lambda - expression 's free variables , and its program is specified by the body of the lambda - expression .
Here is an example illustrating lambda and application .
( lambda ( x ) ( g ( f x ) ) )
f
g
h
f
g
f
g
h
h
A procedure 's program could be written in a language other than Scheme - , for example , Algol , C , or a machine language .
I will consider this possibility later ( Section 4.3.3 ) .
2.2.4 Initial program
Suppose that someone --- let 's call her Marge --- obtains a brand - new machine running W7 as its operating system kernel .
She turns it on , and the machine begins executing an initial program .
The initial program is an ordinary program with no special relation to the kernel other than it is executed on power - up .
In principle , the initial program is arbitrary : it is whatever the manufacturer has chosen to provide .
The initial program is given access to objects that represent all of the computer system 's attached hardware resources , which might include keyboards , displays , facsimile machines , traffic lights , etc .
( Hardware may be manipulated with the control primitive operator , whose details are not important here . )
Because these resources are objects , any given program will only have access to those hardware resources to which it has been explicitly granted access by the initial program ( perhaps indirectly through a series of other programs ) .
In order to make the computer as generally useful as possible , the manufacturer has installed an initial program that executes commands entered from the keyboard .
One kind of command is simply a Scheme - expression .
When an expression is seen , the initial program compiles and executes the xepression and displays its result .
For example , the command
(+ 2 3 )
A second kind of command is a definition , which looks like
( define var E ) .
( define square ( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) )
( square 17 )
To be able to use existing resources , commands need to have access to them .
For this reason they are processed relative to an environment , or set of variable bindings , allowing objects to be accessed by name .
The environment initially includes two kinds of resources : I / O devices ( with names like the - display and the - fax - machine ) , and handy utilities that the user could have written but the manufacturer has thoughtfully supplied .
The utilities are the usual Scheme procedures such as assoc , write , read , and string - append , as well as a few others to be described below .
( define command - processor ( lambda ( env source sink ) ( let loop ( ( env env ) ) ( let ( ( command ( read source ) ) ) ( if ( definition ? command ) ( loop ( bind ( cadr command ) ( eval ( caddr command ) env ) env ) ) ( begin ( write ( eval command env ) sink ) ( loop env ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define definition ?
( lambda ( command ) ( if ( pair ? command ) ( eq ? ( car command ) ' define ) # f ) ) )
Figure 2 : A simple initial program .
The initial program just described , including utilities and command processor , might have been written entirely in Scheme - , in which case it would resemble the program of Figure 2 : eval is a utility that executes a Scheme - expression , of which a representation has been obtained from the user or otherwise received or computed .
It makes use of a compiler that translates the expression into a form acceptable to the kernel 's primitive enclose operator .
The translated expression is given access to a specified environment , and executed .
( define eval ( lambda ( expression env ) ( ( enclose ( compile - scheme - expression ( map car env ) ) ( map cdr env ) ) ) ) )
Definitions are handled using bind , which extends a given environment by adding a binding of a variable to a value .
With environments represented as association lists , bind could be defined with
( define bind ( lambda ( name value env ) ( cons ( cons name value ) env ) ) ) .
2.2.5 Administration
Now we have enough mechanism at our disposal to consider some examples .
Marge intends to set up her machine so that Lisa and Bart can use it and its resources .
As a means for the machine 's users to share objects with one another , she defines a simple object repository :
( define * repository * ( new - cell ) ) ( cell - set ! * repository * '( ) ) ( define lookup ( lambda ( name ) ( let ( ( probe ( assoc name * repository * ) ) ) ( if probe ( cdr probe ) # f ) ) ) ) ( define publish !
( lambda ( name object ) ( cell - set !
* repository * ( cons ( cons name object ) * repository * ) ) ) )
lookup
publish !
assoc
Next , Marge makes an environment for Bart 's command processor .
It must include all of the objects that Bart is to be able to access initially .
There is no harm in including all of the system 's utility procedures ( assoc , read , etc. ) , since no harm can come from his using them .
However , she needs to be careful about the I/O devices .
For the sake of safety , she includes only Bart 's own I/O devices in Bart-env :
( define make - user - env ( lambda ( from - user to - user ) ( bind ' standard - input from - user ( bind ' standard - output to - user ( bind ' lookup lookup ( bind ' publish ! publish ! utilities - env ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define Bart - env ( make - user - env from - Bart to - Bart ) )
Bart 's command processor can now be initiated with
( command - processor Bart - env from - Bart to - Bart )
( command - processor Lisa - env from - Lisa to - Lisa )
from -Lisa
to - Lisa
Bart and Lisa are able to share objects with each other through the repository :
Bart : ( define really - sort ( lambda ( list - of - numbers ) ( if ( null ? list - of - numbers ) '() ( insert ( car list - of - numbers ) ( really - sort ( cdr list - of - numbers ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define insert ( lambda ( x l ) ( let recur ( ( l l ) ) ( if ( null ?
l ) ( list x ) ( if (< x ( car l ) ) ( cons x l ) ( cons ( car l ) ( recur ( cdr l ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( publish ! ' sort sort ) Lisa : ( define Bart - sort ( lookup ' sort ) ) ( Bart - sort ' ( 9 2 7 ) ) => ' ( 2 7 9 )
Of course , Bart and Lisa must both trust Marge , who still has full control over all resources .
They must treat her administrative structure as part of the machine 's trusted substrate .
( Trust can not be avoided .
Bart and Lisa must trust Marge 's software and machine just as Marge trusts the manufacturer 's installed software , the manufacturer trusts the semiconductor chip factories , the chip factories trust the solid state physicists , and so on . )
2.2.6 Trusted Third Party Establishes Safety
There is already a great deal of safety built in to the structure of the W7 kernel .
When a procedure is invoked , the only privileges the invoked procedure 's program has are ( 1 ) those that it was given when created ( " installed " ) , and ( 2 ) those that are passed as arguments .
If the two privilege sets contain no dangerous privileges , then there is no way that any harm can come from the invocation .
However , sometimes there is reason to pass privileges or sensitive information to an unknown program .
This can be a problem if when installed the program was given access to channels over which the information might be transmitted , or to a cell in which a privilege or information may be saved for later unexpected use .
To return to the main example from the introduction : Lisa wants to call Bart 's sort program without risking disclosure of the input , which may contain sensitive information .
Specifically , the risk she runs is that Bart has written something like
( define * list - of - numbers * ( new - cell ) ) ( define sort ( lambda ( list - of - numbers ) ( begin ( cell - set !
* list - of - numbers * list - of - numbers ) ( really - sort list - of - numbers ) ) ) ) ( define really - sort ( lambda ( list - of - numbers ) ( if ( null ? list - of - numbers ) '() ( insert ( car list - of - numbers ) ( really - sort ( cdr list - of - numbers ) ) ) ) ) ) ( publish ! ' sort sort )
( cell - ref * list - of - numbers * )
Sketch of a rudimentary solution :
Ned , who both Bart and Lisa trust , sets up a " safe compilation " service .
Bart submits the source code for his sort program to Ned 's service .
Ned 's service analyzes Bart 's source code to determine whether the program might divulge its input to Bart or to anyone else .
( For a definition of " might divulge , " see below . )
Ned evaluates ( for initialization )
Bart 's program in a fresh environment and extracts access to the resulting sort procedure .
Ned makes sort available to Lisa .
Lisa obtains the program from Ned , and runs it with assurance that the input will not be divulged .
Whether a program " might divulge " its input is undecidable , so any test for this property is necessarily conservative : such a test will reject perfectly benign , useful programs that can't easily be cast into a recognizably safe form .
There are many possible tests .
One simple test is the following one : a program might divulge its input if the program is not obviously applicative ; and a program is obviously applicative iff none of its lambda - expressions contains a ( cell - set ! ... ) expression .
One can clearly do better than this ; some methods will be discussed later ( in the context of the module system , section 3.2 ) .
To see how this safe compilation service might work , let 's continue with the scenario begun above in which Marge has established a public object repository .
The first problem is that Lisa needs a way to determine authorship of a repository entry , to distinguish Bart 's entries from Ned's .
Assuming that all objects published by Ned are safe , she must make sure that the sort procedure she uses is published by Ned , not by Bart .
( define make - publish !
( lambda ( submitter ) ( lambda ( name object ) ( publish ! name ( cons submitter object ) ) ) ) ) ( define make - user - env ( lambda ( user - name from - user to - user ) ( bind ' standard - input from - user ( bind ' standard - output to - user ( bind ' lookup lookup ( bind ' publish ! ( make-publish ! user - name ) utilities - env ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define Bart-env ( make-user - env ' Bart from - Bart to - Bart ) ) ( define Lisa-env ( make-user-env ' Lisa from - Lisa to - Lisa ) ) ( define Ned-env ( make-user - env ' Ned from - Ned to - Ned ) ) Figure 3 : Marge 's improved repository .
This is a fundamental flaw in the repository , so Marge must fix it .
See Figure 3 .
Each object in the repository is now accompanied by the name of the user who put it there , and each user 's environment now has its own publish !
procedure .
Bart 's publish !
procedure , for example , will store entries of the form ( cons ' Bart object ) into the repository .
Here is the complete scenario :
Ned : ( define publish - if - safe !
( lambda ( name program ) ( if ( safe ? program ) ( publish ! name ( eval program ) ) ' not - obviously - safe ) ) ) ( define safe ?
( lambda ( program ) ... ) ) ( publish ! ' publish-if-safe ! publish - if - safe ! )
Bart : ( define sort - program '( begin ( define sort ... ) ( define insert ... ) sort ) ) ( define publish - if - safe ! ( cdr ( lookup ' publish-if- safe ! ) ) ) ( publish - if - safe ! ' safe - sort sort - program ) Lisa : ( define safe - sort - entry ( lookup ' safe - sort ) ) ( define safe - sort ( if ( eq ? ( car safe - sort - entry ) ' Ned ) ( cdr safe - sort - entry ) " safe - sort not published by Ned " ) ) ( safe - sort ' ( 9 2 7 ) )
safe - sort
publish !
publish !
( lookup ' safe - sort )
2.3 Authentication
This section treats the problem of authentication and considers its solution in W7 .
Broadly speaking , authentication is any procedure or test that determines whether an object is trustworthy or genuine .
For example , checking a student identification card authenticates the person presenting the card as being a student as indicated on the card .
Having been found authentic , the person may be granted privileges appropriate to that status , such as permission to use an ice rink .
Authentication is an important capability of secure computer systems .
Some examples of authentication in such systems are :
A request received from an untrusted source such as a public communications network must be authenticated as originating from an agent that has the right to perform the action specified by the request .
In a dynamically typed programming language such as Lisp or Snobol , a value must be authenticated as being of the correct type for an operator receiving it as an operand .
The solution to the safe invocation example of Section 2.2 involves a test for the authenticity of a putatively safe or trustworthy object ( Bart 's program ) .
Authentication is necessary for reliable transmission of an object using an untrusted messenger ( or channel ) .
To authenticate an object transmitted from a sender to receiver , the sender must label or package the object so that it can be recognized ( authenticated ) by the receiver , and this labeling or packaging must be done in an unforgeable and tamper - proof manner .
I 'll use the word capsule for an object so labeled or packaged .
A physical analogy for a capsule would be a locked box to which only the receiver has a key .
When the object is digital information , such as a sequence of characters or numbers , well - known digital cryptographic techniques can be used to implement authenticated transmission [ 24 ] .
However , object transmission in a security kernel that limits object access according to an accessibility graph requires a different mechanism .
With such a kernel , transmitting a name for an object , whether encrypted or not , is never the same as transmitting access to that object , since interpretation of names --- and therefore accessibility of named objects --- is local to each object .
Access can only be transmitted through approved channels such as argument and result transmission in a procedure invocation .
2.3.1 Abstract Data Types
Authentication is required whenever the results of one procedure are intended to constitute the only valid inputs to another procedure .
These objects , the results and valid inputs for a related set of procedures , are called the instances of a type or abstract data type .
The set of related procedures is called a module or cluster in the context of programming languages , or a protected subsystem or server in classical operating systems parlance .
For example , consider a central accounting office that issues account objects to clients .
Clients may create new accounts using a new - account procedure and transfer money between accounts using a transfer procedure .
The integrity of accounts is of great importance to the accounting office ; it would be unfortunate if a client created a counterfeit account and then transferred money from it into a valid account .
Therefore , transfer needs to authenticate the accounts it 's asked to manipulate as genuine --- that is , created by new - account .
From the clients ' point of view , accounts are objects that clients may manipulate a certain set of operators .
From the accounting office 's point of view , accounts are capsules transmitted from new - account to transfer via an untrusted network of interacting clients .
2.3.2 Key - based Authentication
Section 2.2.6's solution to the safe invocation problem relies on the exchange of object names .
Bart tells
Lisa the name of his object in the trusted repository ( safe - sort ) , and Lisa obtains from the repository ( 1 ) the fact that the object is authentically safe ( i.e. placed there by Ned ) , and ( 2 ) the object itself , which Lisa can then use .
If Bart wishes to keep his object a secret between him and Lisa , he may give it a secret key in the form of an unguessable name , i.e. a password , and transmit that name to Lisa .
Passwords can be made long enough and random enough to make the probability of unauthorized discovery arbitrarily small .
( Of course , this assumes that there is no way for untrusted agents to obtain a list of all names defined in the repository . )
Instead of passwords , it is possible to use cells ( Section 2.2.2 ) as keys , as suggested by Morris [ 18 ] .
Like passwords , cells are objects with unique , recognizable identities .
Unlike passwords , they have all the security advantages of objects : access to them can only be transferred through kernel - supported operations .
There is no need to use a single repository , such as Marge 's , to store all objects that might need to be authenticated .
Each separate abstract data type can have its own mapping from keys to objects .
Figure 4 gives an implementation of a general authentication facility ( essentially the same as that described by Morris [ 18 ] ) .
Each call to new - seal returns a new triple of objects ( seal , unseal , sealed ? ) .
Each such triple represents a new abstract data type .
seal encloses an object in a capsule that can be authenticated ; unseal is an extraction operator that reveals the encapsulated object iff the capsule is authentic ( i.e. was made by this seal ) ; and sealed ?
is a predicate that returns true iff the capsule is authentic .
( define ( new - seal ) ( let ( ( instances ( new - cell ) ) ) ( cell - set ! instances '( ) ) ( let ( ( seal ( lambda ( rep ) ( let ( ( abs ( new - cell ) ) ) ( cell - set ! instances ( cons ( cons abs rep ) ( cell - ref instances ) ) ) abs ) ) ) ( unseal ( lambda ( abs ) ( let ( ( probe ( assq abs ( cell - ref instances ) ) ) ) ( if probe ( cdr probe ) ( error " invalid argument " abs ) ) ) ) ) ( sealed ?
( lambda ( x ) ( if ( assq x ( cell - ref instances ) ) #t # f ) ) ) ) ( list seal unseal sealed ? ) ) ) )
Figure 4 : Implementation of seals .
It is assumed that assq ( association list lookup ) can determine cell identity .
Cells ( other than the one holding the association list ) are used only for their identities , not for holding references to objects .
As an example , the program of Figure 5 is an implementation of the accounting system described above .
It 's very important not to publish account - cell , since doing so would allow clients of the accounting system to set account balances to arbitrary values .
( define account - operators ( new - seal ) ) ( define make - account ( car account - operators ) ) ( define account - cell ( cadr account - operators ) ) ( define account ? ( caddr account - operators ) ) ( define new - account ( lambda ( ) ( make - account ( new - cell 0 ) ) ) ) ( define transfer ( lambda ( amount from to ) ( let ( ( from - cell ( account - cell from ) ) ( to - cell ( account - cell to ) ) ) ( if ( >= ( cell - ref from - cell ) amount ) ( begin ( cell - set ! from - cell (- ( cell - ref from - cell ) amount ) ) ( cell - set ! to - cell (+ ( cell - ref to - cell ) amount ) ) ) ( error ( error " insufficient funds " ) ) ) ) ) ) ( publish !
' new - account new - account ) ( publish ! ' transfer transfer ) Figure 5 : Accounting module .
2.3.3 The Case for Kernel Support
As seen above , existing kernel mechanisms ( cells , procedures ) can be used to implement authentication .
However , I would like to argue in favor of a direct authentication mechanism implemented in the W7 kernel .
An argument in favor of this is required due to the stated goal of keeping the kernel as simple as possible .
A key - based authentication mechanism has several practical problems .
Performance :
It 's inefficient to have to search the central table on every use of an instance .
Memory management :
How can the kernel know whether it is safe to delete an object ?
Straightforward garbage collection techniques do n't work because the central table holds links to all of the type 's instances , and the garbage collector is ignorant of the association between the key and the object .
Semantic obscurity :
It would be unfortunate if creating an object of an abstract data type were necessarily a side effect , as it would be if a key had to be generated .
The side effect defeats optimizations such as subgraph sharing .
A direct approach , not involving a keyed table , requires kernel support .
The following argument shows that in the W7 kernel without abstract data type support , a recipient can be fooled no matter what packaging method is used .
Consider a candidate encapsulation and authentication technique .
Without loss of generality , we can assume that capsules are procedures .
In order to authenticate a capsule , the recipient has no choice but to apply it to some argument sequence , since there is nothing else that can be done with a procedure .
This application can appropriately be called a " challenge , " since examining its result distinguishes authentic capsules from nonauthentic ones .
If the challenge is correctly met , then an additional application of the capsule ( or of some related object returned by the challenge ) will then either return or perform some operation on the underlying object .
But given an authentic capsule , an untrusted messenger may easily make a counterfeit , as follows : the counterfeit answers challenges by consulting the authentic capsule and returning what it returns , and handles other applications in any way it likes .
This argument does n't even consider the problem that the challenge might diverge , signal an error , or cause troublesome side effects .
The annoyance of handling these situations ( see section 4.3.1 ) would argue against using procedures , even were there a way to do so .
Kernel support can be provided in W7 by adding new - seal as a new primitive operator :
E ::= ( new - seal )
Figure 6 : In an operating system , accessibility of resources is controlled by kernel data structures called protection domains ( or simply domains ) .
A domain includes a segment table or page table that specifies which memory segments are directly accessible by a program running in that domain .
A domain also specifies availability of other resources , such as I/O devices ( here represented by a network ) and procedures residing in other domains .
( References to such procedures are called remote procedure handles or inter-process communication handles in the literature . )
2.4 Protection Domains
This section attempts to explain the correspondence between W7 and more conventional operating system kernels .
In a typical secure operating system , the objects that are immediately accessible to a running program constitute its protection domain ( or simply domain ) .
These objects are of various sorts , including the following ( there may be others ) :
Mapped memory segments .
These contain both programs and the data stuctures that programs directly manipulate .
Descriptors for hardware devices and files .
Descriptors control access to devices and the file system , and may include information such as buffers or position markers .
In some operating systems , references to procedures residing in other domains ( variously called gateways , inter- process communication handles , or remote procedure handles ) ; I will write simply handle .
A handle consists of a domain together with an address within that domain specifying the procedure 's entry point .
Another nifty table omitted .
( Sorry ! )
This table is isomorphic to table 6 . Figure 7 : In a lambda - calculus interpreter , accessibility of resources is controlled by interpreter data structures called environments .
An environment contains references to data structures , such as lists , that are directly accessible to a program running in that environment .
An environment also specifies availability of other resources , such as I/O devices ( here represented by a network ) and procedures connected to other environments .
The program refers to objects using short names ( numbers ) .
For example , a load or store machine instruction uses a memory address to access a memory segment object , while a system call instruction requesting that information be read from a file uses a file descriptor number to specify the file .
The domain determines how these names are to be interpreted .
The domain contains a segment table or page table for use by the hardware in interpreting memory addresses , and tables of descriptors and handles for use by system call handlers in interpreting I/O and crossdomain procedure call requests .
Just as a domain maps a name ( address or descriptor number ) to an accessible object ( memory segment or descriptor ) , an environment in W7 maps a name ( identifier ) to its denotation ( value or object ) .
The various object types are parallel in the two frameworks as well ( see Figures 6 and 7 ) :
Mapped memory segments correspond to lists and cells .
( Full Scheme also has vector and string data types , which are better approximations to memory segments than are lists and cells .
A more complete version W7 might support memory segments directly . )
Device and file descriptors correspond to W7 devices .
Handles correspond to W7 procedures .
Just as a handle is a domain coupled with an entry point , a procedure is an environment coupled with executable code .
3 Implementation Experience
A variant of the W7 kernel forms the basis of a complete Scheme implementation called Scheme 48 .
This section describes Scheme 48 , analyzes it from a security standpoint , and discusses experience with its use in various applications in which security is important .
The implementation of Scheme 48 consists of two parts : a virtual machine that manages memory and executes a byte - code instruction set , and a set of modules that are executed by the virtual machine .
Virtual machine code could in principle be replaced by real machine code , but this would require a significant compiler construction effort , and that is beyond the scope of the project at this time .
The virtual machine approach has the virtues of robustness , small size , and ease of portability .
( A thorough discussion of Scheme 48 as a Scheme system can be found elsewhere [ 13 ] . )
3.1 Scheme 48 Security Kernel
Scheme 48 's security kernel is implemented in part by the virtual machine and in part by a set of run-time system modules defined using privileged instructions supplied by the virtual machine .
The VM component includes instructions such as car , which is secure because the VM raises an exception if it is applied to anything other than a pair , and application , which raises an exception when given a non-procedure .
The run -time modules include the exception system and the byte - code compiler .
Both of these export interfaces whose use is unrestricted , but they are defined in terms of lower - level operations that are restricted .
Type safety for instructions such as car and procedure application rely on an assiduously followed tagging discipline .
All values , both immediate values such as small integers and access links to objects stored in memory , are represented as descriptors .
A descriptor has a tag that distinguishes immediate values from links .
Arithmetic operations require immediate - tagged operands and affix immediate tags to results .
The non-tag portion of a descriptor for a link holds the hardware address of the stored object .
A stored object is represented as a contiguous series of memory locations .
The first memory location holds a header specifying the object 's size and type ( procedure , capsule , cell , etc. ) , while subsequent locations hold descriptors ( which include the links to the object 's successors in the accessibility network ) .
The tagging discipline guarantees that object addresses are never seen by the programmer .
Not only does this promote security , it also gives the memory manager freedom to move objects from one place to another , guaranteeing that such relocations will not affect any running computations .
The security kernel does not provide direct access to the byte - code interpreter .
Instead , new programs must be given as Scheme programs that are byte - compiled by eval .
The compiler translates the program to a byte - code instruction stream , and then uses a privileged make - closure instruction to make a procedure .
Use of the make - closure instruction is restricted for two reasons :
An agent could defeat security by constructing and executing code streams containing privileged instructions .
For example , the closure - env instruction allows unrestricted access to all the successors of an arbitrary procedure .
instruction allows unrestricted access to all the successors of an arbitrary procedure .
An agent could execute an object access instruction with an index specifying a location beyond the end of the object being accessed .
This might fetch a reference to an object that should n't be seen .
( For performance reasons , some instructions perform no bounds checking .
They rely on the byte - code compiler to ensure that indexes are valid . )
Abstract data types ( Section 2.3.2 ) are used heavily in the Scheme 48 run -time system .
They are provided in the form of a record facility , which is more convenient and efficient than the theoretically equivalent but more elegant new - seal would be .
In the common case where a capsule is a tuple ( that is , has several fields ) , only a single object ( a record ) is created for both the tuple and the capsule .
Not only is less memory consumed , but field references require only one indirection instead of two .
The features of Scheme 48's security kernel beyond what W7 defines are the following :
The basic features of standard Scheme [ 12 ] : characters , vectors , the full suite of numeric operators , strings , string / symbol conversion .
None of these has security implications ; they belong to the kernel for the sake of efficiency .
Exception handling .
It is important for the agent initiating a computation to be able to gain control when the computation leads to an exceptional event such as division by zero .
A special construct allows all exceptions or exceptions of certain types to be intercepted .
Fluid variables .
Every application implicitly passes an environment that maps unique tokens ( called fluid variables ) to cells .
A special construct extends the environment with a new binding .
The interesting aspect from a security perspective is that if the fluid variable ( unique token ) is protected , then bindings of the fluid variable will be protected .
Thus if X calls Y calls Z , then it can be the case that Z can access fluid bindings established by X , while Y can't .
This contrasts with a similar facility in Unix ( process environments ) , which has no such protection .
calls calls , then it can be the case that can access fluid bindings established by , while can't .
This contrasts with a similar facility in Unix ( process environments ) , which has no such protection .
Multiple threads of control .
A new thread of control may be started with ( spawn thunk ) .
Synchronization mechanisms include locks and condition variables .
Each thread has its own separate exception context and fluid environment .
( Threads are not really secure ; see Section 4.3.1 . )
. Synchronization mechanisms include locks and condition variables .
Each thread has its own separate exception context and fluid environment .
( Threads are not really secure ; see Section 4.3.1 . )
Immutability .
This feature is somewhat of a frill , but useful .
A pair , vector , or string can be made read - only , as if it had been created by ( quote ... ) .
Immutable objects may be passed to untrusted procedures without worry that they might be altered , since an attempted mutation ( set - car ! , vector - set ! , etc. ) will raise an exception .
Variables and pairs are mutable , as in Scheme .
3.2 Module System
Scheme 48 provides operators for constructing and querying environments .
Environment control is as important for determining what is in an environment as it is for advertising what is not in an environment .
Roughly speaking , an environment that excludes dangerous things can't be dangerous .
The environments that are manipulated as objects and passed to the compiler are called top - level environments or packages .
Packages have both static and dynamic components .
The static component defines information important for compilation : syntactic keywords , type information , and early binding information such as definitions of in - line procedures .
The dynamic component of a package determines how variables obtain their values at run time .
Bindings move between packages via another kind of environment - like object called a structure .
A structure is a particular package 's implementation of a particular interface ; and an interface is a set of names , with optional types attached :
( make - simple - interface names ) => interface ( make - structure package interface ) => structure
( make - package structures ) => package
Here is a simple example .
Assume that scheme is defined to be a structure holding useful bindings such as define , lambda , and so forth .
( define repository - package ( make - package ( list scheme ) ) ) ( eval '( begin ( define * repository * ... ) ( define lookup ... ) ( define publish ! ... ) ) repository - package ) ( define repository - interface '( lookup publish ! ) ) ( define repository ( make - structure repository - package repository - interface ) ) ... ( define repository - client ( make - package ( list scheme repository ) ) )
( I describe the Scheme 48 module system in more detail elsewhere [ 19 ] . )
3.2.1 Checking Structures for Safety
As seen in Section 2.2.6 , it is useful to be able to determine whether a procedure is safe .
In particular , it is useful to know whether a procedure has access to any resource that could be used as a communication channel to the outside world .
If it were possible to traverse the access graph starting from the procedure , it would be possible to determine the answer to this question .
However , such a traversal cannot be done outside the security kernel .
In Scheme 48 , information necessary to perform certain safety checks is contained in the network of structures and packages .
This network can be considered a quotient ( summary ) of the true access network .
A procedure is considered safe when the structure that exports it is safe ; a structure is safe if its underlying package is safe ; and a package is safe if every structure that it opens is safe .
This definition of " safe " is recursive , so it can be made relative to a basis set of structures that are assumed safe .
Following is a crude implementation of such a safety predicate :
( define ( safe ? struct assumed - safe ) ( cond ( ( memq struct assumed - safe ) # t ) ( ( structure ? struct ) ( every ( lambda ( o ) ( safe ? o assumed - safe ) ) ( package - opens ( structure - package struct ) ) ) ) ( else # f ) ) )
This is n't a precise test , but it has the virtue of being simple and intuitive .
Rather than rely on sophisticated techniques such as types , effects , verification , or other kinds of code analysis , it only involves visibility of values .
The usual Scheme 48 run-time system provides a number of structures , some of which may be considered safe for the purpose of guaranteeing the absence of communication channels .
The structure implementing the standard Scheme dialect is not one of these because it is so easy to use it to create such channels .
A different safe - scheme structure is defined that eliminates the possibility of such channels , as described following :
One source of channels is assignments to top - level variables .
For example :
( define * last - sorted - list * # f ) ( define ( sort l ) ( set ! * last - sorted - list * l ) ( really - sort l ) )
set !
set !
Mutations to data structures reachable from top - level variables also must be prohibited , but now instead of excluding mutations entirely ( as suggested in Section 2.2.6 ) , we exclude top - level variables that hold mutable data structures .
This is done by excluding normal Scheme define and replacing it with a variant that makes the right assurances :
( define ( var var ... ) body ) is allowed .
is allowed .
( define var exp ) is allowed iff exp evaluates to a verifiably immutable object .
Of course , safe - scheme also excludes all operations that access the file system .
It includes I / O routines that take explicit port arguments ( such as ( display x port ) ) but excludes their implicit - port variants ( ( display x ) ) .
3.2.2 Static Privileges
The fact that static bindings of syntactic keywords , macros , and primitive operators are all determined relative to a package means that any such entity may be considered a privilege to be granted or not .
For example , a particular agent ( user or subsystem ) might be denied access to all operators that have side effects just by excluding those operators from environments available to the agent .
Scoping of all syntactic and static entities effectively allows an equation between languages and modules , with the derivative ideas of safe languages and modules that are safe because they are written in safe languages .
Macros are secure in a precise sense : names that a macro introduces into expanded program text are resolved in the environment of the macro's definition , not in the environment of its use .
For example , a package might define letrec in terms of set !
and then export letrec without exporting set ! .
The structure with letrec and its clients can be considered applicative ( or safe ) even though the process of compiling it involves source to source rewrites containing imperative operators .
( Further explanation of the problem of lexically scoped macros and the algorithm used by Scheme 48 to implement them can be found elsewhere [ 6 ] . )
3.3 Deployed Configurations
The Scheme 48 configurations described here are the more interesting ones with respect to protection problems .
Other configurations include the single - user development environment ( by far the most evolved ) , a multiprocessor version written at MIT by Bob Brown , and a distributed version developed by Richard Kelsey and others at NEC .
3.3.1 Mobile Robot System
Scheme 48 is the operating system running on four mobile robots at the Cornell Computer Science Robotics and Vision Lab ( CSRVL ) .
The main on - board computer system is a 16 MHz MC68000 with 500K RAM and 250K EPROM .
User code is isolated from operating system internals by Scheme 's type and bounds checking ; this means that there 's nothing that a user program can do to harm the robot .
This is important because the robots are programmed by undergraduates taking the robotics course , many of whom are relatively novice programmers .
The Scheme 48 virtual machine running on the robot communicates with a development environment running in either Scheme 48 or Common Lisp on a workstation .
The byte - code compiler runs on the workstation and sends byte codes to be executed on the robot .
This " teledebugging " link offloads to the workstation all debugging and programming environment support , including the byte - code compiler .
This division of labor frees up precious memory on the robot .
The tether , which can be a physical encumbrance , can be detached without affecting the virtual machine , and reattached at any time for debugging or downloading .
( A more detailed description of the mobile robot system can be found elsewhere [ 23 ] . )
3.3.2 Multi-User System
The Scheme 48 development environment can be configured to be accessed over the Internet by multiple users , with each user given a separate initial evaluation environment and thread of control .
This configuration , developed by Franklyn Turbak and Dan Winship and called Museme , is a multi-user simulation environment ( MUSE ) similar to LambdaMOO [ 8 ] .
3.3.3 WWW Evaluation Server
Scheme 48 can be configured to be run by a WorldWide Web server ( httpd ) in response to an appropriate request arriving over the Internet .
This service aims to promote Scheme by giving the general network public a chance to experiment with it easily .
A request contains a Scheme program and a Scheme expression , which execute on the server .
The server replies with the printed representation of the result of evaluating the expression .
The environment in which the programs and expressions run has been explicitly reduced from the default environment in order to limit the capabilities of programs , which , because they come from anyone on the Internet , should n't be trusted .
3.4 Security in Standard Scheme
Scheme 48 implements the Scheme standard [ 12 ] .
In order to maintain security , however , users are given different instantiations of some of the built - in procedures , much as a conventional time - sharing system would provides users with different address spaces .
If shared between agents , the following procedures would spell trouble for safe cooperation :
Any built - in procedure that opens a file , such as open - output - file .
A buggy or malevolent program could overwrite important files or read sensitive information from files .
.
A buggy or malevolent program could overwrite important files or read sensitive information from files .
Anything that binds or accesses the current input and output ports , such as display with no explicit port argument .
Use of such procedures would allow " spoofing " --- misleading output that could be mistaken for valid messages coming from a legitimate source such as an error handler or command processor .
load , which not only accesses the file system , but also reads and writes a " current " interaction environment .
Multi-agent Scheme 48 systems need to ensure nonconflicting use of the external file system ( assuming there is an external file system ) .
Each agent has her own instantiations of file - opening procedures ; the private versions implement file system access specific to that agent .
Because file opening procedures have access to an agent 's files , a utility that opens files must be given not file names , but rather access to the files in the form of procedures , ports , or some appropriate data abstraction .
This transition from name - oriented to valueoriented protection is exactly what is necessary in order to implement the principle of least privilege [ 26 ] , which is also behind the analogous shift from Lisp 1.5 's dynamic scoping to Scheme 's lexical scoping .
As with files , one agent 's current - output - port procedure is not allowed to access an output port that matters to another agent .
Each agent has his own version of current - output - port , display , write - char , read , etc .
The call - with - current - continuation procedure raises a fundamental question : is the ability to invoke one 's continuation multiple times a privilege that should be available to all agents ?
The answer is n't obvious ; see Section 4.3.2 .
The following features accepted by the Scheme report authors for inclusion in a Revised5 report [ 20 ] are also troubling :
( interaction - environment ) .
Given eval , this has the same problem as load .
. Given , this has the same problem as .
dynamic - wind .
This operator is supposed to establish a dynamic context such that all entries into and exits from the context are guarded by specified actions .
A mischievous program could initiate longrunning or continuation - invoking computations in an unwind action , and / or set up an arbitrarily large number of nested dynamic - winds , perhaps defeating time - sharing or mechanisms established for regaining control after an error or abort request .
4 Conclusion
The basic premise of this work is that program exchange and interaction are powerful modes of cooperation , and should be encouraged by a computational infrastructure that makes them as risk - free as possible .
Program exchange and interaction are becoming easier and more common , thanks to advances in hardware infrastructure ( increasing numbers of computers and growing network connectivity ) , but they are hindered because most computer systems provide little protection against the danger that might be inflicted by unknown programs .
The techniques proposed here to attain safety are :
Employ a security kernel with a simple but powerful semantics that allows fine - grained control over privileges .
Grant an invoked program only the privileges it needs to do its job .
Rights to secondary storage and I/O devices should n't be implicitly inherited from the invoking agents ' privilege set .
Certify that the program has passed a reliable safety test .
Label or " seal " objects so that they can be authenticated later .
None of these ideas is particularly new .
Some can be derived from Saltzer and Schroeder 's 1975 paper on protection in computer systems [ 26 ] , which lays down desiderata for secure systems .
( 1 ) is their principle of economy of mechanism , ( 2 ) is the principle of least privilege , and ( 4 ) is the principle of separation of privilege .
Rather , the main novelty in the present work is the demonstration that a spare security kernel , derived from first principles and spanning the operating system / programming language gulf , can be simultaneously secure and practical .
4.1 Previous Work
4.1.1 Actors
The connection between lambda - calculus and message passing or " actor " semantics is well known [ 29 ] .
Application in lambda - calculus corresponds to message passing in actor systems , with argument sequences playing the role of messages .
The actor languages [ 2 ] and Scheme were both developed as programming language frameworks , with little explicit attention to security concerns or cooperation between mutually suspicious agents .
Security is of course implicit in the fact that an actor ( procedure ) can only be sent a message , not inspected , and that on a transfer of control only the argument sequence is transmitted , not any other part of the caller 's environment .
There is no provision for authentication ( actor recognition or abstract data types ) either in the actor languages or in Scheme .
4.1.2 MUSEs
A " multi-user simulation environment " ( MUSE , also MUD ( multi-user dungeon ) or MOO ( MUD objectoriented ) ) simulates a world with a number of places ( rooms ) and inhabited by users ( players or characters ) .
A MUSE typically runs on a network and accepts connections from many users at once .
Users move from place to place , communicate with each other , and manipulate simulated physical objects .
Because objects may have value to users and users and their programs may attempt actions that can harm objects , and because of their generally open door policy , security is an important issue in MUSE design and administration .
Programming languages for MUSEs ( in particular , that for LambdaMOO [ 8 ] ) have the feature that a caller 's privileges are n't implicitly passed on to a called program .
This is certainly an improvement over the behavior of mainstream operating systems , which give all of the caller 's privileges to the callee .
The correct behavior is dictated by the demands of the environment : users encounter strange objects and do things to them ; this causes invocation of programs belonging to the objects ( or rather their creators ) .
MUSEs are generally based on ad hoc programming languages with many peculiar features that lead to security problems [ 3 ] , inflexibility , or both .
An overall lack of security in MUSEs is betrayed by the fact that it is a special privilege to be a " programmer . "
New members of a MUSE must convince an administrator that they are worthy before they are allowed to write new programs .
4.1.3 Oooz
Strandh 's Oooz system [ 30 ] resembles Scheme 48 in aspiring to be a simple , multi-user , Scheme - based programming environment and operating system .
The similarity ends there .
Oooz extends Scheme with a hierarchical , globally accessible namespace and an objectoriented programming framework .
The global namespace is analogous to a conventional file system , with access controlled by access control lists attached to objects .
There is no obvious way in Oooz to implement abstract data types or authentication .
4.2 Discussion
4.2.1 Schroeder 's Thesis
Schroeder studied the problem of cooperation between mutually suspicious principals in his 1972 dissertation [ 27 ] .
He describes an extension to the Multics operating system in which caller and callee in a cross - domain call may protect resources from one another .
He was aware of the problem of protecting parameters from unauthorized transmission , but had nothing in particular to say about it :
In some cases it may be desirable to guarantee that a protected subsystem invoked by another cannot remember and later divulge the values of input parameters .
This problem appears to be very difficult to solve in a purely technical way and will not be considered in this thesis . ( [ 27 ] , page 16 )
4.2.2 Operating System Security
Status quo operating systems ( VMS , Unix , DOS Windows , etc. ) do n't effectively address safe invocation problems .
When a program is invoked , it inherits all of the privileges of the invoker .
The assumption is that every program that a user runs is absolutely trustworthy .
Safe invocation could be implemented in some versions of Unix , but it would require some heavy machinery .
One way would be to have a privileged program that invokes a given program with the privileges of a specially unprivileged user .
Such a program is not standard and cannot be created by an ordinary user .
A different implementation would be to have a network server dedicated to the purpose , but the result would be strangely limited and awkward to use ( file descriptors could n't be passed , interrupts might act strangely , etc. ) .
Unix does have a facility whereby a program 's owner can mark the program in such a way that when the program is invoked , it runs with the program 's owner 's privileges instead of with the invoker 's ( except for arguments ) .
This sounds very similar to safe invocation of procedures , until one reads the fine print , which points out that such a program can obtain all of the invoker 's privileges simply by doing a setuid system call .
Most common operating systems distinguish persistent objects ( files ) from volatile objects ( in Unix , file descriptors ) .
An open system call coerces a persistent object to a volatile one .
Persistent objects have global names , while volatile objects have short numeric indexes that are interpreted locally to a running program .
This " scoping " makes them resemble a procedure 's successor links .
Volatile objects can be passed from one program ( process ) to another that it invokes , but not in any other way .
Many operating system designs support secure program invocation in ways similar to what I describe , but these designs are n't deployed .
It is remarkable that we get by without secure cooperation .
We do so only because people who use programs place such a high level of trust in the people who write those programs .
The basic reason for this high level of trust is that computer systems are isolated from one another .
Without communication , there can be no theft , since stolen goods must be communicated back to the thief .
Any harm that arises is either vandalism or accident .
Vandalism ( e.g. the current epidemic of computer viruses ) sophisticated enough to be untraceable is difficult to carry off and has little payoff for the perpetrator , while really harmful accidents ( as when a commercial software product accidentally erases a disk ) are mercifully rare .
4.3 Future Work
This section points out various shortcomings of W7 and Scheme 48 , and attempts to suggest ways of fixing them .
One of the dreams driving this work is to extend Scheme 48 to cover all operating system services , including device drivers .
At that point it should be possible to dispense with the host operating system and run Scheme 48 stand - alone on a workstation , as it does on the mobile robots .
4.3.1 Preemption
A means to preempt a running process is necessary in any operating system .
An agent , in invoking an unknown object , runs the risk that the invocation will be nonterminating ; therefore the agent must have some way to request that the invocation be halted on some condition , such as receipt of special input from outside the processor ( an abort key or button ) or the passage of a predetermined amount of time .
Preemption is also desirable in that it is necessary and , together with support for first - class continuations or coroutines , sufficient for constructing a scheduler that simulates multiple hardware processing elements in software .
One particularly elegant design for a timed preemption facility is a mechanism known as engines , of which Dybvig and Hieb have published a general implementation [ 11 , 9 ] .
Engines abstract over timed preemption by providing a way to run a computation for a specified amount of time .
They are sufficient to construct a user - mode task scheduler .
Dybvig and Hieb 's engine implementation has two problems for a system in which caller and callee are mutually suspicious :
Response time is sensitive to engine nesting depth ; thus a malevolent callee could pile up a very deeply nested sequence of engines , making response to an outer engine ( which should have priority ) arbitrarily sluggish .
No design is given specifying how engines should interact with waits and interrupts associated with concurrent activities ( such as I/O ) .
( Scheme 48 supports a multitasking scheduler via a threads system , but threads are inferior to engines in several ways .
Threads are less secure than engines , since one 's share of the processor is proportional to how many threads you have ; if you want to take over a processor , you need only create lots of threads .
Scheme 48 's threads give no reliable way to monitor the execution time of a supervised untrusted computation , since the computation can spawn new threads .
And there is no way to limit or even monitor the amount of processor time allocated to a thread , since the threads system does n't keep track of processor time used per thread . )
4.3.2 Continuations
First - class continuations are troublesome when caller and callee are mutually untrusting .
With Scheme 's call - with - current - continuation operator , the callee can obtain the continuation and invoke it twice .
An unwary caller who has continuation code that performs a side effect is then vulnerable to having the side effect happen twice , which may be unexpected and undesired .
Must all code that invokes untrusted objects be prepared for this possibility ?
To deal with the contingency requires code similar to the following :
( let ( ( returned ? ( new - cell ) ) ) ( cell - set ! returned ?
# f ) ( let ( ( result ( untrusted arg ... ) ) ) ( if ( cell - ref returned ? ) ( error " I did n't expect this " ) ( begin ( cell - set ! returned ?
# t ) ( side- effect - to - be- done-only - once ! ) ... ) ) ) )
An unwillingly retained continuation is also undesirable from a resource allocation standpoint , since the continuation 's creator might be penalized for tying down resources ( space ) consumed by the continuation .
4.3.3 Machine Programs
Supporting execution of compiler - generated machine code programs is important for two reasons : it would vastly improve performance relative to Scheme 48 's current byte - code interpreter ; and , by using existing compilers , Scheme 48 could be made to run useful programs written in a variety of languages ( such as Pascal and C ) .
The main difficulty in supporting machine programs is ensuring that the kernel 's security policy is followed ; the machine program must not obtain access to any resources that it should n't have access to .
This could very easily happen , since machine programs can construct arbitrary addresses and attempt to dereference them , or even construct arbitrary machine code sequences and jump to them .
Any object that uses memory in the machine program 's address space , or that is accessible via any sequence of machine instructions , is at risk .
There are several approaches to eliminating the risks associated with machine programs :
Limitation : switch into a limited hardware - provided " user mode " when invoking the machine program .
This is the approach used by most operating systems .
In user mode , memory not belonging to the program is protected from access , and no hardware I/O is permitted .
Some instructions , such as those that alter memory protection registers , are disabled .
A protected environment is thus established , and all instructions are either permitted or actively prohibited .
Verification : a trusted program scans the machine program to make sure that it does n't do anything that it should n't .
Unverified programs are rejected .
Sandboxing : similar to verification , except that extra code is inserted around all troublesome instructions to dynamically ensure that security policy is respected [ 33 ] .
Some programs may still be rejected , but fewer are than would be with verification .
Trusted compilation : a program generated by a compiler may respect security policy by construction ; if we trust the compiler , we will trust its output .
The type and array bounds safety of many compilers , such as many Scheme and Pascal compilers , are sufficient to guarantee that the kernel 's security policy is respected .
Such compilers may be used without change .
Limitation may be the only option if one has little influence over the compiler and program being compiled .
For example , most C programs use pointers in ways that are difficult to guarantee safe by verification or sandboxing , and few C compilers generate object code that checks validity of pointers .
Limitation is to be avoided because transfers into and out of user mode are expensive in many hardware architectures .
On the other hand , for programs that do few control transfers to other programs , use of memory protection hardware may be the most efficient way to detect invalid pointers and array indexes ( that is , to implement kernel security policy ) .
An important part of the implementation of machine program support is the interface between machine programs and the kernel .
That is , how does a machine program perform a kernel operation , such as creating or invoking a procedure , and how are the operands -- generally object references --- specified ?
This will be answered differently depending on the extent to which the machine program can be trusted .
When the machine program is trusted , object references can be represented as pointers to data structures representing objects , and kernel operations can be implemented either as subroutine calls ( e.g. object creation can be accomplished by a call to an allocation routine ) or as code sequences occurring directly in the program ( e.g. invocation of a W7 procedure might be compiled similarly to local procedure call ) .
When the machine program is untrusted , transfers of control outside of the program must be generally accomplished by a trap or system call .
( A few hardware architectures support general calls across protection domains ) .
Object references must be amenable to validation on use , since the program may present an arbitrary bit pattern as a putative object reference .
The method used by most operating systems in similar circumstances is to associate , with each activation of an untrusted machine program , a table mapping small integer indexes to objects .
( In Unix , the indexes are known as " file descriptors . " )
The program presents an index , which the kernel interprets as specifying the object at that position in the table .
Validation consists of a simple range check to determine that the index is within the table .
Alternatively , objects may be given unique names ( perhaps their addresses in memory ) , and these names can be used by untrusted machine programs .
When the program presents a name in a kernel operation , the kernel validates the name by determining whether it occurs in an object table specific to the program 's activation ( as above ) .
This approach is similar to the " capability - based " approach to protection [ 15 ] .
For the W7 kernel , there is little reason to prefer this over the small - index approach , since table searches and unique name maintenance are likely to be complicated and inefficient relative to use of indexes , which can be determined when a program is compiled or installed .
4.3.4 Reflection
Reflection is reasoning about self [ 28 ] .
In a computing system , the concept of reflection comprehends examining the internal structure of objects and continuations for purposes of debugging , analysis , or optimization .
Reflection interacts with security issues in ways that to my knowledge have not been researched , much less resolved .
For example , Scheme 48 's debugger has access to special reflective operators that break all protection boundaries ; it can examine the internals of procedures , records , and continuations .
This is very useful , but unfortunately the debugger is egregiously insecure , since it allows any user access to any value transitively accessible from an accessible object .
It is easy enough to achieve security in Scheme 48 by disabling the debugger , but a better solution would be for the kernel to provide a simple , safe way to examine continuations and procedures , so that an unprivileged debugger could be built .
I believe that this can be done in such a way that a user is able to see what she ought to be entitled to see , but nothing else .
In particular , a user should be able to see any of the information that exists in object representations , as long as that information might have been available to her had she included extra debugging hooks in her own programs .
4.3.5 Other Issues
Persistence .
Some support is needed for keeping objects in secondary storage efficiently , and there should be some guarantees about which objects will necessarily survive crashes .
Currently Scheme 48 relies on an external file system to store information persistently ; this is not integrated with the internal protection system beyond the fact that access to the file system as a whole can be limited .
Quotas .
Limits should be imposed on the amount of memory agents should be allowed to use .
Without this , a malevolent or buggy program can consume all available space , making the system unuseable .
Memory limitation is more difficult than execution time limitation ; the allowed space decreases as memory is allocated , but must increase as memory is reclaimed by garbage collection .
With each object , then , must be associated an " account " to be credited when the object is reclaimed .
This could be done either by putting an extra field in each object indicating the account , or by maintaining distinct regions of memory for different accounts .
The latter is reminiscent of multi-stage garbage collection , and could perhaps be unified with it .
Accountability .
When something goes wrong , it 's nice to know who is responsible , if not exactly how it went wrong .
But responsibility is difficult to assign in cooperative enterprises .
In particular , if something goes wrong when one agent invokes another agent 's program , who is responsible ?
If a server receives a request from a client , is it the server or the client who is responsible for ensuring that the request is a reasonable and safe one ?
Revocation .
There is no way in W7 or Scheme 48 to revoke access to an object .
Objects simulating revokable links could be defined using cells , but it 's not obvious that this would be sufficient .
One would have to decide when giving out access to an object .
The times when one would want to revoke a link might be precisely the times when one did n't anticipate that one would want to .
Distribution .
A network of encapsulated objects lends itself to distribution over a network of computer systems .
One major component of a distributed operating system that is missing from W7 / Scheme 48 is a remote invocation mechanism ( classically called RPC , or remote procedure call ) .
Such a mechanism should have the following properties :
Objects can be passed as arguments and returned as results .
This requires automatic creation of " stub " or delegate objects that forward calls over the network .
Calls are properly tail recursive : in a call from node A to node B , B can make a call to node C specifying that the result is to be sent to A , not B .
to node , can make a call to node specifying that the result is to be sent to , not .
Exceptions are distributed transparently , in that an exception on one machine can find the correct exception handler even if it's on another machine .
4.4 Contributions
The success of Scheme 48 shows that a spare security kernel can provide flexible and solid security without becoming difficult to use or to program .
Is W7 simpler than all other security kernels ?
Much of the complexity in operating system kernels arises from performance concerns that W7 has yet to address , so a rational comparison is difficult .
It is difficult to see how it could be smaller , since all of the services it provides are ( as is shown ) necessary : program ( object ) creation and invocation ; object marking and authentication ; primitive access to I /O devices .
There are some minimalists in the Scheme community who believe that procedures , perhaps together with some primitive data types such as symbols and cells , serve as a basis for the construction of all other useful programming constructs .
I hope that the discussion of authentication and abstract data types ( Section 2.3.3 ) will be seen to refute this position and to show the need for a built - in authentication mechanism in minimal programming languages .
The ease with which Trojan horses and viruses may infiltrate computer systems is appalling , as is the extent to which users must blindly trust software provided by vendors .
I hope I have contributed a bit to the currently unpopular cause of principled solutions to security problems such as these .
I hope the document helps to break down the artificial distinction between programming languages and operating systems .
Progress in both of these areas is hindered by a failure to recognize that the concerns of both are fundamentally the same .
What is needed is operating systems that provide services that are useful to languages , and languages that give convenient access to operating system services .

Many bar girls are sending money to their families back home
Pim , who recently left her job in a go - go bar , has a typical story .
" I grew up in the countryside in Phetchabun , northern Thailand .
My parents were farmers and I helped them in the fields .
We were poor but we always had enough to get by .
When I was about 15 , my family fell apart .
My father always drank a lot , but it became worse and worse , and he started becoming violent .
So my mother , sister and I moved out .
I wanted to study to become a nurse , but when my parents split up I had to leave school and find work as a day labourer , harvesting crops for local farmers .
I did n't like it much , and it only paid 100 baht ( $ 3 ) a day .
At about that time a good friend moved to Bangkok , and when she came back to visit she told me she was earning a lot of money there as a waitress .
Bangkok is known as a prime destination for sex tourists
She asked me to come with her , but at the time I was still 16 and too scared .
A few years later , though - when I had given birth to my daughter , and my husband and I had separated - I changed my mind .
I left the baby in Phetchabun with my mother , and told her I needed to earn some money in Bangkok .
But I did n't tell her what I was doing - I still have n't .
She 'd be so ashamed .
' Can I do this ?'
When my friend took me to a bar in Nana Plaza for the first time , I was really shocked .
I 'd never been to a place like that before , and at the beginning I did n't even know what the dancers were doing .
When I finally realised , I could n't take it and I walked out of the bar .
I kept thinking ' Can I really do this ?'
Initially I decided to work there just serving drinks , but the dancers earned a lot more money , and eventually I agreed to do that too .
For the first month , the bar owners allow girls to get their full salary even if they just work as dancers .
But after that you have to meet a quota of at least 10 customers a month , or your wages will be cut .
THAI SEX WORKERS Prostitution is technically illegal in Thailand , but the law is very rarely enforced Estimates of the number of sex workers vary from 30,000 to more than a million Most Thai sex workers actually cater to local men , rather than sex tourists
Most prostitutes come from northern Thailand , while others are from Laos or Burma Child prostitution and trafficking is also known to be a problem
My first customer was a Western man in his 30s .
It was scary and I really did n't like it , but I just kept thinking about the money .
I could n't wait for him to leave , and when he did I had a shower for a very long time .
I started crying , and thought about what my parents would think if they knew what I was doing .
None of my customers ever asked me about my life ; they did n't care .
There was one time a guy asked me if I was okay , but I did n't know what to say , so I just looked away .
While I was working in the bars , I was often worried about disease , and also about safety .
Some girls earned extra by going out of the bars with the men , but I always used a room upstairs as I was too scared of the risks involved .
My friend once went with a guy to his hotel room , and found lots of other men there too .
She would n't tell me what happened after that , but she was shaking for a long time when she got back home .
I also had some scary experiences myself .
One time a Japanese man followed me all the way home at the end of the night , and he kept screaming at me .
Taxi drivers can also be threatening to bar girls , and we would only dare go home in groups .
Looking forward
Despite these problems , new girls often arrive .
Many customers prefer children or young girls , and the bar owners always encouraged us to recruit teenagers from our home villages .
Even though I got used to it in some ways , I always hated working in the bars .
I made some good friends but there was nothing good about the life I was leading .
Nightlight gives jewellery - making jobs to ex-bar girls
That 's when a friend of mine told me about Nightlight [ a Christian charity offering training and employment for former sex workers , through a jewellery - making business ] .
Since I 've started working there , my life is so much better .
I do n't earn as much as I did in the bars , but it 's worth it , and people here listen to me and care for me .
I 've now got the opportunity to look forward in life .
I want to finish school , and study accounting , so I 'll be able to pay for my daughter to have a good life .
I wish I had never become a sex worker .
I think some foreign men think it 's okay to pay for sex here in Thailand , as they think the girls actually want to do this .
But these men do n't understand that most of us have no choice - we 're just trying to earn money for our families , and waiting for a chance to leave . "
Interview by Kate McGeown , BBC News , Bangkok .
Judging by the ongoing popularity of P2P networks , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's " anti-circumvention " provision has been less than a raging success .
A lot less .
While doing little to impede piracy or the bootlegging of copyrighted works , it did manage to make criminals of entire generations of Americans : anyone who has ever ripped a DVD movie to a laptop in order to watch it on a flight has broken the law , even though such a use clearly seems " fair . "
Now , that same anti-circumvention goodness could be coming to Canada in the form of new copyright legislation that might be introduced as early as this spring .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist points out that the bill is similar to a failed version introduced by the Liberals last year , but it adds a tough anti-circumvention section and carves out additional exceptions for educators .
The way Geist sees it , this is bad news for the consumers and for the Conservatives , should they actually introduce the legislation , as it will have plenty of stakeholders lined up in opposition .
Copyright reform , should it come , might be better served addressing fair use ( or " fair dealing " as it is called in Canada ) .
While Canadian commentators love to complain about following in the footsteps of the American hegemony when it comes to things like the DMCA , the same commentators generally like the American example when it comes to fair use .
That 's because Canada 's current fair dealing copyright exception is quite limited : it 's restricted to " research or private study . "
Additional exceptions exist for news reporting , educational institutions , and museums and libraries , but consumers and content creators alike have few ways to use or comment on content without a license from the copyright holder .
The US currently recognizes a broader set of fair use criteria that are summed up in section 107 of copyright law .
That allows for " criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research . " " Criticism " and " comment " are the two biggest exceptions to copyright law , as they allow anyone with a PC and some creativity to use copyrighted video clips for parody or public criticism .
Although the whole fair use system can be maddeningly vague at times ( it is never defined , except by four questions of Delphic obscurity ) , it has plenty of flexibility and few predefined constraints .
If Canada 's copyright overhaul does stress anti-circumvention but not fair dealing , it will be a victory for groups like the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) but an obvious loss for consumer freedom .
Start ripping those DVDs now .
Newsweek ’s Jonathan Alter warns of a Republican plot to deliver some of California ’s electoral votes to the GOP nominee — even if he loses the state .
The scheme , which depends on California ’s much - abused and confusing proposition system , would award the Golden State ’s electoral votes by congressional district .
Newsweek :
Instead of laboring in vain to turn California Red , a clever lawyer for the state Republican Party thought of a gimmicky shortcut .
Thomas Hiltachk , who specializes in ballot referenda that try to fool people in the titles and fine print , is sponsoring a ballot initiative for the June 3 , 2008 , California primary ( which now falls four months after the state ’s presidential primary ) .
The Presidential Election Reform
Act would award the state ’s electoral votes based on who wins each congressional district .
Had this idea been in effect in 2004 , Bush would have won 22 electoral votes from California , about the same number awarded the winners of states like Illinois or Pennsylvania .
In practical terms , adopting the initiative would mean that the Democratic candidate would likely have to win both Ohio and Florida in 2008 ( instead of one or the other ) to be elected .
Hiltachk , who is lying low for now , is a former campaign lawyer for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The governor ’s office says Schwarzenegger has no position on the initiative and “ had absolutely nothing to do with its development . ”
But whichever way Schwarzenegger goes , several GOP presidential candidates and their financial backers have already offered to help boost the plan .
Just interested in good government ?
They ’ve shown a curious lack of interest in backing the same idea in Red States .

Haskell is great , as it's alanguage .
This means that functions do n't have side effects , so can be reordered , rearranged , inlined etc. very easily .
All this means that you can do reasoning in Haskell in a similar manner to that which is done in mathematics .
Most Haskell programmers will exploit the reasoning properties very often , refactoring their code .
Today I used equational reasoning to solve a problem I was having , which makes a nice ( and simple ! ) introduction .
This work was all in the context of the Supero project , aiming to optimise a word counting program .
I found that in the resultant code , some characters were getting tested for being a space twice ( using ) .
An additional test , and then a branch on a value which is already known , harms performance .
There are two possible reasons for this duplicated test : either the input code does the test twice ; or the optimiser looses some sharing .
After a quick look around I decided that the latter was not occuring , so went to look at the source of If you are using Hugs , a simplewill show you this code , which I 've renamed and reformatted slightly .
The key " eureka " moment is to see thathas all it 's leading spaces dropped .
Therefore , ifhas any characters , the first must be a non-space .
We then retest the first character to see if it is a space in .
This redundant test is unnecessary , but how to remove it ?
In Haskell equational reasoning can be used to remove the test , and serves as a proof that the code still has the same functionality .
The first step is to instantiatein thealternative .
This is safe as the branch above has already examined the constructor , so we do not loose laziness .
Now we know thatis not a space , specifically thatis true .
From now on we will work only within the second case alternative .
We now need the definition ofandto proceed further :
Now we can inlineNow looking atwe can see that we match thebranch .
Furthermore , we know from earlier thatis
True so we will take the first alternative .
This lets us rewrite the expression as : Now we are nearly there .
We can replacewithandwithusing the firstbinding : Now we can renametoandtoAnd finally , to get us back to something very much like our original , we can fold back the .
Just as we were able to replace the left hand side ofwith the right hand side , we can do the same in the other direction :
Now putting this all back into the original definition :
We now have a more efficient version ofwhich at every stage kept the same behaviour .
I have emailed the Haskell libraries mailing list and hopefully this optimisation will be able to be applied to the standard libraries .
In reality , when I did this transformation I skipped the inlining ofand relied on what I knew about its behaviour .
If a student was to do this transformation in an exam , more detail would probably be required going fromin .
Either way , as your experience grows these transformations become more natural , and are a fundamental part of working with Haskell .
Scott Gustafson 's Arizona Economics blog points to another example of a local regulatory body , in this case the Structural Pest Commission , bravely protecting incumbent competitors from new competition .
As background , you should know that though we do n't have nearly as many pests as most places , the ones we do have ( e.g. scorpions ) are essentially unkillable with legal chemical technologies .
The best you can hope for is to tighten up your hose to keep them out .
And we have these lovely rodents called roof rats , sort of like squirrels on steroids who are not cute , who like to come in and take up residence in attics and walls .
So a lot of pest control here is about putting up screens over vents and setting traps rather than spraying chemicals .
As retirees go , Rich Hanley seems like a decent enough guy .
He 's a former cop who came to town a few years ago .
He obeys the law .
He pays his taxes .
In 2004 , he started up a little business , repelling roof rats .
Specifically , he covers vents with steel mesh so the little fellas can't come calling .
Once , we would have applauded such enterprise .
Now , we issue cease - and - desist orders .
Yep , it 's true .
My favorite state bureaucrats over at the Structural Pest Control Commission have decided that Hanley has violated the law ...
" The problem is his advertising , " says Lisa Gervase , executive director of the agency ...
The pest - control cops launched a seven - week probe , concluding that Hanley can do the work .
He just can't tell people why he 's doing the work .
Thus , his sales pitch - " Keep birds and rodents from invading your home " - has to go .
Gervase said the state would have no problem if Hanley says he 's covering vents to keep leaves out .
" But if he 's advertising that he can keep pests from invading your home , that 's pest control , and you need a license for pest control . "

Here , I show you a few great ways to hustle free drinks in your local bar or pub .

I must first point out that I 'm in no way advocating con artists .
Not at all .
These are harmless pranks to play on good friends and co-workers .
And dare I say it , you may even want to try them on family , maybe that weird uncle that never buys you a birthday gift .
The main theme of all these hustles is something called a Proposition Bet .
Basically , a proposition bet is a challenge which looks like it only has one outcome ... and it does .
It always favors the person placing the wager .
That 's because you know something the other folks do n't — you know the " challenge " is always going to go your way .
Always .
A show in Britain called " The Real Hustle " does these bets often as a way to show you how much fun they can be , and also how to avoid getting caught out by them .

His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Sealand said in an interview with ' CBC The Hour ' that buying Sealand is probably a good way to circumvent international copyright law , but that he wo n't sell sealand to the Pirate Bay .
Prince Michael , also known as Michael Bates , said the following about the activities of the popular BitTorrent tracker .
“ It ’s theft of proprietary rights , it does n’t suit us at all .
In fact , I ’ve written a book and Hollywood is making a movie out of it , so it would go right against the grain to go into the filesharing thing . ”
Sealand is currently prized at 750 million euros , which equals nearly one billion US dollars , a sum of money that would be impossible for The Pirate Bay to raise anyway .
Prince Michael said that maybe some wealthy Russian , who does n’t want to have a radioactive isotope dropped in his cornflakes when he ’s not looking , might be a potential buyer instead .
Sealand ’s Spanish estate agent , the one who came up with the price , also said that The Pirate Bay may not be allowed to buy the micronation , because Sealand has pledged not to allow a sale that would damage the interests of , or act against the UK .
But not to worry , The Pirate Bay still has its eye on some other islands and micronations .
The good thing is that these are a lot cheaper than Sealand , which is nothing more than a pile of rust and concrete anyway .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday June 22 2007
DePaul University is not one of the " top 10 " American private universities , as we stated in the article below .
It is one of the 10 largest .
This has been corrected .
One of the most rancorous disputes in American academia has ended with a prominent political scientist with controversial views on Israel and anti-semitism being denied tenure at one of the country 's largest universities .
Norman Finkelstein , author of The Holocaust Industry , now has less than a year remaining on his contract with the political sciences department of DePaul University in Chicago .
He lost his bid for a lifelong post after a four to three vote of the promotions and tenure board .
The decision came at the end of several months of wrangling , both within the Catholic university and within the wider academic and Jewish communities in the US .
Mr Finkelstein has argued in his books that claims of anti-semitism are used to dampen down criticism of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians and that the Holocaust is exploited by some Jewish institutions for their own gain .
His position as a Jewish intellectual critical of Israel and of some elites within the Jewish community has prompted passionate debate on both sides .
Intellectuals such as the prolific writer Noam Chomsky and the Oxford historian Avi Shlaim have spoken out in Mr Finkelstein 's favour , but others have decried him in equal measure as giving succour to anti-semitism .
His most bitter opponent is Alan Dershowitz , a Harvard law professor , who campaigned heavily to prevent tenure being granted .
Soon after Mr Finkelstein applied for it , Mr Dershowitz sent DePaul faculty members a dossier of what he categorised as the " most egregious academic sins , outright lies , misquotations , and distortions " of the political scientist .
The dispute has roots that go deeper still , with Mr Finkelstein devoting much of his most recent book , Beyond Chutzpah :
On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History to an attack on Mr Dershowitz 's own work , the Case for Israel .
Mr Dershowitz threatened to sue .
Mr Finkelstein , the son of Holocaust survivors , has responded to the decision to , in effect , sack him from his job at DePaul by condemning the vote as an act of political aggression .
" I met the standards of tenure DePaul required , but it was n't enough to overcome the political opposition to my speaking out on the Israel - Palestine conflict . "
He told the Chicago Sun -Times : " They can deny me tenure , deny me the right to teach .
But they will never stop me from saying what I believe . "
On his website , he has posted letters of support from students and alumni of DePaul .
Mr Finkelstein's own department of political science lobbied in favour of tenure , but he was opposed by the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
DePaul is the largest Catholic university in the US .
It employs more than 800 full - time faculty members .
The president of the university , the Rev Dennis Holtschneider , who made the final decision , put out a statement explaining why he endorsed the rejection of tenure - a decision that normally remains private under academic protocol .
He said : " Some will consider this decision in the context of academic freedom .
In fact , academic freedom is alive and well at DePaul . "
The president also made clear reference to the Finkelstein - Dershowitz fisticuffs , saying there had been considerable outside debate .
" This attention was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case . "
Mr Chomsky said before the announcement that the dispute was " outrageous .
[ Finkelstein ] is an outstanding scholar .
It 's amazing that he has n't had full professorship a long time ago . "
- Pirates used to fly a false national ensign until an unsuspecting ship was close , then unfurl the Jolly Roger and attack .

This is my fourth post of a public diary entry entitled " False Flag Watch " that I will run from time to time to do just that , watch for False Flag Operations , or signs and omens thereof , in America and beyond , because there is much concern right now that there are forces at work within the bowels of our own government , or just beyond in its shadow networks , that are , if not actually planning a staged terrorist attack on America , at least praying for one to happen .
These latter " prayers " have actually been duly publicized in the media recently and should be cause for great concern , if for no other reason than the old admonition , " Be careful what you pray for . "
We are also watching for False Flag Ops beyond America 's borders that are designed to strongly impact foreign and domestic policy .
Note as well that False Flag Operations have an ugly history as covert and deceitful tools of governments to achieve less than noble aims , so I am not hallucinating here .
False Flag
Ops go all the way back to Emperor Nero framing the Christians for the Great Fire of Rome and beyond , wherever and whenever a State or other political body practiced deceit to manipulate its citizens at the expense of some poor scapegoat .

LATEST ALERT :
After someone sent me the link to a TRUENEWS .
COM broadcast dated August 9 , 2007 , I have decided to put out a heightened False Flag Alert .
The broadcaster , Rick Wiles , interviewed another radio personality , Chuck Crismier , host of the Viewpoint Radio Program ( http://www.saveus.org/broadcast/broadcast.asp ) who had learned of a woman who had received strong warnings of an imminent , catastrophic attack on America .
So Crismier interviewed her , anonymously , and she relayed five specific warnings she had received or extrapolated between Wednesday , August 1 and Sunday , August 5 .
These began with a communication from a relative in the military overseas , who warned her that there is significant internet chatter that something " big " is up and imminent , meaning multiple attacks resulting in civil unrest .
She stated that they ( the military ) are prepared for a concise kind of event .
Secondly , she was informed by a friend in the DC area that a neighbor working in the CIA warned this friend that a catastrophic event is imminent .
This CIA official , she stated , went so far as to give the friend 's family a precise escape route heading west from Washington .
Thirdly , another phone call within this short timespan conveyed to her an alert from a worker or official in the Pentagon to a pastor in the Northern Virginia / Washington DC area warning him to tell his congregation that " something really big is about to happen " .
Fourthly , she learned that Quantico Marine Base in Northern Virginia ( she is in a military family ) , was in a very high state of security , although not in a total lockdown .
( Whether this is ongoing now I can not confirm at this time . )
Lastly , friends informed her that their son , who is in the military and about to be deployed , told them that the military was having deploying personnel fill out paperwork listing the names and addresses of relatives so that " when the bad things happened that they were expecting , military personnel would show up at the doors of their relatives and take them off to safe places . "
She noted this this would be extremely unusual , way beyond normal military protocol .
Does this indicate that the military is anticipating widespread social chaos and civil strife ?

and play or download the Thursday August 9 , 2007 broadcast entitled :
Chuck Crismier : DRUM BEATS
For the reader 's convenience I have inserted excerpts of the original Crismier broadcast at the bottom of this post that have been graciously transcribed for me .
I am cutting to the chase and only inserting those sections most pertinent to the woman 's warnings .
If you want a copy of the entire transcript , please contact me .
Note that the woman 's quotes are in blue , Crismier 's in black .
*****
Now this broadcast concerns me a lot , because it represents inadvertent whistleblowers from both the CIA and the military worried enough to warn their closest friends and relatives about a pending danger both to them in particular and America in general .
This is enough for me to announce a YELLOW ALERT , which is , in my own warning system , above orange , but below one other , the highest alert , red .
My intuition is telling me that this woman is genuine and not making this stuff up .
Decide for yourself by listening to her .
Now , if people in the government are warning their friends and loved ones , why are n't they also warning the public at large ?
So I am directing this following note to everyone out there who is knowledgeable that some kind of HORRIFIC attack is about to take place , whether you think al Qaeda , the US government or black ops outside of the government are behind it , or a combination of all three .
Many readers at OpEdNews already believe that 9/11 was orchestrated by a political cabal , and realize that 9/11 , the Sequel , will be employed to usher in a police state .
SO IF YOU ARE A PATRIOT OR JUST PLAIN HUMAN , IT IS TIME TO SHOW SOME KAHUNAS AND ALERT AMERICA ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW .
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING IS TO EXPOSE IT TO THE LIGHT OF DAY .
YOU ARE NOT ALONE .
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF US , IF NOT MILLIONS , WHO HAVE SUFFICIENTLY AWAKENED TO HELP YOU .
Contact me , contact other writers at OpEdNews you may prefer , contact Rob Kall , our fearless publisher , or contact another website or alternative media site .
Probably you do not want to contact the FBI .
They are likely compromised .
Use your intelligence , but do it quickly .
We may not have much time .

Partial Transcript of Chuck Crismier - Drum Beats
..... It is in that context , friends , that we bring before you late , breaking news ... late breaking news , throughout the United States , and throughout the World , that is making its way through a labyrinthine , series of conversations and events , that we bring to you , to , at least , let you know , the ' scuttlebut ' of what seems to be , in the works worldwide .
We have a special guest joining us , concerning this , as I indicated we will not be disclosing the name of this individual , for security reasons , and for protection reasons , of a variety of sorts ; but , I want to welcome our special guest to ViewPoint today , it 's good to have you .
Thank you .
And I need to have you speak up as loudly as possible , we want to make sure we do n't miss a single word of what you have to say , because , indeed , it is of great concern , and that 's really why you 're here , is n't it ?
Yes , it is .
Now , recently , you received information , a phone conversation , with someone else in the United States of America , indicating that they had been in communication with another party , related to the United States Military , that there were substantial preparations being made for some kind of a portending event .
Can you give some light on that ?
I received a phone call , from my sister in law , who 's son is serving in the Military , and he is in correspondence through the computer hooked up with the monitor and with the mike and he told them they had been briefed that the chatter had become very loud and that they were expecting an attack anytime in the United States , multiple attacks , in the United States ; and that , um , he was , that my brother and sister in law were to arm themselves .
My nephew 's wife and two small children are living , nearby my brother and sister in law , and he told them to arm and get ready .
To get ready for what ?
To get ready for the civil unrest that was going to follow the attacks that were going taking place in the United States .
So , there was anticipation , not that an attack ' might ' take place , but it almost sounds like , there was knowledge , that it ' would ' take place .
They are expecting it .
It 's almost as if they have knowledge as to when it 's going to take place .
They know , as the General said , that it could happen anytime , anyday .
Why would we not be informed , as the American people , of such a portending attack ?
I 've thought about this , um , I 've thought , that , perhaps , they do n't want to scare people .
When I started realizing that , in the newspapers , I was seeing , small little articles coming through , that said , al Qaeda sells have grown up , that an attack is inevitable in the United States , different little snippets , that had come across , but nothing that , um , portended the disaster and destruction that seems to come , um , through this phone call .
But this information was coming via someone who was being trained in the United States Military , so it was not coming from these shores ?
No .
What did you feel like when you heard that report ?
Well , I felt a multiple , a number of emotions , first of all , um , my family , many of my members of my family , live and work in the Washington D.C. area , and um , my first thought was , I need to warn them .
I need to warn them , that they can come to live with me , they that need to get out at the very first sign , that they need to have bags packed , gas in the car , um , at the very first notice that anything 's happened , they need to get on the road and to come to our house .
So , not only is their an intense worldwide chatter , that 's developing , that we are hearing reports of , but now , this is coming , as a virtual certainty , coming from the United States Military , that they are prepared for a , precise kind of event .
Yes .
Astounding !
Uhuh .
Now , with that having been said , that was your first exposure ?
Correct .
What happened then ?
I , um , actually , was on my way to visit my grandchildren , and , um , my son and daughter in law , and I told them in the morning , and , of course , they were shocked , and when you are trying to protect your family , it knocks you off your heels a little .
But then my daughter in law said , can I share this , and I feel very strongly , um , that Scripture indicates , that if you know that death is coming towards someone , you have it , it 's incumbent upon you to share that , or , their blood will be on your hands .
Very , very important , so , we can't just clam up as Christians ...
No ... we have a responsibility , not just to , cavalierly , throw out warnings , but after evaluating , carefully assessing , verifying , as much as we can , if there 's something that is seriously jeopardizing , not only our fellow believers , but also other citizens , the second great commandment , virtually requires , that we , if we love our neighbour as ourself , we 're going to warn them , are n't we ?
So what happened ?
My daughter in law asked me if she could share this , and I told her I felt she had to .
So , the first person she called , um , lives a few blocks away from her , in her neighborhood , and she said , oh well , that 's very interesting , cause , two nites ago , my neighbour who's in the CIA came over told us the very same thing , that something bad was going to happen , and that we needed to prepare to , um , leave as soon as something happened , and he gave them escape routes and a place to go to in the mountains .
So , this is a member of the CIA , Central Intelligence Agency , in the Washington , D.C. area , that tells your daughter in law , that , there 's something serious about to happen and they need to be prepared and gives them the specific escape route .
Correct .
Now , this is n't some just , generic thing , maybe something will happen , maybe it wo n't , is it ?
No , no , he told them to go West , and , um , told them how to get there ?
So , there are plans ?
Yes .
For those , who are privy to those plans ?
I guess so , uhuh .
Mmm , that 's kind a scary , is n't it ?
It 's very frightening .
Because , not everyone is being informed of this .
No .
And you were told , initially , by a member of the United States Military , out of this country , that you needed to arm yourselves .
Yes .
Now , why , would Christians need to arm themselves ... what can we possibly do , uh , against bombs and chemical warfare and things like that ; is that the reason why we 're to arm ourselves ?
What were the reasons , if any , given ?
He did n't give any reasons , I prayed about it , and , um , the city that , his , um , father lives in , is , um , is a very poor city , primarily , um , the largest part of the population is at the poverty level , and my brother is , um , is rather wealthy , and , um , I think he was rather frightened for civil unrest and that is why he was saying , arm yourself , he wants his children protected and he wants his father protected .
So , when you see major things happening ... such as happened down in New Orleans ...
Yes ...
... civil unrest breaks out , people begin looting , much like what happened in the Rodney King experience down in Los Angeles , the Watts riots , and so on , and tremendous damage can be done , and , uh , people go where the money is , they go where the property is , they go where they can get the most , the quickest , do n't they ?
Correct .
And , as Christians , though , we have difficulties , bearing arms , sometimes , and standing up for things like this , does that trouble you at all ?
I deal in , what I do in my life , I deal with a lot of people who have been hurt , by very evil people , and I feel that , um , there is a need to protect the innocent , that if there if the evil is coming towards you , you have as much of a need to protect them with an arms , as you do with a warning , uh , as being a watchmen on the wall .
So , this is precisely why we have a second amendment to the United States Constitution ?
I believe so .
Our founders understood this , and were very concerned and they thought that this was so important they included it in the Bill of Rights , did n't they ?
Correct .
I 've always , personally , been troubled with bearing arms , and I 've chosen to trust the Lord and I really have n't been much of a hunter , or anything like that ; so , for me , while I believe in the validity and reason for the Second Ammendment , it is troubling to me , I must admit ...
No ...
... because it puts us in a tension between trusting God , and loving our enemies , and so on , alright , but that 's not the end of the story , is it ?
No , I , uh ...
If that were the end of the story , we , probably , would n't be doing this program .
I placed a phone call to a friend of mine , that I 've known for about 25 years , who also lives in the Washington , D.C. area , her sister and brother in law pastor a church in that area and last week she received a phone call from her sister , who said they had gotten a very disturbing email , from someone they knew who worked in the Pentagon , and his message to them was , something very big was going to happen , and you need to , prayerfully consider , warning your congregation to get prepared .
Someone in the Pentagon , right there in Washington , D.C. , the very center , the heart of American Military Intelligence , warned a Pastor , in Northern Virginia , to warn his congregation , that something is immediate impending ...
Correct .
... and it 's big ...
Yes .
... How could he know that !?!
He has to be in on the know , I 'm sure that the briefings that my nephew underwent , overseas , that they 're being briefed , also , in the United States .
*** Crismier digresses at this point into some lengthy evangelical sermonizing , which I 'm going to skip ***
........ We have a special guest joining us today ... we have kept her identity quiet , because it 's just not necessary to identify the various individuals that are involved , I do n't know who they all are , anyway ; I do n't know who any of them are , but , we do know that there is a pattern , a pathway , that has been traced now , from around the world , of information , that is , each item , is confirming another , that indeed , there is a very serious likelihood of something dramatic , not pleasant , happening in this country , the good old U.S. of A .
Let 's get back to our guest , you 've relayed a couple of instances now , one coming from outside the country , initially , and the report coming to you , then , being confirmed in a different way , inside the country , as you were communicating with a friend , up in the Washington , D.C. area , then , a warning , that person indicated to you , that a CIA agent , who was a friend , had come to them , as a Pastor in Northern Virginia ...
No , no ... the correction is , the second , um , um , confirmation , was that a friend of my daughter in law lived next to a CIA agent
Ahah ...okay ... alright ...
... the third confirmation was that someone in the Pentagon , contacted the Pastor and his wife about that .
Alright ... alright ... so , we are having a series ...
Correct .
... of these verifications , alluding to the very same kind of events ...
Yes .
Alright , what else have you heard ?
Um , on my way back from the visit in Northern Virginia , I found out that Quantico Marine Base , was in , um , a very tight , secure , um , I do n't know if it would really be a total lockdown , but they were getting much , much stronger in their , um , security .
Alright , now , Quantico , for those who are listening around the world , and we do have people listening all over the world , in the middle of the Middle East , in the Mediterranean , in Russia , I mean , people are listening all over the world to this program , Quantico is a major Marine training base in Northern Virginia , just south of Washington , D.C. , correct ?...
Correct .
along the Potomac ...
Yes .
Alright ...
Um , that , that came to me , and then , um , I was meeting with some friends , and I shared this information , and one woman said , well , we do n't have to worry , because our son who 's in the Military also , was getting ready to be deployed , and he told his parents , that , when , before he was deployed , they all had to fill out paperwork , to give the names and addresses of their relatives , so , that when the bad things happened that they were expecting , um , Military personnel would show up at the door of the relative and take them off to safe places .
This is a very , very puzzling piece of information , since when , does the United States Military , go out , identify family and friends of those in the Military , and go out and usher them off , independent of all the rest of the citizens of the United States , usher them off to safe places .
Something does n't add up here , does it ?
No ...I , I was raised in the Military , I married a Military man who served for 23 years in the Military and , um , that is not standard operating procedure in the Military today .
What would you , what do you understand , standard operating procedure , to be , in circumstances like this ?
Being raised in a Marine Corps .
family , if you were n't issued a family , you were not , it was n't valid .
I know that sounds silly , but it 's like , um , the families always , in my experience , came second , it had to be , and it had to be , that their first goal , was to defend the country , thus , to achieve their missions , so , families , um , always knew , that they were not going to be taken care of .
So , I was very surprised by that , uh , statement and I did n't say anything to her , because , I thought , you know , I do n't need to rock her boat , but , that is not my experience at all , having been many , many , many years , involved in the Military .
Alright , so , we have a whole series , threaded together of these experiences , it 's actually amazing , that you should have received all of this information , all , within a very short period of time .
What was the distance of time , from the period of time , from the moment you heard the first piece of information , to this final piece of information ?
I heard the first piece of information , Wednesday around noon , and the last one , Sunday around 3 o'clock in the afternoon .
Alright , so , all this information is within the last week ?
Correct .
And it 's just been accumulating .
Correct .
What 's your take on it ?
My take , is that things are going to get very , very difficult in the United States of America , and I feel that , people need to , of course , look out for their physical safety , but , in the week that I have had to ponder this , I really feel this is a spiritual warning , that , people really need to be thinking , am I ready , to go , if God calls me now ?
I believe , that those who , uh , it does say in Isaiah 57:1 , that there are good people who are taken away , so they will not have to experience , what 's going to come on .
So , it 's very possible , that we might be praying that our families ' are spared , and God , may , in His Mercy , be taking them .
I do believe , that those who are left , those of us who are Christians , who are left , this may , indeed , be the time that we were created for , this may be where our perfs ?
flies in life , to bring people into the kingdom , to , um , help as many as we can .
Maybe , preparing the way of the Lord for ...
Absolutely .
... I mean , John the Baptist 's ministry was only 6 months ...
Exactly .
... only 6 months and Jesus said , that there had never been a Prophet arise greater , than John the Baptist , 6 months ministry ; who knows , friend , but that you are come to the Kingdom for such a time as this .
When we get back , we will talk more about the implications for you , for our families , and how we should respond .
( Commercial break )
Of all the potential hazards that a journalist can expect to confront when embarking on an interview with one of the world 's bestselling novelists , being sexually molested by a turkey is not one of them .
But here we are , standing in the middle of a field talking about literature , the environment and the future of America , and all the while Tom , a pumped - up male who must weigh well over 20 lbs , is orbiting me in progressively smaller circles .
His tail feathers are fanned out , he is making an alarming noise similar to a police siren and is shaking his blood - red proboscis at me - all classic signals , so I 'm told , that he 's hitting on me .
This particular beast belongs to Barbara Kingsolver , a writer famous for her love of nature and of all things rural , whose connection to the land is one of the qualities that so endears her to her millions of readers .
We are at her farm in deepest Virginia , coddled within a U - shaped mountain ridge in the Southern Appalachians .
There 's a stream - or hollow as they call it in these parts , pronounced " holler " - running down the middle of the smallholding .
The view is of rolling woodland and lush pasture , and in all directions chickens , sheep and a donkey are milling about .
I 'd like to report that it was a place of profound tranquillity , but with all the braying , cock crowing and turkey sirens blasting it was more like Times Square on a Saturday night .
Kingsolver , 52 , has acquired an enviably long list of bestselling books , mainly novels but with a sprinkling of poetry and essay collections .
She is best known for The Bean Trees , Pigs in Heaven and , above all , The Poisonwood Bible , a towering novel set in the Congo that has gained her a massive global following .
It has sold more than two million copies , bears the imprimatur of Oprah Winfrey , and was recently voted by members of British book clubs as their favourite novel of all time .
I have travelled down to the Kingsolver farm on the eve of publication of her latest volume , Animal , Vegetable , Miracle .
The book marks something of a departure for her as a writer , as it is her first work of narrative non-fiction .
To get a sense of what the book is about , think of Super Size Me , Morgan Spurlock 's film in which he spent a month doing nothing but consuming McDonald 's fast food .
Now imagine its opposite , and you are getting close to Animal , Vegetable , Miracle .
Like Spurlock , Kingsolver and her family set themselves a time - limited task - a year in their case - but instead of plumbing the depths of America 's fast - food culture , their ambition was to shun it completely .
While Spurlock set out to record the damage that would be inflicted on his own body by eating the equivalent of nine Big Macs a day , Kingsolver wanted to explore the positive impacts - physical , spiritual and environmental - of a diet that was wholesome , seasonal and local .
Part of the motivation of the book was repulsion at America 's advanced state of what Kingsolver calls " alimentary alienation " , where food is mass - produced and has little or no bearing on the lives of those who eat it .
With the help of her husband Steven Hopp , an environmental studies lecturer , she lays out in the book the shocking scale of the crisis .
The average food item on the American shelf has travelled 1,500 miles - further than most families go on annual holidays .
The US consumes about 400 gallons of oil a year per person for agriculture , a rate of guzzling second only to the car .
And here 's a fact straight out of Alice in Wonderland : the US exports 1.1 m tonnes of potatoes , and imports 1.4 m tonnes .
The side - effects of America 's fast - food culture are legion : global warming caused by high food airmiles ; obesity due to the poor diet , particularly among American children , who are predicted to be the country 's first generation with a shorter life expectancy than their parents ; the destruction of farming habitats to clear the way for mass cropping of corn and soya beans ; the detachment of millions of Americans who have absolutely no inkling of what they are consuming or where it comes from .
As Kingsolver sums it up : " Woe is us , we overfed , undernourished US citizens .
We are a nation with an eating disorder , and we know it . "
But there is also a positive narrative to the book , a desire to scratch her itch for earthiness that is rooted , she says , in her childhood in rural Kentucky .
She has hung on to that link with the soil of her formative years ever since , through college in Indiana , where she studied biology , and almost three decades living in Tucson , Arizona , a city of a million people plonked in a desert .
" I 've never really lost contact with the land , " she says , her words interrupted periodically by bursts of Tom 's lustful siren .
" The real places for me were always outside the concrete .
I 've never been able to go for a day without thinking that I 'm an animal , and an animal is dead without its habitat and food chain . "
So in 2005 Kingsolver and crew - her husband and two daughters Camille , 19 , and Lily , 10 - upped sticks from Tucson and moved to Virginia , where Steven already owned a small farm of about 100 acres , most of it woodland and steep hills .
They drew up a plan for a year living as " locavores " - eating food that they had either grown themselves or had bought from the surrounding area .
" We were n't rule bound , we did n't draw a line in the map , " she says , keen to avoid any impression of preaching or fanaticism .
" We wanted to do something that almost everyone could relate to at some level - to take the approach of a normalish American family and see what they could do .
Not to be heroic or explore a human extreme , but to show that this was doable . "
They were on a trip to find a " real " American culture of food , and the book is the chronicle of that journey .
Some of it is about the deprivation they endured - the foregoing of bananas and pineapples , for instance , which are banned on the grounds that exotic fruits are the Humvees of the food world .
But most of the book is devoted to the joys of what they experienced , as the year unfolded .
March , when the " project " , as Kingsolver calls it , began , was the month of asparagus , eaten the very day it was cut .
April was for baby lettuces and greens ; June for cherries , the first sweet taste of fruit after months of abstinence from exotics .
With July came an outpouring of new potatoes , cucumbers and aubergines ; and August saw them drowning in tomatoes of many different varieties , her favourite being the Dolly Partons .
On Thanksgiving , the dining table was piled high with food that was grown or reared on the farm - including one of Tom 's progeny roasted for the occasion - with the exception of cranberries , which they allowed themselves to purchase from further north .
Even in the depths of January they got by , with kale and chard , frozen pesto and cans of tomatoes prepared before winter set in .
There was no slump into winter madness , like Jack Nicholson in the Shining .
If anything , Kingsolver says she felt rather guilty that it all went so smoothly .
" One of the challenges constructing the book was that it was almost too easy .
Where is the suspense ? "
Yet reading the book , you could not accuse the locavore of leading a bland or dull life .
Even on the morning we come to the farm , Kingsolver has been up since 4 am , woken by the harrowing sounds of a racoon breaking into the chicken coop and killing two birds .
Later , we stumble on the bones of a turkey - the dug - up remains , it transpires , of Mother Number One , their first breeding turkey and Tom 's original mate , who came to a sticky end last week in the jaws of a coyote .
If abundance was the over - arching theme of their year , death was never far away either .
They were careful not to give their animals names , so that when the day came to " harvest " them they could do so without squirming .
( A few cherished animals slipped through that injunction : notably Sally the donkey and Opal the Icelandic sheep . )
Kingsolver describes in the book with almost clinical detachment the process of cutting off a rooster 's head , and the way the wings flap afterwards with the body spewing blood .
It is hard to imagine this globally renowned novelist splattered with chicken blood , particularly on the day we meet when she reveals no trace of the farmyard in her personal appearance .
She is dressed in a sky - blue shirt with matching earrings , and I notice that her fingernails are perfectly trimmed and clean .
That puzzled and impressed me in equal measure : how someone so evidently seeped in the grit and dirt of her surroundings could be so spotlessly turned out when she chose to .
But over a few hours spent in her company , the quality that stood out most was precisely this ability to straddle different worlds with apparent ease .
Barbara Kingsolver - bestselling writer , eco-campaigner , farmer , mother .
The year of the " project " was in part for her an exploration , and a celebration , of all those facets of her life .
In the book there is a passage that some women readers will relate to , others may find hard to swallow , in which she says that she has finally , after many years , come to accept as a compliment the idea of being a " housewife " .
She argues that women of her generation made a " devil of a bargain " when they traded homemaking for careers .
" We lost a lot - we traded our aprons for the minivan and the Lunchable , and the result was children with health problems because we pick up junk food on the way to the soccer game .
That 's the great hoodwink of my generation . "
Over the span of the year of the project she found she gained some of that homely comfort back , without jeopardising her job as a writer .
She is unabashed about her desire for domesticity , insisting her ability to talk about it now is a sign of how far women have come , a mark of confidence " that my cooking will not overshadow my other work " .
Kingsolver 's literary work is infused with the themes developed in Animal , Vegetable , Miracle .
Most obviously , her latest novel , Prodigal Summer , is set in the Southern Appalachians and describes in fictional form the very same landscape and love of nature .
But there are also clues to her interest in nature in Poisonwood Bible , though they are harder to find .
The novel , first published in 1999 , is a magnificent portrayal of a dysfunctional American family .
It is told through the voices of the wife and four daughters of a crazed evangelical Baptist who has taken them to the Congo on a mission to save African souls .
At face value the harsh jungle setting of the novel , where even the trees are toxic - the poisonwoods of the title - is as far from the rich and gentle Appalachians as you could imagine , as is Nathan Price and his warring family from Kingsolver 's own brood .
During the course of their locavore year , the Kingsolver family if anything grew closer and more harmonious , in contrast with the discordance displayed by her characters .
" People in my novels always have terrible problems .
If they are not terrible , I make them more terrible , " she says .
Yet several of the themes pursued by Kingsolver in her non-fiction are present in nascent form in Poisonwood Bible .
The mad Baptist struggles in vain to grow crops in the Congo because he stubbornly refuses to listen to the local experts .
His daughter Leah has difficulty making sense of her home country to her African friend : " How could I explain to Anatole about soybean fields where men sat in huge tractors like kings on thrones , taming the soil from one horizon to the other ? "
Leah 's twin sister , Adah , describes the sensation on returning to the US of walking down a supermarket aisle stuffed with produce that nobody really needs .
And there 's an underlying link between the two books that goes to the core of Kingsolver 's power as a writer .
Beneath their deceptively humanist surfaces , both Poisonwood Bible and Animal , Vegetable , Miracle are intensely political books .
You can read Poisonwood Bible as a simple tale of tragedy in the rotten heart of one family ; but equally it is an allegory for the damage wrought by US foreign policy , which sought to uphold the interests of big corporations by frustrating Congo 's early bid for independence - a morality tale that seems to become more relevant with every passing day .
It 's the same with her new book .
You can read it as a straightforward chronicle of a year spent eating locally garnered food ; but equally it is a caustic portrait of the wounds inflicted on America 's own landscape by the government - backed corporate drive for profits .
When I put this to her , she pauses , with the inward look of someone who likes to choose her words carefully , and then she says : " What was done in my name in the Congo was a presumption that what works in one culture should be forced upon another , the agenda of course being to go in and get the goods .
Farming has become an extractive industry , like mining .
It used to be about the American dream , with families working hard to enrich themselves and their communities ; now it 's about large powerful corporations pulling out the good stuff and leaving behind a mess .
So yes , there is a similarity . "
The locavore year technically came to an end several months ago , though the family has largely stuck with the regime .
They eat out a little more frequently than they did , and occasionally buy wild Atlantic salmon , though they regard such treats as splurges rather than entitlements .
Kingsolver is working on a new novel , which she describes as " a fictional secret history revealed in a surprising way " .
Before we part , I ask her what change the year has had on her .
" Physically , not much .
But I really have connected with this place .
To eat of this place helped me to become of it , to belong . "
And as we drive away down the farm 's dust track , Tom 's love call fading into the distance , I admit to myself that I got it wrong .
There is a profound tranquillity here after all .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s strategic bombers have resumed Cold War - style long - haul missions to areas patrolled by NATO and the United States , top generals said on Thursday .

Russia 's strategic bombers have resumed their Cold War practice of flying long - haul missions to areas patrolled by NATO and the United States , top generals said on Thursday .
REUTERS / U.S. Air Force / Handout
A Russian bomber flew over a U.S. naval base on the Pacific island of Guam on Wednesday and “ exchanged smiles ” with U.S. pilots who had scrambled to track it , said Major - General Pavel Androsov , head of long - range aviation in the Russian air force .
“ It has always been the tradition of our long - range aviation to fly far into the ocean , to meet ( U.S. ) aircraft carriers and greet ( U.S. pilots ) visually , ” Androsov told a news conference .
“ Yesterday we revived this tradition , and two of our young crews paid a visit to the area of the ( U.S. Pacific Naval Activities ) base of Guam , ” he said .
President Vladimir Putin has sought to make Russia more assertive in the world .
Putin has boosted defense spending and sought to raise morale in the armed forces , which were starved of funding following the fall of the Soviet Union .
Androsov said the sortie by the two turboprop Tu-95MS bombers , from a base near Blagoveshchensk in the Far East , had lasted for 13 hours .
The Tu -95 , codenamed “ Bear ” by NATO , is Russia ’s Cold War icon and may stay in service until 2040 .
“ I think the result was good .
We met our colleagues -- fighter jet pilots from ( U.S. ) aircraft carriers .
We exchanged smiles and returned home , ” Androsov said .
Ivan Safranchuk , Moscow office director of the Washington - based World Security Institute , said he saw nothing extraordinary in Moscow sending its bombers around the globe .
“ This practice as such never stopped , it was only scaled down because there was less cash available for that , ” he said .
“ It does n’t cost much to flex your muscles ...
You can burn fuel flying over your own land or you can do it flying somewhere like Guam , in which case political dividends will be higher . ”
COLD WAR CAT - AND -MOUSE
The bombers give Russia the capability of launching a devastating nuclear strike even if the nuclear arsenals on its own territory are wiped out .
During the Cold War , they played elaborate airborne games of cat - and - mouse with Western air forces .
Lieutenant - General Igor Khvorov , air forces chief of staff , said the West would have to come to terms with Russia asserting its geopolitical presence .
“ But I do n’t see anything unusual , this is business as usual , ” he said .
The generals said under Putin long - range aviation was no longer in need of fuel , enjoyed better maintenance and much higher wages , a far cry from the 1990s when many pilots were practically grounded because there was no money to buy fuel .
The generals quipped that part of the funding boost was thanks to a five - hour sortie Putin once flew as part of a crew on a supersonic Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber , known as the “ White Swan ” in Russia and codenamed “ Blackjack ” by NATO .
The current state of Russia ’s economy , which is booming for the eighth year in a row , has allowed Russia to finance such flights , said Safranchuk from the World Security Institute .
“ Maintenance and training are not the most expensive budget items of modern armies .
Purchases of new weapons really are . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup C.N Chief Executive Charles O. Prince III plans to eliminate or reassign more than 26,000 jobs , or 8 percent of its work force , when he announces a major overhaul of the financial institution on Wednesday , according to a report in The New York Times .
Citigroup ’s consumer and investment banking businesses are expected to face the most severe cuts , the Times said .
But across the company , legal and compliance departments are being heavily scrutinized , people who have been briefed on the plans said in the Times .
In a memo to employees on Monday , Prince said the bank plans to consolidate some back - office , middle - office and corporate functions , move some work to lower - cost areas , and make its technology platforms more efficient .
Reuters obtained a copy of the memo , and a Citigroup spokesman confirmed its contents .
Other published reports have said that Citigroup might eliminate 15,000 jobs , or about 5 percent of its work force of 327,000 .
CNBC on Monday said Citigroup might cut 45,000 jobs .
The cuts will follow a nearly four - month review by Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin of expenses at the largest U.S. bank .

Now , I am not one my first lap in the pool of life , so of course , I immediately implemented Emergency Response Plan Shitstorm : 1 .
Immediately make any plausible excuse to step away from the client .
2 .
Ask the lovely new coworker you 're secretly crushing on to take over with the client ( double benefit - she is glad to have the opportunity , and she will be nowhere near the desk the newest person has been given right next to the bathroom ) .
3 . Now feeling the second wave of cramps ; sweat and beginning to taste a little metallic in the increasing saliva that is rising in your mouth , you begin race - walking to the can .
Race - walking has two benefits : it is a bit quicker than walking , and it allows you to clamp firmly on your sphincter while you rush to the relief station .
4 .
Say a quick prayer to the porcelain gods that all stalls will be unoccupied .
5 .
As you reach the door to the bathroom , begin unclasping belt and buttons .
6 . Scan for open stalls while completing step 5.7 .
Dash to a stall while lowering trousers to half mast .
Shout warning to anyone else present - " Save yourself !
Get out NOW !
" 8 .
As you pivot and begin lowering your butt to the toilet seat , flick the stall door shut and the lock with it .
Combining these three moves saves time !
Precious time ... 9 .
Sit , relax the sphincter and ride out the storm .
Properly implemented , this plan should save you just enough time to get your ass in place , with a good seal to prevent blow back just as the gallant sphincter gives it up .
Unfortunately , because I stood that extra second or two after my instincts told me I had hideous diarrhea on the way - I was arguing with myself that maybe it was just gas - I did n't quite get a good seal before Vesuvius Crapitanus erupted .
The one other person in the room was heard to exclaim , " Holy Shit ! " and " Oh my God , man ! "
This last was heard from the hallway just before the door slammed shut .
Once the eruptions slowed , then stopped , I began secondary response procedures - look to see if there is toilet paper ... YES !
Did it spray forward onto my pants ... NO !
Did it ... oh fuck !
A two foot high , glistening wall of brownish green slime covers the back of the seat , tank , wall and my white shirt .
That two seconds of denial had kept me from getting a good seal .
I 'd have to improvise a new secondary response procedure to clean up .
Remove shirt and wipe seat and wall .
Clean self as best possible with toilet paper .
Soap and water at the sink .
Having cleaned as best I could , I knew I only had minutes to get to my apartment before the nausea hit .
Calmly as possible , I exited the bathroom , hoping to sneak shirtless down the back stairs .
As I left the bathroom , another guy walked in .
A second later , he came back out , gagging " Call 911 , someone died in there ! "
I was on the stairs , then out the door , then in my car .
I made it home , spent the next 36 hours with my porcelain savior , and hoped that the new woman had made a sale .
Or at least had n't heard about the bathroom disaster and the wild - eyed , shirtless coworker seen running from the scene !
I 'll know tomorrow .
I did everything right , followed the playbook perfectly , but that one hesitation - the one that made me too slow - kept me from getting a good seal .
And that little hesitation may just keep me from enchanting my crush , or it may even mean I need to get a new job , depending on the nicknames they 've come up with for me .
Still , I give myself a 9.6 because I did everything flawlessly except for sticking the landing .
The other judge , who is from Romania and is a janitor when he's not judging , might give me a lower score .
Damn .( Aside to Romanian judge : Dude , I did the best I could with just a shirt .
I 'd have done better with a disinfectant cleaner and a mop .
There 'll be a bottle of pear brandy in your cart on Monday . )
Moral : " Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out . "
Trust your instincts .
Oh , and get a good seal .

The small H. erectus skull had to be removed from sandstone
The broken upper jaw - bone and intact skull from humanlike creatures , or hominids , are described in Nature .
Previously , the hominid Homo habilis was thought to have evolved into the more advanced Homo erectus , which evolved into us .
Now , habilis and erectus are thought to be sister species that overlapped in time .
The new fossil evidence reveals an overlap of about 500,000 years during which Homo habilis and Homo erectus must have co-existed in the Turkana basin area , the region of East Africa where the fossils were unearthed .
" Their co-existence makes it unlikely that Homo erectus evolved from Homo habilis , " said co-author Professor Meave Leakey , palaeontologist and co-director of the Koobi Fora Research Project .
The jaw bone was attributed to Homo habilis because of its distinctive primitive dental characteristics , and was dated to around 1.44 million years ago .
It is the youngest specimen of this species ever found .
The skull , discovered by Frederick Manthi of the National Museums of Kenya , was assigned to the species Homo erectus despite being a similar size to that of a habilis skull .
Most other erectus skulls found have been considerably larger .
But it displayed typical features of erectus such as a gentle ridge called a " keel " running over the top of the jaw joint .
Analysis showed the skull to be about 1.55 million years old .
The new dates indicate that the two species must have lived side by side .
Sister species
If Homo erectus had evolved from habilis and stayed within the same location then both must have been in direct competition for the same resources .
Eventually , one would have out - competed the other .
There may have been a large size difference between the sexes
Professor Chris Stringer , head of human origins at London 's Natural History Museum , said : " Both were apparently stone tool - makers , but one possibility is that the larger and perhaps more mobile erectus species was an active hunter , while habilis scavenged or caught small prey . "
It is most likely that both species evolved from a common ancestor .
Other possibilities
But the linear , ancestor - descendent relationship between the two species cannot be ruled out altogether .
Fred Spoor , professor of developmental biology at University College London , and co-author of the paper , told the BBC News website : " It 's always possible that Homo habilis lived , let 's say , 2.5 million years ago and then in another part of Africa , away from the Turkana basin , an isolated population evolved into Homo erectus . "
After a sufficient amount of time to allow both species to develop different adaptations and lifestyles , Homo erectus could have then found its way to the Turkana basin .
With separate " ecological niches " , both species could co-exist without direct competition for resources .
" But that is a much more complex proposition , " Professor Spoor explained , " the easiest way to interpret these fossils is that there was an ancestral species that gave rise to both of them somewhere between two and three million years ago . "
Not so similar
The fossil record indicates that modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) evolved from Homo erectus .
However , to some researchers , the small size of the erectus skull suggests that species may not have been as similar to us as we once thought .
On average , modern humans display a low level of " sexual dimorphism " , meaning that males and females do not differ physically as much as they do in other animals .
The scientists compared the small skull to a much larger erectus cranium found previously in Tanzania .
If the size difference between the two is indicative of the larger one being from a male and the smaller being from a female , it suggests that erectus displayed a high level of sexual dimorphism - similar to that of modern gorillas .
Sexual dimorphism can relate to reproductive strategies and sexual selection .
If erectus was very sexually dimorphic it may have had multiple mates at a time .
This differs from the more monogamous nature of modern humans , indicating that Homo erectus was not as human - like as once thought .
The researchers dismiss the idea that the small size of the skull could be a result of it belonging to a youngster .
" By studying how the skull bones are fused together we discovered it belonged to a fully grown young adult rather than a developing juvenile erectus , " said Professor Spoor .
Jaime Bayly , a good soul at heart , " but rather in the background . "
This can not be removed .
I enjoy very much to see his live show , I was much laughter , as he said the former president Alejandro Toledo , saying that his government was a banter , and named " Alejandro Toledo banter . "
This was a clear demonstration that to criticize someone , you should not be tail of straw .
The former president told Jaime , who was a joker .
What if I disagree with Scott , is to say that women can decide whether to abort or not , because it is her body and she decides on her body .
Kyle Dropp dartmouth insists that this is the case .
Being a woman carrying in her womb , not yours .
Children are not property of the parents .
This concept is very broad to be developed .
Nor do I agree when he says that the human being reaches its " coming of age " ( this is entirely relative ) , you can do as he pleases , because it is free .
Then I make the following question :
Why are there two terms ? ,
One is " freedom " and the other is : " debauchery . "
I Jaime ask , explain to me these two terms .
Of course I understand them perfectly , but when asked to explain to me , I want him to realize the difference .
Does your government would be a government " Libertine " ?
At the end of its agenda this week , was like a cute teen .
He was thus saying that in fact he did not know whether or not going to run for president .
As the teens who do not know what they really want .
His girl , who presented the program to me in particular , gave me the impression of a young girl who wants fame in exchange for sexual favors .
I say this because when Tim asked who wanted to have a child with her , and formalize their relationship , she replied saying that he wanted to present his book first , and then we would see .
According to James for what he said about the book about this girl , it seems that is pornographic literature .
What if I like it clear , is that James lied to us repeatedly about his sexual impotence , because she herself denied .
And he has also been inconsistent , because it stated that his relationship with this girl was two years ago .
James spent the entire previous year , talking about his alleged sexual impotence .
You can not take seriously someone who does not know what it really wants .
You can not take seriously , someone who agrees with debauchery .
You can not take seriously , someone who believes that everyone can do what they want for their majority .
You can not take seriously anyone who thinks that homosexuality , heterosexuality , and bisexuality are the same .
He himself said at some point in its program , which was considered a political satirist .
And I think this is healthy .
I enjoy your program very much to see , but from there , I vote for him as president , is something completely different .
Consider the general case of Donayre .
What happened , to try to see their mission with a little humor ? ,
Was frowned upon and ended in the retreat .
Jaime himself criticized in his program .
And Jaime will you do same ?
It now appears that the comedian and " copycat " ( because he does not imitate anyone ) Carlos Alvares , also wants to be president .
Everyone wants to be president .
So I want to be president , and why not ? .
インターネットは、学生の就職活動を便利にした。しかし同時に、学生が陥る可能性のある不気味な「落とし穴」も、同時に作り出したのかもしれない。
米国西海岸で大学院に通うタイラーさん（25）は、このところ就職活動である噂が気になっている。「――企業の人事担当者は最近、Googleで学生の情報を検索しているという。これは本当だろうか？」
実は、タイラーさんは学部生時代に政治関連の雑誌を創刊、編集した経歴がある。彼自身、それを隠したりはしていないが、政治のトピックはとかくデリケートな問題が絡むもの。人事担当者によっては、ネガティブな評価を下すかもしれない、というわけだ。
それでなくとも、アメリカの学生はしばしば「MySpace」などのSNSに複数の写真をアップロードする。その中に馬鹿騒ぎの様子を写した画像が含まれていたり、あるいはポルノ関連のトピックが含まれていた場合、仮にそれが人事担当者の目にとまれば、印象が悪くなるおそれもある。
「 これは非常に重要な問題だ。企業がGoogleでアクセスできる情報をコントロールできるよう、我々は適切な対処をしなければならない」
昨年日本で就職活動をした男性（27）も、実名で利用していたブログやSNS（ソーシャルネットワーキングサービス）を匿名に変え、就職活動関連や女性関係など問題のありそうなエントリーは削除した。きっかけは、社会人の先輩に「君のブログは危険だから下げたほうがいい」と言われたためだ。
「 ブログのアクセス解析をしていたら、就活先の会社からのアクセスがあった、という友人もいました」。実名登録しているSNSからプライベートなブログへのリンクを削除するなど、就活をきっかけに、ネット上での活動を匿名化したり縮小した友人は多いと彼は言う。
人事はあなたをググっている？
東京のIT企業に勤めるある人事担当者（27）は、実際にネットを採用活動に使っていると話す。
一例として挙げたのが、就職活動に関連した情報を掲載するコミュニティーサイト「みんなの就職活動日記」（みん就）だ。学生同士が情報を共有するためのサイトだが、企業としてもどんなことが書かれているか目を光らせている。その中で、どの学生がどの書き込みをしたか、特定できる場合もあるようだ。
「 面接を受けに来た後、す ぐ “ みん就 ” に書き込む学生がいる。そういう子は『ああ、あの子だな』と分かる」
意図的に、学生の情報をピンポイントで調べることもあるのだろうか。この質問に対しても、前出の人事はそれに類したことはある、と明かす。

Fraunhofer IPK
WHEN the shredding machines failed , and the mob was at the gates , the spooks at East Germany 's State Security Service , better known as the Stasi , tried turning their files into mush by dunking them in water .
But the number of bathtubs in their headquarters in Normannenstrasse was as unequal to the task as the machines had been .
In the end , they resorted to tearing each page up by hand .
The fact that many of the resulting shreds are only a few millimetres across is testament to just how much the soon - to - be - ex - members of the intelligence service did not want their work to fall into the public domain .
If Bertram Nickolay of the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology , in Berlin , has his way , however , the public domain is where they soon will be .
Using the institute 's expertise in pattern - matching technology , he and his group are about to embark on one of the biggest jigsaw puzzles of all time — or , rather , 45 m of them .
For that is the number of pages which the 600 m fragments of paper , stored in more than 16,000 bags , that were recovered from Normannenstrasse are thought to represent .
At first glance , the task of joining that many shreds looks impossible , even when each shred has been scanned so that the matching can be done by machine .
The secret , as with any computing task , is to break the problem into manageable chunks .
The first stage of this breakdown was done , unwittingly , by the Stasi themselves .
Since they were in a hurry , the shredders tended to stuff all the bits of a given document into a single bag .
That simplifies the problem from nearly impossible to merely unwieldy .
The next stage is to group the shreds from a single bag according to various criteria .
These include the colour and texture of the paper a shred is made from , whether that paper is lined or not , the colour of the ink used , whether that ink represents a picture , a piece of typewritten text or a piece of handwriting , and — if it is handwriting — what style .
Only when a group of related shreds has been found using these criteria does the actual puzzling begin .
That is done the way human puzzlers do it , by paying attention to shapes and sizes of the pieces , and the contours of their edges .
If two shreds can be connected , they are regarded as one larger shred , and are thrown back into the heap of images to be analysed and compared with the others .
Thus , as with a real jigsaw , areas get progressively filled in until the whole picture is complete .
Like a human , the program that does the puzzling is capable of learning .
It spawns slightly altered versions of itself that compete for computer time on the basis of their success at finding matches .
The most successful are then mutated again , in a process similar to biological evolution .
This is necessary because unlike a real jigsaw — or a machine - shredded document — in which the pieces fit perfectly , the shreds of a torn document are slightly distorted and frayed at the edges .
Deciding what matches what therefore requires judgment , which is notoriously difficult to program in advance .
Indeed , if the program really cannot make up its mind whether two shreds match or not , it refers the matter to a human operator .
Dr Nickolay aims to process about 400 bags over the course of the next two years , as a final test of the technology .
If that works , it will just be a question of adding more scanners and computers to expose the truth about East Germany 's dark past .

Vice - president Dick Cheney 's burden on the Bush administration grew heavier yesterday after a former senior US state department official said he could be guilty of a war crime over the abuse of prisoners .
Lawrence Wilkerson , who served as chief of staff to secretary of state Colin Powell from 2002 to 2005 , singled out Mr Cheney in a wide - ranging political assault on the BBC's Today programme .
Mr Wilkerson said that in an internal administration debate over whether to abide by the Geneva conventions in the treatment of detainees , Mr Cheney led the argument " that essentially wanted to do away with all restrictions " .
Asked whether the vice - president was guilty of a war crime , Mr Wilkerson replied : " Well , that 's an interesting question - it was certainly a domestic crime to advocate terror and I would suspect that it is ... an international crime as well . "
In the context of other remarks it appeared he was using the word " terror " to apply to the systematic abuse of prisoners .
The Washington Post last month called Mr Cheney the " vice - president for torture " for his demand that the CIA be exempted from a ban on " cruel , inhuman and degrading " treatment of detainees .
Mr Wilkerson , a former army colonel , also said he had seen increasing evidence that the White House had manipulated pre-war intelligence on Iraq to make its case for the invasion .
He said : " You begin to wonder was this intelligence spun ?
Was it politicised ?
Was it cherry - picked ?
Did , in fact , the American people get fooled ?
I am beginning to have my concerns . "
Mr Cheney has been under fire for his role in assembling evidence of weapons of mass destruction .
Mr Wilkerson told the Associated Press that the vice - president must have sincerely believed Iraq could be a spawning ground for terrorism because " otherwise I have to declare him a moron , an idiot or a nefarious bastard " .
Such charges have kept the Bush administration on the defensive for several months .
Mr Bush yesterday repeated his earlier assertion that the US " does not torture and that 's important for people around the world to realise " .
He is also due to make the first of a series of speeches today , outlining his plan to defeat the insurgency and pave the way for US withdrawal .
The White House will also publish a declassified version of its war plan .
But it has now emerged that two justice department memos listing permissible interrogation methods have been kept secret by the White House , even from the Senate intelligence committee .
The New Yorker recently quoted a source who had seen a memo as calling it " breathtaking " .
" The document dismissed virtually all national and international laws regulating the treatment of prisoners , including war crimes and assault statutes , and it was radical in its view that in wartime the president can fight enemies by whatever means he sees fit , " the magazine reported .
One technique allegedly used by the CIA in questioning suspects is " waterboarding " ( strapping a detainee to a board and submerging it until the prisoner believes he or she is drowning ) .
The White House is accused of defining " torture " so narrowly as to exclude such methods .
But James Ross , a legal expert at Human Rights Watch said such a narrow definition was at odds with international norms .
" Waterboarding is clearly a form of torture .
It has been used since the Inquisition .
It was a well - known torture technique in Latin America , " Mr Ross said .
Human Rights
Watch this year called for a special counsel to investigate any US officials - no matter their rank or position - who took part in , " ordered , or had command responsibility for war crimes or torture , or other prohibited ill - treatment against detainees in US custody " .
The report focused on the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , for his alleged command responsibility for abuses at Abu Ghraib , but Mr Wilkerson argued Mr Cheney was ultimately responsible .
The US is a signatory to the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture , which bans inflicting " severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental " .
Such practices are also a crime under US federal law .
I 've been debating whether or not to post this thing , but what the hell , you 're all grown - ups .

Last time I was in Akihabara , I 'd found a 7 - story sex store filled with the usual DVDs , mags , fetish gear and cosplay outfits .
After floor 2 , my eyes just glazed over , senses overloaded .
But you do n't start hiking up Everest with the intent of half - assing , so I kept on going .
On floor 5 , I noticed what looked like a bright pink projector in the store window .
But instead of a lens , the machine had a faux - flesh orifice with " Heaven " scrawled across the side .
And instead of a lightbulb , it seemed to have a motor churning away , tirelessly .
Then I noticed lots of disposable looking canisters around with different textured interiors .
Aha , a bright pink japanese blowjob machine .
Cool .
One geek thought occurred to me after the typical male ones : I bet this could be rigged into an automatic cellphone cleaning mechanism .

The war on terror has become a perpetual war .
George W. Bush has taken powers unto himself that were never intended to be given to the executive branch .
He has claimed the authority to tell Congress it does n’t have any right to know what he ’s doing .
He ’s claimed authority to kidnap people and throw them into dungeons abroad without any political or legal accountability .
These standards are anathema to a democratic society devoted to the rule of law .

1. Playing Wii Sports
Tennis for the first time was the most revelatory , breakthrough gaming experience I ’ve had since I first saw Myst in the mid 90s .
It ’s truly one of those transformations where you immediately think : this whole medium is capable of something radically different from what we ’ve expected of it to date .
2 . Others may disagree , but from my perspective , Wii Tennis is so much better than all the other Wii Sports games that part of me wonders whether the controller interface is in fact uniquely suited for tennis games , and will prove to be a disappointment elsewhere .
( I ’m sure it will be wonderful for golf , actually — I just have higher expectations for golf sims than the Wii Sports version . )
Wii Bowling , to its credit , probably sets some kind of record for being the closest approximation of a real - world sport in the history of games .
Other than the weight of the ball itself , there ’s basically no difference between bowling in real life and bowling on the Wii .
Not being a huge fan of bowling personally , I consider this to be both good and bad news .
3. Wii Tennis is the first videogame since the second SimCity that my wife has taken even the slightest interest in playing .
This alone leads me to believe that they have a massive , category - changing hit on their hands .
4 . Part of the beauty of Wii Tennis is what they left out .
It ’s absolutely crucial to the game that you do n’t control the players ’ movements , that they just chase the balls on their own .
If you ’d added player - controlled movement , the learning curve would have been much more steep .
Same goes for letting a single player control both onscreen players in a doubles match without actively switching between them .
By removing those variables , they made a game where it ’s fun to play the second you pick up the controller .
( For what it ’s worth , I still think they should add an “ accelerate ” button for shots that your onscreen player wo n’t reach on his or her own .
If you press the button your onscreen avatar will run just a little faster in whatever direction he or she is running . )
5 . Having written so much about the complexity of today ’s games , it ’s fascinating to see a platform so heavily promoting its comparative simplicity .
But I think the success of the Wii is slightly more complicated than that .
Wii Sports trades the onscreen complexity of goals and objectives and puzzles for the physical , haptic complexity of bodily movement .
Since the days of Pong , games have been simplifying the intricacies of movement into unified codes of button pressing and joystick manipulation .
What strikes you immediately playing Wii Sports — and particularly Tennis — is this feeling of fluidity , the feeling that subtle , organic shifts in your body ’s motion will lead to different results onscreen .
My wife has a crosscourt slam she hits at the net that for the life of me I have n’t been able to figure out ; I have a topspin return of soft serves that I ’ve half - perfected that ’s unhittable .
We both got to those techniques through our own athletic experimentation with various gestures , and I ’m not sure I could even fully explain what I ’m doing with my killer topspin shot .
In a traditional game , I ’d know exactly what I was doing : hitting the B button , say , while holding down the right trigger .
Instead , my expertise with the shot has evolved through the physical trial - and - error of swinging the controller , experimenting with different gestures and timings .
And that ’s ultimately what ’s so amazing about the device .
Games for years have borrowed the structures and rules — as well as the imagery — of athletic competition , but the Wii adds something genuinely new to the mix , something we ’d ignored so long we stopped noticing that it was missing : athleticism itself .

1. Three Burning Buildings - One Result
How much more evidence do we need before the government and mainstream media finally talks about this issue ?
By ignoring this issue , the government and media are just insulting our intelligence .
9/11 witnesses - who include fire crew , police officers and media reporters - heard and saw explosions going off inside the towers , long before they actually fell .
Many witnesses reported powerful explosions in the basements of the buildings long before they collapsed .
Plus , controlled demolition experts agree that the collapses of the three buildings bear all of the hallmarks of a controlled demolition .
For example , we see demolition " squibs " shooting out of the windows of the buildings before they started to collapse .
All three buildings collapsed at near freefall speed .
Building 7 , which was n't hit by a plane and contained only small scattered fires , came down symmetrically in just 6 - seconds .
And 6 - weeks after 9/11 , liquified steel was found under the rubble of all three buildings and the temperature was still in excess of 1500 F .
Jet - fuel simply cannot burn hot enough to reach that sort of temperature .
And many of the steel beams found in the rubble of the three buildings were cut diagonally - in exactly the same way as shaped - charges slice through steel diagonally to bring a building straight down .
Sulfur residue was also found on the steel beams .
Sulfur used with thermite is called thermate -- which produces even faster results than thermite , reaching temperatures of over 4,000 F .
We also see red - hot molten steel dripping from the windows of the towers prior to their collapse .
We really need to wake up to the facts and ask questions .
If we do n't , what does that say about us ?
If you have n't yet heard about this subject , please go to Google and find out about the melting point of steel , and about the maximum temperature that jet - fuel can reach , and about the use of thermate shaped - charges in controlled demolitions .
Once you know these facts , you 'll realise that those three buildings simply could NOT have collapsed in the way they did UNLESS they were brought down in a controlled demolition .
2 . All At Freefall Speed
3. Bombs in the Buildings Bombs , explosions , secondary explosions , explosive devices .... how many more times do we need to hear these words being said by 9/11 witnesses before we start asking questions about what really happened on that awful day ?
4 . 1,000 Cameras and No Airplane !
I am not saying that the Pentagon was n't hit by a plane on 9/11 , however we have every right to be suspicious when we look at the facts .
My gut feeling is that the Pentagon WAS hit by a plane , but I find it hard to believe that the plane was the Flight 77 Boeing 757 jet .
The Pentagon is the most guarded building on the planet , with countless CCTV cameras covering every part of the building both inside and out .
Plus there are many establishments in the immediate area , such as gas stations , hotels , etc , that have CCTV cameras .
Yet the US government refuses to release any images or video that actually shows a plane approaching the Pentagon on 9/11 , let alone a Boeing 757 .
Within minutes of the crash , the FBI confiscated CCTV footage from all of the establishments in the immediate area , and they refuse to show us any of that footage .
The only images they have released were only released after years of demands under the Freedom of Information Act , and none of those images show an actual airplane .
If a Boeing 757 really did hit the Pentagon then why not show us the footage ?
And what about the lack of any wreckage from a Boeing 757 , and the lack of bodies , and the fact that the damage to the Pentagon wall is not consistent with what you 'd expect if it had been hit by a Boeing 757 -- the hole is way too small for a start .
And if the alleged terrorists had wanted to wreak maximum damage , then why would they fly the plane into the only part of the Pentagon that had recently been re-inforced , and the only part of the Pentagon that housed the accountants who were looking into the disappearance of over a trillion dollars from the US economy ?
And in any case , the flight instructor of the alleged hijackers said that these people were useless at flying even the smallest aircraft , and yet we 're expected to believe that they carried out an extremely difficult 360 degree menouvre and managed to fly the Boeing just a few feet from the ground as it approached the Pentagon .
Whichever way you want to look at it , this just does n't quite add up , it 's like trying to put a square peg into a round hole .

In 2,000 , just before the republicans got back into the White House , a project set up by the neo-cons who now surround George W Bush , laid out its agenda for global domination in a document called the " Project for the New American Century " .
However , it stated that gaining public support for its aspirations would require a long process , UNLESS there was a catastrophic event like " a new Pearl Harbor " .
Its published aims have , alarmingly , come true .
If a group of people made a public statement saying that having a new Pearl Harbor would be the only way the public would support their agenda , and these same people were in positions that would allow them to conduct , permit or enable such an event when that event actually took place ... would they deserve your suspicion ?
Well this is EXACTLY what happened .
The very people with established motives for conducting an event like the one that took place on 9/11/2001 were responsible for national security when we had that most unlikely , unrealistic and implausible complete catastrophic failure of every single defense procedure in operation .
Yet Americans look to these people for protection now .
The US military was running as many as 15 defense drills that day .
Some of these drills were live fly hijacking simulations .
Some of the drills were practicing for the possibility of having planes fly into government buildings .
Could it be that someone decided that these drills would go live !
Why have the corporate news media refused to report the drills to the public ?
Could it be because you would start asking REAL questions about that day ?
Well , it 's time that you start asking questions because you may just be supporting the real terrorists !
6 . " ABLE DANGER " Terror Drills on 9/11
On the morning of September 11 2001 , the US Defence Agencies had been running pre-planned simulations of terrorist attacks involving crashing planes into the WTC and Pentagon .
The Bush administration described the event as " a bizarre coincidence " .
The matter was not mentioned by the media .
True to form for false - flag terror attacks , it seems that these Military Drills were used as cover for the attack .
Webster Tarpley lays out a very convincing case that military drills were used as cover and pretext for the attacks of 9/11 .
Using drills , our own military resources were directed , in supposed practice attacks , which were ' flipped live ' by moles working within the government .
Using such drills , most of the fighter air cover of the US was redirected to Alaska and Canada .
Other drills were used to inject dozens of false ' blips ' onto FAA radar screens .
Still other drills , ones using ' live fly ' hijacked aircraft , were apparently ' flipped live ' and the planes crashed into the towers under remote control .
The ' hijackers ' are mere patsies , DOD controlled " red team " actors .
The supposed ' hijackers ' are essentially actors trained by the military and CIA to play the part of the " red team " in simulated terrorist drills .
The now famous " Able Danger " program was most likely one half , the red half , of a hijack drill the other half being " Able Warrior . "
7. WTC7 Implosion Please visit the website to order the full version of 9/11 Mysteries : http://www.911mysteries.com
Everyone remembers the Twin Towers exploding at 9:59 AM and 10:28 AM EDT on September 11 , 2001 .
Comparatively few people can recall that there was a third massive skyscraper , also a part of the World Trade Center , which fell very rapidly to the ground on that day .
This was World Trade Center Building 7 .
One reason that few remember WTC Building 7's collapse is that after September 11th it has been treated , both in the media and in The 9/11 Commission Report , as if it did n't happen .
The total collapse of the third huge skyscraper late in the afternoon September 11th was reported as if it were an insignificant footnote ... most people never saw video of Building 7's collapse ...
Incredibly , it is virtually impossible to find any mention of Building 7 in newspapers , magazines , or broadcast media reports after September 11th . "
The Commission avoids another embarrassing problem -- explaining how WTC 7 could have collapsed , also virtually at free - fall speed -- by simply not mentioning the collapse of this building .
The collapse of Building 7 at 5:20 PM EDT was in itself a major event ; the sudden and unexplained fall to earth of a 47 - story steel - framed skyscraper is certainly news .
Why has there been almost no mention of this in the US media , and why was there no mention of Building 7's collapse in The 9/11 Commission Report ?
These are questions of great significance , and they cry out for answers .
To be able to approach any kind of explanation , however , first some pertinent and verified facts of the Building 7 aspect of 9/11 need to be scrutinized .
The fires in WTC 7 were very few and small , and certainly not evenly distributed , so a perfect collapse was impossible , yet it came down in perfect symmetry in just 6 seconds .
WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein said to the fire department commander " the smartest thing to do is pull it . "
Firefighters withdrawing from the area stated the building was going to " blow up " .
The roof of WTC 7 visibly crumbled and the building collapsed perfectly into its footprint .
Molten steel and partially evaporated steel members were found in the debris .
There can be only one conclusion as to what happened to WTC 7 - it was demolished .
Silverstein Properties made billions from the insurance policies he set up on the WTC complex just a few weeks before 9/11 .
He specifically took out insurance policies to cover terrorist attacks , then a few weeks later 9/11 happened .
What are the odds on that ?

9. Mysterious Power - Downs in the World Trade Center
Please visit the website to order the full version of 9/11 Mysteries : http://www.911mysteries.com
Did the World Trade Center towers undergo a deliberate " power - down " on the weekend prior to the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks ?
According to Scott Forbes , a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust , Inc. -- a high - net investment bank which was later acquired by Franklin Templeton -- this is precisely what took place .
Forbes , who was hired by Fiduciary in 1999 and is now stationed at a U.K. branch office , was working on the weekend of September 8 - 9 , 2001 , and said that his company was given three weeks advance notice that New York 's Port Authority would take out power in the South Tower from the 48th floor up .
The reason : the Port Authority was performing a cabling upgrade to increase the WTC 's computer bandwidth .
However , there seems to be no logical reason why the electricity need be shut down in order to upgrade computer bandwidth .
The Fiduciary Trust was one of the WTC 's first occupants after it was erected , and a " power - down " had never been initiated prior to this occasion .
Forbes also stated that his company put forth a huge investment in time and resources to take down their computer systems due to the deliberate power outage .
This process , Forbes recalled , began early Saturday morning ( September 8th ) and continued until mid-Sunday afternoon ( September 9th ) -- approximately 30 hours .
As a result of having its electricity cut , the WTC 's security cameras were rendered inoperative , as were its I.D. systems , and elevators to the upper floors .
Forbes states that there were plenty of engineers going in - and - out of the WTC who had free access throughout the building due to its security system being knocked out .
Even though these disclosures could jeopardize his current employment , Forbes has stepped forward because , " I have mailed this information to many people , including the 9/11 Commission , but no one seems to be registering these facts . "
10 . The 9/11 Commission : See No Evil , Hear No Evil , Speak No Evil !
The Kean Commission ( 9/11 Commission ) was created only after 14 months of pressure from September 11 victims ' families , who for their efforts at first got the failed nomination by George Bush of Henry Kissinger as chairman .
He declined , but the Commission consisted of appointees with obvious conflicts of interest , and was seriously underfunded ( $ 14 million as opposed to the $ 67 million devoted to investigating Clinton 's stray member or $ 30 million for the space shuttle disaster ) .
Its work was met with resistance from the White House .
Bush met with the Commission only on the condition that he be questioned in the Oval Office , jointly with Cheney , and off the record .
The 9/11 Commission Report was noteworthy in the fact that it did n't blame anyone for 9/11 .
Not one person has lost his job because 9/11 happened ; even though high - ranking witness after high - ranking witness to the Commission described blunders and missed opportunities leading up the attacks .
Why did the Commission do that ?
Many of the 9/11 widows are unhappy with the findings and many people have called it a whitewash .
Despite the vast quantity of labor behind it , the 9/11 Commission Report is a cheat and a fraud .
It stands as a series of evasive maneuvers that infantilize the audience , transform candor into iniquity , and conceal realities that demand immediate inspection and confrontation .
Because it is continuously engaged in scotching all attempts to distinguish better from worse leadership responses , the Commission can't discharge its duty to educate the audience about the habits of mind and temperament essential in those chosen to discharge command responsibility during crises .
It ca n't tell the truth about what was done and not done , thought and not thought , at crucial turning points .
The Commissioners ' immeasurably valuable access to the principals involved offered an extraordinary opportunity to amass material precious to future historians : commentary based on moment - to - moment reaction to major events .
But the 567 pages , which purport to provide definitive interpretations of the reactions , are in fact useless to historians , because a seeming terror of bias transforms query after commissarial query -- and silence after silence - - into suggested new lines of self - justification for the interviewees .
In the course of blaming everybody a little , the Commission blames nobody -- blurs the reasons for the actions and hesitations of successive administrations , masks choices that , fearlessly defined , might actually have vitalized our public political discourse .
The 9/11 Commission was a blatant whitewash , it failed to seriously examine virtually every fact supporting complicity of the US administration .
It ignored the PNAC document , the links between the CIA and Bin Laden , the links between the Bush family and Bin Laden , the links beween the CIA and Mohammed Atta , the terror drill exercises that were taking place in the week of 9/11 , the collapse of building 7 , the molten steel found under the rubble of towers 1 , 2 and 7 , the evidence of the use of thermite and sulfur , the witness reports of repeated explosions throughout the towers , the lack of flying skills previously displayed by the alleged hijackers , Silverstein's $ 7 billion insurance payout , the insider trading before 9/11 , the mysterious powerdowns and evacuations at the WTC prior to 9/11 , and the fact that the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the US just after 9/11 while every US citizen was grounded .
The list just goes on and on and on .
It is up to us , the people , to get some answers .
Please write to your congressman to demand a proper INDEPENDENT investigation into 9/11 .
11 . Who Benefited From 9/11 ?
When a crime has been committed , any good investigator will ask the question -- Who benefits ?
In this 9/11 Coincidences installment , we apply this same reasoning to the main parties associated with the events of 9/11 .
I had to shorten this video in order to upload it to YouTube , so I edited lots of bits out .
The full video is 30 mins long and goes into more detail on each of the parties spoken about .
11 . UPDATE - CENSORED BY YOUTUBE
9/11 Coincidences ( Part Eleven ) was removed by YouTube for no apparent reason , they did n't even send me an email to explain why .
However you can watch the video at the following web locations : 12 . Guilty Demeanor
This video takes a look at the guilty demeanor displayed by George W Bush , Donald Rumsfeld and others with regard to the events of 9/11 .
If you were the president of the United States , and an attack on the scale of 9/11 took place on your watch , would n't you immediately do everything you could to ensure that there was a thorough investigation into what happened ?
Would n't you make sure that the investigation was started up straight away , and that it was headed by independent people who left no stone unturned ?
Would n't you make sure that the investigation was given all the funding it needed ?
We know that the Bush administration did everything in its power to derail an open inquiry into 9/11 .
Then , when faced with its inevitability , the president and his aides sought to limit its scope , its access , and its funding .
In addition , the odd behaviour displayed by the White House with regard to 9/11 , would surely make them prime suspects on anyone 's list .
13 . The BUSH - LADEN Connection
George Bush Sr. and bin Laden Sr. are long - standing business partners .
George Bush Sr. and the bin Laden family are on the board of the Carlyle Group , a large defense contractor .
The bin Laden family financed George Bush Jr.'s early failed businesses .
From their generous contributions , even though the companies failed , George was still able to live high on the hog .
According to the book Fortunate Son bin Laden money , invested via James Bath , enabled George Dubya to get hooked on cocaine .
He was busted in 1972 but got off with community service at Project P.U.L.L. - a project for troubled youth .
In 1995 , his father arranged to have the record purged and his son to get a new drivers ' license number .
James R. Bath , friend and neighbor of George W. Bush , was used as a cash funnel from Osama bin Laden 's rich father , Sheikh bin Laden , to set George W. Bush up in business , according to reputable sources from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times .
The connection between GW Bush , the bin Laden family , and the Bank Commerce Credit International ( BCCI ) is well documented .
The Bush dynasty has closer links to the bin Ladens than just about anyone else .
George Bush Jr. arranged for the bin Laden family to escape the USA by private jet when everyone else was still under lockdown .
The bin Laden family were asked no questions .
Pakistan 's Secret Police ( ISI ) , which has close ties to the CIA , secretly airlifted several thousand members of Al Qaeda , and , perhaps Osama , out of Afghanistan to safety shortly after 9/11 .
If it were you or me with this many links to the alleged perpetrators of 9/11 , we'd be rotting in Guantánamo Bay 's Camp Delta in shackles and chains .
If it were Clinton , he'd be lynched .
But because it is BUSH , people pretend not to notice .
I think before too much more money is wasted chasing phantom terrorists , it would be wise to interrogate Bush under oath to find out just what he knows .
He seems to be on intimate terms with the reputed perpetrators .
14 . The BUSH - LADEN Connection ( continued )
There is a long and tangled history between the Bush family and the elite of Saudi Arabia , including the bin Laden family .
It begins in the 1970's in Houston , Texas , when George W. Bush was just starting out in his family 's two businesses of politics and oil .
The powerful - and very rich - bin Laden family helped fund his first venture into oil .
The cozy friendship continued for decades .
After a terrorist attack at a barracks in Saudi Arabia which killed 19 Americans , the bin Laden family received a multi-billion dollar contract to re-build .
And incredibly , George Bush Sr. was in a business meeting at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington on the morning of September 11th with one of Osama bin Laden 's brothers .
While serving as governor of Texas , George W. Bush met with high - level Al Qaeda leaders , hoping to get support to build a pipeline across Afghanistan .
Four months into his presidency , he rewarded the Taliban by handing over $ 43 million in May 2001 , only four months before the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
All airlines in the United States were grounded for two days after 9/11 .
Yet , on September 13 , 2001 , the White House authorized six Saudi jets to fly bin Laden family members from America to Saudi Arabia .
The members of the bin Laden family were never questioned by United States authorities .
Judicial Watch called for George Herbert Bush to resign from the Carlyle Group , when it became known that Osama bin Laden was a major investor in the firm .
( Judicial Watch , March 5 , 2001 ) After the September 11 terrorist attacks , Judicial Watch Chairman and General Counsel Larry Klayman said , " This conflict of interest has now turned into a scandal .
The idea of President George W Bush 's father , an ex-president himself , doing business with a company under investigation by the FBI in the terror attacks of September 11 is horrible .
President Bush should not ask , but demand , that his father pull out of the Carlyle Group . "
( Judicial Watch , September 28 , 2001
Certain army ants in the rainforests of Central and South America conduct spectacular predatory raids containing up to 200,000 foraging ants .
Remarkably , some ants use their bodies to plug potholes in the trail leading back to the nest , making a flatter surface so that prey can be delivered to the developing young at maximum speed .
Specialization by a minority can help the greater good .
Photo by Scott Powell
The raid always remains connected to the nest by a trail of forager traffic , along which prey - laden foragers run back to run back to the nest .
This trail can be extremely uneven and full of ‘ pot holes ’ as it passes over leaves and branches on the forest floor .
The study , by Dr Scott Powell and Professor Nigel Franks at the University of Bristol , and reported in the June issue of Animal Behaviour , shows that these living ‘ plugs ’ improve the quality of the surface .
This increases the overall speed of the traffic and results in an increase in the amount of prey delivered to the nest each day .
Professor Franks said : " I think every road user who has ever inwardly cursed as their vehicle bounced across a pothole – jarring every bone in their body – will identify with this story .
When it comes to rapid road repairs , the ants have their own do - it - yourself highways agency . "
" When the traffic has passed , the down - trodden ants climb out of the potholes and follow their nest mates home , " added Powell .
" Broadly , our research demonstrates that a simple but highly specialised behaviour performed by a minority of ant workers can improve the performance of the majority , resulting in a clear benefit for the society as a whole . "
Their experiments showed that individuals size - match to the hole they plug and cooperate to plug larger holes .
" We did this by getting the ants to literally ‘ walk the plank ’ , said Powell .
" We inserted planks drilled with different sizes of hole into the army ants ’ trails to see how well different sizes of ant matched different sizes of pot hole .
Indeed , they fit beautifully " , explained Franks .
Overall , this behaviour results in an increase in the average speed of prey - laden traffic .
Moreover , calculations suggest that under a range of realistic scenarios , plugging behaviour results in a clear increase in daily prey intake .
In other words , the behaviour of the pothole pluggers more than compensates for them not carrying prey themselves .
This study provides rare quantitative evidence from animal societies that extreme specialisation by a minority can significantly improve the performance of a majority to benefit the group as a whole .
It also suggests that these benefits are a consequence of the unusual and derived foraging strategy of the army ant ( Eciton burchellii ) .
This highlights the importance of considering ecology and evolutionary history in the study of social organisation in animal societies .

There are three “ rats of the week ” on the home page of whosarat.com , a Web site devoted to exposing the identities of witnesses cooperating with the government .
The site posts their names and mug shots , along with court documents detailing what they have agreed to do in exchange for lenient sentences .
Last week , for instance , the site featured a Florida man who agreed in September to plead guilty to cocaine possession but not gun charges in exchange for his commitment to work “ in an undercover role to contact and negotiate with sources of controlled substances . ”
The site says it has identified 4,300 informers and 400 undercover agents , many of them from documents obtained from court files available on the Internet .
“ The reality is this , ” said a spokesman for the site , who identified himself as Anthony Capone .
“ Everybody has a choice in life about what they want to do for a living .
Nobody likes a tattletale . ”
Federal prosecutors are furious , and the Justice Department has begun urging the federal courts to make fundamental changes in public access to electronic court files by removing all plea agreements from them — whether involving cooperating witnesses or not .
Powell would n't invade Iraq again with current knowledge David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday June 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This " I did n't think the [ Iraq ] war was a mistake at the time we entered into it , " said former Secretary of State Colin Powell on NBC's Meet the Press this morning .
" It was a war I would have liked to avoid . "
Powell said he told President Bush , in August 2002 , to seek a resolution from the United Nations for the problem of Saddam Hussein 's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction .
" The president did that .
He took it to the UN and he did not get a satisfactory solution from the UN , and made a decision to use military force , and I supported him in that .
But I think we have handled the aftermath of the fall of Baghdad in a very ineffective way , " said Powell .
Powell was then asked if he would still support the invasion of Iraq knowing that there were no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction .
" If we knew then what we know today , that there were no weapons of mass destruction , I would have had nothing to take to the United Nations , " replied Powell .
" We rested our case on the existence of weapons of mass destruction that were a threat to us and could be given to terrorists making it another kind of threat to us .
I think without that weapons of mass destruction case the justification would not have been there ... "
The following video is from NBC's Meet the Press , broadcast on June 10 .
BERKELEY , California – Two technologies demonstrated at the International Virtual Reality Photography Conference over the weekend come close to delivering the amazing imaging technologies used in Blade Runner to zoom deep into pictures and explore them from different angles .
Both developed by Microsoft , one application allows viewers to zoom deep into gigantic , gigapixel panoramic images .
A sweeping view of downtown Seattle and the Puget Sound can be enlarged to show diners sitting in the Space Needle .
Another application constructs 3 - D objects from hundreds of ordinary 2 - D photographs , allowing the object to be explored from any angle .
The most impressive demonstration at Sunday ’s IVRPC seminar was Photosynth from Microsoft Live Labs – a program that constructs large - scale , 3 - D models of objects like buildings from hundreds of still photographs .
Using a mouse , viewers can walk in – and around – the 3 - D model , looking at the object from almost any angle .
Viewers can isolate individual shots , and quickly zoom into the tiniest details with a roll of the mouse scroll wheel .
( Online demos available here require Windows XP SP2 or Vista ) .
One reconstructed scene showed the Trevi fountain in Rome , stitched together from 350 photographs scraped from Flickr .
The immersive scene incorporated images shot with everything from cell - phone cameras to high - end SLRs .
Another 3 - D panorama reconstructed the lavish Gyeongbokgung palace in Seoul , Korea , integrating both professional shots and photographs submitted by amateurs .
“ You can actually jump into the images , ” remarked Drew Steedly , a scientist with Microsoft Live Labs .
Photosynth uses a visual algorithm to scan through hundreds of images , hunting for distinctive features .
After identifying features common to different pictures – doors , windows and sculptures – the program links the photos together and calculates the 3 - D position of each picture .
The technique is similar to depth perception – where the brain combines different views from each eye into one seamless 3 - D view .
In Photosynth , the system establishes a " point - cloud " for each photograph space , and then stitches the latticework of images to create a dazzlingly seamless three - dimensional interactive environment ready for exploration .
" We ’re working on releasing something where you could make your own collection , ” said Steedly , although when pressed , he admitted there 's no timetable for the public rollout of Photosynth .
Matt Uyttendaele of Microsoft Research showed off HD View , a high - definition panoramic viewer that can handle monster panoramic shots , often several gigapixels big .
The browser - based viewer provides an immersive wide - angle view , up to 360 degrees , and is capable of displaying images composed of billions of pixels .
( Again , the technology requires XP or Vista ) .
The sweeping panorama of Seattle was composed of 800 images taken with a zoom camera mounted on a motorized telescope tripod .
The tripod stepped the camera across the panorama as it captured a mosaic of 20 megapixel images .
" Its pretty amazing , details in the JPEG images that you do n’t even realize are there , " said Uyttendaele .
" It ’s just another dimension to exploring these really large images . "
Currently available only for Windows , a new version of HD View will be released in a few weeks that adds tone mapping , which sharpens images by automatically removing atmospheric haze .
“ We ’re encouraging people to try this out if they want , ” said Uyttendaele .
It 's going to be a long night .
Greg Sargent has confirmed with Sarah Binder , an expert in governance studies at Brookings Institution that Reid 's parliamentary procedure on this is solid .
She points to this particular Senate reg :
Whenever upon such roll call it shall be ascertained that a quorum is not present , a majority of the Senators present may direct the Sergeant at Arms to request , and , when necessary , to compel the attendance of the absent Senators ...
And yes , this has apparently happened before , in 1988 , when Majority Leader Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , ordered round - the - clock Senate sessions that were boycotted by Republicans .
Charlie Cook recounts that Byrd ordered the Senate 's sergeant - at - arms to arrest absent senators and bring them to the floor .
Capitol cops arrested Sen. Robert Packwood , R - Ore. , and even removed him from a locked Senate office and carried him onto the Senate floor , Cook writes .
( If I remember correctly , Packwood was n't just hiding in his office , but in the bathroom in his office .
But my memory could be faulty .
It makes a good story , anyway . )
At any rate , the night is going to be long .
Howard Dean says ( in e-mail ) :
Now , let 's not kid ourselves : they can filibuster , and we probably wo n't have the votes to stop them .
But if Senate Republicans are against ending the war , then they should show it by voting against the legislation -- a straight - up - and - down vote on a bill that the majority of Americans support .
That 's how a democratic government works .
Instead , they 're threatening to block the vote , and we 're going to force them to explain themselves in front of the American people .
So let 's show Senator Reid that we 're united behind him .
We 've created a simple tool that will let you write a letter and fax it to your Senators instantly -- you can let them know all night long just how much opposition there is to the war in Iraq .
Send your Senators a message right now : http://www.democrats.org/....
Let your Senators know you 're hanging out with them tonight .
Give their staff who have to stay , too , some company and something to do tonight .
And let them know one simple thing .
We want our troops to come home .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health , which supports a variety of biomedical studies using animals , will stop breeding government - owned chimpanzees for research -- a step animal rights advocates lauded on Thursday .

The NIH ’s National Center for Research Resources cited financial reasons for its decision this week to permanently cease breeding of government - owned chimpanzees for research .
A breeding moratorium on NCRR - owned and supported chimpanzees had been in place since 1995 .
The Humane Society of the United States said it suspects that ethical reasons also were involved in the decision .
The group , which opposes the use of these apes as lab animals , said the decision on ending breeding likely also means NIH no longer will be acquiring new chimpanzees through other means .
Because chimpanzees are physiologically and genetically similar to people , they have been used in medical research defended by many scientists but scorned by animals rights advocates on ethical grounds .
“ This decision is a huge step towards a day when chimpanzees are no longer used in invasive biomedical research and testing , ” Kathleen Conlee of the Humane Society said in a statement .
‘ MONUMENTAL DECISION ’
“ This will spare some chimpanzees a life of up to 60 years in a laboratory .
While it does n’t help chimpanzees already living in laboratories , it is a monumental decision , ” Conlee added .
“ Our ultimate goal is to put an end ( to ) the use of chimpanzees in research and retire those chimpanzees to permanent and appropriate sanctuary . ”
The Humane Society said the NCRR ’s chimpanzee population includes about 500 in laboratories and 90 more in a federal sanctuary for those deemed no longer needed for research .
In a statement on its Web site , NCRR said it acknowledges the continuing importance of chimpanzees to biomedical research , but cited “ fiduciary responsibilities ” to maintain the health and well - being of chimpanzees already in its care .
The center said chimpanzees can live at least 50 years in captivity , and that high - quality care for a single animal over its lifespan can cost up to $ 500,000 .
It said it also must meet budget responsibilities to other programs and resources .
“ Therefore , after careful review of existing chimpanzee resources , NCRR has determined that it does not have the financial resources to support the breeding of chimpanzees that are owned or supported by NCRR , ” the center said .
“ However , NCRR will continue to honor its commitments to the existing chimpanzee facilities , including the federal sanctuary for chimpanzees that are no longer needed in biomedical research , ” the center added .
The advocacy group Project R&R : Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees in U.S. Laboratories said about 1,300 chimpanzees are currently in U.S. laboratories .
It said some were caught in the wild as babies in Africa while others were born in laboratories or sent from zoos , circuses and animal trainers .
Theodora Capaldo , the group ’s executive director , said that “ not only U.S. but also world sentiment is growing in support of the day when no chimpanzees will be used in laboratory research . ”
In a major new statewide survey , solid majorities of Massachusetts residents – spanning all political parties – and those who live on the Cape and on the Islands — said they want the Bay State to emerge as a national leader in alternative energy , including wind power projects such as Cape Wind .
The new Opinion Research Corporation ( ORC ) poll ( pdf ) for the Newton - based Civil Society Institute also looks at the attitudes of state residents about coal - fired power plants , nuclear power , and the federal vehicle fuel - efficiency standards that Massachusetts Rep. Ed Markey is now shepherding through Congress .
The scientific survey of 600 state residents found that 93 percent of Massachusetts residents — including 78 percent of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands — agree that the state should be “ a national leader in using cleaner and renewable energy on a large scale by moving ahead with offshore wind power ” and other clean energy initiatives .
The statement is supported on a bipartisan basis by Republicans ( 94 percent ) , Democrats ( 93 percent ) , and Independents ( 93 percent ) .
More than four out of five Massachusetts residents ( 84 percent ) — including 58 percent of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands — explicitly support “ the proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm that would involve wind turbines being placed in Nantucket Sound about five and a half miles from the Town of Hyannis . ”
These numbers are virtually unchanged from a June 2006 Civil Society Institute ( CSI ) survey that posed the same question and found 81 percent support statewide and 61 percent in Cape Cod / the Islands ( the latter of which is within the survey ’s margin of error ) .
Republican support for Cape Wind is at 82 percent , Democrats at 86 percent and Independents at 81 percent .
Another key finding : Almost nine out of 10 Massachusetts residents ( 88 percent ) think that Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick should follow the lead of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger “ when it comes to state government leadership on global warming solutions and the promotion of clean , renewable energy . ”
About two out of three state residents ( 65 percent ) expressed strong support for such an approach and only 9 percent said no .
Support for this leadership role being taken by Governor Patrick was strongly supported across the political spectrum : Republicans ( 82 percent ) ; Democrats ( 93 percent ) ; and Independents ( 80 percent ) .
So there you have it .
Wide spread support from all political parties for renewable energy leadership including but not limited too support for cape wind .
So why are people like Ted Kennedy still opposing this project ?
Their views are far from reflecting the opinion of Mass .
residents , in fact it is rapidly becoming an embarrassing political liability .
Could it be that Kennedy , Delahunt oppose the project because it could harm the view from their large summer homes ?
We must assume that something is up .
Ted Kennedy has been around the block way to many times in this state to not realize that this is going to hurt him .
Civil Society Institute President and Founder Pam Solo said :
“ I would encourage Governor Patrick , Senator Kennedy , Senator Kerry , Representative Markey and the rest of the Massachusetts congressional delegation to look closely at these survey findings .
The notion that wind power and the other clean energy sources are dividing lines in Massachusetts either in terms of politics or region â€¦ or both â€¦ is an entirely mistaken and counterproductive idea .
Instead , what we see in this survey is a clear example of Massachusetts citizens ‘ leading the leaders . ’
State residents want action now on clean , safe renewable energy sources , including Cape Wind , and also higher federal fuel - efficiency standards for vehicles .
They want the state to get out in front as a true national leader solving the threats posed by global warming and our addiction to foreign oil . ”
With the specter of global warming set to affect Massachusetts particularly hard I think that our political leaders have a unique chance to do something major and important right in our back yard we should take it .
It would also be a way to spark a new and vibrant economic power house in the state .
“ Opinion Research Corporation Senior Researcher Graham Hueber said : “ One of the most striking aspects of this survey is the clear sense that state residents have of a potential ‘ Massachusetts Miracle ’ if their leaders decide to take a front - and - center role on clean energy solutions to global warming .
It is very telling that a very strong 91 percent of state residents see a parallel to the Route 128 tech boom of the 1980s and now want the state to emulate California ‘ in seeking to create new jobs and industries by becoming a national hub for new energy technology development . ”
Commenting on the survey , Barbara Hill , executive director , Clean Power Now , Hyannis , MA. , said : “ This past spring Governor Patrick and his administration took an historic step forward by determining the Cape Wind Project ’s Final Environmental Impact Report ( FEIR ) as adequate , moving us closer to realizing significant public benefits such as improved air quality , energy reliability and economic growth .
The development of this project as proposed will advance the Commonwealth ’s energy policy goals and help make Massachusetts a world leader in the development and production of clean energy . ”
KEY SURVEY FINDINGS
More than nine out of 10 state residents ( 91 percent ) agreed with the following statement : “ In the 1980s , Massachusetts ’ Route 128 was famous as the rival to California ’s Silicon Valley when it came to incubating new high - tech companies and emerging computer technologies .
More than 20 years later , California is taking the lead with renewable energy .
Should Massachusetts follow California in seeking to create new jobs and industries by becoming a national hub for new energy technology development ? ”
There is strong bipartisan support for such leadership among Republicans ( 90 percent ) , Democrats ( 92 percent ) and Independents ( 90 percent ) .
More than four out of five constituents ( 84 percent ) of Rep. Ed Markey say “ yes ” when asked : “ Massachusetts Congressman Ed Markey will be a leader in the U.S. House of Representatives about what Congress decides to do on global warming in his role as chair of the special U.S. House committee on global warming .
Do you think Congressman Markey should use his role to push for Congress to enact a higher 40 miles per gallon standard by 2010 in order to reduce dependence on Middle East oil and also cut global - warming pollution ? ”
Over half ( 55 percent ) said “ definitely ” yes and only 13 percent said “ no . ” ( Rep .
Markey is currently proposing lower federal fuel - efficiency standards that would take considerably longer to go into effect than the 40 - MPG - by - 2010 standard outlined in the survey . )
Over three out of four state residents ( 78 percent ) — and 61 percent of those living on the Cape and on the Islands — support wind as the best energy resource for provide electricity to Cape Cod and the Islands .
Statewide , the support for other alternatives was as follows : nuclear ( 10 percent ) ; coal ( 4 percent ) ; and other ( 5 percent ) .
Wind power is supported by 74 percent of Republicans , 81 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of Independents .
These support levels are up slightly from 2006 : 74 percent statewide and 57 percent for the Cape / Islands .
Clean renewable energy is widely supported over nuclear power in Massachusetts , including on the Cape and on the Islands .
State residents would prefer to see solar ( 91 percent ) , more conservation ( 90 percent ) , and wind power ( 89 percent ) used first before resorting to more nuclear power .
On the Cape and on the Islands , the views were very similar , with strong support for wind power ( 75 percent ) ; conservation ( 81 percent ) ; and solar ( 84 percent ) .
More than three out four Massachusetts residents ( 78 percent ) favor a “ five - year moratorium on new coal - fired power plants on the East Coast and the rest of the United States if there was stepped - up investment on clean , safe renewable energy – such as wind and solar – and improved home energy - efficiency standards . ”
This statement was supported strongly by 50 percent of state residents and opposed by only 19 percent .
76 percent of Republicans , 83 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Independents support the notion of a moratorium on more coal - fired power plants .
A nearly unanimous 94 percent of state residents support efforts in Massachusetts such as that undertaken by Cambridge , which “ has announced that it will be the first energy - efficient city in the U.S. ”
Nearly three out of four state residents ( 73 percent ) strongly support such steps and only 3 percent oppose them .
Interestingly , likely 2008 voters are somewhat more supportive of such an approach in the state than are non-voters ( 95 percent v. 89 percent ) .
More than four out of five state residents ( 83 percent ) agree that “ President Bush and Congress should increase the federal fuel - efficiency standard NOW to 40 miles per gallon , ” rather than waiting to achieve a lower MPG standard over a longer period of time .
Over half of state residents ( 56 percent ) feel strongly about the need for quick action versus a total of 14 percent who oppose it .
Quick action on federal fuel efficiency standards is supported across the political spectrum : Republicans ( 80 percent ) ; Democrats ( 84 percent ) ; and Independents ( 82 percent ) .
When framed in this way , the shift to a higher MPG standard on a quick basis is supported by 84 percent of the constituents of Congressman Ed Markey .
More than three out of four state residents ( 84 percent ) think that a “ significant portion ” of the gasoline tax funding the Federal Highway Trust Fund should be used “ to accelerate research and development into alternative fuel and energy sources that could reduce dependence on Middle East oil and also cut global - warming pollution . ”
More than three out five state residents ( 63 percent ) said that the federal gasoline tax should “ definitely ” be used for such purposes versus 15 percent who said “ no . ”
The earmarked gas tax concept is particularly popular with 18 - 24 year olds at 90 percent .
The approach also is supported by 77 percent of Republicans , 90 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Independents .
Nearly nine out of 10 state residents ( 87 percent ) “ favor enhanced home energy - efficiency standards in Massachusetts and the rest of the United States in order to decrease heating and cooling energy consumption and related bills for consumers . ”
Nearly three out of five state residents ( 59 percent ) expressed strong support for such an approach .
Three out of four state residents said they are “ aware of the public discussion about Cape Wind , the offshore wind farm proposed for Nantucket Sound . ”
About one quarter ( 24 percent ) said they had no awareness .
Among the Cape / Islands portion of the respondents , 93 percent are aware of Cape Wind versus 7 percent who are not .
The political party identification of the Massachusetts survey respondents breaks down as follows : Republican ( 12 percent ) ; Independent / lean Republican ( 11 percent ) ; Independent ( 17 percent ) ; Independent / lean Democratic ( 25 percent ) ; and Democratic ( 31 percent ) .
92 percent of state residents said that they are likely to vote in 2008 .
So now we find ourselves in a situation where the vast majority of state residents of all parties seem to overwhelmingly want the leaders of this state to pursue renewable energy .
They want solar power , they want cape wind , and they want efficiency , and most of them plan on voting .
We can only hope they remember the answering to the survey when they are in the voting booth .
The real question is how will the leaders opposing cape wind explain why they have the opinion they do ?
Could it be the view ?
Could it be they do n’t want to have to sail their yachts around the turbines ?
The political tide is not turning , it has turned , and if the leaders of this state do n’t realize this , they are at risk of being swept away .
If only the queen ’s personal assets are taken into account , she is worth several hundred million dollars , according to the Sunday Times Rich List and people familiar with her finances who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .
But if all royal possessions are added to the mix , her wealth runs into the billions .
Yet even then , hurdles remain :
What is the value of the Crown Jewels , for example ?
Or the many Leonardo da Vinci drawings she holds in trust in the Royal Collection ?
The queen ’s private property primarily includes two homes and estates , Balmoral in Scotland ( 50,000 acres ) and Sandringham in eastern England ( 21,000 acres ) , and , on a smaller scale , such things as her prized stamp collection .
She also has a private investment portfolio of undisclosed size .
At the other end of the spectrum is a collection of assets called the Crown Estate .
This includes farms , a racetrack and property in London , like the Israeli embassy , and is valued at more than $ 14.2 billion , according to its annual accounts .
Those properties originally belonged to the monarchy , but King George III , who took the throne in 1760 , handed over management to the state , with all income from the properties flowing into public coffers .
In return , he and all of his successors have received an annual payment from the government ; the Crown Estate is now run from offices just off Regent Street , one of central London ’s prime shopping boulevards ( a street that the Crown Estate also owns ) .
The queen and Prince Charles also own lands and properties traditionally passed down to the monarch and heir to finance private expenditures : the Duchy of Lancaster belongs to the queen , and the Duchy of Cornwall to the prince .
The Duchy of Lancaster has a value of $ 693 million , according to its accounts for the fiscal year ended March 2006 , up from $ 449 million in fiscal 2002 , and generated a net operating income of $ 22 million .
It includes land in northern England , and the Savoy Estate , a patch of offices and shops between the Strand and the Thames in London .
The Duchy of Cornwall , 135,000 acres located mainly in southwest England , was valued in March 2007 at about $ 1.2 billion , up from $ 835 million in 2003 .
Britain ’s government also pays an annual allowance to the queen and her husband , Prince Philip , for their public work .
In the year ended in March 2007 , they received $ 26 million , according to the queen ’s most recent annual review of income and expenditures .
The royals also receive public subsidies for palace maintenance , public relations and travel costs , which together amounted to about $ 42 million in the year ended in March .
Other government agencies directly paid them about $ 8 million over the same period for other costs .

All these figures began getting more public attention as pressure for a more open monarchy increased from the 1960s to the 1980s .
Media scrutiny , particularly from aggressive tabloids , opened a window onto what critics described as lives of unearned wealth and privilege .
The unraveling of several royal marriages in the 1990s — particularly that of Prince Charles and Princess Diana — further dulled the aura of respect surrounding the Windsors .
“ The monarchy was part of the set of institutions of privilege at a time when there was a general appetite for opening up , ” said Peter Kellner , president of YouGov , a British polling organization .
“ They were revealed as people that seemed to deserve being less deferential to .
As a result they have had to make a number of concessions . ”
The movie Blood Diamond opens with a ferocious raid by rebels on a quiet village in Sierra Leone .
Families are scattered and separated as the rebels rampage , murdering indiscriminately and setting fire to thatched - roofed huts and smallholdings .
When the killing stops , some of the stronger men from the village who have survived are rounded up to work as slaves in the rebel - controlled diamond mines in the east of the country and their sons are taken away in trucks , destined to become boy soldiers in one of Africa 's harshest civil wars .
Blood Diamond is a complex film .
On one level it indulges many of the stereotypes of the traditional Hollywood adventure movie set in or about Africa .
For a start , the hero , a Rhodesian mercenary , played by an impressive Leonardo DiCaprio , is white .
The chaos of a war - stricken African state provides the setting for his quest to live authentically and free , apart from conventional bourgeois society .
He is an all - action hero , ruthless in his pursuit of self - affirmation and seemingly indestructible until , that is , his heart is softened by a woman - an American journalist , who is , also , white .
Yet on another level , Blood Diamond is an important political text which , as did The Constant Gardener before it , attempts to expose the complicity of western corporations in the ruin of a resources - rich but vulnerable and disturbed African country ; the ultimate villains , for all their cruelty and violence , are not the rebel soldiers but their western sponsors .
Most interesting , the film investigates the phenomenon of the child soldier in Africa , of those boys and sometimes girls who are orphaned in conflict or stolen from their families and then brutalised and humiliated until , finding a new kind of family among rebel soldiers , they become drug - addicted killers , without pity or fear .
We know something of these children from innumerable journalistic dispatches from northern Uganda , where the paramilitary Lord 's Resistance Army has fought a murderous war against the Museveni government for nearly two decades ; from Sierra Leone , whose civil war was ended by one of Tony Blair 's more successful foreign policy interventions ; from Liberia , one of the most ravaged of all African states ; and , most recently , from Sudan , where the attacks on villages by Arab militias , mobile killing units inspired by the Khartoum government , continue unhindered in spite of the presence of African Union peacekeeping forces and agitation from western aid groups such as the admirable Aegis Trust .
We know something of these children , too , from recent novels , such as Uzodinma Iweala 's acclaimed Beasts of No Nation , which was set in an unnamed west African state and narrated in a swirling , fractured demotic by a boy soldier named Agu , and Ahmadou Kourouma 's Allah is Not Obliged , which takes as its setting the civil war in Liberia , as well as from Blood Diamond .
We know something of these children but , at the same time , can we ever say that we know them - know what they feel , think , need or want in all their complicated interiority ?
The honest answer is that we do not , although that may be about to change with the publication next month of two remarkable first - person documentary accounts .
These are Ishmael Beah's A Long Way Gone , an astonishingly self - revealing memoir of his time as a boy soldier in Sierra Leone in the mid-1990s , and Dave Eggers 's What Is the What , a long , experimental non-fiction novel written in collaboration with Valentino Achak Deng , one of the so - called Lost Boys of Sudan who are now living in the US , having been displaced in the civil war .
There is , too , the forthcoming documentary film God Grew Tired of Us , directed by Christopher Quinn , with Brad Pitt as an executive producer and Nicole Kidman as narrator .
Like the Eggers novel , this is a story of American immigration framed by the trauma of war in Sudan and the suffering of tens of thousands of children separated from their families , some of whom became boy soldiers .
Clearly , as the New York Times recently put it , the African boy - killer , or the ' kid - at - arms ' , in the American vernacular , 'is becoming a pop-cultural trope .
He 's in novels , movies , magazines and on TV , flaunting his Uzi like a giant foam hand at a baseball game ' .
His ubiquity is a manifestation of how far Africa , with its wars , post - colonial dilemmas and ethnic rivalries but also its hope , vibrancy , cultural and linguistic diversity , has moved from the margins to the centre of western consciousness ; of how Africa has become the cause celeb , as it were , of our new globalisation .
It is obvious that cultural extravaganzas such as Africa 05 , the Make Poverty History campaign and Live 8 have played their part in raising greater awareness of Africa , its problems and its needs , as has the proselytising of Bono , Bill Gates and Tony Blair .
The critical and commercial success of works such as Blood Diamond and The Last King of Scotland , about Idi Amin 's Uganda , have also reaffirmed what many executives in Hollywood no doubt suspected : African stories , especially African war stories , sell .
They are the cultural news .
Even Starbucks , purveyors of grotesquely oversized corporate cappuccinos , has sensed a commercial opportunity .
The coffee chain has chosen Beah 's memoir as the inaugural title of its new book club .
A Long Way Gone is about to go on sale in all Starbucks in Britain ; in the US , it is already a number one bestseller because of the support of Starbucks , which sponsored Beah 's countrywide reading tour .
As harrowing as it is violent , A Long Way Gone is an odd choice for a sanitised coffee chain .
It begins relatively serenely , with a gentle portrayal of communal life in Beah 's home village .
One day the village is attacked by the Revolutionary United Front , the rebel army that controls Sierra Leone 's diamond mines .
Beah , then 12 , is separated from his family in the ensuing chaos .
Once safe , he first allows himself to believe that a reunion with his family is possible , supported and protected as he is by other displaced boys - in a kind of union of strangers .
Later , however , he discovers that his parents and two brothers are dead ; soon , he is separated from the boys as well , left to wander alone and bereft in the hostile bush , scavenging for food .
He is eventually picked up by government troops in the south - east .
They teach him how to handle an AK - 47 in preparation for his becoming part of a child unit fighting the rebels in the bush .
Beah writes without self - pity of how he became addicted to drugs , ' smoking marijuana and sniffing brown brown , cocaine mixed with gunpowder ' , of how he ransacked villages , murdering innocents as and when he had to ; and of how he learned never to wonder about the old life he left behind .
The first death is the most difficult for him , after which he kills and tortures without remorse .
Beah has no idea how many people he killed .
' I never thought to keep count , ' he told Time magazine .
' We attacked civilians , villagers , anyone the commander deemed was an enemy ; we killed them .
If you thought they maybe aided the rebels , you shot them .
If they withheld food , you shot them . '
In 1998 , he moved to New York to live with a woman called Laura Simms , who worked at the United Nations and had been paying his school fees in Freetown as part of his rehabilitation .
He was 17 .
He attended Oberlin College in Ohio and decided to write a memoir because he knows he has been given a second chance in life , ' a second life even ' , and he wants to bear witness so that others may learn from his experience .
He is tormented by guilty memories , but refuses to give in to them .
' If I choose to feel guilty for what I have done , I will want to be dead myself , ' he says .
He writes with taut , pared - down urgency ; when he tries to inflate his style , the effect can be awkward : ' Sometimes I closed my eyes hard to avoid thinking , but the eye of my mind refused to be closed and continued to plague me with images ...'
At times , too much is described too hastily , so that one narrow escape from death in the bush or raid on rebel positions reads very much like another , rendered in the hectic style of a pulp thriller .
Except that , the story being told here is not a work of overheated imagination : it is painfully , terrifyingly true .
The publisher Fourth Estate is selling A Long Way Gone hard , perhaps overselling it : ' This account is utterly unique - until now there has not been a first - person account of this kind . '
In fact , I read something similar only a couple of years ago , China Keitetsi's Child Soldier , published by the independent Souvenir Press .
Keitetsi fought as a young girl in Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army , which came to power in Uganda in 1985 .
( Paul Kagame , now President of Rwanda , fought alongside Museveni , as did many Uganda - exiled Tutsis who later formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front and , in 1994 , led the liberation of their home country following the genocide in which over a period of 100 days nearly one million people , mostly ethnic Tutsis , were murdered . )
Keitetsi , who lives in Denmark , was repeatedly raped as a soldier and had her first child at the age of 14 .
' For us female soldiers , we had to offer sex to more than five officers in one unit , ' she writes .
' Nearly every evening an officer would come and order you to report to his place , typically at 9 pm ...
I have never been to hell , though I am not always sure .
Where else can such pain belong ?
It was so painful , but I could only cry with my heart , because with tears I could never survive . '
Uzodinma Iweala has just been selected as one of Granta magazine 's Best of Young American Writers .
' It 's important and wonderful that issues such as that of the plight of the child soldiers are being written about and discussed , ' he says of books by Keitetsi , Beah and others .
' If people are encouraged as a result to think more deeply about the historical context for conflict , about the situation about which they are reading as well as the historical context of African writing itself , then that 's all the better . '
There is , however , a problem , what he calls a ' sinister side ' to our fascination with Africa .
' Is this resurgence of interest in Africa and its issues indicative of a genuine desire to see change ? ' he asks .
' Or does it merely reflect that Africa has been centre stage for the past two or three years , even if it is now being edged out by the new celebrity cause of global warming ?'
Iweala is a Nigerian , an Igbo , born and educated in America .
His mother , Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala , was until recently the finance and then foreign minister of Nigeria .
Before that , she was vice - president of the World Bank and returned to Nigeria only on a mission to reduce corruption and introduce economic reforms .
Her son is a child of privilege and opportunity , with an Ivy League education .
So why for his first novel did he choose to speak in such a disturbed voice , as a child of suffering ?
' The sun is dropping down behind the hill like it is not wanting to be seeing us anymore , ' says Agu , the warrior - boy narrator of Beasts of No Nation .
' All we are knowing is that before the war we are children and now we are not . '
In other words , why war ?
Why boy soldiers ?
Stuart Brown , of the Centre of West Africa Studies at the University of Birmingham , has spoken of how so much African writing is ' very serious ' precisely because it has a sense of social responsibility .
' They [ African writers ] do n't see themselves as entertainers in the same sense that American writers do .
African writers feel it is their duty to represent their experiences in their world . '
But Iweala 's experience could not have been more different from those he describes in his novel .
Is he , in one sense , then , writing for a western audience , conforming to what is expected of a novel set in Africa ?
He is silent for a while and then says : ' As African writers we have a compulsion to tell our own stories .
I agree that there can be an expectation for stories about Africa to be about suffering , death and destruction ... but for too long we had to listen to other people , non-Africans , as they attempted to tell our stories . '
The day after we had spoken , I received an email from Iweala .
He had been thinking about what he called the West 's sinister fascination with Africa and why , for all the comfort of his American lifestyle , he had written a novel of such violence , linguistic and thematic .
' If you read articles and watch the BBC you constantly and consistently hear words like ' bloodthirsty ' , ' tribal ' .
And the wars we fight are always ' senseless ' as compared to western wars which I suppose are full of meaning .
Personally I believe all war is senseless .
What I 'm saying is that I wonder if sometimes the fascination with the child soldier or Africa 's wars is one of genuine ' how can we stop this ' or whether it's that same attitude that people have when they pass a gruesome road accident .
' Now if that 's what I think then why did I write about the topic ?
When dealing with a place you have to tell good stories and stories that are not necessarily so pleasant .
Why I and others like me who have written and will write about such a subject is to humanise rather than dehumanise as the press and common stereotypes often do .
In my book - and in Beah 's book , and the others that have come before - there is much more focus on the internal state of the child soldier .
We are attempting to understand why any human would be put in this situation or how any human would behave in this situation .
I and I think others who write about the subject are committed to doing that through our work .
Interestingly , when I started researching for my novel , I was reading about child soldiers around the world not just in Africa .
In the former Yugoslavia , Chechnya , South Asia ...'
The most celebrated of the current batch of boy soldier narratives is , perhaps inevitably , What Is the What by the bestselling memoirist , novelist and literary entrepreneur Dave Eggers .
Iweala is one of several of the new generation of African novelists to have endorsed the Eggers book - published here at the end of next month - with a cover quote .
What Is the What is a curious hybrid .
It is at once a gripping , fast - paced adventure story - there are gun battles , people are eaten by crocodiles , and so on - and a more ruminative , coming - of - age narrative .
It is a biography as well as a work of fiction , with invented scenes and characters .
It is a book about America as much as it's a book about Africa - the novel begins with Deng being attacked and tied up in his Atlanta apartment by African - American raiders , who mock his accent and call him , pejoratively , ' Africa ' .
Eggers has spoken of how he wanted to write a conventional biography , to tell Achak Deng 's story straight .
' I did n't want my voice in there . '
In the end , he opted , perhaps because of the difficulty of his self - imposed task , to become a kind of ventriloquist .
He inhabits a role , and presumes to speak through Deng as if he were him .
He need not have worried about indulging too much in an act of self - display , because his voice is n't really in there at all ; the voice in which the fictional Deng tells his story has a flat , parable - like simplicity , simultaneously monotonous , innocent and beguiling .
It 's the voice of a hundred fairytales .
And he speaks in the same measured tone throughout what is a 500 - page novel , a formidable feat of consistency and control .
' In many cases , the Lost Boys of Sudan have no one else , ' the fictional Achak tells us , beginning another of his long internal monologues .
' The Lost Boys is not a nickname appreciated by many among our ranks , but it is apt enough .
We fled or were sent from our homes , many of us orphaned , and thousands of us wandered through deserts and forests for what seemed like years .
In many ways we are alone and in most cases we are unsure of where exactly we 're going . '
As a boy - aged no more than about six - Valentino Achak Deng was separated from his family when his village of Marial Bai in southern Sudan came under attack from Islamist Arab militia on horseback , the murahaleen .
That was during what is now known as the second Sudanese civil war , from 1983 to 2005 .
( As for what is happening now in Darfur , western Sudan - the violence , the expulsions , the mass killing - if it is not a continuation of the same civil war , it is certainly genocide . )
Once adrift from his family , Achak , an ethnic Dinka , begins to wander lost and hungry with other similarly bereaved boys .
Together in ever - increasing numbers they begin the monumental trek north to Ethiopia , where they have been told they will find safety and comfort , ' in the place that is ' , as well as one day having the possibility of being reunited with their families , if their families are not dead already .
Deng , who is now 25 and a student at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania , eventually arrived in America in 2001 , having spent a decade at the Kakuma camp in Kenya , what he describes as ' one of the largest and most remote refugee camps in the world ' .
He was brought to America by a charity called the Lost Boys Foundation and once there he was introduced to Eggers , to whom , as he writes in the preface to What Is the What , he told his story orally over the course of many years .
Eggers then ' concocted this novel , approximating my voice and using the basic events of my life as the foundation ' .
Why did n't Achak Deng write his own story , as Ishmael Beah has ?
If he did n't have the confidence to write it himself , as Beah did , he could have hired an experienced ghost writer to do it for him .
But perhaps such questions are glib ; perhaps he was simply too caught up in the knots and entanglements of his own story .
Perhaps only a writer with the patience , empathy and artistry of Eggers could have fully unravelled it for him .
After all , Eggers himself is a kind of lost boy ; his bestselling memoir , A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius , tells of how the death of his parents while he was at college left him and his sister alone , with the responsibility of caring for their seven - year - old brother .
Deng has granted Eggers an unusual freedom , the freedom to recast his life in fiction .
The result is a deeply affecting , if problematic work .
Its chief selling point and the source of much of its considerable pathos is the claim it makes to truth - to be telling the truth , in broad outline , of the terrors of the civil war in Sudan as well as the truth , in detailed particularity , of one man 's suffering and quest for redemption in America .
There is a moment , early in A Long Way Gone , when Ishmael Beah , in flight from rebel attack , describes arriving in a village in the company of a group of boys .
This is before he has become a soldier , before his fall into annihilation and despair .
Beah loves American rap music and carries cassettes of his favourite artists with him at all times .
But on arriving in the village he is searched and his rap cassettes are confiscated .
The village chief demands to know what kind of music is rap .
' It is similar to telling parables , ' Beah replies , ' but in the white man 's language . '
In their own different ways , Eggers and Deng , Beah and Iweala , and even China Keitetsi ( whose book was published first in Danish before being translated into many languages ) , are all telling parables , parables of loss , flight and renewal , not in the white man 's language , but in a style and idiom that is entirely their own .
Absent from their books are the grand , melodramatic generalisations about Africa that are such a feature of so much work by western writers about the continent - written in what might be called the standard white man 's language .
Here , for instance , is Peter Godwin , from his recent memoir about Zimbabwe , When a Crocodile Eats the Sun : ' Most of us struggle in life to maintain the illusion of control , but in Africa that illusion is almost impossible to maintain .
I always have the sense there that there is no equilibrium , that everything teeters on the brink of some dramatic change [ in Africa ] , that society constantly stands poised for some spasm , some tsunami in which you can do nothing but hope to bob up to the surface and not be sucked out into a dark and hungry sea . '
The stories of Ishmael Beah , Achak Deng and the Lost Boys featured in God Grew Tired of Us are each related in long retrospective , from positions of relative safety in America .
They are stories of departure and of arrival - in a new land , with new aspirations .
They are also about the process of memory , of what and how we choose to remember and what we would rather forget , if only we could .
When Beah describes his most brutal experiences as a soldier in the bush his language inevitably contracts ; it reduces , becomes perfunctory .
As the novelist William Boyd has smartly observed : ' The horror is duly registered , but its vagueness and generality do n't add up to moments of lived personal history . '
It is as if such moments of horror can only be described in the sketchiest of details ; to recall them otherwise would be beyond perhaps what is possible .
It would be , as it were , to relive them all over again .
' Forgiveness is actually an important part of healing from the war for me , ' Beah says .
' To forgive is not to forget but to transform all that happened into something positive because the other route can only bring more suffering to me and those around me . '
You hope that writing his book has brought him a release from suffering .
As for the other countless lost boys and kids - at - arms who have survived wars but have never made it out of Africa , you would like to believe that one day they , too , will be able to find a kind of peace .
Child soldiers : the facts
Human Rights
Watch estimates there are up to 300,000 child ( under - 18 ) soldiers worldwide , located in 36 countries , including Iraq , Colombia , Ethiopia and Russia .
Numbers of child soldiers have risen as small , easy - to - use automatic guns have become more widely available .
In some countries , such as Nepal , Sri Lanka and Uganda , more than a third of child soldiers are girls .
Many are addicted to hard drugs , which they are given to make them more courageous in battle .
They are often forced to commit atrocities against their family so that they can't return home .
A 2002 UN optional protocol raised the minimum age for recruiting soldiers from 15 to 18 .
The UK government is among 110 countries to have ratified it , but says it would still use under - 18s if there was ' a genuine military need ' .

The CIA has declined to comment on claims of a covert prison network
" We do not torture , " Mr Bush told reporters during a visit to Panama .
He said enemies were plotting to hurt the US and his government would pursue them , but would do so " under the law " .
Meanwhile , the US Supreme Court has allowed a legal challenge to the Bush administration 's use of military tribunals for foreign detainees .
The court will decide whether a former driver for Osama Bin Laden , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , can be tried for war crimes before military officers in Guantanamo Bay .
Correspondents say the case will be a major test of the US government 's wartime powers .
' Country at war '
The White House has not confirmed Washington Post claims that the CIA set up a covert prison network in eastern Europe and Asia to hold high - profile terror suspects following the 11 September 2001 attacks .
About 30 detainees , considered major terrorism suspects , were held at these " black sites " , although the centres have now been closed , the paper reported .
On Sunday , the United Nations ' special rapporteur on torture urged European officials to conduct high - level investigations into the allegations .
" We are finding terrorists and bringing them to justice , " Mr Bush said at a joint news conference with Panamanian President Martin Torrijos .
" Our country is at war and our government has the obligation to protect the American people , " Mr Bush said .
" Any activity we conduct is within the law . "
The Senate has passed legislation banning torture , but the Bush administration is seeking an exemption for the CIA spy agency .
" We do not torture and therefore we 're working with Congress to make sure that as we go forward , we make it more possible to do our job , " Mr Bush said .
Bin Laden driver
The Supreme Court has agreed to review an appeals court ruling that Mr Hamdan could be tried by a military tribunal .
The court will hear arguments in the case in March or April , with a decision expected by June .
Mr Hamdan , from Yemen , is accused of conspiracy to commit war crimes , including terrorism .
A judge halted his trial last year , saying it could not proceed until a decision had been made on whether he was a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions .
Mr Hamdan contested his status as " enemy combatant " , and his lawyers were seeking to force US authorities to try him in a civilian court , arguing that the military tribunals were illegal under US law .
Mr Hamdan worked for Bin Laden in Afghanistan from 1997 until the US attack in Afghanistan in 2001 .
He denies being a member of al - Qaeda .
Bernard Robertson and Tony Vignaux
In R v Adams the prosecution gave evidence of the results of a DNA test .
The witness gave that evidence in the form of a likelihood ratio .
The defence the produced Professor Donnely who explained to the jury how to combine that evidence with other evidence in the case ( which all pointed away from the accused 's guilt ) .
The correct way to do this , of course , is by applying Bayes ' Theorem .
This was accepted by a Bench presided over by the Lord Chief Justice in R v Deen ( CA , 21 December 1993 ) .
Professor Donnelly then went further and explained to the jurors how they could use Bayes '
Theorem to combine each of the other items of evidence in the case with each other .
When the case went on appeal , the Court of Appeal ( Rose LJ , Hidden and Buxton JJ ) said that they had not heard argument about this and could not ' express a concluded view on the matter ' .
Nonetheless they had ' very grave doubt as to whether that evidence was properly admissible ' .
The Court in Adams doubted the admissibility of the evidence because it seemed to trespass " on an area peculiarly and exclusively within the province of the jury , namely the way in which they evaluate the relationship between one piece of evidence and another " .
This raises some basic issues to which we shall return .
Had the Court stopped at this point all might have been well .
Unfortunately the reasons that their Lordships gave for this view were , it is respectfully submitted , the wrong ones .
The Court did admit that " Bayes Theorem may be an appropriate and useful tool for statisticians and other experts seeking to establish a mathematical assessment of probability " .
This statement is ambiguous .
The word ' mathematical ' here could refer simply to the appearance of precision , or it could imply a qualitative difference between ' mathematical probability ' and other probability .
We would reject the latter proposition .
There is only one kind of uncertainty and there is only way of measuring uncertainty .
That is called probability ; the only logical way to reason in a state of uncertainty is in accordance with the axioms of probability .
The Court then made a number of detailed observations with which we deal in turn .
the theorem can only operate by giving to each separate piece of evidence a numerical percentage representing the ratio between the probability of circumstance A and the probability of circumstance B granted the existence of that evidence .
Two quibbles .
First , probabilities may be expressed in percentages , but a likelihood ratio is just a number : it can not be a percentage .
Secondly , in the last part of this sentence their Lordships have transposed the conditional , the error discussed in R v Deen .
A likelihood ratio is the ratio between the probability of the evidence given circumstance A and circumstance B .
It describes the strength of the evidence in distinguishing between proposition A and proposition B .
What their Lordships have described is the posterior odds that the Court is trying to assess .
But the major point is that once these corrections are made this is a correct statement about Bayes '
Theorem which is neutral in effect .
The percentages chosen are matters of judgement : that is inevitable .
But the apparently objective numerical figures used in the theorem may conceal the element of judgement on which it entirely depends .
One would hope that these ' judgements ' would be made in the same way that all assessments of probability should be made , rationally and by reference to the evidence .
The figures given are merely expressions of strength of belief .
Any system for expressing strength of belief must comply with some simple rules such as :
( a ) if I believe that A is more likely to be true than B and that B is more likely to be true than C , I must believe that A is more likely to be true than A ; and
( b ) equivalent levels of belief are expressed equivalently and divergent levels of belief expressed divergently .
Not only are numbers a convenient way of achieving this , but it can be shown that any system of expressing strength of belief which complies with these rules can be reduced to numbers .
the theorems methodology requires , as we have described , that items of evidence be assessed separately according to their bearing on the accuseds guilt , before being combined in the overall formula
This is correct only up to a point .
At some point in the deliberative process items of evidence have to examined separately , indeed it is hard to see how a body of evidence can be rationally assessed without some dissection .
When an item of evidence is examined however , it must be considered in the light of the evidence already considered .
This leads to the criticism of bayesian reasoning that the interdependencies of the items of evidence make the process far too complex .
There are several answers to that .
One is that all Bayes '
Theorem does is make obvious complexities which exist in reality .
It is hard to understand how decision making can be improved by deliberately ignoring them .
Secondly , the idea that a jury sits in Court with a pre set ' prior probability ' , computes a likelihood ratio for each item of evidence and then combines them one by one is an unhelpful model .
The jury considers the evidence when it has withdrawn .
By that stage a large amount of evidence will have been accepted as true and the dispute will have narrowed down to a choice between two or three well - defined stories .
At this point the jury 's deliberation begins .
The jury only has seriously to consider evidence which is genuinely in dispute and which distinguishes between disputed alternatives .
This enormously reduces the problem of complexity .
That in our view is far too rigid an approach to evidence of the type that a jury characteristically has to assess , where the cogency of ( for instance ) identification evidence may have to be assessed , at least in part , in the light of the strength of the chain of evidence of which it forms part .
Where an item of evidence is genuinely part of a chain , it must be considered in that light and bayesian reasoning explains in formal terms how that is done .
Clearly , an identification is affected by the Turnbull factors and these are to be considered when assessing the strength of the identification as evidence .
If , however , the Court was referring here to the rule that a weak identification is treated differently according to whether or not there is supporting evidence , bayesian reasoning reveals this as illogical .
The appropriate analogy when an identification and supporting evidence are considered is not a chain but a rope composed of several strands .
The strength of one strand may affect the strength of the whole rope but it cannot affect the strength of another particular strand .
The rule in Turnbull that a weak identification should only go to the jury if there is supporting evidence amounts only to saying that a weak identification can go to the jury if the case is otherwise strong and not if it is otherwise weak .
Jurors evaluate evidence and reach a conclusion not by means of a formula , mathematical or otherwise , but by the joint application of their individual common sense and knowledge of the world to the evidence before them .
But what does this mean ?.
Bayes '
Theorem is merely the formal expression of how one applies common sense and knowledge of the world to the evidence .
It makes clear whether evidence can be regarded as strengthening or weakening a case .
While Bayes '
Theorem is not the only tool provided by Bayesian reasoning , any analysis that does not comply with Bayesian principles is illogical and wrong .
Few ' bayesian lawyers ' argues that jurors should consciously apply Bayes '
Theorem to each item of evidence as Professor Donnelly appears to have recommended .
But whenever a Judge instructs a jury in how to consider evidence or an appeal Court rules on how facts are to be thought about , these instructions must be consistent with logic and reason , the formal expression of which is bayesian formulae .
The obvious analogy is that the instructions that a parent gives when teaching a child how to ride a bicycle must conform to the laws of mechanics ; but there is no need to have any conscious knowledge of mechanics before one can successfully teach a child to ride a bicycle .
Scientific evidence tendered as proof of a particular fact may establish that fact to an extent which , in any particular case , may vary between slight possibility and virtual certainty .
For example , different blood spots on an accuseds clothing may , on testing , reveal a range of conclusions from human blood via possibly the victims blood to highly likely to be the victims blood .
Unfortunately there is a major misunderstanding here .
For decades scientists have given evidence in this form , especially in paternity cases .
The result is that the Courts have become used to hearing this kind of evidence , and become puzzled when the scientfic evidence appears to establish a fact to a virtual certainty but there is cogent non-scientific evidence pointing the other way .
In fact there is no logical way of combining such a statement with the remainder of the evidence in the case , which is itself sufficient reason for rejecting it .
The evidence in Adams was not given in this way , but lawyers have become so used to hearing this kind of statement that when evidence is correctly given , as it was in Adams , they hear it incorrectly , as evidenced by their Lordships ' transposition of the conditional pointed out above .
In fact a scientist who expresses a conclusion of this sort usurps the role of the jury to a greater , and more insidious , extent than Professor Donnelly may have done .
The assessment of a posterior probability , which a statement such as ' highly likely to be the victims blood  is , requires the assessment of a prior probability .
In paternity cases this has arbitrarily been treated as 0.5 , but there is no warrant for this .
The prior probability depends upon the other evidence in the case and is a matter for the jury .
Professor Donnelly 's sin was to make his assumptions and reasoning transparent , whereas the Court appears illogically content with expressions which conceal the expert 's assumptions .
Individual jurors might differ greatly not only according to how cogent they found a particular piece of evidence ( which would be a matter for discussion and debate between the jury as a whole ) , but also on the question of what percentage figure for probability should be placed on that evidence .
Again , the reference here should be to a likelihood ratio and not to a ' percentage figure for probability ' .
That apart , this statement appears to be tautological .
Two people who disagree on the strength of a item of evidence will naturally disagree on its likelihood ratio .
An important point however , is that the process of constructing a likelihood ratio will make clear why two people disagree .
At the end of an argument structured in this way one or both may wish to change their view of the evidence .
different jurors might well wish to select different numerical figures even when they were broadly agreed on the weight of the evidence in question .
This would , of course , make perfect sense if means is that jurors only agree broadly and not precisely about the strength of the evidence .
If two people agree that a piece of evidence is ' very strong ' they must both presumably accord it a likelihood ratio higher than a piece of evidence they are agreed is only ' strong ' and so forth .
They could , presumably , only resolve any such difference by taking an average , which would truly reflect neither partys view ; and this point leaves aside the even greater difficulty of how twelve jurors , applying Bayes as a single jury , are to reconcile , under the mathematics of that formula , differing individual view about the cogency of particular pieces of evidence .
At this point , it is respectfully submitted , their Lordships are wrong in law .
The only matter on which the jury is required to be unanimous is that " the the prosecution [ has ] prove [ d ] the charge it makes beyond reasonable doubt . "
Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ 1942 ] AC 1 ( HL ) per Viscount Simon LC at 11 .
The jury are not required to be unanimous as to how the offence was committed .
This was regarded as ' clear beyond argument ' by the Court of Appeal in Attorney General 's Reference ( No 4 of 1980 ) [ 1981 ]
2 All ER 617 .
A more dramatic example is the Supreme Court of Canada 's upholding the verdict in Thatcher v The Queen ( 1987 ) 39 DLR ( 4th ) 275 in which the prosecution told two mutually inconsistent stories .
Likewise the jurors are not required to agree on the evidential route by which they reach their individual verdicts .
As Turner J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal put it in Thomas v. The Queen [ 1972 ] NZLR 34 , at 41 :
It is of course inherent in the process of conviction by jury that the jury must be convinced as a whole , and each member must be convinced individually , beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused .
This necessarily extends to every essential element of the crime charge ... it does not logically follow that each of the members of the jury must base his or her individual conclusion upon the same reasoning as the others .
Different members may individually be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused , by their individual acceptance of different facts .
( emphasis in original )
A fortiori , where they reach their verdicts on the basis of the same facts there is no requirement for jurors to be precisely agreed on the strength of any particular item of evidence .
to introduce Bayes Theorem , or any similar method , into a criminal trial plunges the jury into inappropriate and unnecessary realms of theory and complexity deflecting them from their proper task .
It may indeed plunge the jury into unnecessary realms of theory and complexity , but it can hardly be described as a deflection from their proper task .
Bayes '
Theorem constitutes not a deflection from this task but a formalisation of it , a formalisation which , we would agree may not always be necessary or helpful to a juror , but which is the only appropriate yardstick for those , such as appeal Courts and academics , who judge Judges .
There is arguably a much simpler and more compelling reason why experts should not give evidence on how jurors should combine non-scientific evidence using Bayes ' Theorem .
If such evidence were admissible in Adams it would be admissible in every single criminal case .
While this might be good for those qualified to give the evidence , this would not do anything for the cost - effectiveness of the criminal justice system .
In fact it is doubtful whether an explanation of Bayesian reasoning is ' evidence ' at all .
It is merely a detailed analysis of common sense .
A Judge might in a particular case wish to hear a detailed explanation , but would then be hearing a witness in order to take judicial notice of a matter , not taking evidence .
Such instruction could be included in counsel 's closing addresses to the jury and in the Judge 's summing up since Judges are required to instruct the jury on how to consider the evidence .
We have always favoured expert witnesses explaining the effect of the likelihood ratio by saying words to the effect of " whatever you consider the odds of guilt are on the basis of the other evidence , my evidence should cause you to multiply those odds X fold " .
This makes it clear that the witnesses are giving an opinion only on the strength of their own particular evidence and not of the case as a whole and also stresses that scientific evidence must be considered in combination with the other evidence in the case .
The ground for quashing the conviction was that the Judge 's summing up concentrated on Bayes ' Theorem
without indicating to the jury the more commonsense and basic ways in which it would have been open to them to weigh up the relative weight of the DNA evidence . . . [ the jurors ] were left by the summing up with no other sufficient guidance as to how to evaluate the prosecution case . . . in the light of the other non-DNA evidence in the case .
The defence case , however , was not that the DNA evidence should be weighed relative to the other evidence but that it should be combined with it .
Apart from this point the Court of Appeal fail to explain what these ' more commonsense and basic ways ' are .
If it had attempted to explain it would have faced an insuperable difficulty .
The guidance could either be meaningless waffle or it could have some content .
Such content would either have to conform to the requirements of bayesian reasoning or be illogical and wrong .
We understand that Adams has now been retried in the Crown Court .
Prosecution and defence agreed a method of explaining the application of Bayes ' Theorem to the jury .
We are told that the experts concerned may be publishing a paper explaining what occurred .

“ Based on our understanding of the Iranian system and the history of I.R.G.C. operations , the intelligence community assesses that activity this extensive on the part of the Quds Force would not be conducted without approval from top leaders in Iran , ” a senior intelligence official said , referring to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
Intelligence officials have cast this view as an “ assessment , ” a logical inference based on years of studying the Revolutionary Guard .
But some senior American officials are hesitant to make this deductive leap .
Twice during his recent trip through Asia , Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , broke with military officials in Baghdad and said he was not ready to conclude that Iran ’s top leaders were behind the attacks .
During a stopover in Jakarta , Indonesia , General Pace told reporters that American forces had confirmed that some bomb materials found inside Iraq were made in Iran , but “ that does not translate that the Iranian government , per se , for sure , is directly involved in doing this , ” he said , The Associated Press reported .
There is a larger lesson about the way intelligence analysis is carried out .
Intelligence officials say that while forensic analysis can determine how a weapon is engineered and where its components are manufactured , the hardest task they face is discerning the strategy and intent of a hostile government .
Last month , Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said during an interview that the United States still had far too few intelligence resources inside Iran to draw any conclusions about the intent of senior Iranian leaders .
South Africa has blamed Britain for the deepening crisis in Zimbabwe by accusing the UK of leading a campaign to " strangle " the beleaguered African state 's economy and saying it has a " death wish " against a negotiated settlement that might leave Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF in power .
According to a South African government document circulating among diplomats ahead of a regional summit this week , President Thabo Mbeki will paint an optimistic picture of his efforts to broker an agreement between Mr Mugabe and the Zimbabwean opposition .
But the document , a draft of the report the South African president is expected to present at the meeting , says Britain remains a significant obstacle by spearheading sanctions that Mr Mugabe blames for his country 's economic collapse .
" The most worrisome thing is that the UK continues to deny its role as the principal protagonist in the Zimbabwean issue and is persisting with its activities to isolate Zimbabwe , " the report says .
" None of the western countries that have imposed the sanctions that are strangling Zimbabwe 's economy have shown any willingness to lift them . "
Britain pressed the European Union to impose " targeted sanctions " against Zimbabwe 's leadership by refusing visas , freezing bank accounts and other measures that the UK said were aimed at individuals without harming Zimbabweans .
But Mr Mugabe has blamed what he describes as the " illegal sanctions " for the economic collapse and said his government is a victim of British imperialism because it seized white - owned farms for redistribution to poor blacks .
His opponents say the crisis is the result of a brutal strategy to hold on to power by violently suppressing the opposition , rigging elections and trying to buy support by seizing the farms .
This last move devastated the tobacco export industry that provided Zimbabwe with much of its foreign earnings .
The wholesale printing of money helped fuel inflation now estimated to be running at about 20,000 % .
Shops are virtually empty of basic foodstuffs .
Some African leaders have been willing to criticise Mr Mugabe , although a Zambian opposition leader , Michael Sata , urged the region 's leaders to " join hands and launch strong protests against attempts by the west to recolonise Zimbabwe " .
The South African report describes the crisis as " Zimbabwe 's bilateral dispute with Britain " .
However , the focus of Mr Mbeki 's efforts is to reach an agreement between Mr Mugabe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ahead of elections next year .
Mr Mbeki has not had a smooth ride .
Mr Mugabe 's two negotiators , both cabinet ministers , failed to arrive for talks in South Africa last month .
The ministers , Nicholas Goche and Patrick Chinamasa , finally arrived in Pretoria a week ago .
The document says some issues , including constitutional reforms , have been " worked out " .
" There are strong indications that the two sides are sliding towards an agreement , " it says .
But MDC sources say that agreement is not near and they suspect that Mr Mugabe is playing for time until the end of the year when the focus will shift to the presidential election campaign .
Meanwhile , the economic crisis is expected to deepen .
More than 3 million Zimbabweans have left the country in search of work .
We win !!!

Yesterday I watched the last episode of “ Gilmore Girls ” .
One of my favorite TV - series – over .
Then a friend sent me a link to a site that said that there will be no 4th season of “ Veronica Mars ” .
That kinda pissed me off .
After that – to follow the theme of the day – I read that “ Jericho ” is also over .
When I was young , I watched stuff like “ The A - Team ” .
When I got older , I watched “ Picket Fences ” and “ Profit ” , which is still my favorite TV - series .
Then came “ Buffy ” & “ Angel ” .
Today there are at least 15 shows I watch – Yes , I ’m an addict and I love it .
Do you notice something in this list ?
Keep in mind the fact that I ’m German .
Exactly – I did n’t mention one German TV - show .
Why ?
Because German TV - series in general suck !
There are probably one or two pearls in this pile of dirt , but that ’s it .
What is your secret ?
It ca n’t be the gigantic budget .
Shows like “ 24 ” or “ Rome ” might cost a lot to produce , but something like “ How I met your mother ” ?
The Abundance of great actors ?
I do n’t think so .
There are a lot of them , no doubt about that , but I would n’t bet on a David Schwimmer block buster anytime soon .
So what makes your shows so much better than ours ?
The screen writers ?
Technology ?
The way they ’re produced ?
I ’ve got no idea .
But I hope you will continue to make them .
I ’m an addict , remember ?
Some of you may recall reports from Iraq which described the egregious tactic of US troops kidnapping the family members of detainees in order to “ assist ” the interrogation process .
At the time we were informed this was a only a limited effort , and that all such family members detained were people who were known to be guilty of aiding the insurgents .
As we know all too well by now , such “ official ” remarks are often a flat out lie to cover up systematic abuses .
Salon ’s David Benjamin has a story up that reveals the use of kidnapping family members of detainees in Iraq by US forces is the standard operating procedure for many interrogations :
July 14 , 2006 | Congress has demanded that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld hand over a raft of documents to Congress that could substantiate allegations that U.S. forces have tried to break terror suspects by kidnapping and mistreating their family members .
Rumsfeld has until 5 p.m. Friday to comply .
It now appears that kidnapping , scarcely covered by the media , and absent in the major military investigations of detainee abuse , may have been systematically employed by U.S. troops .
Salon has obtained Army documents that show several cases where U.S. forces abducted terror suspects ’ families .
After he was thrown in prison , Cpl. Charles Graner , the alleged ringleader at Abu Ghraib , told investigators the military routinely kidnapped family members to force suspects to turn themselves in .
Yes , there ’s nothing like the threat of having your daughter or wife raped by American soldiers to loosen one ’s tongue .
Why , I ’d say anything they wanted me to say , I ’d sign any confession put before me , if my wife or daughter was in the hands of foreign troops who had occupied my country .
It might not bear any relation to reality , but at that point I could care less .
Protecting my child or wife would be all that I cared about .
And what works with daughters and wives can work equally as well with sons :
( cont . )
In a hearing before Shays ’ Government Reform subcommittee last February , Provance testified that the Army had retaliated against him .
Provance also made the disturbing allegation that interrogators broke an Iraqi general , Hamid Zabar , by imprisoning and abusing his frail 16 - year - old son .
Waxman was shocked .
“ Do you think this practice was repeated with other children ? ” he asked Provance .
“ I do n’t see why it would not have been , sir , ” Provance replied .
Zabar ’s son had been apprehended with his father and held at Abu Ghraib , though the boy had n’t done anything wrong .
“ He was useless , ” Provance said about the boy in a phone interview with Salon from Heidelberg , Germany , where he is still in the Army .
“ He was of no intelligence value . ”
But , Provance said , interrogators grew frustrated when the boy ’s father , Zabar , would n’t talk , despite a 14 - hour interrogation .
So they stripped Zabar ’s son naked and doused him with mud and water .
They put him in the open back of a truck and drove around in the frigid January night air until the boy began to freeze .
Zabar was then made to look at his suffering son .
Naturally , steps have been taken to give the higher ups “ plausible deniability . ”
There is no paper trail that shows that kidnapping or abusing the family of suspects might have been official Department of Justice or Pentagon policy .
It is not mentioned in any of the Bush administration interrogation memos that have so far surfaced in the press .
In late 2002 , commanders at the military prison at Guantánamo Bay did request authority , during interrogations , for “ the use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequence are imminent for him and / or his family . ”
In a December 2002 memorandum , Rumsfeld rejected a “ blanket approval ” of that interrogation technique , but did not rule it out completely .
I really do n’t have much to add .
This is despicable , and a deep stain on our nation .
Yet , can anyone argue that this step was not inevitable once George Bush declared his “ War on Terror ? ”
When you vow to fight the “ terrorists ” with the “ gloves off ” this is what happens : you begin to emulate the worst despots and the most criminal regimes on the planet .
You view even the most heinous measures as necessary to combat your enemy , even those that were previously considered beyond the pale .
You violate every law and standard of decency in pursuit of of an ever more nebulous victory .
In short , you become the evil you first meant to oppose .
This is what America stands for in the 21st Century : the torture of innocent children to make their fathers confess .
We ’ve fallen a long way in a short time , have n’t we ?

VERSAILLES , France , June 25 —
For much of the last three years visitors to the Château de Versailles have had good reason to feel disappointed :
The Hall of Mirrors , the palace ’s most glittering jewel , has been undergoing extensive restoration , with only about half of its 220 - foot - long gallery visible at any one time .
This week , after a $ 16 million makeover , the full spectacle finally resumed , with the hall looking , as closely as possible , the way it first appeared to Louis XIV in 1684 .
With its 357 mirrors , 17 glass doors , marble walls , chandeliers and ceiling paintings , it remains — as was the Sun King ’s intent — a sight breathtaking in its majesty .
Yet the hall is not as good as new .
Time has left its marks , and while these are not evident to most visitors , experts know where the nips and tucks are hidden .
Describing the gallery as “ a dazzling old lady , ” Frédéric Didier , the chief architect overseeing France ’s historical monuments , said , “ All the wrinkles in her face tell a story . ”
Still , while repairs to the hall were ordered within 15 years of its opening , this is the first time in more than three centuries that it has been cleaned and restored from top to bottom : from the 30 paintings by Charles Le Brun that decorate the length of the vaulted ceiling to the 8,460 square feet of parquet flooring .
A great theme of travel photography is the capturing of weird and wacky signs .

Estonia says many state websites have been affected
Many of the attacks have come from Russia and are being hosted by Russian state computer servers , Tallinn says .
Moscow denies any involvement .
Estonia says the attacks began after it moved a Soviet war memorial in Tallinn .
The move was condemned by the Kremlin .
A Nato spokesman said the organisation was giving Estonia technical help .
" In the 21st century it 's not just about tanks and artillery , " Nato spokesman James Appathurai told BBC News .
" We have sent one of our experts at the request of the Estonian authorities to help them in their defence . "
' Paperless government '
Estonia wants to put the issue at the top of Friday 's EU - Russia summit agenda .
The [ hacking ] principle is very simple - you just send a shed load of requests simultaneously
Anton Nossik
Russian internet pioneer
The pirates hitting Estonia
The head of IT security at Estonia 's defence ministry , Mikhail Tammet , told BBC News that the attacks had affected a range of government websites , including those of the parliament and governmental institutions .
He said the country was particularly vulnerable as much of its government was run online .
" Estonia depends largely on the internet .
We have e-government , government is so - called paperless ... all the bank services are on the internet .
We even elect our parliament via the internet , " Mr Tammet said .
The memorial 's removal also triggered riots amongst mostly ethnic Russian living in Estonia , during which one person was killed and more than 150 injured .
Estonians say the memorial symbolised Soviet occupation of the Baltic state .
Russians say it is a tribute to those who fought the Nazis .
Spam avalanche
The Estonian government says its state and commercial websites - including a number of banks - are being bombarded by mass requests for information - overwhelming their computer servers .
Targets of the so - called denial - of - service attacks have also included the Estonian foreign and defence ministries and leading newspapers and banks .
In some cases , officials have simply blocked access to the servers from outside Estonia , to prevent them from being attacked .
" A couple weeks ago when the whole thing started we had some problems in our online services and then our mail server was absolutely inundated with spam e-mails as well , " Estonian journalist Aet Suvari told the BBC .
" In the past few weeks it has been quite difficult for some government officials to read their e-mails on the web , to get access to the banks . "
The defence ministry says that the cyber attacks come from all over the world , but some have been hosted by Russian state servers .
It says that instructions on how to carry out cyber warfare are circulating in Russian on Russian websites .
Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip has directly accused Russia of being responsible , pointing the blame at the Russian government .
Nato and EU internet experts are all helping to track down the culprits , but Estonian officials say that they have had no co-operation from Russia .
' Internet pioneer '
While technical experts say that the initial wave of attacks came from official structures in Russia , they now say it might be very difficult to track the perpetrators down , the BBC's Steven Eke says .

Russia - which has a large community of hackers and computer virus - writers - has been accused of mounting such attacks before in the US and Ukraine .
Moscow denies any involvement in the internet attacks on Estonia .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC that the allegations were " completely untrue " .
British condom maker Futura Medical Plc said on Thursday that results of a study showed its new condom helped men have firmer and bigger erections , as well as a longer - lasting sexual experience .
Shares in the company , which specialises in sexual healthcare and pain relief , rose 14.5 per cent to 59.25 pence on hopes the condom , which will be marketed by Durex condom - maker SSL International , could go on sale next year .
Futura said the study of 108 healthy couples showed its CSD500 condom helped men to get a firmer erection compared with a standard condom , increased penis size and made the sexual experience last longer , delivering statistically significant results .
The annual crime statistics released by the Home Office reveal an apparent 5 % rise in violent crime , 10 % rise in vandalism and a 3 % increase in robbery in 2006 / 07 .
But the increases are matched by continuing falls in burglary , car crime and sex offences .
Home Office criminologists portrayed Britain as becoming a " less violent nation " with half a million fewer violent crime victims than in 1995 - a fall of 45 % .
They insisted yesterday that the 5 % rise in violent crime recorded by the BCS was " not statistically significant " .
Their claims are supported by a fall in the murder rate to its lowest level for eight years with 755 homicides , and a 13 % fall in gun crime according to the police .
Death by dangerous driving however is becoming an increasing problem with a record 462 killed this way last year .
The first official figures on the impact of the change in pub opening hours also suggests that the predictions of " murder and mayhem " that accompanied its introduction have not been borne out .
But they do show a slight increase - of just under 7,000 - to 940,000 offences in the volume of violent disorder , criminal damage and harassment committed between 6 pm and 6 am in the 12 months following the change in the licensing laws , suggesting that a " cafe culture " is still a long way away in Britain 's late - night city centres .
The figures also show a rise in the number of offences - up 10,000 to 57,000 - committed between 3 am and 6 am reflecting the increased number of people , including police , about at that time .
But it remains only a small proportion - 4 % - of the total amount of violent crime , disorder and criminal damage recorded .
The volume of more serious violence committed has actually fallen since the drinking hours changed .
The two sets of figures published yesterday - crime recorded by the police and the British Crime Survey based on interviews with 40,000 people about their experience of crime - show that the overall crime rate remains broadly stable .
The police say crime fell by 2 % while BCS suggests it rose by 3 % .
The risk of becoming a victim of crime is 24 % - one in four - compared with 40 % in 1995 .
The most likely target of a violent attack is a young man under 21 living in one of the most deprived social areas , followed by students and the unemployed .
Those who live in " up and coming " or " improving " areas also have a higher than average risk of being a crime victim if they live next to a high crime hotspot .
The BCS confirms that although the elderly have the highest fear of crime they are the least likely to become a victim although they will suffer disproportionately if they are attacked .
Concerns about antisocial behaviour are fuelled by the 10 % increase in vandalism recorded in the past year .
Overall the public 's fear of crime has continued to fall , lagging a little behind the actual reduction in crime over the past 10 years .
Nevertheless they still believe crime is rising in Britain [ 65 % ] and in their local neighbourhood [ 41 % ] .
The annual crime figures also cast some light on the debate over whether to reclassify cannabis as a class B drug .
The BCS figures show illicit drug use is now at its lowest level since 1995 with the proportion of 16 - to 24 - year - olds who have smoked cannabis in the last year falling from 28 % in 1997 to 21 % this year .
Professor Paul Wiles , the chief Home Office statistician , said the 9 % rise in cannabis possession offences to 130,000 incidents reflected the police 's ability to hand out warnings to users since the drug had been downgraded to class C. Before the change the police would have had to arrest the offender for possession and process them at the police station .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , claimed the figures showed that crime had fallen by a third since Labour came to power in 1997 .
She acknowledged that knife crime remains a concern as does antisocial behaviour .
But the shadow home secretary , David Davis , said the crime reductions were based on " fiddled figures " and said the alleged rise in violent crime represented a " serial failure to protect the public " .
The editors of The Oil Drum are ideologically diverse .
Over the last year , we have created a forum at www.theoildrum.com to encourage an open , rational , and fact - based discussion of energy issues .
While individual editors frequently express an opinion on a subject , we have never felt it necessary to take a unified position on any specific issue .
That is , until today .
Meanwhile , Democratic leaders have had their own response to rising gas prices .
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has announced his support for the Menendez Amendment , which would " provide more than $ 6 billion in relief directly to the American people by eliminating the federal tax for both gas and diesel for 60 days . "
Senator Charles Schumer recently called for a federal investigation to determine whether oil companies are withholding gasoline production , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has blamed high gas prices on the administration 's cozy relationship with the oil companies , price gouging , and royalty relief .
Leaders of both political parties are expressing concern about the high price of gasoline .
President George Bush announced yesterday that he was suspending deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to make more oil available to consumers as well as putting on hold the traditional regulations requiring additives to make fuel burn cleaner during the summer driving season .
We strongly feel that the leaders of both political parties are not only headed in the wrong direction with respect to gas prices , but we also worry that they fundamentally misunderstand the factors behind the current situation at gasoline stations around the US .
Public statements by political figures over the past several days would seem to suggest that oil companies and their record profits are the sole factor determining the price of gasoline .
Not only is this untrue , but it is dangerous to give the American people the impression that only oil companies are to blame .
The American people need to understand that the phenomenon of high gas prices cannot be attributed to a single source .
They also need to understand that no one political party will be able to fix our current woes .
The major factor that determines gas prices is the price of crude oil from which gasoline is derived .
When crude oil prices are high , so are gas prices .
The following are just a few factors that affect the price of a barrel of oil :
Oil companies do not single - handedly determine the price of oil .
The price of oil is set on the crude oil futures market .
Simply put , these prices are affected by supply and demand because , at present , oil trades in a global commodity market where increased demand or reduced supply in one place instantly translates into price shifts everywhere .
A variety of publicly available information sources show that supply is relatively static at the moment , while world demand continues to grow as economies grow .
We have provided evidence many times at The Oil Drum that the output of major oilfields is declining and that we may now have reached a peak or plateau in global oil supply .
Oil companies have not been able to increase production for a number of years , and it is unclear that OPEC is accurately reporting their reserves .
Even if there were significant sources of high quality oil remaining , it is getting increasingly difficult and expensive to drill .
These factors , along with aging infrastructure for oil exploration and a retiring workforce are also contributing to high oil prices .
The geopolitical situation is volatile , and an astute citizen may notice that every time there is news from Nigeria or Iran , the price of oil goes up because of the potential and real effects of these situations on world oil supply .
Again , oil traders are fearful that the supply will not remain stable forever .
Countries like China and India are industrializing at a great pace , and while we are accustomed to obtaining oil at a comfortable quantity and price , it will be impossible ( and immoral ) to deny similar resources to these countries .
China is working furiously to secure new oil supplies , and they 're content to negotiate with countries we 're reluctant to deal with , like Iran and the Sudan .
These points demonstrate that disruptions in the supply of oil that affect the price of gasoline at the pump are not just a temporary glitch .
For various reasons -- decreased discoveries of new oilfields , geopolitical instability , international competition for oil supply -- we can no longer assume that we will be able to consume as much oil as possible , or ever get it again for $ 1.50 a gallon .
Demagoguery and grandstanding are not strategies for addressing our energy problems .
As an alternative , the editors of The Oil Drum put forth the following recommendations :
It is nonsensical for political leaders of both parties to eliminate the gas tax temporarily or permanently as this will only worsen our dependence on oil by disincentivizing the innovation of oil alternatives and oil conservation efforts .
Both mainstream American political parties are doing their country a disservice by accusing convenient scapegoats of price gouging or price fixing instead of educating the public about how the price of gas is actually set .
Right now , governments should be focused on helping us cure our " addiction to oil . "
The answer does not lie in lowering gas prices , which will only encourage people to drive more and further waste our valuable resources .
As the Department of Energy funded Hirsch Report on Peak Oil laid out , the consequences of not taking steps to transition away from oil could be dramatic to our economic system .
Appropriate solutions include large - scale research , development , and implementation programs to improve the scalability of alternative sources of energy , other projects geared towards improving mass transit and carpooling programs across the country , providing incentives to buy smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles , and promoting a campaign to increase awareness about conservation .
The political discourse on this topic is simply so devoid of fact , and constructive discourse so buried and out of the mainstream , that we felt we needed to raise a voice of reason .
Public officials will continue to misinform and obfuscate if we allow it .
The only solution is to educate the public about the most important problem we face as a generation .
We , the citizens of the US and the world , must move our attention to this the issue of energy more than any other .
We must hold our representative governments accountable for having an open and honest debate on the subject .
Simply put , we must learn more about where our energy comes from .

A Sudden Change of State
A new paper suggests we have been greatly underestimating the impacts of climate change – and the size of the necessary response .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 3rd July 2007
Reading a scientific paper on the train this weekend , I found , to my amazement , that my hands were shaking .
This has never happened to me before , but nor have I ever read anything like it .
Published by a team led by James Hansen at Nasa , it suggests that the grim reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change could be absurdly optimistic ( 1 ) .
The IPCC predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as 59 cm this century ( 2 ) .
Hansen ’s paper argues that the slow melting of ice sheets the panel expects does n’t fit the data .
The geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion , but flips suddenly from one state to another .
When temperatures increased to 2 - 3 degrees above today ’s level 3.5 million years ago , sea levels rose not by 59 centimetres but by 25 metres .
The ice responded immediately to changes in temperature ( 3 ) .
We now have a pretty good idea of why ice sheets collapse .
The buttresses that prevent them from sliding into the sea break up ; meltwater trickles down to their base , causing them suddenly to slip ; and pools of water form on the surface , making the ice darker so that it absorbs more heat .
These processes are already taking place in Greenland and West Antarctica .
Rather than taking thousands of years to melt , as the IPCC predicts , Hansen and his team find it “ implausible ” that the expected warming before 2100 “ would permit a West Antarctic ice sheet of present size to survive even for a century . ”
As well as drowning most of the world ’s centres of population , a sudden disintegration could lead to much higher rises in global temperature , because less ice means less heat reflected back into space .
The new paper suggests that the temperature could therefore be twice as sensitive to rising greenhouse gases than the IPCC assumes .
“ Civilization developed , ” Hansen writes , “ during a period of unusual climate stability , the Holocene , now almost 12,000 years in duration .
That period is about to end . ” ( 4 )
I looked up from the paper , almost expecting to see crowds stampeding through the streets .
I saw people chatting outside a riverside pub .
The other passengers on the train snoozed over their newspapers or played on their mobile phones .
Unaware of the causes of our good fortune , blissfully detached from their likely termination , we drift into catastrophe .
Or we are led there .
A good source tells me that the British government is well aware that its target for cutting carbon emissions – 60 % by 2050 – is too little , too late , but that it will go no further for one reason : it fears losing the support of the Confederation of British Industry .
Why this body is allowed to keep holding a gun to our heads has never been explained , but Gordon Brown has just appointed Digby Jones , its former director - general , as a minister in the department responsible for energy policy .
I do n’t remember voting for him .
There could be no clearer signal that the public interest is being drowned by corporate power .
The government ’s energy programme , partly as a result , is characterised by a complete absence of vision .
You can see this most clearly when you examine its plans for renewables .
The EU has set a target for 20 % of all energy in the member states to come from renewable sources by 2020 .
This in itself is pathetic .
But the government refuses to adopt it ( 5 ) : instead it proposes that 20 % of our electricity ( just part of our total energy use ) should come from renewable power by that date .
Even this is not a target , just an “ aspiration ” , and it is on course to miss it .
Worse still , it has no idea what happens after that .
Last week I asked whether it has commissioned any research to discover how much more electricity we could generate from renewable sources .
It has not ( 6 ) .
It ’s a critical question , whose answer – if its results were applied globally – could determine whether or not the planetary “ albedo flip ” that Hansen predicts takes place .
There has been remarkably little investigation of this issue .
Until recently I guessed that the maximum contribution from renewables would be something like 50 % : beyond that point the difficulties of storing electricity and balancing the grid could become overwhelming .
But three papers now suggest that we could go much further .
Last year , the German government published a study of the effects of linking the electricity networks of all the countries in Europe and connecting them to North Africa and Iceland with high voltage direct current cables ( 7 ) .
This would open up a much greater variety of renewable power sources .
Every country in the network would then be able to rely on stable and predictable supplies from elsewhere : hydroelectricity in Scandanavia and the Alps , geothermal energy in Iceland and vast solar thermal farms in the Sahara .
By spreading the demand across a much wider network , it suggests that 80 % of Europe ’s electricity could be produced from renewable power without any greater risk of blackouts or flickers .
At about the same time , Mark Barrett at University College London published a preliminary study looking mainly at ways of altering the pattern of demand for electricity to match the variable supply from wind and waves and tidal power ( 8 ) .
At about twice the current price , he found that we might be able to produce as much as 95 % of our electricity from renewable sources without causing interruptions in the power supply .
Now a new study by the Centre for Alternative Technology takes this even further ( 9 ) .
It is due to be published next week , but I have been allowed a preview .
It is remarkable in two respects : it suggests that by 2027 we could produce 100 % of our electricity without the use of fossil fuels or nuclear power , and that we could do so while almost tripling its supply : our heating systems ( using electricity to drive heat pumps ) and our transport systems could be mostly powered by it .
It relies on a great expansion of electricity storage : building new hydroelectric reservoirs into which water can be pumped when electricity is abundant , constructing giant vanadium flow batteries and linking electric cars up to the grid when they are parked , using their batteries to meet fluctuations in demand .
It contains some optimistic technical assumptions , but also a very pessimistic one : that the UK relies entirely on its own energy supplies .
If the German proposal were to be combined with these ideas , we could begin to see how we might reliably move towards a world without fossil fuels .
If Hansen is correct , to avert the meltdown that brings the Holocene to an end we require a response on this scale : a sort of political “ albedo flip ” .
The government must immediately commission studies to discover how much of our energy could be produced without fossil fuels , set that as its target then turn the economy round to meet it .
But a power shift like this cannot take place without a power shift of another kind : we need a government which fears planetary meltdown more than it fears the CBI .

Latest data shows that the current share of renewables in the UK ’s total energy mix is around 2 % and for the EU as a whole around 6 % .
Projections indicate that by 2020 , on the basis of existing policies , renewables would contribute around 5 % of the UK ’s consumption and are unlikely to exceed 10 % of the EU’s . ”

A leading zoologist has found evidence that genes used to modify crops can jump the species barrier and cause bacteria to mutate , prompting fears that GM technology could pose serious health risks .
A four - year study by Professor Hans - Hinrich Kaatz , a respected German zoologist , found that the alien gene used to modify oilseed rape had transferred to bacteria living inside the guts of honey bees .
The research - which has yet to be published and has not been reviewed by fellow scientists - is highly significant because it suggests that all types of bacteria could become contaminated by genes used in genetically modified technology , including those that live inside the human digestive system .
If this happened , it could have an impact on the bacteria 's vital role in helping the human body fight disease , aid digestion and facilitate blood clotting .
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown , who was yesterday advising farmers who have accidentally grown contaminated GM oilseed rape in Britain to rip up their crops , confirmed the potential significance of Kaatz 's research .
He said : ' If this is true , then it would be very serious . '
The 47 - year - old Kaatz has been reluctant to talk about his research until it has been published in a scientific journal , because he fears a backlash from the scientific community similar to that faced by Dr Arpad Pustzai , who claimed that genetically modified potatoes damaged the stomach lining of rats .
Pustzai was sacked and had his work discredited .
But in his first newspaper interview , Kaatz told The Observer : ' It is true , I have found the herbicide - resistant genes in the rapeseed transferred across to the bacteria and yeast inside the intestines of young bees .
This happened rarely , but it did happen . '
Although Kaatz realised the potential ' significance ' of his findings , he said he ' was not surprised ' at the results .
Asked if this had implications for the bacteria inside the human gut , he said : ' Maybe , but I am not an expert on this . '
Dr Mae -Wan
Ho , geneticist at Open University and a critic of GM technology , has no doubts about the dangers .
She said : ' These findings are very worrying and provide the first real evidence of what many have feared .
Everybody is keen to exploit GM technology , but nobody is looking at the risk of horizontal gene transfer .
' We are playing about with genetic structures that existed for millions of years and the experiment is running out of control . '
One of the biggest concerns is if the anti-biotic resistant gene used in some GM crops crossed over to bacteria .
' If this happened it would leave us unable to treat major illnesses like meningitis and E coli .'
Kaatz , who works at the respected Institute for Bee Research at the University of Jena in Germany , built nets in a field planted with genetically modified rapeseed produced by AgrEvo .
He let the bees fly freely within the net .
At the beehives , he installed pollen traps in order to sample the pollen from the bees ' hindlegs when entering the hive .
This pollen was fed to young honey bees in the laboratory .
Pollen is the natural diet of young bees , which need a high protein diet .
Kaatz then extracted the intestine of the young bees and discovered that the gene from the GM rape - seed had been transferred in the bee gut to the microbes .
Professor Robert Pickard , director - general of the Institute of the British Nutrition Foundation , is a bee expert as well as being a biologist and has visited the institute where Kaatz works .
He said : ' There is no doubt that , if Kaatz 's research is substantiated , then it poses very interesting questions and will need to be looked at very closely .
' But it must be remembered that the human body has been coping perfectly well with strange DNA for millions of years .
And we also know many people have been eating GM products for years without showing any signs of ill health . '

The sun is dying , and with it , all of humanity .
As a last gasp , earthlings send a crew of astronauts on a mission to reignite it .
With the new sci- fi film Sunshine , Danny Boyle advances his genre - tweaking career , which also includes the mordant Shallow Grave , the drug - culture classic Trainspotting and the socio - zombie mashup 28 Days Later .
Sunshine , which stars Cillian Murphy , Michelle Yeoh , Rose Byrne and Chris Evans , opens on July 20 .
Wired News spoke with Boyle about making space convincing , his ride on the " vomit comet " and how Star Wars killed serious science fiction .
Wired News :
Is it true Sunshine was inspired by an article in a scientific journal ?
Danny Boyle : ( Screenwriter ) Alex Garland 's a nut for the journals .
He sent me a first draft with this amazing high - concept idea : a trip to save the sun .
As far as we can find , there 's never been a film about the sun , yet it 's the single most important thing you could jeopardize .
WN : It 's become rare for real science to intrude on sci-fi cinema .
Boyle : Hard - core sci- fi has gone out of fashion , has n't it ?
There was a strong strain of it into the ' 70s that tried to depict space realistically , but it 's been replaced .
Alien , one of the great masterpieces , was quickly followed by Star Wars .
And Star Wars , of course , led everyone to fantasy sci- fi , that playground where anything goes .
You can imagine any creature , on any planet .
And they all talk English .
WN : What did you do to keep it real ?
Boyle :
We tried to be strict .
At the end of the film , there 's obviously no way a man could reach out his arm and touch the sun .
But the beginning of the film is absolutely based in as rigid a realism as we could do .
We consulted NASA about it , and had scientific advisors with us the whole time .
WN : It 's just a movie , though , so your storytelling must have collided with the hard science .
Boyle : I loved doing all the science research but I have to be honest :
My brain does n't really do maths .
To really do the physics , you need to do the maths , because everything is explicable .
You can't encompass it in your brain on a visual level without doing the equations .
Ultimately , I had to be loyal to the story .
I had no loyalty to the physics .
I 'm a sham storyteller and quite proud of that .
You sacrifice what you need to for the story .
WN : What Hollywood clichés did you try to avoid ?
Boyle :
We resisted the studio's attempts to turn this into a disaster movie , where you keep cutting back to Earth .
Our principle was always to trap the audience in the ship with the astronauts , and keep them there in this claustrophobic space .
We did n't want it to be objective , with you watching it coolly .
We wanted you to feel the journey pass through you .
We spent a lot of our time and our resources to try and make that happen , to take people to the surface of the sun .
WN : Did you worry that it would be a letdown for the audience once they got there ?
You do n't want the sun to look like a light bulb covered in red crepe paper .
Boyle : ( Laughs )
On a technical level , the sun was everything .
You 've got to make it plausible on a sci - fi level .
And beyond that , whatever you think of the story or the characters , the journey needs to be visceral .
You need to take the audience on the journey with you .
I was dead honest with ( visual effects supervisor Tom Wood ) .
I told him I do n't understand how CGI works .
I described what I wanted , and he had to match it or better it .
It was as simple as that .
Sometimes it would come back and I could n't believe what I was seeing .
It was extraordinary .
WN : How did you convince the actors they were on a spaceship instead of on a soundstage ?
Boyle :
One of my obsessions was that I did n't want this to be a green - screen or blue - screen film , to have the actors looking at a blank screen that would be replaced months later by some astonishing effect that they were n't aware of and therefore could n't react to .
I wanted to make sure that everyone understood what they were looking at , that they 'd see something that would allow them to act accordingly .
So we spent a lot of money on stuff that was never going to be seen , creating live effects on the stages for the actors to look at .
People said , " You are just wasting money .
It 'll all get replaced by CG . "
I said , " I know it 's going to be replaced .
It 's not there because I do n't know what I 'm doing .
It 's there to make the actors experience it . "
My fear with CG is that actors look bored or they overact , that they can't find where to pitch it .
I think our approach makes the CG feel organic to the film , instead of a late arrival hitched on .
In the end , all realism is based on the question : " Do you believe that actor ?
Do you believe that moment ? "
It 's simple as that for me , whether you are dealing with drug addicts in Trainspotting or an incredibly sophisticated mission to the stars .
It 's the same benchmark , really : " Do you believe ? "
WN : I know you talked to astronauts and researched real - world space programs , in part to give the cast the sense of vulnerability of astronauts have out in space .
Boyle :
It 's just unbelievable .
( I read ) one bit about the lunar landing module .
Neil Armstrong said you could put your fist through it .
If you just punched it hard or leant on it wrong , your hand would go through like a biscuit tin .
Two hundred thousand miles from earth in a biscuit tin ( laughs ) !
WN : How did those experiences affect the actors ?
Boyle :
It added to the group dynamic .
It 's almost like a siege mentality .
They are so fragile and vulnerable – it just helps psychologically to get the actors in the zone .
That 's what you do this work for , all this research and getting them to talk to real astronauts .
Hopefully some of it rubs off .
WN : And you put them in zero gravity simulators .
Boyle : Yeah , we did some weightlessness .
I did the vomit comet , where you get 30 seconds of weightlessness .
If you ever have three grand to spare , I can't think of a better way to spend it .
It absolutely changes you .
WN : The film covers some of the same thematic material as 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Solaris , films you 've described as masterpieces .
Were you worried about following in those footsteps ?
Boyle :
There are certain things you bump into and can't avoid .
You can't be in a state of denial .
You have to acknowledge that you 'll be following their footsteps , because it 's quite a narrow corridor , really .
WN : What is it about those films that makes them masterpieces ?
Boyle :
They stretch the mind .
They use space to stretch the mind to what 's possible .
What happens to you out there , in this endless space that 's also claustrophobic ?
Your body can't step outside the steel tube because everything is poised to destroy you , but your mind can .
It can bend out there .
WN : Will you ever do another sci - fi film ?
Boyle : No ! I
When I was making Sunshine , it suddenly struck me :
No director has ever gone back into space , with the exception of franchise directors .
If you look at the record , you 'll find that 's true .

Under is looking for Aussies over the age of 18 to fill 200 positions as condom testers , stuff .co.nz reports .
Durex marketing manager Sam White explained that successful applicants would get a AU$ 60 selection of rubberwear , and would be " required to provide the company with honest feedback about the products ' performance " .
He said : " With this job on your CV , it really will be a chance to brag to your mates about the special skills you possess , not to mention that your new role will work wonders with the opposite sex . "
White added : " Who would n't want to have a chance with an actual authorised professional ? "
We assume he 's talking about Durex , rather than state - approved ladies of the night , who would undoubtedly be happy to welcome a display of special skills in return for a small consideration .
The condom - testing jobs are unpaid , although one rumpy - pumper will be paid a AU$ 1,000 bonus .

A goat that gained international notoriety last year after getting married to a Sudanese man who indecently assaulted her has died after accidentally choking on a plastic bag .
The black and white goat called Rose swallowed the plastic bag while scavenging for scraps on the streets of Juba , a town in southern Sudan , it was reported today .
The story of the goat's " marriage " became one of the most widely read stories on the internet last year .
A Google search brings up more than 170,000 web pages based on the story .
The incident came to worldwide attention in February last year when the BBC Monitoring Service reported that the goat 's owner had been woken by a loud noise outside and rushed out to find a man having sex with the animal .
The intruder , Charles Tombe , was captured and hauled before the local council of elders who ordered him to marry Rose and pay a dowry of 15,000 Sudanese dinars ( £ 37 ) to Mr Alifi .
Tom Rhodes , the editor of the Juba Post , which first ran the story , told the BBC : " The idea was to publicly embarrass the man . "
Following the marriage Rose had a male kid , but " not a human one " , Mr Rhodes said .
The Joint Chiefs of Staff just sent a menacing letter to the Washington Post over a cartoon .
AMERICAblog received a copy of the letter at 10 AM this morning , but as its veracity was not yet confirmed , we waited until E&P was able to confirm that is is for real .
Here 's the letter the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote to the Post .
And why not have the Pentagon try to stifle a free media while supposedly promoting freedom in Iraq ?
The US government just arrested one of President Bush 's top political critics for threatening his life with a t - shirt .
So why not now threaten a top political cartoonist for drawing a cartoon that the Pentagon does n't like ?
Why not use the power of government to try to censor the media , something that 's a direct violation of that pesky and quaint 1st Amendment to the US Constitution - you remember , that document the Bush administration does n't think is relevant .
I have no problem with citizens speaking out about political cartoons they find offensive - hell , we 've done it recently with the anti-gay cartoon in the Post .
But when the government does it , that 's a whole other story that smacks of censorship , especially when that government is the Pentagon threatening you during wartime .
It will be interesting to see if the Post replied to the Pentagon .
They sure did n't reply when it was a homophobic cartoon they published .
Hey , here 's a thought .
Now that the Joint Chiefs have addressed the insidious threat cartoons pose to our troops , perhaps they can move on to less pressing issues like getting them their damn body armor .
A 15 - story office block in the heart of London is being demolished backwards in order to build a skyscraper in its place .
Demolishers are working up from the ground level upwards , dismantling each floor to reveal the concrete core of the P&O building .
Find out why , and the new skyscraper replacing it , after the jump .

When the P&O building was constructed in 1965 , each floor was hung from a huge beam at the top of the tower and supported by the central core .
According to Matthew
White , project director , the weight has to be removed from the structure from the bottom up .
" Eventually the beam will be deconstructed at roof level , leaving the core , which will be demolished from the top down . "
And this is what will replace the ' 60s block — a 735 - ft sliver of skinniness from Richard ( now Lord ) Rogers .

The plasma - filled shield would offer protection from harmful particles
They argue that magnetic shields could be deployed around spacecraft and on the surfaces of planets to deflect harmful energetic particles .
Several countries ' space agencies have announced their intentions to resume human exploration of the Solar System .
Scientists hope to mimic the magnetic field which protects the Earth .
Details have been presented at the Royal Astronomical Society 's National Astronomy Meeting in Preston , UK .
There are a variety of risks facing future space explorers , not least of which is the cancer - causing radiation from cosmic rays and solar flares that astronauts will encounter when they venture beyond the Earth 's protective magnetic envelope , or magnetosphere .
The nice thing is that magnet technology is really quite evolved here on Earth .
The question is can you take it into space ?
Mike Hapgood ,
Rutherford - Appleton Laboratory
The Earth 's magnetosphere deflects many of the energetic particles from space ; others are largely absorbed by the atmosphere .
Between 1968 and 1973 , the Apollo astronauts were only in space for about 10 days at a time .
They were simply lucky not to have been in space during a major eruption on the Sun that would have flooded their spacecraft with deadly radiation .
Crew members on the International Space Station can retreat to a thick - walled room during times of increased solar radiation .
Stable field
But these protective shelters would not be practical on long - duration space journeys , since the " drip - drip " of energised particles is thought to be as harmful to the health of astronauts as large solar storms .
Potentially damaging solar activity is hard to predict
The harmful particles come from the Sun , in the form of the solar wind , and from sources outside our Solar System .
To create the deflector shield around a spacecraft or on the surface of a planet or moon , scientists need to generate a magnetic field and then fill it with ionised gas called plasma .
The plasma would be held in place by a stable magnetic field ( without the magnetic field , the plasma would simply drift away ) .
This shield could be deployed around a spacecraft or around astronauts on the surface of a planetary body such as the Moon .
As energetic particles interact with the plasma , energy is sapped away from them and they slow down .
" You do n't need much of a magnetic field to hold off the solar wind .
You could produce the shield 20 - 30 kilometres away from the spacecraft , " explained Dr Ruth Bamford , from the Rutherford - Appleton Laboratory in Didcot , UK , one of the scientists on the team .
Dr Mike Hapgood , from the Didcot - based research centre , told BBC News : " The nice thing is that magnet technology is really quite evolved here on Earth .
The question is can you take it into space ? ' "
The team from Rutherford - Appleton plans to build an artificial magnetosphere in the laboratory .
They would eventually like to fly a test satellite which would test the technology in space .
' Shields on '
The idea has been likened to the deflector shields which protect the USS Enterprise and other spacecraft in Star Trek .
Like their fictional counterparts , these shields could also be switched on and off .
The planned moon base will be exposed to solar radiation
An artificial magnetosphere could come in handy anywhere in the Solar System where humans would need to be for long durations .
A permanent Moon base , of the type Nasa plans to build , could be buried under lunar soil to protect the occupants and equipment from space radiation .
But inhabitants will still be vulnerable when venturing outside in their spacesuits .
" Our warning systems are n't very good [ for solar flares ] .
You might be able to say : ' this is a dangerous period in terms of solar activity ' , but you might be on red alert for weeks , " said Dr Hapgood .
" If you 've got a problem , you might not want to wait a week to fix it .
You might want a device to deploy on the surface as a shield that would blunt the effect of a flare at ten minutes ' notice , it adds an extra level of safety . "
The idea for the shields draws on technology pioneered in experimental nuclear fusion reactors .
Nuclear fusion is not yet a mature technology .
It works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them , as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations .
At the Jet experimental fusion facility at Culham in the UK , magnetic fields were used to keep plasma away from the interior wall of the reactor .
This represents a reversal of that technology : " We want to use the same technique to keep an object in the middle away from plasma that 's on the outside , " said Dr Bamford .
But the plasma needed to protect against particles from the solar wind and elsewhere would actually be weaker than that generated in experimental fusion reactors like Jet .
Ever since the world learned of the lawless state of American military prisons in Iraq , the administration has hidden behind the claim that only a few bad apples were brutalizing prisoners .
President Bush also has dodged the full force of public outrage because the victims were foreigners , mostly Muslims , captured in what he has painted as a war against Islamic terrorists bent on destroying America .
This week ,
The Times published two articles that reminded us again that the American military prisons are profoundly and systemically broken and that no one is safe from the summary judgment and harsh treatment institutionalized by the White House and the Pentagon after 9/11 .
On Monday , Michael Moss wrote about a U.S. contractor who was swept up in a military raid and dumped into a system where everyone is presumed guilty and denied any chance to prove otherwise .
Donald Vance , a 29 - year - old Navy veteran from Chicago , was a whistle - blower who prompted the raid by tipping off the F.B.I. to suspicious activity at the company where he worked , including possible weapons trafficking .
He was arrested and held for 97 days — shackled and blindfolded , prevented from sleeping by blaring music and round - the - clock lights .
In other words , he was subjected to the same mistreatment that thousands of non-Americans have been subjected to since the 2003 invasion .

( AP )  Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani said he opposes creation of a Palestinian state at this time and would take a tough stand with Iran , including destroying its nuclear infrastructure " should all else fail . "
Outlining his foreign policy views in the September / October issue of Foreign Affairs magazine , Giuliani said " too much emphasis " has been placed on brokering negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians — an apparent swipe at President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who have been pushing both sides for final status negotiations despite Hamas ' takeover of Gaza in June .
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : Giuliani , Edwards pen policy statements CANDIDATE PROFILE : Rudy Giuliani
" It is not in the interest of the United States , at a time when it is being threatened by Islamist terrorists , to assist the creation of another state that will support terrorism , " the former New York mayor said .
" Palestinian statehood will have to be earned through sustained good governance , a clear commitment to fighting terrorism , and a willingness to live in peace with Israel , " Giuliani said .
" America 's commitment to Israel 's security is a permanent feature of our foreign policy . "
Giuliani said in the article that he would not rule out negotiating with Iran , but such negotiations should proceed from " a position of strength . "
" The theocrats ruling Iran need to understand that we can wield the stick as well as the carrot , by undermining popular support for their regime , damaging the Iranian economy , weakening Iran 's military , and , should all else fail , destroying its nuclear infrastructure , " Giuliani said .
Bush recently warned Iran of " consequences " if Iran is determined to be assisting the flow of explosive devices into Iraq .

Iran 's Nuclear Program Whistling in the Dark

I always keep the quote by Ron Jeffries , from the Refactoring book close at hand :
" The lesson is : Even if you know exactly what is going on in you system , measure performance , do n't speculate .
You 'll learn something , and nine times out of ten , it wo n't be that you were right ! ! "
How true - I 've always thought about putting that on the wall somewhere prominent ..!
My performance tuning motto ( which I periodically forget because I think I 'm so smart ) :
Measure twice , cut ( code ) once .
Actually , the complexity of the sieve is O( n ln ln n ) .
If you graph this you 'll see it 's all but indistinguishable from linear above n=0 , even for quite large n.
Still , it 's a little bit bigger than O(n ) .
Nice post .
Profiling is generally better than guessing :)
I note that you can start the loops from ( i * i ) rather than ( 2*i ) , because you have already sieved out all the multiples of every prime less than i .
As in your example , this seems enticing from an optimization point of view , but does n't actually give you much of a boost when you measure it - I 'm seeing about 20 % faster for the n-version , and only 3 % faster for the sqrt( n ) - version , even less impact than the n to sqrt ( n ) change .
Ironically though , since this tweak seems to capture the intent of the sieve algorithm better , I 'd advocate it even though I side with Beck on not doing the n to sqrt ( n ) change .

Many years ago I was working on an application in C ++.
My parter ( at the time ) , Jim Newkirk , came to me and told me that one of our common functions was very slow .
This function converted a binary representation of a data tree to text to be stored in a file .
( This was before XML , but the concept is the same ) .
I looked at this function for some time and realized that there was a linear symbol table lookup .
So I confidently replaced the linear search with a binary search and gave the function back to Jim .
Jim returned some hours later asking me whether I had made any changes or not , because the function was just as slow as ever .
This made no sense to me so I studied and studied the function and found a few other obvious algorithic changes to make .
Yet nothing I did made the slightest difference .
The function remained abyssmally slow , and Jim grew ever more frustrated with my useless flailings with this function .
Eventually Jim figured out how to profile the function and found that the problem was in a low level C++ library ( strstream ) which was allocating and reallocating and reallocating blocks as our text representation gradually grew .
The function was increased in speed by orders of magnitude simply by preallocating the buffer that the text representation was to be loaded into .
Once , long ago , I had to write an algorithm to calculate the area of an arbitrary polygon .
I concieved upon a notion of repeatedly subdividing the polygon into triangles .
Each triangle would eliminate one vertex of the polygon and its area could be added to the growing sum .
It took awhile to get this working because I had to deal with many irregular shapes .
Still , after a day or two I had a very nice function that would calculate the area of any polygon at all .
A few days later one of my co-workers came to me and said : " It takes 45 minutes to calculate the area of the property line I 'm drawing , so I can't display the area while the property line is being drawn or editted . " 45 min. is a long time , so I asked her how many vertices the polygon had .
She told me that it had over a thousand .
Looking at my algorithm I realized that it was O ( N^3 ) and so was very fast for small polygons but impossibly slow for large polygons .
I thought and thought about this problem but could not find a better solution .
( Nowadays I 'd just google for it , but that 's now and this was then ...)
So we turned of the automatic display off area and told our customer it was too time consuming .
Two weeks later , by sheer happenstance , I was thumbing through a book on prolog ( a lovely and strange langage that I recommend you learn ! ) and saw an algorithm for finding the area of a polygon .
It was elegant , simple , and linear .
It never would have occurred to me .
I implemented it in a matter of a few minutes and , voila !
we had real - time update of polygon area while dragging vertices accross the screen .
Last night I was sitting in a Limo , driving back from O'Hare to my home in the northern suburbs of Chicago .
I - 294 had some construction and we wound up caught in a traffic jam .
So I pulled out my Macbook Pro and started writing a random Ruby program .
I wrote the Sieve of Eratosthenes , just for grins .
Once I got it working I decided to see just how fast Ruby is , so I augmented the program with benchmarks to measure it 's speed .
It was pretty fast !
I could calculate all the primes less than a million in under two seconds !
Not bad for an interpreted language .
I wondered what the O(x ) of this algorithm was .
Sitting in the car I could not look it up , so I decided to measure it by plotting some points .
So I ran the algorithm from 100,000 to 5,000,000 in increments of 100,000 .
Then I ploted those points on a graph .
How could this algorithm be linear ?
It 's got a nested loop !
Does n't it have to be some kind of O ( N^2 ) or at least O ( N log N ) ?
Here 's the code , check for yourself :
My son , Micah , was sitting next to me in the Limo , and he leaned over and said : " The loop should only go up to the square root of n . "
I sheepishly realized that this must be the reason for the linearity .
The loop was being swamped by the useless linear iterations all the way up to n when it should have been terminated just as it reached the root of n .
Not only would this change show the true curve of the performance graph , but it should substantially increase the speed of the algorithm .
So I made the simple change :
When I plotted the two graphs together , this is what I got : This was really disappointing .
Firstly , there was no curve exposed in the sqrt ( n ) graph .
Secondly , the sqrt(n ) performance was only twice the speed of the original !
How could a function whose outer loop had just had itshalved yeild just a ( 2X ) increase in speed ?
As I looked more at the algorithm I realized that as the iterator for the outer loop increases , the time for the inner loop decreases for two reasons .
First , the step is larger .
Second there are morevalues in the sieve so the if statement fires less often .
Thiseffect must somehow balance things such that the behavior of the algorithm remains linear .
I 'm not a computer scientist , and am not really interested in doing the math to figure out whether this algorithm is really linear or not .
The graph tells me what I need to know .
For all intents and purposes the performance of this algorithm is linear .
All this just leads back to the title .
Performance tuning is perverse .
What youis going on is seldom what reallygoing on .
Who could have guessed that limiting the outer iteration to the square root of the maximum would yeild just a 2X increase in performance ?
Who could have guessed that the algorithm itself was linear ?!
Six year ago , at the very first XP Immersion , I wrote a Sieve algorithm in Java as an example for Kent Beck to refactor in front of a group of 30 - odd students .
I watched in horror as he removed the clever sqrt from the function and replaced it with n .
He said " I do n't know if that 'll really make the algorithm much faster and anyway setting the limit to n is much simpler and easier to read . "
So he deleted the fancy comment I had placed around the sqrt that explained why it was so clever and set the limit to n .
At the time I rolled my eyes to myself and silently smirked .
I was certain that the sqrt would make the algorithm orders of magnitude faster for large n.
I was convinced that every hundred - fold increase of n would yeild only a 10 - fold increase in time .
Six years later I finally measured that assumption and found that the increase was a linear factor of two , and that Kent was right all along .

‘ Groups of elderly Australians are reportedly setting up backyard laboratories to manufacture an illegal euthanasia drug so they can kill themselves when they have had enough of life .
One group has already succeeded in producing the drug nembutal , which is used by vets to put down animals , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Monday night .
At least four other backyard factories were planned for major cities across the country , with a total of some 800 elderly people prepared to become involved in producing the drug .
Dozens of older Australians were also engaged in illegally importing nembutal from the Mexican border town of Tijuana , close to the US city of San Diego , according to the report . ’
Getting Iraq War Funding Wrong Again
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
This week , Congress finalized the controversial $ 124 billion Iraq emergency supplemental spending bill , with the House and Senate both voting in favor of final passage .
The majority of my Republican colleagues and I voted against this measure , and the president has vowed to veto the legislation .
In this final version , the House leadership retained billions of dollars in pork meant to attract skeptical votes , retained a watered - down version of the problematic benchmarks  that seek to micromanage the war effort , and continued to play politics with the funding of critical veterans medical and other assistance .
In other words , this final version was even worse than the original in almost all respects .
As I wrote when this measure first came before the House , we have to make a clear distinction between the Constitutional authority of Congress to make foreign policy , and the Constitutional authority of the president , as commander in chief , to direct the management of any military operation .
We do no favor to the troops by micromanaging the war from Capitol Hill while continuing to fund it beyond the president ’s request .
If one is unhappy with our progress in Iraq after four years of war , voting to de-fund the war makes sense .
If one is unhappy with the manner in which we went to war , without a constitutional declaration , voting against funding for that war makes equally good sense .
What occurred , however , was the worst of both .
Democrats , dissatisfied with the way the war is being fought , gave the president all the money he asked for and more to keep fighting it , while demanding that he fight it in the manner they see fit .
That is definitely not a recipe for success in Iraq and foreign policy in general .
What is the best way forward in Iraq ?
Where do we go from here ?
First , Congress should admit its mistake in unconstitutionally transferring war power to the president and in citing United Nations resolutions as justification for war against Iraq .
We should never go to war because another nation has violated a United Nations resolution .
Then we should repeal the authority given to the president in 2002 and disavow presidential discretion in starting wars .
Then we should start bringing our troops home in the safest manner possible .
Though many will criticize the president for mis-steps in Iraq and at home , it is with the willing participation of Congress , through measures like this war - funding bill , that our policy continues to veer off course .
Additionally , it is with the complicity of Congress that we have become a nation of pre-emptive war , secret military tribunals , torture , rejection of habeas corpus , warrantless searches , undue government secrecy , extraordinary renditions , and uncontrolled spying on the American people .
Fighting over there has nothing to do with preserving freedoms here at home .
More likely the opposite is true .

G8 panic : Police confiscate children 's bikes
The German police ’s security measures are becoming more and more bizarre .
Yesterday , as activists and citizens began to flood the Rostock region
in Germany to protest the upcoming G8 summit , police repression has
become humorous , but still more restrictive .
On Wednesday the police prevented the building of a legitimate protest
camp in Wichmannsdorf because of the “ well - founded suspicion that stolen
bicycles from around the country are being brought to Heiligendamm . ”
Yesterday outside of Rostock police used mobile checkpoints to search
traffic for stolen bicycles , comparing the bicycle ’s license numbers
with their databases .
Children ’s bicycles and older bikes without the now customary ID numbers
were seized .
Meanwhile in Sherwin protests have been restricted by the
courts because of police claims of a “ state of emergency ” due to a
shortage of available police .
In preparation for the G8 summit , the German government has begun their
largest security operation since World War II , employing over 16,000
police in the area of Rostock and Heiligendamm .
Repressive measures in
the last month have brought harsh public criticism on the government .
Last month In Hamburg and Berlin numerous activists ’ homes and offices
were raided for information .
I some cases the police have taken “ scent
sample ” from activists so that they can be tracked by dogs , presumably
during the summit .
Now protestors who have brought bicycles to provide ecological
transportation during the summit have also met difficulty “ With our
request to repair old and unused bicycles we want to help solve the
transportation problems , ” says Petra Fröhlich .
Activists see a deliberate attempt to impede the preparations for the
protests .
“ The accusation of stolen goods is absurd , ” criticized Petra
Fröhlich .
” A glance at the shoddy old bikes shows that they have been
lying around in basements and attics , clearly not worth stealing .
Only
through hours of work were the bikes made useable again . ”
Environmental activists were also critical of the security measures .
“ While the German government is trying to cast itself as climate
defender at the G8 Conference , it is hindering the use of ecological
transportation , ” complained Marcel Grünau , who was setting up a tent
with other teenage ecological activists .
It gives him another reason to
protest on the streets against G8 – on his bicycle .
He , like many
others , supports the idea of “ action - bikes ” and managed to reach the
Baltic with several bicycles .
Now he hopes to be able to keep a
wheel ’s length ahead of the police and G8 .
Buying or selling a home , or any type of real estate , can be made easier when a real estate agent is involved .
Not only do they have training in the field , but they also know the ins and outs of the market .
Additionally , real estate agents can find variability on the job .
They may choose to represent a buyer or a seller , be involved in various types of negotiations , look for certain types of property or help a client close a desirable deal .
Real Estate Sales Agent Schools
If your career goals involve buying , selling , developing , or managing properties , and you want the foundation of a solid education in property management , there is no better option than a master of business administration or MBA in real estate .
The following five real estate agent programs can furnish students with an MBA in real estate :
The University of California , Berkeley :
This MBA in real estate program is offered by the Haas School of Business and aims to provide students with an award - winning faculty .

Real Estate Agent Education Requirements
Though a high school diploma is the minimum level of education needed to become a real estate agent , an advanced degree can help open up doors for employment .
Real estate agent education requirements vary from agency to agency , but a bachelor 's or master 's degree can mean leadership roles and higher earning potential .
A master of business administration or MBA in real estate is a particularly helpful path for those hoping to make a long - term career in the real estate industry .
Completing a state - accredited program can be important to seeking licensing later on .
MBA real estate programs instruct students in a variety of critical disciplines in property sales , management , and development :
Business planning and administration
Architecture and urban planning
Real estate law
Finance , economics , and business management
Marketing and customer service
International real estate markets
Real estate investment and entrepreneurship , including analysis and financing
MBA real estate programs are offered in business schools and colleges all over the United States , available through classroom curricula and online coursework .
Some hybrid programs offer a combination of classes and online study , an ideal choice for students who intend to work full time as they complete their studies .
Real Estate Agent Certification and Licensing
Real estate agent training leads to the important steps of certification and licensure .
Certification is available to agents through organizations like the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
Some of the NAR certifications include : Certified Real Estate Broker Manager ( CRB ) , Certified Residential Specialist ( CRS ) , Certified Real Estate Team Specialist ( CRETS ) , and others .
Certification is not necessary , but may be beneficial to the job .
Licensing is required in all 50 states .
To become licensed , an individual typically needs to complete specific coursework and pass a licensing exam .
Passing a background check also can be a requirement .
Often , licenses need to be renewed every two to four years with continuing education being an important component .
More licensing details can be found through a state 's real estate licensing commission .

FREDERICK , Colo .
—A Catholic priest faces an indecent exposure charge after police said he went jogging in the nude about an hour before sunrise .
The Rev. Robert
Whipkey told officers he had been running naked at a high school track and did n’t think anyone would be around at that time of day , a police report said .
He told officers he sweats profusely if he wears clothing while jogging .
“ I know what I did was wrong , ” he said in the report .
Whipkey did not return phone messages .
His attorney , Doug Tisdale , told the Longmont Times - Call that Whipkey had no comment .
Whipkey , 53 , was arrested June 22 in this small town about 20 miles north of Denver .
An officer said he saw a naked man walking down the street at 4:35 a.m.
The U.S. Naval Observatory
Web site said sunrise that day in Frederick was 5:31 a.m .
The officer said when he shined his flashlight at the man , he covered himself with a piece of clothing he was carrying .
The Archdiocese of Denver said it takes the incident seriously but is awaiting the outcome of the case .
Whipkey , who also officiates at parishes in the nearby towns of Mead and Erie , remains an active priest .
If convicted of indecent exposure , a misdemeanor , he would have to register as a sex offender , prosecutors said .

In a public statement , Prosecutor HÃ¥kan Roswall made it clear that he intends to press charges against the admins of The Pirate Bay .
Tobias Andersson from the Pirate Bay was not impressed by Roswalls statements , and said they will simply move to another country if they are outlawed in Sweden , without downtime !
Last May , the Swedish police confiscated 180 servers and three admins were held in custody for a few hours during the Pirate Bay raid .
The raid was highly unsuccessful , though , and they only stayed down for a couple of days before they were back in full force , stronger than ever thanks to the widespread media attention .
Now , it appears that Roswall , who compared The Pirate Bay and the Bureau of Piracy ( PiratbyrÃ¥n ) with terrorists last year , does not want to give up just yet .
Roswall said that he is determined to prosecute
The Pirate Bay admins for breaches of copyright law , for helping others break copyright law , and conspiring to break copyright law .
Swedish news agency The Local talked to Tobias Andersson from The Pirate Bay , who said :
“ We expected this , and of course we do n’t think they will succeed .
I think they feel they have to do it .
It would look bad otherwise since they had 20 to 30 police officers involved in the raid ” .
The Pirate Bay raid caused quite some controversy in Sweden after several sources reported that the MPAA initiated the attack by directly influencing the Ministry of Justice to intervene in this specific case , which is considered illegal in Sweden .
Story Highlights • NEW : Snow : Iran would have to halt uranium program to talk with U.S .
• Iran official : Open to critical regional talks on Iraq
• Forum to discuss Iraq will unite regional neighbors and others
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. officials wo n't hold direct talks with Iran or Syria at a Baghdad conference next month despite the Bush administration 's complaints that those countries are allowing weapons into Iraq , White House spokesman Tony Snow said Wednesday .
Direct talks would happen only if those countries made changes to their own policies .
Iran would have to halt its uranium enrichment work and Syria would have to stop supporting groups Washington considers terrorist organizations , Snow said .
" If between now and the 10th of March the Iranians suspended reprocessing and enrichment , then you 'd have a different ballpark , " he said .
" If the Syrians had changed their attitude toward Hamas and Hezbollah , OK . "
A top Iranian official said Wednesday that his country " will participate " in Iraq 's neighbors ' conference next month " if it will be of help to Baghdad , " according to a state - run Iranian news service .
Although the Bush administration has long accused Iran and Syria of meddling in Iraq , the bipartisan Iraq Study Group called for direct talks with those countries .
During a Senate hearing Tuesday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates painted U.S. attendance at the conference as a step toward carrying out one of the study group 's major recommendations .
U.S. military officials in Iraq have accused Iran of providing deadly armor- piercing explosives and mortar shells to Shiite Muslim militias in Iraq , while the United States accuses Syria of allowing weapons and fighters to reach the Sunni insurgency in western Iraq across its border .
Both countries deny the allegations .
If concerns about the flow of weapons and fighters into Iraq come up at the Iraqi - sponsored conference , " obviously we will address them , " Snow said .
" But there will not be bilateral talks between the United States and Iran or the United States and Syria , within the context of these meetings . "
Washington and Tehran have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 , when Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy and held dozens of diplomats hostage for more than a year .
But Snow said U.S. and Iranian officials have been " seated at the same table in multilateral negotiations " several times in the past few years , during aid conferences and in meetings at the United Nations .
However , he said , the Bush administration can't change policy while Iran is under a U.N. Security Council demand to halt its nuclear fuel program .
" It 's important that people understand that this administration is serious when it comes to the Iranians about a precondition for bilateral negotiations and also for diplomatic relations , which is , they can't be working toward a nuclear weapon , " he said .
Iran says it is enriching uranium for civilian power plants , but the United States accuses it of planning to develop a nuclear bomb .
The U.N. 's nuclear watchdog agency reported last week that it cannot assure the Security Council that the Iranian work is only for peaceful purposes .
Iraqi officials announced the neighbors conference on Tuesday .
Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said attendance by the United States , Syria and Iran would be an ice - breaking diplomatic event that would pave the way to foster cooperative efforts to help Iraq .
Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , has accepted an invitation to the conference .
Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani confirmed that Zebari has asked his Iranian counterpart , Manouchehr Mottaki , to attend the conference , the Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
Also on the guest list for the sub-ministerial talks are representatives of Iraq 's Persian Gulf neighbors , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia ; Jordan , Egypt and Turkey ; the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , which includes Russia , China , Britain , the United States and France ; the United Nations , the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
The U.S. Embassy in Iraq said the initial meeting could be followed with another conference at the ministerial level .
A series of shocking personal testimonies is now shedding light on Camp 22 - one of the country 's most horrific secrets
In the remote north - eastern corner of North Korea , close to the border of Russia and China , is Haengyong .
Hidden away in the mountains , this remote town is home to Camp 22 - North Korea 's largest concentration camp , where thousands of men , women and children accused of political crimes are held .
Now , it is claimed , it is also where thousands die each year and where prison guards stamp on the necks of babies born to prisoners to kill them .
Over the past year harrowing first - hand testimonies from North Korean defectors have detailed execution and torture , and now chilling evidence has emerged that the walls of Camp 22 hide an even more evil secret : gas chambers where horrific chemical experiments are conducted on human beings .
Witnesses have described watching entire families being put in glass chambers and gassed .
They are left to an agonising death while scientists take notes .
The allegations offer the most shocking glimpse so far of Kim Jong - il 's North Korean regime .
Kwon Hyuk , who has changed his name , was the former military attaché at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing .
He was also the chief of management at Camp 22 .
In the BBC's This World documentary , to be broadcast tonight , Hyuk claims he now wants the world to know what is happening .
' I witnessed a whole family being tested on suffocating gas and dying in the gas chamber , ' he said .
' The parents , son and and a daughter .
The parents were vomiting and dying , but till the very last moment they tried to save kids by doing mouth - to - mouth breathing . '
Hyuk has drawn detailed diagrams of the gas chamber he saw .
He said : ' The glass chamber is sealed airtight .
It is 3.5 metres wide , 3 m long and 2.2 m high_ [ There ] is the injection tube going through the unit .
Normally , a family sticks together and individual prisoners stand separately around the corners .
Scientists observe the entire process from above , through the glass . '
He explains how he had believed this treatment was justified .
' At the time I felt that they thoroughly deserved such a death .
Because all of us were led to believe that all the bad things that were happening to North Korea were their fault ; that we were poor , divided and not making progress as a country .
' It would be a total lie for me to say I feel sympathetic about the children dying such a painful death .
Under the society and the regime I was in at the time , I only felt that they were the enemies .
So I felt no sympathy or pity for them at all . '
His testimony is backed up by Soon Ok - lee , who was imprisoned for seven years .
' An officer ordered me to select 50 healthy female prisoners , ' she said .
' One of the guards handed me a basket full of soaked cabbage , told me not to eat it but to give it to the 50 women .
I gave them out and heard a scream from those who had eaten them .
They were all screaming and vomiting blood .
All who ate the cabbage leaves started violently vomiting blood and screaming with pain .
It was hell .
In less than 20 minutes they were quite dead . '
Defectors have smuggled out documents that appear to reveal how methodical the chemical experiments were .
One stamped ' top secret ' and ' transfer letter ' is dated February 2002 .
The name of the victim was Lin Hun - hwa .
He was 39 .
The text reads : ' The above person is transferred from ... camp number 22 for the purpose of human experimentation of liquid gas for chemical weapons . '
Kim Sang -hun , a North Korean human rights worker , says the document is genuine .
He said : ' It carries a North Korean format , the quality of paper is North Korean and it has an official stamp of agencies involved with this human experimentation .
A stamp they can not deny .
And it carries names of the victim and where and why and how these people were experimented [ on ] . '
The number of prisoners held in the North Korean gulag is not known : one estimate is 200,000 , held in 12 or more centres .
Camp 22 is thought to hold 50,000 .
Most are imprisoned because their relatives are believed to be critical of the regime .
Many are Christians , a religion believed by Kim Jong - il to be one of the greatest threats to his power .
According to the dictator , not only is a suspected dissident arrested but also three generations of his family are imprisoned , to root out the bad blood and seed of dissent .
With North Korea trying to win concessions in return for axing its nuclear programme , campaigners want human rights to be a part of any deal .
Richard Spring ,
Tory foreign affairs spokesman , is pushing for a House of Commons debate on human rights in North Korea .
' The situation is absolutely horrific , ' Spring said .
' It is totally unacceptable by any norms of civilised society .
It makes it even more urgent to convince the North Koreans that procuring weapons of mass destruction must end , not only for the security of the region but for the good of their own population . '
Mervyn Thomas , chief executive of Christian Solidarity Worldwide , said : ' For too long the horrendous suffering of the people of North Korea , especially those imprisoned in unspeakably barbaric prison camps , has been met with silence ...
It is imperative that the international community does not continue to turn a blind eye to these atrocities which should weigh heavily on the world 's conscience . '

1 There went our best chance :
In the ninth century , a team of Chinese alchemists trying to synthesize an " elixir of immortality " from saltpeter , sulfur , realgar , and dried honey instead invented gunpowder .
2 German scientist Hennig Brand stored 50 buckets of urine in his cellar for months in 1675 , hoping that it would turn into gold .
Instead , an obscure mix of alchemy and chemistry yielded a waxy , glowing goo that spontaneously burst into flame — the element now known as phosphorus .
3 Soldiers supplied the raw material in vast , sloshing quantities until the 1750s , when Swedish chemist Carl Scheele developed an industrial method of producing phosphorus .
He discovered eight other elements , including chlorine , oxygen , and nitrogen , and compounds like ammonia , glycerin , and prussic acid .
4 Scheele was found dead in his lab at age 43 , perhaps owing to his propensity for tasting his own toxic chemicals .
5 Kevlar , superglue , cellophane , Post - it notes , photographs , and the phonograph :
They all emerged from laboratory blunders .
6 The Flash , created in 1940 for All - American Publications , was the first comic book hero to develop superpowers after a lab accident , attaining " super speed " after inhaling " hard water " vapors .
7
Other beneficiaries of the Freak Lab Mishap include Plastic Man ( struck by a falling drum full of acid ) , the Hulk ( irradiated by an experimental bomb ) , and of course , Spider - Man ( bitten by a radioactive spider ) .
8
In real life , perhaps a bigger risk comes from lab - contracted diseases .
The world 's last documented case of smallpox killed photographer Janet Parker in 1978 after the virus escaped from a lab at the University of Birmingham in England .
9
But sometimes humans strike back : Alexander Fleming , famous for his serendipitous discovery of penicillin , also chanced upon an antibiotic enzyme in nasal mucus when he sneezed onto a bacterial sample and noticed that his snot kept the microbes in check .
10 The lab - accident rate in schools and colleges is 100 to 1,000 times greater than at firms like Dow or DuPont .
11 In 1938 DuPont chemist Roy Plunkett opened a dud canister of tetrafluoroethylene gas and discovered an amazing , nearly friction - free white powder .
He named it Teflon .
12 Perhaps he should have chucked it out instead :
In 2005 the Environmental Protection Agency identified a Teflon ingredient , perfluorooctanoic acid , as a " likely carcinogen . "
It is now in the bloodstream of 95 percent of Americans .
13 After a 1992 drug trial in the Welsh mining town of Merthyr Tydfil , male subjects reported that sildenafil citrate had n't done much for their angina , but it did have an unusual side effect on another part of their anatomy .
Today the drug is sold as Viagra .
14 In 1943 Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman inadvertently absorbed a small quantity of lysergic acid through his fingertips and experienced " dizziness . . . visual distortions . . . [ a ] desire to laugh . "
The age of LSD had begun .
15 Hoffman 's long , strange trip continues .
He turned 100 this past January .
16
Why he's not the father of the electric chair :
While trying to electrocute a turkey , Benjamin Franklin sent a whopping jolt from two Leyden jars into his own body .
" The flash was very great and the crack as loud as a Pistol , " he wrote , describing the incident as an " Experiment in Electricity that I desire never to repeat . "
17 In 1965 astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson scrubbed their Bell Labs radio antenna to rid it of pigeon droppings , which they suspected were causing the instrument 's annoying steady hiss .
18 That noise turned out to be the microwave echo of the Big Bang .
19 The world has scores of superpowerful particle accelerators .
Last year , a fireball created at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in Upton , New York , had the characteristics of a black hole .
Physicists are reasonably sure that no such black holes could escape and consume Earth .
20 Reasonably .

Here 's an illuminating research study that was presented at a major European conference in September , 2006 .
It reports on the daily pattern of blood sugars of a group of normal subjects as revealed by continuous blood sugar monitoring .
It gives a very solid answer to the question , " What is a normal blood sugar ? "
What is Normal Glucose ?
– Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data from Healthy Subjects .
Professor J.S. Christiansen , presented at the Annual Meeting of the EASD .
Above is a very revealing graph screen - captured from the dynamic display of this presentation .
Click on the image to enlarge it so you can read it better .
It shows analysis of data from a study of normal people 's blood sugars after a high carbohydrate breakfast eaten at 7:30 AM .
The blue line is the average for the group .
The brown lines are the readings for the people with the highest and lowest individual values which very possibly are those with the highest ( 5.4 % ) and lowest ( 4.3 % ) A1Cs .
The main findings here , for those of you who do n't have the high speed internet connection needed to listen to this presentation , is that in normal people fasting blood glucose throughout the night stays flat in the low 80 mg / dl ( 4.4 mmol / L ) range .
After a high carb meal , blood sugar rises to about 125 mg / dl for a brief period , with the peak blood sugar being measured at 45 minutes after eating .
The chart at the top of this page is taken from this presentation .
Notice that in all but the people with the highest A1cs , blood sugar is under 100 mg / dl ( 5.5 mmol / L ) at 1 hour and 15 minutes after eating and it returns to 85 mg / dl ( 4.7 mmol / L ) by 1 hour and 45 minutes after eating .
Note also , how much lower even the highest of these normal readings are than the ADA 's diagnostic cutoff for " impaired glucose tolerance " which is 140 mg / dl two hours after eating !
A few people in the study went as high as 160 mg / dl ( 8.9 mmol / L ) after the high carb meal , which may be because they are not entirely normal .
The study most likely recruited normal subjects based on their A1cs and the highest values in the group went up to 5.4 % which is compatible with very early deterioration in first phase insulin secretion .
This study also documents that eating a high carb meal for breakfast results in an unacceptably high blood sugar swing much higher than any other blood sugar rise seen throughout the day , even for normal people , a point that the professor stresses in his presentation .
So throw out the Corn Flakes !
An actor dressed as a bee was showing mistreating animals
The group , Peta , criticised al - Aqsa TV for the children 's show in which an actor was swinging cats around by their tails and throwing stones at lions .
The show 's host said afterwards that children should not behave like this .
The show was criticised in June for featuring a character in a Mickey Mouse suit , denouncing Israel and the US .
The character was later shown being beaten to death by an actor who played an Israeli agent .
' Sickening '
The episode about the Gaza zoo featured in the al - Aqsa TV children 's programme - Tomorrow 's Pioneers - last week .
In it , an actor dressed as a bee was swinging cats around by their tails and also throwing stones at lions in their cages .
The episode was reportedly aimed at teaching children not to abuse animals .
But it drew strong criticism from Peta ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) after it was posted on YouTube video - sharing website by Palestinian Media Watch group .
" It 's shocking and sickening , " Peta 's Martin Mersereau told Reuters news agency .
" Any lessons meant to be contained in this segment are almost certainly lost on most children , who are more likely to imitate people they see treating animals cruelly rather than understand this behaviour is wrong , " he said .
So far there have been no comments from al - Aqsa TV officials .
I just saw in the San Jose Mercury News issue for last Sunday that Meebo got $ 3.5 M from Sequoia Capital .
If this is not the start of Bust 2.0 then I am not sure what is ( may be its the end of Bubble 2.0 ? )
Meebo has a simple Ajax / DHTML based UI that lets you connect to IM networks through a web browser .
The UI is cool and everything , but the only reason Meebo had such strong growth was that large corporations and government offices around the world block the standard IM ports for security and productivity reasons .
Meebo represented a loophole and got tons of users that way .
For example , my mother is a general manager in the tax authority in Egypt ( the equivalent of the IRS here ) , and she was very upset when the government offices closed all IM ports last year ; she now loves Meebo , its her only way to IM while at work .
The question is : how long do you think it will be until these corporations start to block meebo.com ?
and why would Sequoia fund something like that ?
Are they “ betting ” these 3 gals can build lots of other interesting web apps ?
Sorry Meebo , but my prediction is that you are going down .

A glut of vacant , unsold homes with swimming pools is contributing to a glut of mosquitoes in the West .
An untended pool means stagnant water , a breeding ground for mosquitoes to lay eggs that can produce thousands of mosquitoes in a couple of weeks .
" They become these little backyard swamps , " says John Townsend , who runs the mosquito - control office in Arizona 's Maricopa County .
" Mosquitoes move in and breed up a storm . "
Luis Navarro , a mosquito - control officer in Maricopa County , says mortgage foreclosures have brought him more business this year .
Some owners do n't drain pools when they move out , and pools that were drained collect rainwater , he says .
Even a properly treated pool can become a haven for mosquito larvae in the heat as chemicals break down faster , allowing the growth of algae and mosquito food sources such as zooplankton , Navarro says .
David Brown , manager of the Sacramento and Yolo County , Calif. , mosquito - control office , says growing concern over the mosquito - borne West Nile virus is prompting expanded efforts to identify problem pools .
Last year , 4,269 people in the USA contracted the West Nile virus , and 177 died from it , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Eradication strategies : • Sacramento's mosquito - control operation has asked the Sacramento Association of Realtors for a list of vacant homes with swimming pools .
Since May , 400 pools have been reported .
" It 's really a community effort , " Brown says .
" We are trying to enlist everyone . "
Technicians follow up , visiting pools to spread chemicals to kill the larvae and add mosquito - eating fish to the water .
•
In Maricopa County , the sheriff 's office spots potential backyard breeding grounds from a helicopter or plane .
Townsend says 5 % - 10 % of the county 's 300,000 pools are poorly maintained .
He gets at least 200 complaints a week about algae in pools .
" You can have one bad swimming pool , and it can basically become a blight of the neighborhood , " he says .
Thousands of mosquitoes can breed in one pool , live for more than a month and travel more than a mile , he says .
• The Southern Nevada Health District , which includes pool - packed Las Vegas , relies on neighbors ' complaints to identify pools green with algae .
By June 25 , the district's " green pool " count outpaced last year 's numbers by more than a fourth .
Many involved vacant homes in the process of foreclosure , environmental health supervisor Mark Bergtholdt says .
•
In central California 's Santa Clara County , mosquito fighters say they can't check each pool and that people are hesitant to report their neighbors , so the county hires a plane to take aerial photos , says Kriss Costa , community resource specialist .
•
The Coachella Valley mosquito - control office in Southern California teaches " backyard maintenance " at homeowners association meetings .
Robert Mann , public information officer , says the office needs homeowners to report dirty pools because " backyard sources are the hardest to detect . "
Backyard maintenance is easy , he says : " It 's basically walking around and dumping any container that can hold standing water . "

In my first post to this blog I said I was working on a book about programming in groups .
A few weeks ago I met with Gary Cornell the CEO of Apress and my editor on Practical Common Lisp to talk about my book idea .
His reaction was , more or less , “ That ’s interesting but I ’ve got another book you should do first . ”
So , as of today I ’m working on a book , tentatively titled Coders at Work , which will be a collection of Q&A interviews with interesting programmers .
1
It will also be a companion volume to Apress ’s recently published Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston , which is a collection of interviews with founders of high - tech startups .
I hope soon to have a web site set up where I ’ll be putting up pages listing people I ’m hoping to interview and collecting suggestions for possible subjects and questions to ask them .
I ’ll post here when it ’s up .
In the meantime , if there ’s anyone you think would make an interesting interview subject or questions you think I should ask let me know .

CNN Arabic commissioned a public opinion survey on the al - Adhamiya wall and found that 76 % of Iraqis reject " establishing isolation walls ... to reduce sectarian violence " .
I would guess that David Kilcullen and other American strategists might respond that this is just the outcome of a successful al - Qaeda information operation .
But even if that were true - which I doubt - it would n't change the political reality which now exists of widespread , intense hostility to the wall project .
Blaming it on al - Qaeda or on the Arab media does n't change that .
Ignoring those attitudes or dismissing them as the product of political manipulation shows exactly a contemptuous disrespect for Iraqi opinion which infuriates and alienates them .
It reminds me quite a lot of earlier periods of the American occupation , where American officials complained about the Arab media 's " incitement " and " distortions " so much that they lost sight of the real problems on the ground and lost touch with real Iraqi attitudes - exactly the sort of mistake which the new team promised not to repeat .
Here 's why this is so dangerous .
American officials have repeatedly argued that the point of the " surge " and the Baghdad security plan is to create a temporarily secure space which would allow for political reconciliation .
Petraeus and his supporters say ( correctly ) that there 's no purely military solution - the strategy depends upon the military escalation producing political results .
But the Adhamiya situation suggests that tactics are once again taking the place of strategy .
That the wall apparently is going ahead for ' security ' reasons despite its major negative repercussions in the political realm is a clear red flag .
If political reconciliation is going nowhere , even deteriorating , then the strategy is failing on the terms laid out by its own architects .
The controversy over the wall is obviously only small part of a much larger political crisis , but it's an alarming indicator of where things seem to be going .
In the desert , just across the Mediterranean sea , is a vast source of energy that holds the promise of a carbon - free , nuclear - free electrical future for the whole of Europe , if not the world .
We are not talking about the vast oil and gas deposits underneath Algeria and Libya , or uranium for nuclear plants , but something far simpler - the sun .
And in vast quantities : every year it pours down the equivalent of 1.5 m barrels of oil of energy for every square kilometre .
Most people in Britain think of solar power as a few panels on the roof of a house producing hot water or a bit of electricity .
But according to two reports prepared for the German government , Europe , the Middle East and North Africa should be building vast solar farms in North Africa 's deserts using a simple technology that more resembles using a magnifying glass to burn a hole in a piece of paper than any space age technology .
Two German scientists , Dr Gerhard Knies and Dr Franz Trieb , calculate that covering just 0.5 % of the world 's hot deserts with a technology called concentrated solar power ( CSP ) would provide the world 's entire electricity needs , with the technology also providing desalinated water to desert regions as a valuable byproduct , as well as air conditioning for nearby cities .
Focusing on Europe , North Africa and the Middle East , they say , Europe should build a new high - voltage direct current electricity grid to allow the easy , efficient transport of electricity from a variety of alternative sources .
Britain could put in wind power , Norway hydro , and central Europe biomass and geo - thermal .
Together the region could provide all its electricity needs by 2050 with barely any fossil fuels and no nuclear power .
This would allow a 70 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production over the period .
CSP technology is not new .
There has been a plant in the Mojave desert in California for the past 15 years .
Others are being built in Nevada , southern Spain and Australia .
There are different forms of CSP but all share in common the use of mirrors to concentrate the sun 's rays on a pipe or vessel containing some sort of gas or liquid that heats up to around 400C ( 752 F ) and is used to power conventional steam turbines .
The mirrors are very large and create shaded areas underneath which can be used for horticulture irrigated by desalinated water generated by the plants .
The cold water that can also be produced for air conditioning means there are three benefits .
" It is this triple use of the energy which really boost the overall energy efficiency of these kinds of plants up to 80 % to 90 % , " says Dr Knies .
This form of solar power is also attractive because the hot liquid can be stored in large vessels which can keep the turbines running for hours after the sun has gone down , avoiding the problems association with other forms of solar power .
Competitive with oil
The German reports put an approximate cost on power derived from CSP .
This is now around $ 50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the cost of building a plant .
That cost is likely to fall sharply , to about $ 20 , as the production of the mirrors reaches industrial levels .
It is about half the equivalent cost of using the photovoltaic cells that people have on their roofs .
So CSP is competitive with oil , currently priced around $ 60 a barrel .
Dr Knies says CSP is not yet competitive with natural gas for producing electricity alone .
But if desalination and air conditioning are added CSP undercuts gas and that is without taking into account the cost of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels .
The researchers say a relatively small amount of the world 's hot deserts - only about half a percent - would need to be covered in solar collectors to provide the entire world 's electrical needs ( see map ) .
The desert land is plentiful and cheap but , more importantly , there is roughly three times as much sunlight in hot deserts as in northern Europe .
This is why the reports recommend a collaboration between countries of Europe , the Middle East and Africa to construct a high - voltage direct current ( HVDC ) grid for the sharing of carbon - free energy .
Alternating current cables , which now form the main electricity grids in Europe , are not suitable for long distance transport of electricity because too much is lost on the way .
Dr Trieb , of the German Air and Space Agency , says the advantage of DC cables is that the loss in transport is only about 3 % per 1,000 kilometres , meaning losses between North Africa and Britain of about 10 % .
" Contrary to what is commonly supposed it is entirely feasible , and cost - effective , to transmit solar electricity over long distances .
Solar electricity imported to Europe would be amongst the cheapest source of electricity and that includes transporting it , " he says .
" CSP imports would be much less vulnerable to interruption than are current imports of gas , oil and uranium . "
Algeria already exports huge quantities of oil and gas to Europe via pipelines but has a vast potential resource in sunlight that could make it a complete energy supplier to Europe .
Many members of the Opec oil cartel , which have worried that alternative energies would kill demand for their oil , are blessed with hot , sunny deserts that could become a further source of energy income .
The two reports make it clear that an HVDC grid around Europe and North Africa could provide enough electricity by 2050 to make it possible to phase out nuclear power and hugely reduce use of fossil fuels .
An umbrella group of scientists has been formed across the region called the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation ( Trec ) but the idea has yet to excite the imagination of the British government in spite of the recent Stern review on climate change .
Neil Crumpton , renewables specialist at Friends of the Earth , said : " Most politicians on the world stage , particularly Tony Blair and George Bush , appear to have little or no awareness of CSP 's potential let alone a strategic vision for using it to help build global energy and climate security . "
European commission president José Manuel Barroso said recently that he wanted to see the European Union develop a common energy strategy based on low carbon emissions .
The Trec scientists hope German chancellor Angela Merkel will use next year 's joint presidency of the EU and Group of Eight leading economies to push for an agreement on a European DC grid and the launch of a widespread CSP programme .
The outlook is not promising .
More than 30 countries last week agreed to spend £ 7bn on an experimental fusion reactor in France which critics say will not produce any electricity for 50 years , if at all .
That amount of money would provide a lot of CSP power , a proven , working and simple technology that would work now , not in 2056 .
Safer and cheaper
Dan Lewis , energy expert at the Economic Research Council , calculates that CSP costs $ 3 - 5 m per installed megawatt , one - fifth the cost of fusion .
" Fusion is basically a job creation scheme for plasma physicists . "
Mr Crumpton agreed : " Nuclear power accounts for just 3.1 % of global energy supply and would be hard pushed to provide more .
Yet CSP could supply 30 % or 300 % of future energy demand far more simply , safely and cost effectively .
In the wake of the Stern report the enlightened investment is on hot deserts , not uranium mines or oil wells . "
For some reason , standing up for our country 's creed can be tough for some politicians , and it will be instructive to see who in the Senate will move to reverse the Bush administration 's trampling of our Constitution and who will stand idly by as we lose more of our national identity and witness further erosion of our global reputation .
Senator Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) signed on last week to cosponsor S.185 , the Habeas Corpus Restoration

When the Senate returns from recess on July 9 , all attention will turn to the Department of Defense authorization bill and , among what I 'm sure will be a flurry of amendments , will be S. 185 , a bill to " …restore habeas corpus for those detained by the United States .

These Democrats were joined by Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont in supporting S. 185 .
" Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last year ’s legislation .
I hope that the new Senate will reconsider this historic error in judgment and set the matter right , " said Patrick Leahy in the June 7 Judiciary Committee hearings .
" Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II , the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear and another stain on America ’s reputation in the world . "
" Whatever long - term counterterrorism strategy America pursues , it will be undermined if we fail to adhere to our longstanding American value , " said Russ Feingold in the same Judiciary hearings .
" We cannot begin to make a dent in terrorist recruitment and plotting worldwide without sending a clear message that the United States will adhere to the principles that make our country great . "
So , with 22 Democratic Senators supporting the restoration of habeas corpus , the logical question that follows is where are the others on something this central to true American values ?
It 's one thing , though not necessarily the right thing , for a Gulf Coast Senator to shy away from openly supporting an oil - drilling ban or a Michigan lawmaker to balk at anything that might hurt the auto industry , but restoring rights that Team Bush has gutted from our Constitution seems like something that should get unanimous support -- at least among members of the Democratic party .
Here 's the list of Democratic Senators who need to hear from you .
Even if they intend to vote for the Habeas Corpus Restoration
Act of 2007 when it comes to the Senate floor next month , they need to be pushed further to stand up and cosponsor this important component in taking back our country :

“ Did someone leave the radio on in the bathroom ? ” I asked Jared .
There was a faint sound of classical music .
“ No .
It ’s coming from outside .
It started while you were away and happens every night . ”
We live in an apartment building in New York .
There are neighbors on all sides .
We ’re used to hearing TV shows from below , and the little kid in the apartment directly above us has a favorite game : throwing a bunch of marbles on the floor and then throwing himself around the room violently .
I ’m not sure how you keep score .
As I write this , he ’s running rapidly from room to room crashing into things .
I ca n’t wait until he ’s old enough for paintball .
Anyway .
This classical - music - late - at - night thing had never happened before .
Worse , it was some kind of sturm - und - drang romantic crap that was making me angry right when I wanted to fall asleep .
Eventually , the music stopped , and I was able to drift off to sleep .
But the next night , when the music resumed at midnight , I was really worn out , and it was more self - important Wagner rubbish , with pompous crescendos that consistently woke me up every time I finally drifted off to sleep , and I had no choice but to go sit in the living room and look at pictures of lolcats until it stopped , which it finally did , around 1 am .
The next night I had had enough .
When the music started at about midnight , I got dressed and started exploring the apartment building .
I crept around the halls , listening at every door , trying to figure out where the music came from .
I poked my head out windows and found an unlocked door leading to an airshaft where the music was amazingly loud .
I climbed up and down the stairs , and listened closely from the window on each and every landing , until I was pretty convinced that the problem was from dear old Mrs.
C’s apartment , # 2B , directly below us .
I did n’t think Mrs. C , who is probably in her 60s , was even awake that late , let alone listening to music loudly , but I briefly entertained the possibility that the local classical music station was doing the Ring Cycle or something and she was staying up late to hear it .
Not bloody likely .
One thing I had noticed was that the music seemed to go on at midnight every night , and off at 1:00 am .
Somehow , that made me think it was a clock radio , which probably had the alarm factory set to 12:00 .
I could n’t bring myself to wake up an old lady downstairs on the mere suspicion that music was coming from her apartment .
Frustrated , I went back to my apartment and caught up on xkcd .
I was depressed and angry , because I had n’t solved the problem .
I festered and scowled all the next day .
The next evening , I knocked on Mrs. C ’s door .
The super had told me she was going away for the entire summer the next day so if the problem was coming from her apartment I better find out pronto .
“ Sorry to bother you , ” I said .
“ I ’ve noticed that every night around midnight there ’s loud classical music coming from the airshaft behind our apartments and it ’s keeping me awake . ”
“ Oh no , it ’s not me ! ” she insisted , as I suspected she would .
Of course not : she probably goes to sleep at a completely normal hour and certainly never plays loud music that bothers the neighbors !
I thought she was a little hard of hearing and probably never noticed the thing blaring away from her spare room in the middle of the night .
Or maybe she was a good sleeper .
It took a few minutes , but I finally convinced her to check if there was any kind of clock radio in the room below my window .
Turns out there was .
Right in an open window beneath my own bedroom window .
When I saw that it was tuned to 96.3 , WQXR , I knew I had found the culprit .
“ Oh , that thing ?
I have no idea how to use that thing .
I never use it , ” she said .
“ I ’ll disconnect it completely . ”
“ Not necessary , ” I said , and turned off the alarm , set the volume to zero , and , in my late - onset OCD , set the clock to the exact time .
Mrs. C was terribly apologetic , but it really was n’t her fault .
It took me — me !— quite a while to figure out how to operate the damn clock radio , and let me tell you , sonny boy , I know a thing or two about clock radios .
The UI was terrible .
Your average little old lady did n’t stand a chance .
Is it the clock radio ’s fault ?
Sort of .
It was too hard to use .
It had an alarm that continued to go off daily even if nobody touched it the day before , which is not the greatest idea .
And there ’s no reason to reset the alarm time to midnight after a power outage .
7:00 am would be a completely civilized default .
Somehow , over the last few weeks , I ’ve become hypercritical .
I ’m always looking for flaws in things , and when I find them , I become single - minded about fixing them .
It ’s a particular frame of mind , actually , that software developers get into when they ’re in the final debugging phase of a new product .
Over the last few weeks , I ’ve been writing all the documentation for the next big version of FogBugz .
As I write things , I try them out , either to make sure they work the way I think they should , or to get screenshots .
And every hour or so , bells go off .
“ Wait a minute !
What just happened ?
That ’s not supposed to work like that ! ”
And since it ’s software , I can always fix it .
HA HA !
Just kidding !
I ca n’t make head or tail out of the code any more .
I enter a bug and someone with a clue fixes it .
Dave Winer says , “ To create a usable piece of software , you have to fight for every fix , every feature , every little accommodation that will get one more person up the curve .
There are no shortcuts .
Luck is involved , but you do n’t win by being lucky , it happens because you fought for every inch . “
Commercial software — the kind you sell to other people — is a game of inches .
Every day you make a tiny bit of progress .
You make one thing just a smidgen better .
You make the alarm clock default to 7:00 am instead of 12:00 midnight .
A tiny improvement that will barely benefit anyone .
One inch .
There are thousands and tens of thousands of these tiny things .
It takes a mindset of constant criticism to find them .
You have to reshape your mind until you ’re finding fault with everything .
Your significant others go nuts .
Your family wants to kill you .
When you ’re walking to work and you see a driver do something stupid , it takes all your willpower to resist going up to the driver and explaining to him why he nearly killed that poor child in the wheelchair .
And as you fix more and more of these little details , as you polish and shape and shine and craft the little corners of your product , something magical happens .
The inches add up to feet , the feet add up to yards , and the yards add up to miles .
And you ship a truly great product .
The kind of product that feels great , that works intuitively , that blows people away .
The kind of product where that one - in - a - million user doing that one - in - a - million unusual thing finds that not only does it work , but it ’s beautiful : even the janitor ’s closets of your software have marble floors and solid core oak doors and polished mahogany wainscoting .
And that ’s when you know it ’s great software .
Congratulations to the FogBugz 6.0 team , outlandishly good players of the game of inches , who shipped their first beta today , on track for final release at the end of the summer .
This is the best product they ’ve ever produced .
It will blow you away .
There ’s a bunch of techniques for doing deployments of long - running processes ( Zope , Python server , Rails , etc ) .
A pretty good technique is to do HTTP proxying .
There ’s some details and conventions I ’d like to see for HTTP , but that ’s not my concern here .
HTTP proxying is n’t great for commodity hosting .
Mostly you need to set up a new long - running process , and commodity hosts do n’t make that easy or reliable .
FastCGI offers one solution to that , essentially putting the process management into Apache or whatever web server you are using .
The problem with FastCGI is that it is finicky .
There ’s lots of configuration parameters , lots of parts do n’t work right , and there seems to be a golden path where things actually work but it ’s hard to know exactly what that is .
Another technique that has been used in the past instead of FastCGI is a very small CGI script .
One example in SCGI is called cgi2scgi .
This small script is fast to run ( it compiles to 12 kb ) , and all it does is take the CGI request and turn it into a SCGI request to a long - running server .
This is a nice start , and easy to deploy , except it does n’t handle long - running processes .
A great feature to add to something like this would be simple process management .
I imagine something where if the socket ( named or a port ) that the cgi2scgi script connects to is n’t up or working , it runs a script that will start the server .
If another request comes in while the server is starting up , it should n’t try to start the server twice .
If the server is randomly killed ( as is common on commodity hosters ) then the next request will try to bring the server up .
Unlike FastCGI , this wo n’t try to handle different process models or anything fancy .
It ’s up to the startup script to set everything up properly , start multiple worker processes if necessary , etc .
There ’s probably some tricky details I have n’t thought of , and it ’s slightly annoying to write all this in C ( but necessary , since it ’s part of the CGI script , which must be small ) .
But I think it can be done better than existing in - the - wild FastCGI implementations .
And when we ’re done , I think we could have something that would be a really good basis for commodity hosting of a whole bunch of non-PHP frameworks .
You can distribute the Linux binaries , as all the Commodity Hosts That Matter can run those ( even the BSD ones should be fine ) .
Easy application installation practically falls right out of that .
... making Linux just a little more fun !
OCaml , an Introduction
By Jurjen Stellingwerff
Object Caml is an ML type of language .
For the non-gurus : it 's a functional language that can also be programmed in a non-functional and object - oriented way .
This language is really easy to learn .
It 's powerful and keeps impressing me with its speed .
Programs written in this language are almost always stable by default .
No segmentation faults , only occasional unending loops for the programmers that still hang on to program their own loops .
It is really not needed to write most loops , since the libraries contain standard functions that are good enough in 99 % of the cases .
So try to use those functions :
It really pays off in terms of stability of your programs , and , unless you have intimate knowledge of the inner works of this language , they tend to be better optimised .
The language can be obtained from the website caml.inria.fr .
Here , they provide RPMs for the RedHat 7.2/8.0/9 and Mandrake 8.0 distributions .
Also MS
Windows binaries are available , but not all Unix library functions will work there , for some mysterious reason .
The source tarball does compile flawlessly for me .
It just has a somewhat unusual makefile layout :
# ./ configure # make world ; make opt ; make install
The normal libraries include many usable data - structures like balanced trees , hash tables , and streams .
Their version of header files ( .mli files ) contain all the basic documentation you need , and those are directly converted into HTML and published on the Web in their OCaml manual .
This manual is not very usable to study this language , so I 'll try to explain here some of the basic language constructions .
This is just to give you an impression of the power of this language .
Modules & Functions
Now some real life examples .
I wrote a program to help administrating a computer .
It is a subset of a normal file finder , but is a command line tool and very fast .
It helps locating large , not - recently - used files to be deleted from the system .
It crawls through the directory tree and show the contents in different layouts .
Every module in OCaml has its own namespace .
Specific definitions can be found by adding the module name , with the first character an upper - case character .
You can also change the namespace of the current program to include a total module .
Normally , only the standard module ' pervasives.mli ' is included in the default namespace .
The example program ' show.ml ' starts with :
open Basics open Unix open Unix .
LargeFile
This includes my own set of ' basics ' functions and 2 standard libraries : ' Unix ' and ' Unix . Large File ' .
A module normally consists of 2 files .
The first file for exporting definitions ' module.mli ' ( like the C .h file ) , and the second one for actual code ( the ' module.ml ' file ) .
The program uses the function ' string_sub ' that provides a foolproof version of the ' String. sub ' standard function ( from the string . mli module ) .
The basics.mli file contains the lines :
val string_sub : string -> int -> int -> string (**
Get the sub string from a [ string ] from position [ from ] with [ length ] .
This is the same function as String.sub , but it will never raise an exception .
And a negative [ from ] value is counted from the right side of the string . *)
This gives the definition of this function and the description .
There is an automatic documentation generator ( ocamldoc ) that reads .mli files and writes .html files as basic interface documentation .
Normal comments start with ( * but the documentation generator only writes comments that start with ( ** to the .html files .
This document contains links to the documentation of the used modules .
This documentation is really helpful to start programming ocaml .
The .mli files are all included in the distribution , but the complete manual and a book can be downloaded from the Web site caml.inria.fr
The function is followed by its type .
It wants 3 parameters and provides a string .
Normally we need to write ' Basics.string_sub ' to use this function .
But after the ' open Basics ' instruction just ' string_sub ' is enough .
Basic operations and function calls
Now , back to the main program again .
The first function is ' gettype ' .
It will try to return the type of a file .
The file type is defined as the part of the filename following the last '.'.
When there is no dot , the type is unknown and returned empty .
let gettype file = try let pos = String . rindex file '. ' in String.sub file ( pos+1 ) ( String.length file - pos - 1 ) with Not_found -> " " ;;
This function only uses standard functions .
First , it catches the Not_found exception in the ' try ' ' with Not_found -> " " ' code .
All other exceptions will be passed to the caller to be handled , and can possibly stop the main program .
The local variable pos get is filled with the result of the function rindex .
This function is also the reason to catch the exception ; otherwise , the main program might stop on the first found file with no '. ' in it .
Local variables can be declared everywhere inside ocaml with ' let < variable > = < value > in < code > ' .
After the completion of the given code , the variable is out of scope and will be forgotten .
The data will be passed to the garbage collector to be removed from memory .
Function calls do normally use brackets .
The function call to ' String.sub ' gets 3 parameters the string ' file ' the integer ' ( pos+1 ) ' and the integer '( String.length file - pos - 1 ) ' .
The last parameter calls the function ' String.length ' with a single parameter ' file ' .
So , the functions are eager for their parameters ; brackets are needed only when the parameters are filled with calculations .
Also '(+ ) ' and '( - ) ' are functions of the pervasives module .
It is very easy to define your own operators ; just add brackets around their definition , and they are ready .
If then else
The next routine ' filesize ' in the example code is far longer , but largely introduces sub- functions and ' if < bool - expr > then < expr > else < expr > ' statements .
This function creates a string from an int64 number for human readable file and directory sizes .
The types of parameters are normally not given ; they are determined by ocaml through their usage .
When something is not clear , the compiler or interpreter will complain about it before executing the code .
let filesize s = let tostr f = if f>9.9 then string_of_int ( int_of_float ( f +. 0.5 ) ) else let res = string_of_float ( floor ( f *. 10.0 +. 0.5 ) /. 10.0 ) in if String . length res=2 then res ^ " 0 " else res in let bytes =
Int64.to_ float s in if bytes > 512.0 then let kb = bytes /. 1024.0 in if kb > 512.0 then let mb = kb /. 1024.0 in if mb > 512.0 then let gb = mb /. 1024.0 in tostr gb ^ " Gb " else tostr mb ^ " Mb " else tostr kb ^ " kb " else Int64.to_string s ;;
The ocaml standard library has a set of conversion functions .
These functions normally follow the form of ' int_of_float ' and ' string_of_float ' .
Specific types like ' Int64 ' use shorthand notations like ' Int64.to_float ' .
String concatenations are done with the operation ' ( ^ ) ' .
Normally , functions are defined for only one specific type , so there are new sets of arithmetic functions for floats like '( +. ) ' , '(*. ) ' and '( /. ) ' .
The ' tostr ' sub-function has some extra calculation to change something like ' 5 .
Gb ' into the nicer form of ' 5.0 Gb ' .
List notation and type conversion
The next function , ' converttime ' , converts a string into a float .
OCaml uses floats for date for 2 reasons .
The first is to prevent possible Year 2 k problems , and can also be used for less than one - second time measurements .
The function accepts English acronyms for month names .
So let 's introduce the list and the pair to create a translation of acronyms into numbers .
let month = [ ( " jan " , 0 ) ; ( " feb " , 1 ) ; ( " mar " , 2 ) ; ( " apr " , 3 ) ; ( " may " , 4 ) ; ( " jun " , 5 ) ; ( " jul " , 6 ) ; ( " aug " , 7 ) ; ( " sep " , 8 ) ; ( " oct " , 9 ) ; ( " nov " , 10 ) ; ( " dec " , 11 ) ] ;;
This list is totally static , and can be used easily by the standard function List.assoc to convert a string into the corresponding number .
let converttime str = try begin match if str > " a " && str < " z " then ( int_of_string ( string_sub str ( String.rindex str ' ' +1 ) 99 ) , List.assoc ( string_sub str 0 3 ) month , 1 ) else ( int_of_string ( string_sub str 0 ( try String. index str ' -' with Not_found -> 99 ) ) , ( try let pos=String . index str ' - '+1 in int_of_string ( string_sub str pos ( try String.index_from str pos '- '- pos with err -> 99 ) ) - 1 with err -> 0 ) , ( try let pos=String . index str ' - '+1 in int_of_string ( string_sub str ( String.index_from str pos '- ' +1 ) 99 ) with err -> 1 ) ) with ( yr , mn , md ) -> (* print_string ( " Last access before : " ^ string_of_int ( if yr < 50 then yr+2000 else if yr < 100 then yr+1900 else yr ) ^ " - " ^ string_of_int ( mn+1 ) ^ " - " ^ string_of_int md ^ "
" ) ; *) fst ( mktime { tm_sec = 0 ; tm_min = 0 ; tm_hour = 0 ; tm_mday = md ; tm_mon = mn ; tm_year = if yr < 50 then yr+100 else if yr< 100 then yr else yr-1900 ; tm_wday = 0 ; tm_yday = 0 ; tm_isdst = false }) end with err -> print_string ( " Cannot decipher this date string ' " ^ str ^ " '
" ) ; max_float ;;
The new operation in this function is the ' match < expr > with < template > -> expr ' .
This is one of the most versatile instructions of ocaml .
It can be used to examine the contents of variables and get the needed information out of it .
This function creates the triplet ( year , month , day - of - month ) out of 2 different date notations .
To debug this function the ' print_string ' instruction is included but commented out to prevent clutter in the output of the program .
Normally there is some logging mechanism to make the extra messages optional for the user .
The ' print_string ' shows the ISO notation of the given date ; it creates a 4 - digits year and gives a month number with January =1 instead of the internal Unix use of January=0 .
This function also shows the use of ' try < expr > with err -> < expr > ' that caches every possible exception and fills the variable ' err ' with the details of the exception .
This function can raise quite a lot of different exceptions , and frankly I am not very interested in the details .
The routine just complains to the user about the given date string and gets over it .
It returns the maximal possible float to include every filename .
The main standard function is the ' Unix. mktime ' function .
It wants to get a record filled with numbers about the current time .
This function returns a pair with the needed float and a normalized record .
With the pervasives function fst returns just the first parameter of the pair .
The ' ;' before the ' max_float ' indicates that the expression results in a float , but the instructions before the ' ; ' are calculated first .
This is the first non-functional instruction inside the example code .
OCaml is not strictly functional , but has the full power of other functional languages .
Dynamic data structure
Now is the time for a real data structure that is dynamically build and can be used in a lot of different ways .
type entrytype = |
Dir of entry list (* directory with a list of files *) |
File of string (* a file inside a directory *) and entry = { mutable e_name : string ; (* name of a file or directory *) e_type : entrytype ; (* what type is this together with type related information *) e_atime : float ; (* last access time *) e_size : int64 ; (* size of the file or size of all the matching files in the directory *) }
The ' and ' statement is used to glue the two definitions together .
They are created at the same time so that ' entrytype ' can include ' entry ' and vice - versa .
' entrytype ' can consist one of 2 things : a directory with a list of entries or a file with its type .
The directory entry has a mutable name .
This is can be used later on to change a filename info the full path to that file .
As with ANSI C , the operators for Boolean algebra are ' ( && ) ' and ' ( | | ) ' .
Recursion
let rec dirwrite el depth sortfn = List.iter ( fun e -> match e.e_type with | Dir lst -> if e.e_size <>
Int64.of_int 0 then begin print_string ( ( String . make ( depth * 2 ) ' ') ^ " Directory " ^ e.e_name ^ " = ( " ^ filesize e.e_size ^ " )
" ) ; dirwrite lst ( depth+1 ) sortfn end | File string -> print_string ( ( String . make ( depth * 2 ) ' ') ^ e.e_name ^ " ( " ^ filesize e.e_size ^ " )
" ) ) ( List.sort sortfn el ) ;;
Here is the recursive ( ' rec ' ) function ' dirwrite ' that traverses a given tree 'el ' and writes the result to the standard output .
The parameter ' depth ' indicates the amount of spaces to write a tree like structure of filenames .
The function sorts all the lists with the given function ' sortfn ' .
The new language structure here is ' fun < parm - 1 > ... < parm -n> -> < expr > '.
This construction creates a function without a name .
The parameters of this function like construction can be used like a template to match pairs .
This function suppresses directories that are 0 bytes in size to reduce clutter .
Variables vs. definitions
(* List of global variables *) let min_size = ref ( Int64.of_int 0 ) and (* minimum size of a file in bytes *) last_access = ref max_float and (* last access time in seconds since 1970 *) has_type = ref " " and (* type of file to show or empty to show all *) name_match = ref " " and (* regular expression to match the filename with ; empty is show all *) name_regexp = ref ( Str.regexp " " ) and (* pre-calculated regular expression *) no_symlinks = ref false (* do n't follow symbolic links to directories *) ;;
This is a list of variables that can be changed due to the 'ref < expr > ' construction .
Normally definitions are just a label to their contents .
These definitions are pointers to the memory and can be read by '!< variable > ' and written by ' < variable > := < expr > ' .
The parameters given to the program can make changes to the way the files are read .
let rec dirread path = let list = ref [ ] and size = ref ( Int64.of_int 0 ) in try let dh = opendir path in while true do let file = readdir dh in if file < > " .. " && file < > " . " && file <>" CVS " && String.sub file 0 1 <> " . " then let s=stat ( path^ " / " ^file ) in if s.st_kind = S_DIR && ( not ! no_symlinks || ( lstat ( path^ " / " ^file ) ) .
st_kind <> S_LNK ) then let dir = dirread ( path^ " / " ^file ) in list := { e_name = file ; e_type = Dir ( fst dir ) ; e_atime = s.st_atime ; e_size = snd dir } :: ! list ; size := Int64.add ! size ( snd dir ) else if ( ! has_type = " " || gettype file = ! has_type ) && s.st_size > ! min_size && s.st_atime < ! last_access && (!name_match = " " || Str.string_match !name_regexp file 0 ) then begin list := { e_name = file ; e_type = File ( gettype file ) ; e_atime = s.st_atime ; e_size = s.st_size ; } :: ! list ; size := Int64.add ! size s.st_size end done ; ( ! list , ! size ) with | End_of_file -> ( ! list , ! size ) | Unix_error ( EACCES , err , parm ) -> ( ! list , ! size ) ;;
The following functions are introduced in the function ' dirread ' :
Unix.opendir to start reading a directory .
Unix .readdir to read a filename .
Unix.stat for a record ( Unix.stats ) of statistics on a file .
Unix.lstat for statistics on a link .
Int64.add to add two int64 type of variables
Str.regexp to create a new interpreted regular expression
Str.string_match to match a string against a regular expression
Pervasives .( ::) to create a list with an extra element in front of the old one
Pervasives.true as a Boolean constant
Pervasives.snd to return the second part of a pair
exception Unix .
Unix_error ( EACCESS , err , parm ) that is raised when an access denied is encountered .
Small is beautiful
let rec flat el path = List. fold_right ( fun e ls -> match e.e_type with |
Dir lst -> flat lst ( path ^ " / " ^ e.e_name ) @ ls | File string -> e.e_name
This neat little routine ' flat ' hits the tree ' el ' flat on the ground .
It takes every file from every branch and creates a single list of all the encountered files .
This is done with one of the most versatile standard routines inside ocaml : the ' List. fold_right ' routine .
This routine introduces a state machine ( scarab ) that crawls over a list and operates on every encountered element .
It produces a new structure ( droppings ) as a result -- in this case , a flattened list .
The construction ' < record - field > <- < expr > ' changes the contents of a mutable record field .
Without mutable fields , you can mutate records only by creating a new one with lots of fields inherited from the old one .
This is a shortcut for that .
let name_order a b = compare a.e_name b.e_name ;; let type_order a b = let typea = match a.e_type with Dir ls -> " dir " | File tp -> tp and typeb = match b.e_type with Dir ls -> " dir " | File tp -> tp in if compare typea typeb = 0 then compare a.e_name b.e_name else compare typea typeb ;; let atime_order a b = compare a.e_atime b.e_atime ;;
A set of sorting functions to use inside ' dirwrite ' .
The function ' compare ' results in the widely used values of - 1 for lower than , 0 for equal and +1 for higher than .
Command line parameters let dir = ref " . " and sort = ref name_order and show = ref 0 in Arg. parse [ ( " - t " , Arg. Unit ( fun ( ) -> sort := type_order ) , " Sort by type and filename " ) ; ( " - l " , Arg. Unit ( fun ( ) -> sort := atime_order ) , " Sort by last access time " ) ; ( " - n " , Arg.

String ( fun s -> last_access := converttime s ) , " Last access older than give date ( format ' yyyy - mm - dd ' or ' mmm yyyy ' ) " ) ; ( " - - size " , Arg . Int ( fun i -> min_size := Int64.mul ( Int64.of_int i ) ( Int64.of_int ( 1024*1024 ) ) ) , " File size bigger than size in Mbytes " ) ; ( " - - type " , Arg. String ( fun s -> has_type := s ) , " File is specific type " ) ; ( " - - name " , Arg. String ( fun s -> name_match := s ; name_regexp := Str.regexp ( s ^ " $ " ) ) , " Filename matches regular expression " ) ] ( fun d -> dir := d ) " show [ DIR ] " ; let res = dirread ! dir in if ! show=0 then begin dirwrite ( fst res ) 0 ! sort ; print_string ( " Total size " ^ filesize ( snd res ) ^ "
" ) end else List.iter ( fun e -> print_endline ( e.e_name ^ if !
show=2 then " ( " ^filesize e.e_size^ " ) " else " " ) ) ( List. sort ! sort ( flat ( fst res ) ! dir ) ) ;;
And here is the main routine .
It calls the Arg. parse routine to parse the parameters given to the program .
But this is too much un -GNU for me .
I wrote my own version of it that follows the GNU coding standards a bit more than the default one ( Gnuarg ) .
The other version is a bit more complicated so I will include only the sources that use it .
Generating binaries
The code can be obtained from here .
Just unpack it somewhere with ' tar - xzf show .
tar.gz ' and move into the source directory with 'cd show / src ' .
There is also a Makefile that compiles to machine code and installs everything .
But Makefiles are too rough for sour eyes to show in this article .
The nitty - gritty details are there in the source .
The general compile form is .
ocamlopt -o show unix.cmxa str.cmxa basics.cmx show.ml
The only non-standard libraries in use here are unix.cmxa and str.cmxa .
make su make install exit show -- help show -s ~ -- size 3 -- before " apr 2003 "
That concludes this example program .
Language features
Garbage collector Just forget variables that contain complete data structures .
Once it gets out of scope , the total structure will be eliminated from memory in due time .
Flexible data - structures
Any 2 data structures can be combined without hassle .
Just create an array of records that contain 2 fields with hash tables of strings .
No problem there ... everything in a single variable than can be passed to functions or can be used globally in the program .
No pointers needed A variable can have any type and when a new variable is created Flexible in language boundary checks
The language can check array and string boundaries automatically , or those checks can be turned off for an extra speed boost .
Without it , the language can give a segmentation fault , but that is the programmer 's choice .
High quality error handling Totally integrated into the language and no notable performance hit .
Native code generator and byte code interpreter
All the tools are there -- interpreter ( ocaml ) , byte code ( ocamlc ) and native code compiler ( ocamlopt ) -- every wish is granted .
The package comes also with a documentation generator ( ocamldoc ) and a simple to use profiler ( ocamlprof ) that adds usage counts as comments to the original source code .
The language is also compatible with the more sophisticated profilers around .
ANSI -C compatibility layer
It is possible to include ANSI C routines inside OCaml programs , and OCaml routines inside C programs .
This has a very easy to use API .
Slightly less easy is the creation of OCaml data structures inside C ; for me , that was the source of many segfaults .
So , my routines call exported OCaml routines to fill data structures and create only OCaml strings and numbers in C .
That way I wo n't have the hassle to debug the C code ...
OCaml is much easier to debug for me .
Object orientation
Not my favourite programming paradigm , but it is possible to build object - oriented programs in this language .
Those features are not part of this article .
I can live without them .
An active mailing list This list is at caml-list@inria.fr and is normally in English .
Yes , this originally French project has taken the burden to translate almost everything they got .
This is no easy feat for them , so be grateful .
Cons :
Duplicate efforts in libraries
There are separate libraries for different type of big arrays , big files , and extra long integers .
This is n't a big problem , because you can always just start with the normal structures and drop in the special library when need arises .
The naming of the different functions is very much standardized , so renaming of function calls is n't needed much .
The extra long integers though are too much different from normal integers .
That part of the standard functions really need some tuning .
Readability
You need to be familiar with the basis constructions of the language , to make any sense of the actual code .
Some constructions can look really weird without intimate knowledge of the language .
OCaml is not a very natural language and has a very powerful , short notation for things .
But this not much worse than languages like ANSI C , Perl , or lisp .
Not known enough in the Linux world
This language has excellent interfaces to standard libraries and easy binding to ANSI C , but still is n't very known .
I like to create some articles like this to change that a bit .
This is a really great language to program in , and gives you real power without the pitfalls common in other languages .
Programmers should give it a try and feel that power once .
There is also a new construction ' while do done ' it just does what it is supposed to do .
