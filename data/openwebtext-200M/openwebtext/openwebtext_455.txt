Recently I started writing a REST service .
I began in the usual way , writing a php script , calling it with a GET request , accessing the variables using the PHP superglobal variable $ _GET .
I wrote code to handle a POST request and used the variables I found in $ _POST .
Then I tried to write a PUT request .
PHP does n't have a built - in way to do this , and at first I was a little confused as to how I could reach this information .
It turns out that this can be read from the incoming stream to PHP , php://input .
file_get_contents ( " php://input " ) ;
The above line provided me with a query string similar to what you might see on the URL with a GET request .
key / value pairs separated by question marks .
I was rescued from attempting to parse this monster with a regex by someone pointing out to me that parse_str ( ) is intended for this purpose ( seriously , I write a lot of PHP , I do n't know how I miss these things but its always fun when I do " discover " them ) - it takes a query string and parses out the variables .
Look out for a major health warning on str_parse ( ) - by default it will create all the variables all over your local scope !!
Pass in the second parameter though and it will put them in there as an associatvive array instead - I 'd strongly recommend this approach and I 've used it here with my $ post_vars variable .
parse_str(file_get_contents ( " php://input " ) , $ post_vars ) ;
This loads the variable $ post_vars with the associative array of variables just like you 'd expect to see from a GET request .
Simple Example
Its a bit of a contrived example but it shows use of the REQUEST_METHOD setting from the $ _SERVER variable to figure out when we need to grab the post vars .
Firstly , here 's the script :
if($_SERVER [ ' REQUEST_METHOD ' ] == ' GET ' ) { echo " this is a get request
" ; echo $ _GET [ ' fruit ' ] . " is the fruit
" ; echo " I want " .$ _GET [ ' quantity ' ] . " of them
" ; } elseif ($_SERVER [ ' REQUEST_METHOD '] == ' PUT ' ) { echo " this is a put request
" ; parse_str( file_get_contents ( " php://input " ) , $ post_vars ) ; echo $ post_vars [ ' fruit ' ] . " is the fruit
" ; echo " I want " .$ post_vars [ ' quantity ' ] . " of them
" ; }
And here 's what happened when I request the same script using two different HTTP verbs .
I 'm using cURL to show the example simply because I think it shows it best .
Via GET :
curl " http://localhost/rest_fruit.php?quantity=2&fruit=plum " this is a get request plum is the fruit I want 2 of them
Via PUT :
curl -X PUT http://localhost/rest_fruit.php
-d fruit=orange -d quantity =4 this is a put request orange is the fruit I want 4 of them
Purists will tell me that I should n't be returning data from a PUT request , and they'd be right !
But this does show how to access the incoming variables and detect which verb was being used .
If you 're going to write a REST service then the correct naming of resources and the correct response to each resource being accessed in various ways is really important , but its a story I 'll save for another day .
If you use this , or perhaps you access the variables another way , then do post a comment - there are n't a lot of resources available on this topic for PHP .
why ur hed jus asplode ?
wuz it my cuteness ?

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Exactly 20 years after warning America about global warming , a top NASA scientist said the situation has gotten so bad that the world 's only hope is drastic action .
James Hansen told Congress on Monday that the world has long passed the " dangerous level " for greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and needs to get back to 1988 levels .
He said Earth 's atmosphere can only stay this loaded with man-made carbon dioxide for a couple more decades without changes such as mass extinction , ecosystem collapse and dramatic sea level rises .
" We 're toast if we do n't get on a very different path , " Hansen , director of the Goddard Institute of Space Sciences who is sometimes called the godfather of global warming science , told The Associated Press .
" This is the last chance . "
Hansen brought global warming home to the public in June 1988 during a Washington heat wave , telling a Senate hearing that global warming was already here .
To mark the anniversary , he testified before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming where he was called a prophet , and addressed a luncheon at the National Press Club where he was called a hero by former Sen.
Tim Wirth , D - Colo. , who headed the 1988 hearing .
To cut emissions , Hansen said coal - fired power plants that do n't capture carbon dioxide emissions should n't be used in the United States after 2025 , and should be eliminated in the rest of the world by 2030 .
That carbon capture technology is still being developed and not yet cost efficient for power plants .
Burning fossil fuels like coal is the chief cause of man-made greenhouse gases .
Hansen said the Earth 's atmosphere has got to get back to a level of 350 parts of carbon dioxide per million .
Last month , it was 10 % higher : 386.7 parts per million .
Hansen said he 'll testify on behalf of British protesters against new coal - fired power plants .
Protesters have chained themselves to gates and equipment at sites of several proposed coal plants in England .
" The thing that I think is most important is to block coal - fired power plants , " Hansen told the luncheon .
" I 'm not yet at the point of chaining myself but we somehow have to draw attention to this . "
Frank Maisano , a spokesman for many U.S. utilities , including those trying to build new coal plants , said while Hansen has shown foresight as a scientist , his " stop them all approach is very simplistic " and shows that he is beyond his level of expertise .
The year of Hansen 's original testimony was the world 's hottest year on record .
Since then , 14 years have been hotter , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Two decades later , Hansen spent his time on the question of whether it 's too late to do anything about it .
His answer :
There 's still time to stop the worst , but not much time .
" We see a tipping point occurring right before our eyes , " Hansen told the AP before the luncheon .
" The Arctic is the first tipping point and it 's occurring exactly the way we said it would . "
Hansen , echoing work by other scientists , said that in five to 10 years , the Arctic will be free of sea ice in the summer .
Longtime global warming skeptic Sen. James Inhofe , R - Okla. , citing a recent poll , said in a statement , " Hansen , ( former Vice President ) Gore and the media have been trumpeting man-made climate doom since the 1980s .
But Americans are not buying it . "
But Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass. , committee chairman , said , " Dr. Hansen was right .
Twenty years later , we recognize him as a climate prophet . "

Comic - Con ’08 Revelations Pt. 2
I went to high school with a guy named Tr2n .
Or maybe it was Tran Nguyen .
Either way , the trailer for “ Tron 2 ”
that premiered at Comic - Con was short and sweet and enough to get me excited .
I actually wrote this comic several months ago when they announced the film .
I had a page of notes about how “ Tron ” and “ The Big Lebowski ” could intersect .
“ Ju don ’ fuck wif ’ de Sark
“ Shut the fuck up , Tronny ! ”
“ and I sure as shit do n’t disc on Shabbos !
“ Tronny died as so many young programs died in the games … ”
The list went on and on .
Yes , my brain is broken .
As far as I ’m concerned they ’re the same movie now .

MIAMI  Teresa Aral , a travel agent in South Florida , was greatly relieved after learning she did not have to pay the state a quarter of a million dollars to keep booking trips to Cuba .
For now , at least .
Ms. Aral , along with 15 other agents providing charter flights to Cuba , filed a lawsuit in Miami against the State of Florida , challenging a new law requiring them to post a one - time $ 250,000 bond and disclose the names of clients in order to continue their business with Cuba .
But earlier this month , a federal judge temporarily lifted the measure while he considered its legality .
“ I ’m very grateful that at least the judicial branch of government here is still working , ” Ms. Aral said after the ruling .
Cuban - Americans are allowed to visit the island every three years and must obtain visas through the federal government .
Another title for this one might be “ Jawdropper of the Day . ”

NYT REJECTS MCCAIN’S EDITORIAL ; SHOULD ‘MIRROR ’ OBAMA
Mon Jul 21 2008 12:00:25 ET
An editorial written by Republican presidential hopeful McCain has been rejected by the NEW YORK TIMES — less than a week after the paper published an essay written by Obama , the DRUDGE REPORT has learned .
The paper ’s decision to refuse McCain ’s direct rebuttal to Obama ’s ‘ My Plan for Iraq ’ has ignited explosive charges of media bias in top Republican circles .
‘ It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama ’s piece , ’ NYT Op - Ed editor David Shipley explained in an email late Friday to McCain ’s staff .
‘ I ’m not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written . ’
In McCain ’s submission to the TIMES , he writes of Obama : ‘ I am dismayed that he never talks about winning the war — only of ending it … if we do n’t win the war , our enemies will .
A triumph for the terrorists would be a disaster for us .
That is something I will not allow to happen as president . ’
NYT ’s Shipley advised McCain to try again : ‘ I ’d be pleased , though , to look at another draft . ’
[ Shipley served in the Clinton Administration from 1995 until 1997 as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Presidential Speechwriter . ]

Yesterday , the Politico quoted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as saying , “ I ’m trying to save the planet ; I ’m trying to save the planet . ”
She was responding , of course , to pressure that she and her fellow Democrats are experiencing to suspend a congressional ban on offshore oil drilling in the face of skyrocketing energy prices .
It would be really wonderful , however , if the liberal congresswoman could get as energized about saving our once great republic .
Herein lies another problem : the vast majority of our politicos ( from both major parties ) do not even seem to know what kind of country the United States was designed to be .
Virtually every reference made to the United States by our civil magistrates is that we are a “ democracy . ”
That ’s odd ; someone should have told our Founding Fathers , because they emphatically rejected the concept of creating a “ democracy ” in favor of creating a constitutional republic .
Has anyone quoted the Pledge of Allegiance lately ?
Does it say , “ And to the democracy for which it stands ” ?
Or does it say , “ And to the republic for which it stands ” ?
Of course it says “ republic . ”
At the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention , a passerby asked Benjamin Franklin , “ Well , Doctor , what have we got–a republic or monarchy ? ” Franklin replied , “ A republic–if you can keep it . ”
Ladies and Gentlemen , that is the sixty - four million dollar question : Can we keep our republic ?
Can we keep our constitutional form of government ?
Can we keep our constitutionally protected liberties ?
In Federalist No. 10 , James Madison ( “ The Father of the U.S. Constitution ” ) said , “ [ D] emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . ”
The fear of what happens to freedom and liberty under democratic rule is what prompted Madison and the rest of America ’s founders to labor so hard to create what they did : a constitutional republic .
Under God , it is allegiance to the Constitution that has preserved our liberties , our peace and happiness , our security , and our very way of life .
Furthermore , it is the repudiation and rejection of constitutional government that is responsible for the manner in which these very same blessings are currently being lost .
Someone needs to remind Rep. Pelosi that it is not her duty ( nor does she have the power ) to “ save the planet . ”
And by the same token , someone needs to remind Senators Barack Obama and John McCain that they are not campaigning to be President of the World , but President of the United States .
What every elected officeholder is expected and required to do is very simple : they are required to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America .
Period .
End of story .
Our public servants are not charged with saving the snail darter or the Spotted Owl , or saving the profits of the international bankers , or saving Wall Street in general , or saving the perks of corporate lobbyists , or saving Freddie and Fannie , or saving the peoples of the world from all the bogeymen , or even saving humankind or the planet itself .
What our public servants are charged with , however , is preserving ( saving ) our constitutional republic .
Of course , the problem is , the people who are charged with the preservation of our republic are the ones who are the most responsible for its destruction .
The American people have far more to fear from Nancy Pelosi , Barack Obama , and John McCain than they do from any foreign adversary , because our leaders have proven that they have absolutely no fidelity to the principles of constitutional government .
They have no compunction about eviscerating the protection of our freedoms , or about abolishing the vanguard of our liberties .
They are Machiavellian , making King George of old look like a mere amateur .
No , I take that back .
It is not our civil magistrates who are most responsible for the destruction of our republican form of government : it is “ We the people . ”
At the end of the day , it is the responsibility of the people to govern themselves .
We must be willing to hold our civil magistrates accountable to the contract they made with us , which is to uphold constitutional government .
It is our duty to “ throw off ” any system of government that does not secure our liberties and protect our Constitution .
And this we have not done .
Christian pastors and ministers have failed us .
The “ Religious Right ” has failed us .
College professors have failed us .
High School teachers have failed us .
Newspaper editors and publishers have failed us .
TV news anchors and reporters have failed us .
Parents have failed .
Friends have failed .
The two major political parties have failed .
As a whole , no one is talking about , or even thinking about , the loss of constitutional government , national independence , and sovereignty .
Few seem even conscious that this is taking place .
Worrying about which major party wins a general election is like worrying about whether Coke or Pepsi sold more soft drinks last month .
Pick your poison .
One is just as bad as the other .
Neither has any fidelity to the Constitution or to the principles of liberty , which it represents .
Both John McCain and Barack Obama are enemies to constitutional government .
Both are in the process of sacrificing our national sovereignty to global entities .
Both men lied when they took an oath to preserve and protect the Constitution .
So , why should we care which impostor wins the election ?
It is up to the American people to enforce constitutional government .
From a Christian perspective , it is “ We the people ” who are the “ powers that be ” in Romans chapter 13 .
Under our form of government , the source of authority and the source of legitimacy reside with “ We the people . ”
We are not the slaves of any king or despot .
Our elected leaders are public servants , not private masters .
In a nutshell , they work for us .
They are contracted to preserve our liberties and our way of life .
When they fail , they must answer to us .
So , when will the American people pick themselves up by the bootstraps and start acting like free citizens and stop groveling before these imbecilic political parties ?
When will we set this political house in order ?
Of course , all of this demands that each of us understands constitutional government and the principles upon which liberty rests .
It also demands that each of us be prepared to do whatever is our personal duty to preserve this republic .
Patriotism is more than waving a flag on July 4th , or singing The National Anthem at a ball game , or wearing a flag lapel pin on Flag Day .
For an American , real patriotism means that we are willing to preserve and protect our constitutional republic .
Remember , Franklin ’s answer : “ A republic–if you can keep it . ”
Nancy Pelosi can talk about saving the planet all she wants to : her duty , however , is to preserve , protect , and defend the U.S. Constitution .
And that is also the job of every single American citizen .
Unfortunately , most of us are no better at doing our job than Pelosi is at doing hers .

President Bush addressed reporters Thursday morning as he signed a bill expanding his surveillance powers .
Photo : White HouseThe American Civil Liberties Union filed suit Thursday over a controversial wiretapping law , challenging the constitutionality of the expanded spy powers Congress granted to the president on Wednesday .
The federal lawsuit was filed with the court just hours after Bush signed the bill into law .
The ACLU is suing on behalf of journalist and human rights groups , asking the court put a halt to Congress 's legalization of Bush 's formerly secret warrantless wiretapping program .
The ACLU contends ( .pdf ) the expanded spying power violates the Constitution 's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures .
On Wednesday , the Senate gave final congressional approval to a massive expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , finishing a year of debate over how far the U.S. government should be able to conduct blanket surveillance using telecom facilities inside the United States .
In passing the FISA Amendments Act , Congress gave the executive branch the power to order Google , AT&T and Yahoo to forward to the government all e-mails , phone calls and text messages where one party to the conversation is thought to be overseas .
President Bush signed the bill into law Thursday morning , describing it as a bill that " protect [s ] the liberties of our citizens while maintaining the vital flow of intelligence . "
The ACLU contends those blanket powers to grab international communications of Americans without specific court orders violate the Fourth Amendment and would stymie journalists who often speak to confidential sources outside the country .
Plaintiff Naomi Klein , the liberal columnist and author , said the surveillance would compromise her writing about international issues .
" If the U.S. government is given unchecked surveillance power to monitor reporters ' confidential sources , my ability to do this work will be seriously compromised , " Klein said .
Longtime foreign correspondent Christopher Hedges admits that surveillance is not a new obstacle for journalists , but says this goes a step too far .
" There is a lot of monitoring that goes on especially when you are overseas , " Hedges said .
" But this creates a further erosion in my ability to work as a journalist . "
The suit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Thursday , asks the judge to stay the implementation of the new powers , until its constitutionality is determined .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which has spearheaded the still ongoing lawsuits against the nation 's telecoms , will challenge the provision of the bill that gives retroactive amnesty to telecoms that are being sued for helping the government spy on Americans without warrants .
They argue that Congress 's attempt to have citizen lawsuits dismissed violates the separation of powers .
But the San Francisco - based online rights group also announced in a fund - raising letter on Thursday that it would also challenge the constitutionality of the bill 's expanded spying powers .
" We are also preparing a new case against the government for its warrantless wiretapping , past , present and future , " said EFF senior staff attorney Kevin Bankston , who said the details were being withheld to keep the element of surprise .
" But suffice to say it will be quite different from the other cases against the government that have been filed so far , " Bankston said .
" Like with our case against AT&T , however , the ultimate goal will be the same : to halt the mass interception of Americans ' communications and to dismantle the dragnet spying network that was first exposed by our witness , AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein . "

Stupid House resolution of the week : National Corvette Day !
Yes , there are wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , gas is now like a billion dollars per gallon , banks are foreclosing on homes at record rates .
but the House of Representatives is coming to the rescue .
Thanks to Rep. John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) and 55 stalwart colleagues , Monday has been designated " National Corvette Day . "
Yes , the American automative icon now gets its own day .
I know I feel better already .
All that stuff that I was worried about — war , terrorism , health care , a meltdown of the economy — has melted away .
I will sleep easy now .
Thanks , Mr. Shimkus !
You can read the full text of the Corvette resolution ( H.Res.970 ) below .
It was passed by the House on Thursday .
My only other problem with this resolution — except for the fact that it is a stupid waste of time — is that it really does n't even mention the most important stuff about the Corvette .
Any resolution on the ' Vette that does n't include the phrases " Whereas it will help you get chicks " and " Whereas it looks really cool " just fails to do justice to this legend on wheels ( thanks to an unnamed colleague for that point ) .
So hurray to Corvettes , but boo to Shimkus and the rest of the House .
May the two never meet .
" H. Res. 970
In the House of Representatives , U. S. ,
June 26 , 2008 .
Whereas the Chevrolet Corvette is America 's first sports car ;
Whereas the first production Corvette rolled off a Flint , Michigan , assembly line on June 30 , 1953 ;
Whereas the Corvette is now manufactured in Bowling Green , Kentucky ;
Whereas the Corvette is the most widely respected production sports car in United States history ;
Whereas the Corvette is truly a symbol of American pride ;
Whereas General Motors is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2008 ; and
Whereas the 30th of June would be an appropriate day to designate as ` National Corvette Day ' :
Now , therefore , be it
Resolved ,
That the United States House of Representatives supports the designation of a ` National Corvette Day ' to honor the Chevrolet Corvette . "

Now there 's a shocker , no ?
This is just one of many reasons why we should n't torture .
As more details about the Bush administration 's torture program come to light , ( see Jane Mayer 's The Dark Side ) we find that torture brings about more bogus intelligence and coerced confessions have led our intelligence agencies on a host of wild goose chases and wasted valuable time and U.S. tax dollars .
The judge ruled that some of Hamdan 's statements made at Gitmo may be allowed , but his defense is arguing that all his statements were coerced by using abusive tactics .
How much evidence will be thrown out is yet to be determined , but if this article from the AP is accurate , the first of King George 's war tribunals is shaping up to be yet another three ring circus .
A man from Portland Oregon is suing police for unlawful seizure with excessive force after officers fired a Taser and bean bag rounds at him when he refused to stop filming a warrantless search of his neighbour 's property last year .
According to a report in The Oregonian , Frank Waterhouse claims that on May 27 , 2006 he was brutally assaulted by police when officers followed a sniffer dog onto the property in pursuit of a fleeing suspect .
Waterhouse says that the dog keyed on a car , prompting officers to break out a window which upset residents who maintain that no one ran onto the property .
It was at that point that an angry resident grabbed a video camera and started to film the police search .
The Oregonian report states : When one woman was told to stop recording , she gave the video camera to Waterhouse .
He walked to the edge of the property , climbed up a dirt embankment and continued to record .
At one point , he yelled to his friend , " Yes , I got it all on film .
They had no right to come on this property .
" He says in the suit that police immediately came after him , and yelled at him " put it down . "
Officers moved towards him , and he said , " Do n't come after me . "
Waterhouse said seconds later he was shot with a bean bag gun and a Taser and fell to the ground .
DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s foreign minister said on Thursday U.S. participation in nuclear talks was “ positive ” , but France said big powers still wanted Tehran to make specific proposals to resolve a dispute over Iran ’s nuclear work .
The United States said on Wednesday it was sending an envoy to Geneva to join nuclear talks with Iran for the first time , to underline to the Islamic Republic and others that Washington wanted a diplomatic solution to the impasse .
“ The American participation is positive , ” Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference in Damascus .
“ We look forward to constructive engagement ” , he said , referring to a new round of talks in Geneva on Saturday .
Senior U.S. diplomat Williams Burns will join EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and officials from Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China for the talks .
The powers are seeking a more detailed Iranian response to their enhanced offer of financial and diplomatic incentives to halt its secretive nuclear activity that could yield atom bombs .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the U.S. presence would be “ an additional asset ” and that Iran ’s readiness for more talks was encouraging , despite its initially dismissive response to the revised package .
“ We are waiting for an opening , ” he told reporters in English outside a European security meeting in Vienna .
“ I talked to ( Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr ) Mottaki and he was open , but open to what ?
That is always the case .
We talk and talk with the Iranians , but it ’s always disillusion . ”
He said Tehran was still not addressing “ the core of the subject ” -- an enrichment suspension , or an interim freeze on steps to expand the proliferation - prone activity , to get preliminary negotiations going .
“ Iran ’s ( written ) response to our offer said , ‘ OK to dialogue ’ , but nothing about enrichment , as if they had not read our letter , ” Kouchner said .
“ I have lots of hope for these talks , but I do n’t expect anything from them .
France has had lots of talks with Iran ( on nuclear issues ) but they have never produced anything . ”
BEIJING WELCOMES U.S. PRESENCE
Iran says its nuclear work is for peaceful power generation , not nuclear bombs as Western leaders suspect , and it has rejected demands it give up uranium enrichment .

Asked if she expected a positive response from Iran , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said : “ I do n’t know . ”
“ The point we are making is that the United States is firmly behind this diplomacy and firmly behind and unified with our allies .
Hopefully the Iranians will take that message , ” she told reporters .
Washington has had no relations with Iran since 1980 and would have the most to offer it in terms of relief from international political and economic sanctions , making U.S. engagement crucial to resolving the standoff , analysts say .
A British newspaper said on Thursday the United States would announce in the next month that it plans to establish a U.S. interest section in Tehran for the first time in 30 years .
“ The move will see U.S. diplomats stationed in the country , ” said the Guardian , describing the development as “ a remarkable turnaround in policy by President George Bush who has pursued a hawkish approach to Iran throughout his time in office . ”
Tensions with Iran have intensified , particularly since Tehran tested missiles last week , pushing up oil prices , rattling Israeli nerves and prompting Washington to say it would defend its allies against any possible attacks .
The Bush administration said it was not changing its stance that it will join full - blown negotiations with Iran only if Tehran first shelves enrichment activity .
Tuesday , 15 Jul , 2008 Current Events
A woman from Australia , who became very famous as the oldest blogger in the world , passed away at the age of 108 .
In her blog she left one last post where she wrote about her poor health but at the same time she also mentioned about her singing a happy song every day .
Her name was Olive Riley .
She was living in Woy Woy , a coastal town 50 miles north of Sydney .
Olive started blogging in February 2007 .
She enjoyed sharing stories about her life during the two world wars and the way she raised 3 children by herself .
Though her body was physically week , her mid was sharp and she managed to win the love of an international audience with her blog , entitled " The Life of Riley " , where she posted YouTube videos where she talked and sang .
Riley was born in 1899 and in October it would have been her 109th birthday .
She was 12 years older than another blogger from Spain , Maria Amelia .
" She enjoyed the notoriety - it kept her mind fresh .
She had people communicating with her from as far away as Russia and America on a continual basis , not just once in a while . " said Darren Stone , her great - grandson from Brisbane .
Since February 2007 the Australian woman had over 70 entries on her blog .
The blog was set with the help of one of her friends , who also helped Riley in entering posts on her blog .
She described a lot of great moments of her life , including the washing days when she was a little girl and the days when she had to search for firewood in order to heat the large copper tub .
" That was my job - and it was real hard work for a small kid , " recalled Riley .
Mrs Riley was there when the Sydney Harbor Bridge opened in 1932 .
On June 24 , 2008 she wrote her last post where she told about moving into a nursing home .
He commented on her poor health , saying : " I still feel weak and can't shake off that bad cough . "
Then she added that she sang a happy song with a guest in her home , just like she did every day .
Then Mrs Riley mentioned that she had " read a whole swag of email messages and comments from my internet friends today , and I was so pleased to hear from you .
Thank you , one and all . ' "
On Saturday Mrs Riley passed away in the nursing home .

Biotech and pharmaceutical companies have a mixed record when it comes to publishing the results of clinical trials .
A peer - reviewed publication that suggests a drug is effective provides a scientific stamp of approval .
Studies revealing that drugs are little better than placebos , however , do a company few favors , and companies make little effort to publish them .
This can result in a significant publication bias that produces unrealistic expectations regarding the effectiveness of drugs , as we have recently seen with antidepressants .
Last week 's edition of Science includes a Policy Forum that discusses the changing state of public access to clinical trial data , which includes many other examples of significant information that never got published .
These include recent news , such as negative outcomes in people using Avandia , as well as older problems , such as the well - documented issues with the use of Paxil by teens and Vioxx by nearly everyone .
In many of these cases , the public only learned of the existence of this clinical trial data during legal action .
These cases may not be exceptional , either ; the authors cite data showing " that over 30 percent of trials of 12 antidepressants submitted to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for review , primarily those with negative results , have not been published . "
The authors , both based at the US National Library of Medicine , are decisively in favor of greater public disclosure .
" Although advances in all areas of science depend upon free exchange of data , " they write , " clinical trials warrant particular scrutiny due to their use of human volunteers and our dependence upon their results to inform medical decisions . "
The Science article describes the changes that are resulting from the passage of a 2007 law ( PDF ) that ordered the FDA to create an expanded registry that tracks the results of clinical trials .
Thanks to the changes , any trials of drugs or devices regulated by the FDA ( other than Phase I safety tests ) performed in the US need to be registered .
That data is going into a preexisting online database , and the editors of medical journals have made registering there a mandatory precursor of publication in the peer - reviewed literature .
The authors consider the law a major step forward that will increase the access of researchers to relevant clinical data , which will in turn enhance the public 's knowledge of critical medical information .
Still , there are a number of limitations that will leave holes in the knowledge base .
Perhaps the largest black box will be the large and growing set of pseudomedical interventions out there .
Ads for diet pills regularly claim clinical validation of their efficacy but , given that they 're unregulated , their makers wo n't be required to post the ostensible clinical data to back that up .
Even real medical interventions , such as surgeries and behavioral therapies , do n't fall under the FDA 's umbrella .
Potential problems do n't end there .
The authors also recognize that the clinical trial registry will be no panacea for intentional fraud or poorly - designed trial protocols .
Much of what we know about drug safety , they also note , has not come from clinical trials but instead is provided by observational studies that describe what happens when drugs enter the market and are used by far larger populations ; these studies wo n't show up in the data registry .
Despite these limits , the existence of the registry will greatly expand the research community 's access to trial data .
Having the data there , however , wo n't necessarily provide a direct benefit to the public .
People will have to know what to search the database for and qualified individual will still need to analyze the contents in order to extract useful knowledge .
Even once the knowledge is out there , action by the FDA is likely to be as politicized and controversial as it is in the absence of such data .
Congress ' effort to enforce full disclosure appears to have created a useful resource for the research community and , ultimately , the public .
It 's not comprehensive , and it wo n't help us decide how to act on that knowledge , but it 's clearly a step that should prevent publication bias — both intentional and incidental — that keeps the public from having a better picture of major health issues .

BBC News , Islamabad
The militants have their own brand of harsh justice Taleban militants in Pakistan 's north - western Mohmand tribal area have set up permanent Islamic courts , they say .
The districts have been divided into four judicial zones , each having two judges and a permanent court address .
The Taleban have up until now used mobile courts - with no permanent offices or judges - to settle criminal and financial disputes .
They say the permanent courts show the diminishing authority of the central and local governments .
The Taleban currently control large areas of Pakistan 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) along the border with Afghanistan .
' Dozens of judgements '
" There will be eight judges , two for each zonal court , and there will be a top judge to whom appeals can be made , " Dr Asad , a spokesman for the Mohmand Taleban , told the BBC News website .
An official of the Mohmand tribal administration confirmed the report , saying the courts were already functioning a day after the Taleban 's announcement .
Meanwhile , the top spokesman for the Pakistani Taleban Movement ( PTM ) , Maulvi Omar , has told the BBC Urdu service that permanent Taleban courts were already functioning in Bajaur district , Mohmand 's northern neighbour .
" About 20 local religious scholars issue dozens of judgements each day in Bajaur , where we have the most organised judicial system in place , " he said .
Public killings
In addition the PTM also runs a vast network of mobile courts in the rest of the Fata areas , he said .
The cases range from land transactions and loan disputes to family matters .
The Taleban are becoming increasingly powerful in the tribal areas
All this is embarrassing for the Pakistani government , especially because the Taleban have in the past carried out cruel punishments against people accused of moral turpitude , crime or spying .
Earlier this month , two Afghan nationals accused of spying for the US were publicly killed on the orders of a Taleban court in Bajaur .
Last month , a court in Orakzai ordered the public killing of half a dozen alleged bandits .
And in March , the Taleban killed a couple after they were allegedly found guilty of adultery by a court in Mohmand .
Meanwhile , Pakistani troops are engaged in a week - long face off with militants in the Hangu district of NWFP , on the border with Orakzai tribal region .
The militants say they are holding more than 20 government officials hostage , and would like to exchange them for four Taleban activists arrested by the police on 5 July from Doaba , a town near Hangu .

With the new year comes the time for New Year ’s resolutions to begin .
Most of us go into this time of year with great expectations with regard to how we can change our lives for the better .
But , change takes time and can require some serious work .
Since very few of us actually stick to our New Year ’s resolutions , we ’ve got to find a better way to create more success with them .
Introducing smaller changes a little bit at a time have proven to be successful .
This creates habits that will have long term staying power and is the way to help ensure success .
So , we have come up with some great tips to help you achieve some long term success with your New Year ’s resolutions .
Finances
One of the biggest hurdles that most of us face is getting our finances in order .
In some way , shape or form , we feel that there is something not operating at 100 % with our finances .
This could be any of the following things :
Savings
Investing
Retirement
Spending
Loans
Debt
While we would all love to wave a magic wand and our finances would miraculously be in order , that seems highly unlikely .
Instead , we usually aim for lofty goals to fix one entire category in a year ’s time .
But most of us have more than a year ’s worth of work that will need to be done to fix recurring issues .
Instead , it makes more sense to take things in smaller chunks with our finances .
This can help create a longer term plan that is more easily digestible , which makes it much more attainable over the long run .
Great tips to help you achieve some long term success with your New Year 's resolutions .

Create a Budget
One of the best ways to do this is to first create a budget .
This may sound harder than it is , but you can start with the basics and get more advanced as time goes on .
When you create your budget , make sure to include :
Income from all sources ( only what you take home though , since this is the money you have to work with )
Mortgage or rent
Utilities ( gas , water , electricity )
Recurring household expenses ( cable , streaming , internet , cell phone , etc. )
etc. )
Household expenses ( toiletries , linens , etc. )
Grocery expenses ( we include alcohol in this category , but you can split that out , if you prefer )
Automobile expenses ( this includes gas , car payments , car insurance and anything else for the car )
( this includes gas , car payments , and anything else for the car ) Clothing and shoes
Monthly recurring extracurricular expenses ( gym , memberships , dues , children ’s activities )
) Luxury ( eating out , traveling , etc. )
Misc expenses ( anything that is a one off , such as stamps )
Weekly Budget Meeting
Once you have your budget created , then move onto having a weekly budget meeting to go over everything .
This may sound extremely time consuming , but it really is n’t .
If you are having a budget meeting every week , then it should really only take you about 10 - 15 minutes to go over everything .
What you want to cover during these meetings are :
What did you spend last week ?
How much did you make last week ?
Where are you with regard to the monthly budget in each category ?
Are you over or under ?
Are there expenses coming up in the next week that you need to discuss and account for ?
Where are you at with your emergency fund savings ?
Where are you at with your retirement accounts ?
How is the debt repayment coming along ?
Do you want to attack your debt using the debt snowball or the debt avalanche method ?
method ?
Are there any other places you would like to put your money this week ?
Will you be bringing in anymore money this upcoming week ?
If so , where should it be allocated ?
Are you on goal for your overall monthly budget ?
If not , what areas do you need to focus on to get back on track ?
Once you have answered all of these questions , you are done with the meeting and can move on with your day .
But the more frequently you have these meetings , the easier it is to stay on track .
And by doing so , you have a much higher long term success rate for changing your overall financial picture with these types of New Year ’s resolutions .
Physical Health
Changing your physical health can be just as difficult as changing your financial health .
Approaching it with the same smaller steps method can really increase your odds of success though .
One of the best first steps to make with your physical health is to increase the amount of water you drink .
Most of us simply are n’t drinking enough of the clear , delicious nectar of the Gods .
Instead , we are choosing sodas , teas , coffees , sports drinks , etc .
While some of these still have great nutritional content and redeeming value , they still are n’t water .
As humans , we contain , on average , up to 60 % water .
Which means that we need to replenish this water regularly in order to operate at our optimal potential .
Some of the basic benefits of drinking more water are :
Increases proper digestion
Regulates body temperature
Lubricates joints
Helps the brain produce hormones and neurotransmitters ( aka metabolism )
Increase cell production and survival
Ensures the immune system is functioning properly
As you can tell , water is pretty darn important for us .
And this includes making sure our digestive tract is operating properly .
And when it is , we have an easier time losing or maintaining weight .
Optimal Water Levels
The amount of water you need to maintain your optimal levels will vary based on weight , sex , activity level and environment you live in .
On average , you should be getting between .5 – 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight per day .
Here is a good example :
A 150 pound person in a temperate environment with a higher activity level should be getting approximately 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight per day .
150 x 1 = 150 ounces
8 ounces per cup
150 / 8 = 18.75 cups
While this formula works pretty well as a generalization , you know your body best .
So play around with different levels of water intake to see where you find your sweet spot to be .
Smaller Meals
Another great way to work on your physical health is to change the way you eat .
The 3 larger meals most Americans are used to nowadays are actually not the best way for us to eat .
Seeing as we derived from hunter / gatherer ’s , our digestive system is n’t meant to handle the vast quantity of food we assault it with 3 times a day .
Instead , it is meant to handler smaller amounts of food more regularly , and it operates more efficiently that way .
Plus , when you eat smaller meals , you should naturally be eating less calories .
Eating less calories more frequently should keep you filled up for a longer period of time .
Which translates to eating less calories per day , which can equal weight loss .
By changing how you eat to more of a grazing lifestyle , you will help your metabolism operate more efficiently , and therefore , store less fat .
Since this can be a large change though , start small .
Begin with eating a lighter breakfast than usual and trying to graze throughout the day , whenever you are hungry .
If you can get rid of lunch altogether , then do it .
If not , work your way up to that .
Dinner is usually the last meal to go , because it is our most social meal .
Ultimately , if you can make some of these small changes for your health , you can really see some long term results .
New Year ’s Resolutions Summary
Overall , there are a lot of ways that you can ease into a New Year ’s resolution with staying power .
But everything comes down to small changes .
If you want to change your finances , start with creating a budget .
Then begin to have a weekly budget meeting .
This will ingrain the information in your brain and create a new habit .
And if you want to change your health , start with drinking more water .
Next you can add in smaller meals per day with less calories , for longer staying power .
If you can start small , you can really make some positive differences in your life a year from now !
What are some of the best ways you have found to make New Year ’s resolutions stick in your life ?
Hillary Rodham Clinton chalked up an easy victory in Sunday 's Puerto Rico primary , a widely expected win that underscores the advantage she has enjoyed among Latino voters over Democratic rival Barack Obama .
Clinton trounced Obama 68 % to 32 % , write The Times ' Michael Finnegan and Louise Roug .
" Obama remains the front - runner for their party 's presidential nomination .
Although Clinton won 38 delegates in Puerto Rico to Obama 's 17 , he is just 47 short of the threshold for victory , the Associated Press said ; she needs 202.5 . "
" With Tuesday 's primaries in South Dakota and Montana the only Democratic contests left , the final decision rests with the approximately 200 uncommitted superdelegates .
Those party insiders will join the delegates selected in caucuses and primaries to determine who will be the nominee at August 's Democratic National Convention in Denver . "

North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan had her best fundraising quarter to date in her challenge to Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - N.C. ) .
Lesser - known
Dems flex money muscle
Senate Democrats continued to hold a sizable advantage over Republicans in fundraising for competitive Senate races – and this quarter , some of their less - publicized recruits also picked up their fundraising pace .
Several emerging Democratic challengers demonstrated this quarter that they are capable of raising enough money necessary to seriously challenge Republican incumbents , even though they still face overall financial hurdles against well - heeled opponents .

North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan had her best fundraising quarter to date in her challenge to Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - N.C. ) .
Hagan , a five - term state senator from the Greensboro area , announced that she raised over $ 1.6 million over the last three months , with $ 1.2 million left in her campaign account at the end of June .
Dole still narrowly outperformed Hagan , raising about $ 2.1 million in the quarter .
And Dole continues to have significantly more cash on hand — $ 2.7 million — even after spending on several television ads touting her record on illegal immigration and her work on the tobacco buyout .
In Maine , Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) raised $ 1.06 million , just barely outdistancing Rep. Tom Allen ( D - Maine ) , who raised just over $ 1 million .
Collins still is in fairly strong shape for re-election :
She has about $ 2 million more than Allen — $ 5.1 to $ 3.1 million — to spend , and has been leading by double - digits in most recent public polls
And Oregon state House Speaker Jeff Merkley ( D ) , fresh off winning his party ’s nomination , narrowly outraised Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) for the quarter .
Merkley raised $ 1.42 million , compared to Smith ’s $ 1.35 million haul .
But much of that money went towards the competitive primary , and Smith still has about eight times as much cash - on - hand as Merkley ( $ 4.5 million to $ 560,000 ) .
One of the biggest fundraising surprises came from Nebraska , where Democratic rancher Scott Kleeb outraised former governor Mike Johanns ( R ) for the quarter , $ 700,000 to $ 683,000 .
The race is still a long - shot for Democrats , but the fundraising figures represent a symbolic blow to Johanns , who has extensive connections both in Nebraska and Washington , where he served as President Bush ’s Agriculture Secretary .
In Alaska , Anchorage mayor Mark Begich raised just over $ 1 million in his bid to unseat Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , who has served in the Senate since 1968 .
Stevens had not yet reported his fundraising numbers at presstime .
Meanwhile , the Democrats ’ leading recruits continued to post impressive fundraising numbers .
Former Virginia Governor Mark Warner raised $ 3 million over the last three months , giving him a $ 5.1 million warchest to spend against Republican Jim Gilmore .
That ’s over 40 times more than Gilmore , who ended the quarter with a paltry $ 117,000 cash - on - hand .
The Udall cousins , Reps. Mark Udall ( D - Colo . ) and Tom Udall ( D - N.M. ) are both among their party ’s top fundraisers as well .
Mark Udall raised over $ 2 million in his race against former GOP Rep .
Bob Schaffer , and now has nearly $ 4 million on - hand .
Schaffer raised $ 1.4 million and has $ 2.8 million cash - on - hand .
His cousin , Tom , raised $ 2.1 million in the quarter , greatly benefited from not facing a primary opponent , allowing him to concentrate on raising money .
His opponent , Rep. Steve Pearce ( R - N.M. ) , was forced to expend much money in a contentious primary against Rep. Heather Wilson ( R - N.M . ) .
And former New Hampshire Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen announced she raised $ 1.6 million and now has $ 2.1 million in her campaign account . .
Republican Sen. John Sununu ’s campaign has announced that it has about $ 5 million cash - on - hand after raising more than $ 1 million over the quarter .
“ Democratic candidates from coast to coast had very good quarters and our in position to run strong , well - funded campaigns headed into the fall , ” said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Miller .
Republicans , though , are bullish over their nominee in Louisiana , state Treasurer John Kennedy , who matched Sen .
Mary Landrieu ’s fundraising total over the last three months .
Kennedy raised $ 1.51 million , about the same as Landrieu ’s estimated $ 1.5 million total .
Landrieu , though , maintains a strong cash - on - hand advantage , with $ 5.4 million in her campaign account , twice as much as Kennedy ’s $ 2.7 million .
“ For the second straight quarter John Kennedy has outperformed Mary Landrieu , even with all the fundraising advantages an incumbent enjoys , ” said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman John Randall .
In another encouraging development for Republicans , Sen. Norm Coleman ( R- Minn . ) outraised Democratic comedian Al Franken for the first time in over a year .
Coleman raised $ 2.35 million , just ahead of Franken ’s $ 2.26 million for the quarter , and has over $ 3 million more in his campaign account than Franken ( $ 7.2 million to $ 4 million ) .
Franken ’s campaign has struggled in recent months after the state GOP attacked him for a lewd sexual article he once wrote for Playboy magazine and for not paying back taxes he owed in 17 states .
Despite being outraised , Franken improved upon his fundraising totals from the past quarters .
In Texas , GOP Sen .
John Cornyn announced he raised $ 1.7 million , almost double the total of his Democratic opponent , state Senator Rick Noriega , who raised $ 930,000 .
Cornyn now has a formidable $ 9.4 million warchest , significantly more than Noriega .
Democrats have suggested they have an outside shot at unseating Cornyn , but Noriega ’s mediocre fundraising will make that task very difficult – especially in Texas , where it will cost millions to finance a full - fledged advertising blitz throughout the state .

Sydney , July 21 , 2008 ( ABN Newswire ) -
The big question this week is whether oil continues to ease as it did for most of the past week .
Oil fell for a fourth day on Friday in the largest weekly decline for more than three years .
Prices dropped 11 % over the week on reduced tension between the US and Iran , falling US industrial activity and gas demand and easing growth in China .
A strike in Brazil seems to have been settled , but there could be more unrest in Nigeria in the coming week .
August crude oil fell 41 c a barrel on Friday to $ US128.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest close since June 5 .
( Futures reached a record of $ US147.27 on July 11 . )
Last week 's decline was the biggest in percentage terms since December 2004 , when oil closed at $ US42.54 a barrel that week .
Last week 's $ US16.20 a - barrel fall was the largest weekly drop in dollar terms since the futures began trading in 1983 .
Helping was a report showing that high oil prices are having an impact on US consumption .
It fell 3 % in the first half of 2008 , the biggest decline for the period in 17 years , according to the American Petroleum Institute in a monthly update .
" While U.S. refiners churned out record and near - record amounts of oil products , imports – especially product imports -- fell substantially , " the API report said .
" Deliveries of all oil products – a measure of demand – fell 3.0 percent compared with the same first - half - year period in 2007 , with gasoline deliveries slipping 1.7 percent .
" For the preceding three years , oil demand had essentially held steady .
" API statistics manager Ron Planting said , " At 20.08 million barrels per day , total demand was the lowest in five years .
And the decline in gasoline demand was the first significant one recorded in 17 years .
" Higher pump prices and a slowing economy were undoubtedly factors .
" At 2.0 percent , the second - quarter decline in demand for gasoline was even greater than for the first six months .
" However , the 1.8 percent decline for all products for the last three months , compared with the same period a year ago , was less in part because of a 2.1 percent increase in demand for distillates , which includes diesel fuels and home heating oil .
"
In London September Brent crude oil fell 88 USc to $ US130.19 a barrel on London 's ICE Futures Europe exchange , the lowest close since June 5 .
Gold and silver fell Friday after the three day share rally cut demand for the precious metals as an alternative investment .
Not even the surge in US producer and consumer inflation in June ( to 9.2 % and 5 % annual rate respectively ) saw any real upsurge in demand or talk about a hedge against inflation .
Comex August gold futures fell $ US12.70 to $ US958 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange after hitting a low of $ US950.20 .
Gold dropped 0.3 % over the week while September silver futures fell 2.9 % to $ US18.20 an ounce .
Silver is still up 22 % so far this year and gold , 14 % .
Corn also fell , ending the biggest weekly drop in 12 years , after Argentina revoked controversial escalating taxes on some grain exports .
That ended a fight with farmers that had disrupted shipments of grain from the country for much of this year and saw a significant rise in social and political tensions in the country .
The weakness spread to soybeans and wheat which also dropped as traders realised that Argentina should be able to step up exports of both of those products without too much hindrance .
Argentine President , Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner withdrew the tax proposals after failing to win support on her tax plan from Congress .
Farmers had threatened to resume a four - month protest unless the decree on taxes was revoked .
The country is the world 's second - largest corn exporter , the third major soybean exporter and a top five wheat shipper .
December corn futures fell 21.5 USc , or 3.3 % on Friday to $ US6.285 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade .
That took the week 's fall to 11 % , the largest drop since 1996 .
November soybean futures fell 50c , or 3.3 % , to $ US14.48 a bushel , down a total of 9.3 % and the biggest drop for four months .
But the price is still up 70 % in the past year after reaching an all - time high of $ US16.3675 at the start of this month .
September wheat futures fell 5.5 USc , to $ US8.04 a bushel ; a fall of 3.2 % over the week .
The price is still up 29 % in the past year , reaching a record $ US13.495 in late February .
And copper , the other significant indicator of industrial demand , fell , posting a second straight weekly decline as supplies rose and economic growth slowed in China , the world 's largest consumer of the metal .
Stocks rose 13 % last week to 42,935 tonnes , the highest since late May .
Chinese production in the six months to June rose 19 % compared to the first half of 2007 , but China 's imports of copper and alloys dropped 19 % last month from June 2007 , a good indicator of current demand levels in the country where a power shortage is curtailing output of aluminium , lead , zinc and perhaps now copper .
Comex September copper futures fell 4.6 USc to $ US3.669 a pound on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The price fell 1.9 % over the week after dropping 5.3 % the week before .
The price of the September most - active futures contract has dropped 14 % from a record $ US4.2605 a pound set May 5 on concern that slowing global economic growth and declining consumption in China will lower demand .

The Great Barrier Reef , the Grand Canyon , Egypt 's pyramids :
Some of the world 's most famous landmarks have been recognized by UNESCO , the arm of the United Nations charged with protecting heritage around the globe .
But many lesser known gems — Slovakian churches , an agricultural site in Papua New Guinea , the lakes of northern Kazakhstan , a Mexican butterfly reserve — fill the global list of more than 850 World Heritage Sites .
Fifteen of Canada 's natural and cultural sites have been recognized , ranging from the northern tip of Newfoundland to the Yukon 's border with Alaska .
( See interactive map . )
Joggins fossil cliffs , N.S .
For nearly 200 years , scientists have been fascinated with this 10 - kilometre stretch at the Bay of Fundy , where tides continually erode stone to expose fossils dating back hundreds of millions of years .
The cliffs , which even garnered a mention in Charles Darwin 's landmark work ,
On the Origin of Species , are home to enormous fossilized trees and what 's believed to be the remains of the world 's oldest reptile .
UNESCO designated Joggins as Canada 's newest World Heritage Site in 2008 .
L'Anse aux Meadows , N.L .
Lying at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador , this 11th - century Viking settlement offers evidence of the first European presence in North America .
Discovered in 1960 by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his archeologist wife , Anne Stine Ingstad , it is the only authenticated Viking settlement in North America outside of Greenland .
The excavated remains of wood - framed peat - turf buildings are similar to those found in Norse Greenland and Iceland .
UNESCO recognized the site in 1978 , making it Canada 's first cultural entry on the list .
( The Northwest Territories ' Nahanni National Park was also added in 1978 but as a natural phenomenon . )
Nahanni National Park , N.W.T .
Canada 's first entry on the UNESCO list , this preserve protects a portion of the Mackenzie Mountains Natural Region , including massive canyons , sulphur hot springs , alpine tundra and the spectacular rapids of the South Nahanni River .
The park 's boreal forest is home to wolves , grizzly bears and caribou while mountain goats and Dall sheep inhabit the alpine climes .
UNESCO designated this a World Heritage Site in 1978 .
Kluane / Wrangell - St.Elias / Glacier Bay / Tatshenshini-Alsek , Yukon and B.C .
The first binational entry on UNESCO 's list , this 97,000 - square - kilometre site includes the 5,959 - metre Mount Logan , Canada 's highest peak .
This massive reserve is home to some of the world 's fastest - moving glaciers and the largest non-polar ice field on the planet .
The animal population includes grizzly bears , caribou and Dall sheep .
UNESCO named this a World Heritage Site in 1979 .
Dinosaur Provincial Park , Alta .
A World Heritage Site 75 million years in the making , this spot in the heart of Alberta 's Badlands has been a destination for paleontologists since dinosaur fossils were first discovered here in 1884 .
Thirty - four species of dinosaur were discovered here , along with hundreds of fossil specimens now on display in museums around the world .
UNESCO also recognized the provincial park's " particularly beautiful scenery " when adding it to the World Heritage list in 1979 .
Head - Smashed - In Buffalo Jump , Alta .
Natives used this buffalo hunting ground , located 18 kilometres northwest of Fort Macleod , Alta. , for nearly 6,000 years .
Exploiting the topography as well as a knowledge of buffalo behaviour , hunters killed the animals by chasing them over a precipice , then carving up the carcasses in a camp below .
Great numbers of buffalo skeletons remain here , as well as marked trails and remains of an aboriginal camp .
UNESCO designated this a World Heritage Site in 1981 .
SGang Gwaay , B.C .
This site is part of the larger Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site found in the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia .
SGang Gwaay was named a World Heritage Site in 1981 in recognition of the art and culture of the Haida people .
The site contains remains of houses and totem poles and reflects the Haida 's way of life and relationship with nature .
Wood Buffalo National Park , N.W.T. and Alta .
Canada 's largest national park , covering 44,807 square kilometres , is home to North America 's largest population of wild bison and the world 's largest inland delta , which lies at the mouth of the Peace and Athabasca rivers .
Originally founded in 1922 to protect the last remaining bison herds in North America , the park became a World Heritage Site in 1983 .
The Rocky Mountains , Alta. and B.C .
One of Canada 's most recognizable landmarks , the Rockies have been recognized by UNESCO since 1984 .
The mountains are known worldwide for their scenic vistas and spectacular waterways .
The caves , glaciers , lakes , waterfalls and rocky peaks of areas surrounding Banff and Jasper as well as the Kootenay and Yoho regions all lie within the designation .
Historic district of Old Quebec
In 1985 , UNESCO recognized Old Quebec as one of the world 's finest examples of a fortified colonial city .
It is the only North American city to have preserved its ramparts and other defensive works that were designed to protect numerous churches , monuments and other notable sites , including the Dauphine Redoubt , the Citadel and the area that is now the Château Frontenac .
In 2008 , this cultural and historic centre began celebrating the 400th anniversary of its founding .
Gros Morne National Park , N.L .
Glaciers carved a dazzling range of valleys , cliffs and fjords in this area on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland .
The Long Range Mountains of this region are estimated to be 20 times older than the Rockies , having been formed by continental collision approximately 1.2 billion years ago .
On recognizing the site in 1987 , UNESCO specifically cited the park as " a rare example of the process of continental drift , where deep ocean crust and the rocks of the earth 's mantle lie exposed . "
Old Town Lunenburg , N.S .
Named a World Heritage Site in 1995 , UNESCO cited Lunenburg as the best surviving example of a planned British colonial settlement in North America .
The town 's rectangular grid design , originally drawn up in England , has been largely preserved over time , as has much of the town 's historic architecture , some of which dates from the 18th century .
Lunenburg celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2003 .
With a present - day population of more than 2,500 , it is now a major tourist draw on Nova Scotia 's coast .
Waterton Glacier International Peace Park , Alta .
This is the second Canada - U.S. entry on the UNESCO list and the world 's first International Peace Park , formed in 1932 by combining Alberta 's Waterton Lakes National Park with Glacier National Park in Montana .
The park is home to an exceptional range of plant and animal life , with prairie , forest , alpine and glacial land inhabited by grizzly bears , mountain lions , wolves and mountain goats .
Of some historical significance to the area , the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through the Montana side in 1805 during their journey to the Pacific coast .
UNESCO recognized the site in 1995 .
Miguasha National Park , Que .
When designating this site in 1999 , UNESCO named it the world 's most outstanding site of fossils from the Devonian " Age of the Fishes , " which lasted from 417 million to 354 million years ago .
UNESCO considers the park a vital source of the most abundant and best - preserved fossil specimens of lobe - finned fishes , which are considered the precursors to the tetrapodes — the first four - legged , air - breathing terrestrial vertebrates .
Rideau Canal , Ont .
In 2007 , UNESCO recognized the canal in time for its 175th birthday .
This engineering marvel is North America 's oldest continually operating canal and among the first designed for steam - powered vessels .
A series of dams and 47 huge locks were constructed to allow safer passage for British shipping during the days of British - American competition for the region .
Extensive defensive works , including blockhouses , Martello towers and Kingston 's imposing Fort Henry were built to prevent American attacks .
UNESCO said the canal is of historical importance " as it bears witness to the fight for control of the north of the American continent . "
What the designation means
UNESCO World Heritage sites are covered under a 1972 international treaty dedicated to preserving the world 's cultural and natural legacy .
More than 180 countries have signed on to the agreement .
Its goal , according to UNESCO , is protect sites with " outstanding universal value to humanity … for future generations to appreciate and enjoy . "
Protected sites remain the property and responsibility of the country in which they are located .
The World Heritage designation , however , brings the attention of the international community dedicated to historical and natural preservation .
UNESCO monitors conditions to make sure the sites are receiving the proper care .
Ontario residents are learning to live better with less electricity , says a report to be released today .
Consumption is dropping faster than at any previous time and the province is ahead of the conservation target it set three years ago , Peter Love , chief energy conservation officer with the Ontario Power Authority , said in an interview .
" We 're getting there , but there 's a long way to go , " he said .
From 2005 to 2007 , Ontario's total consumption fell by 2.6 per cent to 150,8906 gigawatt hours , and the average for each person dropped by 4.6 per cent to 11,725 kilowatt hours .
Both figures are adjusted for changes in the weather .
In addition , last year 's weather - adjusted peak demand – the highest recorded use of electricity , a hot day when air conditioners were cranked up – was 24,820 megawatts , which was 1,462 megawatts below the amount forecast a couple of years ago by the Independent Electricity System Operator , the provincial agency that controls the flow of electricity .
That beat Queen 's Park 's first - stage goal – a reduction of 1,350 megawatts – for the first three years of its plan to cut peak demand by 6,300 megawatts by 2025 .
" We have a lot of work to do .
We 're looking to create a culture of conservation .
It happens over decades , " Love said .
The decline shows the Liberal government should rethink its focus on building new nuclear power plants , said Chris Winter , head of the Conservation Council of Ontario , an independent advocacy group .
Critics have said the government is moving far too slowly on conservation as it plans $ 40 billion worth of new nuclear generating stations .
The report " tells me that people are getting the message and that those of us who said we could go much faster were right , " Winter said .
" We always said they could achieve 6,300 megawatts ( of reduction ) by 2012 .
At what point do they get the message that people prefer conservation to coal , nuclear or other dirty power ? "
But Love said Ontario's conservation goal is far tougher than others in North America .
" The next target will be much more difficult . "
The power authority has launched 26 conservation programs , ranging from an incentive to encourage homeowners to get rid of energy - sucking old beer fridges to technical help for major industries .
No new residential incentives are planned for this summer , but the province has installed 1.4 million " smart meters , " out of 4.3 million in total , that will reward consumers for using appliances during periods of low demand .
When it 's finally underway , the charge for electricity – now no more than 5.9 cents per kilowatt hour – will be 9.3 cents during peak times , 7.3 cents in medium periods and only 2.7 cents in off - peak times , generally overnight .
A kilowatt - hour is the amount of electricity required to keep a 100 - watt light burning for 10 hours , and one billion watts equals one gigawatt .
The conservation effort is a far cry from the 1960s , when the former Ontario Hydro exhorted consumers to turn up their thermostats , take off their socks and " live better electrically . "
It 's also different from the province 's only previous attempt to curb demand , when , from 1988 to ' 92 , Hydro had a team of more than 500 staff pushing the conservation message .
That program resulted in about half the total electricity savings of the current effort , the power authority says .

The authority is contracting out much of the current conservation work to utilities , energy service companies and non-profit groups .
Ontario's electricity rates are still much lower than most other parts of the world , Paul Shervill , the power authority 's vice - president of conservation development said .

The three women , wearing only underwear and some tape to cover their nipples , were protesting inside a cage outside the KFC restaurant on George Street , at the corner of Bathurst Street .
They had a banner that read : " Chicks agree , boycott KFC " , PETA Asia -Pacific 's director Jason Baker said .
Police arrived and arrested the women - aged 20 , 22 and 31 - and placed them inside a paddy wagon , Mr Baker said .
" One of the officers said : ' We have the new nuisance regulation this week for World Youth Day , ' " he said .
" I said : ' Are you serious ? '
I thought it does n't start until tomorrow , and was [ being challenged in court ] anyway . "
However , a police spokesman said the women were arrested for protesting naked , " which is an offence " .
" I do n't think they were arrested under the new legislation , if that 's what you are asking . "
The women have not been charged yet and are being questioned at a police station , the police spokesman said .
Failure to comply with the new WYD laws can attract a penalty of up to $ 5500 .
But Mr Baker said the group had conducted naked protests in the city before , and no members had been arrested .
" I 'm shocked .
We have protested many times in Sydney , and at this KFC before .
" We had 24 people naked in Pitt Street just six weeks ago ... we 've never had problems . "
Pamela Anderson protest
Today 's protest was a follow - up to the attention drawn last week by Pamela Anderson to KFC 's treatment of chickens , Mr Baker said .
" The space an average KFC chicken has is about the size of an A4 piece of paper , " he said .
" What we are asking KFC to do is implement minimum animal welfare standards . "
Angus Armstrong , general manager , KFC Australia , told Stay In Touch in a statement last week : " KFC works with Australia 's three largest and most reputable chicken suppliers to ensure that our customers enjoy top quality , fresh , great tasting chicken .
In addition to KFC , these companies supply to the majority of chicken retailers in Australia and all are members of the Australia Chicken Meat Federation and are subject to some of the highest standards in the world .
" KFC does not own or operate any chicken farms but works closely with reputable suppliers , industry and government authorities to ensure the most humane farming methods in accordance with Australian regulations . "
Today he issued another statement saying the protesters were " not abreast of chicken farming practices in Australia " .
" This issue was over - exposed before today 's protest , " he said .
" We do not own or operate chicken farms , but work closely with reputable suppliers , government and industry bodies regarding humane farming methods in accordance with Australia 's high standards .
" We 're comfortable with freedom of expression , provided the facts are laid bare .
" We buy our chickens from reputable suppliers all of which are members of the Australia Chicken Meat Federation .
These suppliers are subject to some of the highest standards in the world . "
In this post I 'll cover a lecture on MySQL performance tuning .
This lecture is given by Jay Pipes .
Jay works at MySQL and has written a book on MySQL .
It 's called Pro MySQL and it covers intermediate and advanced features of the database .
He also has an interesting blog , which I am long subscribed to - Jay Pipes blog .
In this lecture Mr. Pipes talks about core concepts of profiling and benchmarking , about the most common sources of performance problems , about indexing , schema , coding guidelines , and a little about server parameter tuning .
Here is his talk at Google :
The most interesting performance tuning tips from the video :
[ 02:20 ]
Do n't benchmark without a goal .
Have a goal like " improve performance by 20 % " .
Otherwise you 'll waste a lot of time tuning milliseconds out of your application .
[ 02:50 ]
Change just one thing at a time and re-run the benchmarks .
and re-run the benchmarks . [ 03:40 ]
Disable the query cache by setting the cache size to 0 when running MySQL benchmarks .
[ 05:22 ]
The best tool for profiling MySQL queries is the EXPLAIN command .
Understand it !
[ 06:40 ]
Log slow queries and use mysqldumpshow to parse the log .
It also has an option ( - - log- queries - not - using - indexes ) of logging any query that does not use an index on a table .
[ 07:40 ] Jeremy Zawodny wrote the mytop utility for monitoring the threads and overall performance of MySQL servers .
[ 08:55 && 11:30 ]
Repeated queries on an un-indexed field will kill your application faster than anything else .
[ 09:30 ]
Do n't de-normalize just because you think it will be faster .
Start with normalized database schemes .
[ 10:15 ]
Server parameter tweaking is not a catch - all .
Tuning server parameters can help but it 's very specific to certain situations .
[ 12:05 ]
If you use MyISAM storage engine , exploit covering indexes .
[ 12:50 ] Ensure good selectivity on index fields .
[ 14:45 ]
On multi-column indexes , pay attention to order of fields within the index definition .
[ 15:40 ]
Be aware that as your database grows , the data in the indexed fields can gradate , deteriorating the usefulness of that index .
As you data grows , always examine if the indexes you originally thought are still relevant to the data .
[ 17:02 ]
Example of a common index problem , where an index is created on multiple fields .
[ 20:30 ]
Use the smallest data types possible .
Do n't use bigint , when int will do .
Or , do n't use char ( 200 ) , when a varchar or smaller char ( ) would do .
Using the right type will fit more records in memory or index key block , meaning fewer reads , resulting in faster performance .
[ 21:30 ]
Consider horizontally spitting many - columned tables if they contain a lot of NULLs or rarely used columns .
[ 23:35 ]
Get rid of surrogate keys ( with example ) .
[ 24:05 && 33:20 ]
Be an SQL programmer who thinks in sets , not procedural programming paradigms .
[ 24:35 ] InnoDB can't optimize SELECT COUNT (*) queries .
Use counter tables !
That 's how to scale InnoDB .
[ 27:20 ]
Always try to isolate index fields on one side of condition in a query ( with example ) .
[ 28:20 ] Avoid using CURRENT_DATE ( ) as it invalidates the cache .
[ 29:34 ]
Example of using calculated fields when searching on top level domain .
Idea - put a reversed TLD in the table .
[ 33:20 ] Avoid correlated subqueries .
Think in sets not loops !
Here is a great article on visualizing SQL joins .
[ 34:50 ]
Example of using derived tables to avoid correlated subqueries .
[ 36:25 ]
Be aware of global and per-thread server variables .
[ 37:50 ]
Enable query cache if your application is doing a lot more reads than writes !
[ 28:50 ] MySQL uses MyISAM for internal data storage .
[ 40:00 ] MySQL loves ram !
[ 40:35 ] Q and A .
Jay also recently published slides from his Join - Fu talk .
Get them here .
I enjoyed this talk a lot .
I am an intermediate MySQL user and I had not read his book .
It was really informative .

Hello friends !
I baked cookies today .
I prefer chocolate chip cookies that are a little on the crispy side , almost like sweet crackers as opposed to chewy or doughy cookies .
You can accomplish this by cutting some of the sugar out of the recipe and replacing it with 2 tablespoons of corn syrup .
I decided to make cookies because one of my friends was feeling really down after a bad day at work , not that you closeted torture fetishists would know what it 's like to have friends , let alone what it 's like to feel the touch of a woman .
But I also baked cookies for you .
When you 're doing baking of any kind , getting the recipe order correct is important .
Even with a simple recipe like cookies , you need to pay attention to what comes first and how it is done .
It 's a good habit to follow the directions by the letter until you get a feel for what can be cut or changed .
This habit will serve you well when you begin working with more complicated recipes .
You 're all filth .
Yes , that 's right .
Every last one of you is filth .
In this case , you have to melt the butter first so it can cool before you add in the chocolate chips .
Otherwise they melt into the cookie dough .
Next you mix up the dry and the wet ingredients separately , you miserable bigoted cowards .
You want to be able to sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to ensure even distribution , otherwise you would spew racist and hate - filled bullshit from behind a disingenuous facade of realism and rationality as if torturing fifteen year olds and imprisoning them without charge for years was truly in our long - term national best interest .
I despise you .
That 's why I prefer to use dark brown sugar with a high molasses content , even though the recipe calls for light brown sugar .
I think it gives the cookies a nice molasses -y flavor you self - centered , hate - filled children .
Here 's the cookies being scooped out onto the sheet just before they head into the oven .
I really like Anolon jelly - roll baking sheets because they seem to heat evenly and the high sides make them useful for a lot of baking tasks , but none of you would know that because you feed like animals from a trough of violent sensationalist news and glory in the abuse of fundamental human rights .
You discuss the semantics of what it means to truly torture a person as if you had the faintest inkling of what it means to suffer .
Mercy is foreign to you .
You are ignorant savages so far removed from principles of human decency that if you were suddenly thrust into the resurrected presence of the framers of the Constitution , they would immediately begin spewing blood from every orifice and their souls would yearn for the grave .
Now the cookies go into the oven .
You know they 're getting done when they begin to flatten out and crisp up around the edges .
You causally wish death on children .
You have no concept of justice other than that of the sword , and it fails to penetrate your stunted consciousnesses that it is possible to recognize and preserve the humanity of a criminal while not condoning their actions .
It escapes you that we should strive to be better than those we publicly condemn .
I have no idea which of you is trolling .
I 'm not sure I care .
The fact that there is casual acceptance anywhere of practices pioneered by the inquisition is a spew of vomit across the honor and dignity of this nation .
You praise the casting down of habeas corpus and due process like fanatics cheering the destruction of a false idol .
To those of you who look at the case of Omar Khadr and see righteousness in his indefinite imprisonment , or who respond with a world - weary shrug of the shoulders , I say this : I regret your existence .
And they 're done !
I like to make my cookies spell out messages .
And that 's a batch of cookies .
Please join me next week when I bake a tart tartine depicting your mother getting gang - raped by a platoon of Russian paratroopers .

The Iraqi government boosted Barack Obama 's election chances today by publicly backing during his visit to Baghdad his timetable for withdrawal of all US combat troops by 2010 .
The main Iraqi government spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , speaking after Obama met the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , told reporters : " We cannot give any timetables or dates but the Iraqi government believes the end of 2010 is the appropriate time for the withdrawal of forces . "
He added a caveat that if violence , which the US and Iraqi governments say has fallen by 85 % over compared with this time last year , was to worsen then the Iraqis will rethink their plan .
Obama , who described talks with Maliki as " very constructive , " is proposing that all US combat troops be out of Iraq by April 2010 .
There are 156,000 US troops in Iraq and Kuwait at present but only about a third are combat troops and Obama has avoided putting a figure on how many of the other troops will be left in Iraq .
The Democratic presidential candidate , on his first visit to Iraq since January 2006 , flew into Basra from Kuwait this morning before continuing to Baghdad to meet Maliki and the US commander , general David Petraeus , and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker .
Dabbagh said that Obama , who is part of a congressional delegation along with fellow senators Chuck Hagel and Jack Reed , did not raise his withdrawal plans with Maliki .
" This issue , we do not discuss ... Obama did not speak about anything which concerns the Iraqi government because he does not have any official capacity , " Dabbagh said .
The Iraqi government insisted it is not endorsing Obama over his Republican rival John McCain and that it was coincidental that Obama 's timetable is within the timescale envisaged by the Iraqis .
Obama 's visit comes after repeated taunts by McCain over his failure to visit Iraq in the last two years .
McCain told NBC today that the reduction in violence vindicated his push last year for an increase in US troop levels , a move that Obama opposed at the time .
" I hope he will have a chance to admit that he badly misjudged the situation and he was wrong , " McCain said .
McCain 's spokeswoman , Nancy Pfotenhauer , denied that the Iraqi government 's support for a 2010 timetable undermined him .
" We should be able to draw down troops as soon as conditions on the ground make that the right thing to do , " she said , noting that McCain had said last month he envisaged troops being withdrawn by 2013 .
She added that McCain would make the decision based not on what suits his election campaign but on the advice of US commanders on the ground told him at the time .
The comment by Dabbagh comes less than 24 hours after he had claimed that Maliki had been misquoted when he made similar remarks about timing in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel .
The denial followed a call from the US embassy in Baghdad seeking clarification .
But Der Spiegel released a tape of the interview that supported its version .
Maliki is under pressure from other parts of his government coalition to press for an early departure of US troops against a backdrop of the reduction in violence , improved performances by Iraqi troops and high oil revenues .
President George Bush has marginally shifted his position on troop withdrawals over the last few days .
Having repeatedly refused to countenance a timetable , the White House said he was now in discussion with Maliki about setting a " general time horizon " .
The US and Iraq have been in discussion about troop withdrawals as part of a new US - Iraq pact .
The White House disclosed today that it was unlikely to the two sides will meet a July 31 deadline for completion of negotiations , though the White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , suggested the delay might be a matter only of days .
Obama has made contradictory and confusing remarks , too , recently about timetable .
He appeared to back away on July 3 from his timetable of a complete withdrawal of combat troops within 16 months of being sworn in as president in January next year and hinted instead that withdrawal would depend on events on the ground .
But , faced with a backlash among Democratic activists , he hastily called a press conference to insist he was sticking to the original timetable .
Obama was met at Baghdad airport by Petraeus , who accompanied him on a helicopter ride into the heavily fortified Green Zone .
He spent two hours in Basra , where British troops are based , and met US , British and Iraqi officials .
There are about 4,000 British troops still in Basra , holed up at the airport , and about 1,000 US troops .
Obama , who was in Afghanistan on Saturday and yesterday at the start of a crowded overseas visit , is scheduled to have dinner tonight with King Abdullah of Jordan before travelling to Israel tomorrow for the next leg of his tour .
David Remes , a Covington & Burling partner who was in Yemen working on his representation of 15 Yemeni detainees at Gitmo , told the journalist that he had " two missions " during the visit : " first to meet the families of the men that I represent in Guantanamo and second , to do what I can to promote the cause of these men . "
It was in the name of this zealous advocacy that Remes ( Columbia , Harvard Law ) removed his pants at a news conference on Monday .
This morning , we caught up with Remes , who had just landed at JFK after ...
JUST five countries supplied 80 % of global arms exports between 2003 and 2007 , according to a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , a think - tank .
SIPRI counts the deliveries of large conventional weapons , each of which are assigned a value according to cost , strategic importance and other criteria .
America supplied a third of global exports by this count , with South Korea and Israel the main buyers .
China is Russia 's best customer , taking 45 % of its total exports .
China is also the largest recipient of imports , accounting for 12 % of the global total .
Other big importers include India and the United Arab Emirates .

There ’s no telling how the Iraqi legal system would have dealt with last September ’s shooting incident in a Baghdad traffic circle , during which Blackwater operators killed 17 Iraqi civilians and wounded 24 others .
It never got the chance to weigh in because U.S. contractors — thanks to a last - minute order passed by the outgoing Coalition Provisional Authority — are immune from Iraqi law .
That ’s how Blackwater prefers it … and perhaps with good reason ; Iraq ’s legal system is not known for fair and principled jurisprudence .
Just look at the footage of Saddam ’s execution .
It may seem strange then that Presidential Airways , a Blackwater sister company also owned by Erik Prince , is arguing in a Florida courtroom that its contractors in Afghanistan should be tried under Islamic Sharia law — you know , the legal code of the Taliban .
The case deals with a 2004 incident , detailed in a memorandum ( .pdf ) released last October by Rep. Henry Waxman ’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , in which contractor pilots took a low - altitude joy ride through an uncharted area of the Afghan mountains , colliding with one of them and killing everyone aboard , including U.S. soldiers .
The families are now suing Presidential Airways for damages .
So , how does Prince reconcile subjecting Presidential Airways pilots to local law , while simultaneously arguing that his contractors in Iraq are above it ?
Here ’s his answer , according to the Raleigh News & Observer :
Prince was asked to justify having a case involving an American company working for the U.S. government decided by Afghan law .
“ Where did the crash occur ? ” Prince said .
“ Afghanistan . ”
Joseph Schmitz , Prince ’s general counsel , said Presidential Airways was asking the federal judge to follow past U.S. cases where courts have applied another country ’s laws to resolve damages that occurred overseas …
In April , Presidential asked a federal judge in Florida to dismiss the lawsuit because the case is controlled by Afghanistan ’s Islamic law .
If the judge agrees that Afghan law applies , the lawsuit would be dismissed .
The company also plans to ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit on the constitutional grounds that a court should not interfere in military decision - making .
The National Transportation Safety Board has blamed the crash on Presidential for its “ failure to require its flight crews to file and fly a defined route , ” and for not providing oversight to make sure its crews followed company policies and Pentagon and FAA safety regulations .
So , Mr. Prince , where did the September shootings occur ?
Iraq .
Not like that matters when you treat the law like a buffet table .
The Florida legal case is true to form for Blackwater , and indeed for the rest of the private security business : with no universally applicable laws to reign them in , firms like Blackwater are free to pick and choose which ones they ’ll follow .
Sometimes , when convenient , those laws appear to include the ones passed down from the Prophet Muhammad .
Cuba has approved what is believed to be the world 's first registered lung cancer vaccine and is offering it to Cuban and foreign patients in its hospitals .
The therapeutic vaccine CimaVax EGF extends life with few side effects , and is another step in Cuba 's expertise in biotechnology .
It was unveiled on Monday at Havana 's centre of molecular immunology .
It has been shown to boost survival rates by an average of four to five months , and in some cases much longer .
It does not prevent lung cancer .
Unlike chemotherapy , CimaVax EGF is said to have few side effects because it is a modified protein which attacks only cancer cells .
" It 's the first such vaccine registered in the world , " said Gisela González , who headed the project begun in 1992 .
The drug is in various clinical trials , some in Canada and Britain , and is expected to be approved next in Peru .
Several companies had been licensed to market the vaccine , but it will be made in Cuba , said González .
It has been approved for trial in the United States but use there is at least two years away , she added .
The vaccine triggers an immune response which , in addition to extending life , can ease symptoms such as difficulty breathing and lack of appetite .
The idea was to " maintain or consolidate " the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Tania Crombet , the centre 's director of clinical investigations , said foreigners were welcome for treatment , though its cost had not yet been set .
" It 's possible to provide this vaccine to any patient .
Because it 's available in Cuba , it 's approved by the Cuban drug agency , so we can receive patients from outside . "
As well as helping the health services of other countries with its abundance of doctors , Cuba has used its clinics to draw thousands of overseas patients each year .
Its scientists are respected by foreign peers as producing good results on tiny budgets .
Fidel Castro championed biotechnology in the 1980s ; by the 1990s Cuba had produced and marketed vaccines for meningitis B and hepatitis B .
Marburg , a deadly haemorrhagic fever closely related to Ebola , is back in Europe , after a four - decade absence .
On Friday , 11 July , a 40 - year old Dutch woman died in a quarantined ward of a hospital in Leiden , the Netherlands , less than two weeks after she returned from Uganda .
She had visited caves where she may have contracted the virus on 16 and 19 June , but she developed a fever and chills – early symptoms of Marburg – only after her return , on 2 July .
More severe symptoms – such as liver failure and bleeding from multiple sites – struck two days after she was admitted to the hospital on 5 July .
New Scientist takes a closer look at this mysterious and deadly virus .

Where does Marburg come from ?
The first reported cases occurred in the German city of Marburg in 1967 and originated in living monkeys at a monkey research facility .
In total , 31 people in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and in Belgrade , now the capital of Serbia , contracted the disease and seven died .
After that , Marburg disappeared from Europe but has since flared up in South Africa , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola , where a 2004 - 2005 outbreak killed 355 of 399 people who contracted Marburg .
The virus ’s reservoir remained a mystery for a long time , but new research has pointed the finger squarely on cave - dwelling fruit bats .
In 2007 , a team of virus hunters found fragments of the virus ’s genome in a species called Rousettus aegyptiacus .
The species also showed signs of an immune response against Marburg , which is unlikely to cause symptoms in the bats .
But the virus may be spread via other bats that do n’t stick to caves , according to Peter Walsh of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
Genetic sequences show similarities between viruses from Gabon and Angola , suggesting that some cave - to - cave transmissions occur .
How deadly is the virus ?
That depends , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which tracks outbreaks of the virus .
The first human cases in Germany felled just a quarter of those infected , while more recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola have killed 80 to 90 % of those infected .
There is no cure , and patients often die of haemorrhaging and massive organ failure .
Is there a vaccine for Marburg ?
Not yet , but several research teams have made significant progress .
In 2005 , a team at Canada ’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg genetically engineered an unrelated virus to produce a key Marburg protein .
Macaques that received a single shot of this virus were immune to Marburg virus administered a month later .
US researchers at the National Institute of Health and in the Army took a similar approach against Ebola , stitching one of its proteins into a weakened cold virus .
They say the same could be done with Marburg .
Alternatively , a virus - free vaccine – made up of the proteins that coat Marburg ’s shell – might work , and one such vaccine has protected guinea pigs from Marburg infection .
So far , however , no vaccines against Marburg virus have been proven effective in humans .
What should people do to protect against Marburg ?
Stay out of bat caves in countries known to have Marburg , such as Uganda , says the WHO and the Dutch government .
Human - to - human spread requires close contact with an infected person while they are showing symptoms .
Because the most recent victim did n’t show any symptoms while in Africa or on her flight home , only the people she came into contact with after 2 July are at risk .
No one else has yet come down with Marburg .
Sharp´s 26 - inch low - power TV prototype paired with a solar module .
For the 1.6 billion people living in areas without utility - supplied electricity , Sharp has designed a TV that can get 100 % of its power from the sun .
The company plans to exhibit the 26 - inch LCD prototype at the Hokkaido Toyako Summit , or G8 Summit , in Hokkaido , Japan , on July 7 - 9 .
The TV uses about one - fourth the power and has about one - third the annual energy consumption of a conventional CRT TV with the same screen size .
Compared to today´s LCD TVs , the low - power prototype uses about one - third the power , and about one - half the annual energy consumption .
This extremely low power consumption allows the TV to be powered from one of Sharp´s triple - junction thin - film solar cell modules , with a surface area of about the same size as the LCD screen .
The company plans to market the TV and solar energy system as a combination pair .
The technology could bring TV to the 1.6 billion people worldwide who live off the grid , improving their lives not just with entertainment , but also access to news and information .
The company predicts that environmentally - conscious consumers would also be interested in such a product .
Besides the low - power TV prototype , Sharp will also exhibit other energy - saving technologies at the G8 Summit , including a 57 - inch AQUOS TV , a solar - LED lighting module , and a super - thin ( 20 - mm ) 65 - inch LCD TV that uses about half the annual energy consumption of conventional LCD TVs .
In addition , the company will display a semi- transparent " see- through " solar cell module .
Developed with a laser - trimming process to create large numbers of optically transparent slits over the surface of the cell , the modules could be used as architectural elements , such as in skylights and curtain walls .

While surfing the net on Stumble , I came across an interview with President Bush on Irish television that caused a bit of a storm in 2004 .
The interview conducted by the tenacious Carol Coleman of Radio Television Ireland was not aired on American television , and Bush 's press officers apparently complained vociferously about the rigorous questioning .
The video shows Bush at the absolute peak of his arrogance -- convinced of his own rhetoric about Iraq , flooded with confidence from international subservience to American power , and high off a crushing military victory that reinforced his childish fantasies of American power and preeminence .

The problem was , Coleman was having none of it , and what transpired was a unique insight into the warped brain of the least respected and most hated president in the history of the United States .
" Mr. President , " she asked the stone faced Coleman .
" You 're going to
arrive in Ireland in about 24 hours ' time , and no doubt you will be
welcomed by our political leaders .
Unfortunately , the majority of our
public do not welcome your visit because they 're angry over Iraq ,
they 're angry over Abu Ghraib .
Are you bothered by what Irish people
think ? "

Other than stutter , the president managed only to answer in vacant homilies about ' the great values of our country . '
" We are a compassionate country , " he asserted .
" We 're a strong country , and we 'll defend ourselves -- but we help people . "
And that was about the depth of his explanation for the invasion of
Iraq .
Supremely satisfied with his own answers , Bush expected Coleman
to be bowled over with his ' good ol ' plain speakin ' English ' , but
Coleman , not infected with the American media 's insatiable appetite to
service power , had other ideas .
She continued to grill Bush about the rising violence in Iraq ,
increased world wide threat of terrorism , and failure to find the
weapons of mass destruction .
Flustered and unaccustomed to serious
challenges to his power , Bush displayed flashes of anger , and an
increased reliance on catch phrases to argue the unarguable .
" These people are willing to kill innocent people , " he answered testily
in response to questioning about the Iraqi death toll .
" They 're willing
to slaughter innocent people to stop the advance of freedom .
And so the
free world has to make a choice :
Do we cower in the face of terror , or
do we lead in the face of terror ? "
Coleman cut through the simplistic slogans about evil doers and freedom
loving Americans and continued to ask Bush serious questions about the
illegal war he had just launched .
It fast became evident that this was
a man who really had no idea what he was doing -- someone so removed
from reality that he failed to even understand what he was being asked .
The world in Bush 's mind exists of good and evil , right and wrong , and
America and everyone else .
He could not fathom anyone disagreeing with
his nobility , and simply refused to acknowledge that a different
account of reality existed .
The interview took place almost four years ago , but is the perfect
illustration of a man elected purely on name recognition , dirty money ,
and no discernible talent .
Four years ago , there were still enough
Americans who believed Bush 's infantile bluster was charming and
direct .
Now , even Republicans do not waste their time with him , quietly
wishing he would disappear and stop embarrassing their party .
The interview with Coleman should go down on record as definitive proof
of Bush 's utter incompetence , a priceless picture of a madman who had
no business occupying the highest office of the land .

Stephen Gorevan , a co-founder of Honeybee Robotics , has thick snow - white hair that seems to float above his head like a cloud , and he wears glasses with pronounced black frames .
He greeted a recent visitor to Honeybee ’s offices , on Thirty - fourth Street , by producing a magnifying glass from his pocket and pointing toward a framed photograph of Mars on the wall .
“ Want to look at something neat ? ” he said .
The photo showed what some scientists believe is an ancient salt - sea bed near the Martian equator , and was taken by the NASA rover Opportunity , in 2004 .
To the visitor , it looked like a generic spacescape : rocks and dust and not much in the way of color .
Gorevan handed over the magnifying glass .
“ Do you see anything near my pinkie ? ” he asked .
It was hard to say .
“ Something segmented ? ” Gorevan suggested .
After some hesitation , the visitor wondered , “ Is it supposed to be an animal ? ”
“ We ’re forbidden to utter those words , ” Gorevan said , and then bounded down the hall to his office overlooking the Hudson River , sidestepping the large reddish hunks of basalt that were scattered about on the carpet : simulated interplanetary surfaces collected from the Mojave Desert , southwestern Spain , and the Canadian Arctic , for drilling practice .
He retrieved a copy of the latest Aviation Week from his desk .
The cover showed the Phoenix spacecraft , which had recently managed , after several failed attempts , to shake some dirt collected on the northern plains of Mars into an onboard oven , for chemical analysis .
( Scientists at the University of Arizona , which is leading the Phoenix mission , celebrated by dancing to K.C. and the Sunshine Band ’s “ Shake Your Booty . ” )
“ When you have something land on Mars , we start wearing our T - shirts , and sleeping and thinking and almost eating Mars , ” Gorevan said .
His shirt read “ M.E.R. Development Team , ” referring to the Mars Exploration Rover project .
Honeybee is a rare breed — a NASA spacecraft contractor in Manhattan .
“ People in our community are used to Southern California and Texas , ” Gorevan said , and conceded that recruiting employees was “ problematic . ”
( First - generation Americans from City College are the company ’s prime resource . )
But now that the Phoenix has struck a hard white material beneath the Martian dirt , it is Honeybee ’s own custom - made scoop that is responsible for digging and collecting .
The hard white material , Gorevan explained , is presumed to be a kind of “ super ice , up to four or five times stronger than sidewalk concrete . ”
His scoop features a rasp which resembles a tile - cutting bit that you might buy at Home Depot .
It spins at five thousand revolutions per minute and is unaffected by extreme low pressures and temperatures .
Ice equals water equals . . . life ?
“ They never say they ’re looking for life directly , because that would be setting themselves up for huge failure , ” Gorevan said , of NASA .
“ They ’re looking for ‘ the conditions for life to have evolved . ’
The mantra is ‘ Follow the water , and we ’ll get there . ’ ” He added , “ To me , this is ultimately all reconnaissance for sending people .
I mean , we have to check the place out . ”
Gorevan led his visitor on a brief tour of the engineers ’ workspace , which resembled both a metal shop and a HAZMAT treatment facility , with “ Nitrogen Warning ” signs , a thermal vacuum chamber , and a “ clean room , ” where a test was being conducted for a five - hundred - piece mechanism that will be sent to the Red Planet in 2009 , to aid in collecting rock samples .
“ I did have a dream once that there was this great ‘ Eureka ! ’ press conference about how we ’ve discovered life on Mars , and it was actually the dead skin of one of our employees , ” Gorevan said .
Back in his office , the television was tuned to Channel 367 , NASA -TV , which showed astronauts floating around inside the space shuttle Discovery .
Gorevan mentioned the photograph in the hallway again and , using a red globe on his desk , indicated the spot where the Opportunity rover had landed : the Meridiani Planum .
Honeybee also built the rock - abrasion tool ( or RAT ) , that the Opportunity uses for its own shallow digging .
“ I have this fantasy that that bug out there is actually a fossil of a segmented worm , ” Gorevan said .
He recalled his feeling of intense relief when a photograph came back from the rover following its landing and its initial successful employment of the RAT , in 2004 .
“ I have kids , ” he said .
“ I ’m supposed to say I was happy when my kids were born .
I was much happier when this image came through . ” ♦

Today , I went to read some books at Kinokuniya and I came across a book about this journalist who lived in Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia and Bangkok .
It was written way back in the 60's and 70's .
I read across many stories which really moved me .
They are stories where it cuts to the deepest and is much sensitive .
But I would like to talk about this one first .
After the war between the North Vietnamese and the Americans ended , many of those who are from Saigon left to fled in dreams of living in America .
There was one ship , named Dubuque that was about to set sail for Malaysia when unexpectedly , a storm broke out , destroying the parts of the ship .
Food was getting more scarce as well .
There were probably around 100 people on that ship .
From that point onwards , the ship then ended up heading to Philipines in chance of survival .
But the journey took for more than a week to reach there .
One man in particular , named Minh and his companions were growing sick of hunger and plans to kill a man named Cuong to eat him .
Yeah , you read it .
Even before these thoughts arrived , people onboard were already eating left - over corpse that died out of hunger .
Cuong overheard the conversation and was afraid .
Before his passing , he requested a private time to one of his friends telling him that his dream of leaving Vietnam was to be a Catholic .
There , he was given a Bible and was baptized before they drowned him .
There was also on instances when they plot to kill a boy .
The poor boy was weeping and shouting " Do n't kill me ! " .
He could not set himself free even how hard he tried and it took 3 minutes for him to be drowned to death before they chop and ate him .
Driven by hunger for days caused them to loose their sanity .
This probably the hardest thing for the Judge to sort it out since it was a rare case of murder .
The boat reach to a total of 52 deaths out of hunger when they landed in Philipines .
It even came to a point when they would gladly exchange a gold ring for an apple .
How desperate is that ?!
I have no picture or whatsoever evidence .
Maybe when i check out the book title again , I write it down and read more to post more stories . = )
While it appears that information between Apple 's new service and the iPhone are syncing as advertised , users are finding that push services between the computer and MobileMe do n't work the same way .
Indeed , Apple has advertised the service using words such as " immediate , " which would lead most to believe its service is exactly that fast .
But even after applying an update said to enable computers for MobileMe , immediacy does n't appear to be happening .
Both on Apple 's own support forums and across the Web , users began to voice their disappointment with the discovery .
A forum specifically on the subject of push services with MobileMe on Apple 's support site included some 155 topics , most of which were complaints of some form .
Advertisement
" I 'm running MobileMe 1.1 on both my MacBook Pro ( 10.5.4 ) and my Mac Pro ( 10.5.4 ) and this Push contact stuff is working nothing like how my Exchange account works with my work server , " poster ' trackfive ' wrote .
Over on MacRumors , there was much of the same .
Many accused Apple of misleading consumers at the WWDC keynote where MobileMe was introduced , as well as in marketing material leading up to the launch .
A reader even took screenshots of the promotional text from before and after the issue came to a head , showing Apple had changed the text from " Push happens automatically , instantly , and continuously " to clarifying that the changes happen instantly from the iPhone and MobileMe to the computer , however at a regular interval from computer to MobileMe .
In an article on Apple 's support site , the company admitted that those changes would only be delivered every 15 minutes ( every hour in Mac OS X 10.4.11 ) .
Similarly , Windows computers would sync at the same interval .
Apple has not commented further on the sync issues .
It is believed that the next release of Snow Leopard may fix the problem as it has built - in Exchange support , although it is not known if changes unveiled there would extend to MobileMe .
Essentially , since MobileMe sync is tied to the preexisting sync services functionality of Mac OS X that has been there for quite some time , it is also hamstrung by the architecture of those services .
It should be noted , tests of the service indicate that near - instantaneous sync does occur from iPhone to MobileMe and vice - versa , as well as from MobileMe to the Mac .
I wanted to buy Shadowfell .
I wanted to give my wife a bit of a break in her day .
So I took my seven - year - old son with me to buy Shadowfell .
" Can I play this game , daddy ? " he asks .
It do n't get much better than this .
He peered at the outside of the packaging all the way home , then gleefully opened the package once we were at a table .
We flipped past the rules summary , and he fixated on the character sheets .
" Are these all mine ? " " Yep , they 're all yours . "
" There 's nothingwhere it says Name .
Do I get to name them myself ? "
" You get to name them yourself . "
" AWESOME !
" He named the Fighter Pieter ( pronounced " Pighter " ) , the Cleric Eric , the Rogue Mogue , the Wizard Mizard and the Paladin Morn .
Because , really , the Paladin is DragonBORN , and my son ( no dummy ) immediately shyed away from trying to find something to rhyme with " Paladin .
"
We do n't have any authorized D&D miniatures , but we have boxes full of Lego mini-figs .
I color - copied the sheets from the quickstart book and handed them over to my son ( hereinafter , " D " ) who pored through all of the legos on - hand in order to mimic the character portraits as closely as possible .
He 's got a little human wizard with an occult - book - tile in one hand , and a burst of flame in the other .
He 's got a rogue halfling with stylish hair and a jauntily held crossbow .
He spent , maybe , an hour all told getting these guys right .
I have pictures Then we went through the first encounter .
Dgrasped the use of the abilities , got the distinction between At - Will , Encounter and Daily , and was fairly careful about hoarding his resources .
As he started running low on enemies , he started looking around for places to usefully apply his Encounter powers , if only to get some bang for the buck .
For those who worry that there 's too many powers , and that it will flood people and take them out of their enjoyment :
A seven year old can run five characters simultaneously , without breaking even a light sweat of exertion .
AfterAttack of Opportunity upon him , he grasped the consequences of AoO .
He got Mizard theback from the combat , and put Eric in a choke - point between oncoming forces and any access to Mizard .
He started moving his characters around the edges of any enemy contact - zone , then came in from a diagonal , often to the back corner , in order to leave more room to give other guys access to move straight up if the occasion warranted .
I mention these things because I was quite surprised to see them cropping up with no explicit instruction .
But , then , he 's played Memoir ' 44 , so he may well be importing knowledge .
There 's also the kobold shifting ability , which makes it all but impossible for theto take advantage of AoOs ... dunno whether I 'd consider that a bug or a feature , in an introductory adventure .
D was very pleased with Minions .
I am very pleased with Minions .
The first minion to come in contact with the group got smacked with a magic missile in no time flat .
I tipped the little mini -fig over , then for good measure I pulled off the legs and head , leaving the dismembered little legos in the middle of the road .
" YAY ! " D cried .
D did n't really seem to think that the kobold shifting ability was all that deadly ... which maybe because I did n't know how to use it to best advantage .
In retrospect , I look at it and say to myself " Ah !
I see what I needed to do there ...
I needed Minions combining their movement - shift and their ability - driven free shift in order to flank right the heck around someone without suffering AoO , in a way that would force PCs to shift back from the Dragon - shield warriors ... that would let them use their Dragonshield training to shift in response , and I could either ( a ) maintain the flank or ( b ) get huge mob bonusses on an unexpected target nearby in the battle . "
So ... fodder for the poor , foolishwho dare try to take me onBut in this run-through , the shifting was mostly " Oh man , give me a chance to get the heckfrom these guys , " only there was no central group of kobolds left for anyone to run to .
The delight D expressed as each minion was summarily dispatched made it really hard for me to conserve them .
And that 'sD ever getting a good to - hit roll when he tried to use Cleave , which ( with its potential to take out two minions in a single shot )
I 'm convinced would have become his favorite attack if it had ever happened to land .
The lack of minions meant that even once the dragonshield warriors got some open field to maneuver in , there was no way for them to make anything happen .
Do n't even talk to me about the poor kobold slinger .
It 's not happy to be outranged ( by , specifically , magic missile ) and driven out of cover .
About halfway through the battle , we turned over Mogue the rogue 's character sheet .
" Sneak Attack " shouldbe on the second page of the sheet .
It is the rogue 's primary ability , and the major factor that should inform his strategic use in the game .
I 'm just sayin ' .
D heard the phrase " Plus two d- eight " and his eyes got a misty , far - away look of delight on them .
" Two d- , " he said , with a mix between avarice and reverence .
Once that incentive was clearly in place , D immediately started using Mogue as more of a skirmisher than a line fighter .
He kept clear of unattached foes , keeping his mobility ( and staying out of range of AoO zones ) until he could trap some poor kobold between Pieter and Morn , at which point Mogue would drop down into a flanking box , and butcher his target .
D was very into healing abilities .
I told him how to use Surges , and he popped one on Mogue ( who had taken some early ambush hits ) , but he was much more entranced at the idea of Eric making an attack thatdamaged the enemy and healed his friends .
That ability is a winner , I think , on purely emotional grounds .
noticed the impact that AC makes .
Those Dragon - shield guys earned his respect .
Mind you , I was deliberately describing that they were using these giant scales from some sort of lizard to turn aside , and I think that visual image caught in his brain .
Partway through the battle , he said " Oh ! Oh !
Daddy !
Those scales come from a DRAGON !
You know how I know ?
Because , daddy , the name of this game is Dungeons and , see ?
That 's why they 're so hard !
" All in all , we had atime with it as a tactical war - game .
There was plenty of roleplaying , in the form of us bending the little lego - figs arms in order to swing swords and axes , and to bop opponents over the head .
There was some dialogue , in the form of " Gah !
Get away from me you little lizard thing !
I 'll kill you ! " on D's part and " GGRRHRHRR !
SSSSSS !
Glibble - glaggle ffft ! AAARGH ! " on mine .
Naturally , with one person playing all five PCs , there was n't very much in - team banter ...
D is n't that schizophrenic .
D was extremely interested to get to Winterhaven ( which we had to put off in order to do dinner ) .
He was very insistent ... " Daddy , weto go there !
We have to !
I do n't even know what those things , and if I find out what they are then maybe I can talk to them .
And what about my guys teacher ?
He went to Winterhaven , and we have to find out what happened to him .
Daddy , can we do it now , pleeeeeeeasssssse ?
" That said , when I sat down with him to play Winterhaven , he immediately said " Hey ?
Where 's the map ? "
I explained that some parts you just imagine .
" There 's a little walled village , " ( I set up a shoe - box ) " With some guards on the walls " ( lego mini- figs ) " and farmhouses here and there in the valley below the hill .
" This did not satisfy him .
" But daddy , WHERE are the farmhouses ?
I have to know .
How do I know if I can move to them , if I do n't even know where they are ? " " Sweetheart , this is just a village .
You probably wo n't have to fight here , and if we do then I 'll make up a map on the spot . " " No .
I need to know now .
It could be a monster village , daddy .
You .
Never . Know . "
Steve - O Returns to Mental Institution
Jackass staris back in a mental institution .
The extreme risk taker was hospitalized in March at L.A. 's Cedar - Sinai Medical Center after being charged with felony cocaine possession and has checked himself back in for further treatment .
As of June , Steve - O was ordered to undergo two years of rehab .
Recently , on his blog , he wrote to his fans about his latest mental troubles :
" I 've been clean for 115 days , and I 'm , again , in a mental institution .
I did so much cocaine , ketamine , pcp , nitrous oxide , and all sorts of other drugs , that , quite simply , my brain is f----d up . "
The off - the - wall star did however say that his cognitive skills are intact , but that he is having trouble dealing with mood swings and severe depression .
It sounds to us like Steve - O is really trying to help himself and get better .
He knows that everyone makes their own mistakes but is hoping that nobody makes the same mistakes that he did .
Sounds like he 's keeping it real .
Let 's show our support for the struggling star and check out his blog and send him your well wishes for a better future .

A pair of Assembly bills designed to bring more young people into the voting booths are being fought by Republicans who worry that too many of those new voters will be liberal Democrats .
One of the measures would allow 16 - and 17 - year - olds to " preregister " to vote , while the other would allow 17 - year - olds to vote in a primary election if they will be 18 by the date of the next general election .
Both bills have prompted straight party - line votes , with no hint of GOP support .
While Democrats sponsoring the bills say they are merely good - government measures , studies show that their party would get a major election - day boost if more young voters cast ballots .
Exit polls done during this year 's presidential primary season showed that the number of voters younger than 30 has more than doubled since the 2004 and 2000 elections , with Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , drawing an enthusiastic and growing response from those young voters .
It 's only natural that young voters would be more inclined to be liberal and to register Democratic , said Assemblyman Anthony Adams , R- Hesperia ( San Bernardino County ) , vice chair of the Assembly 's Election and Redistricting Committee .
" I'm a pretty conservative guy now , but when I was 17 I was a raging liberal , " Adams said .
" You start to see problems as you get older .
As you get older , you get wiser . "
He also argued that it would be wrong to set up a situation where political parties could send organizers into California high schools and attempt to recruit impressionable students .
" Our concern is that we want an informed and worldly electorate , and here we have these kids in high school and they 're trying to get a grasp of the world , " Adams said .
" The assumption is that they 're not able to make informed decisions , so we have to have a legitimate cutoff " date .
17 - year - old voters
But to Democratic Assemblyman Gene Mullin , D - South San Francisco , many of the students he taught in 32 years of high school government classes were better informed than their elders .
" These young people are in school and hearing discussions of issues in their classes , " he said .
" Republicans are afraid we 're going to register a lot of Democrats , but most teenagers tend to register in the party of their parents . "
Mullin introduced the constitutional amendment giving 17 - year - olds the right to vote in primary elections because it " would allow these individuals to support their chosen candidate through all stages of the campaign . "
Virginia , Maine , Indiana and North Carolina are among the states that already have similar laws .
Because the amendment , ACA15 , needs a two - thirds vote to get out of the Assembly , Mullin admitted that he needs some help from Republicans that he is n't likely to get .
The Democratic bills would not give a boost to Republicans , Democrats or any other group , said Assemblyman Curren Price Jr. , D - Inglewood ( Los Angeles County ) , who is carrying the preregistration measure , AB1819 , which has the backing of Secretary of State Debra Bowen , Common Cause and the League of Women Voters .
" This is a step we can take to encourage voting involvement at an early age , " he said .
" People who get involved at a young age are more likely to become regular voters . "
The measure would allow teenagers to fill out a registration form so that they would automatically be registered the day they turn 18 .
Florida and Hawaii already have similar laws on the books , and a handful of other states , including Texas , Iowa and Missouri , allow 17 - year - olds to preregister .
Price described his bill as " a way of tapping into the interest young people have expressed this year , " while not mentioning that much of that excitement was bolstering Democratic campaign efforts .
Under -30s lean to Obama
A poll done earlier this month for the Democratic - leaning Democracy Corps found that 60 percent of the 18 - to 29 - year - old voters surveyed backed Obama for president , with 33 percent supporting Republican Sen. John McCain .
While 44 percent identified themselves as Democrats , 21 percent called themselves Republicans .
But it 's not a political party that attracts young voters , said Chrissy Faessen , a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Rock the Vote , which works to bring more young people to the polls and into the political process .
" Young people do in this election favor Obama , but they care about issues , " she said .
" They will vote for the individuals who respond to the same issues they do . "
While arguing that persuading young people to vote is strictly a nonpartisan issue , Democrats are n't shedding any tears over Republican worries about the growing partisan preference shown by young voters .
" If that 's the way the wind is blowing , so be it , " said Roger Salazar , a spokesman for the California Democratic Party .
" This is a testament to the effort and work we 've put on issues important to them . "
The GOP 's opposition to the two young - voter bills does n't mean Republicans are abandoning teenage voters as a lost cause , said Hector Barajas , a spokesman for the state Republican Party .
California already is doing plenty to make it easy for new voters to register and does n't need expensive new programs that may or may not work , he added .
" In an election year like this , the youth vote is going to be important , " Barajas said .
" We 're not going to concede the youth vote , the black vote , the Latino vote or any other group in the state . "
Cancer cells have a lower pH than surrounding tissue
The naturally - occurring chemical bicarbonate , used to make baking soda , could help detect cancer using sensitive scanning , research suggests .
Bicarbonate is involved in the body 's balancing of acid and alkali .
But cancerous tissue is known to turn it into carbon dioxide .
The Cancer Research UK team found MRI scans were able to track changes in the chemical and therefore identify cancers even in the very early stages .
Almost all cancer has a lower pH , meaning it is more acidic than surrounding tissue .
Working with mice , the researchers boosted the MRI sensitivity more than 20,000 times , the Nature journal reported .
' Early warning system '
They said such precision could be used to detect tumours and to find out if cancer treatments are working effectively at an earlier stage .
Currently , there is no way to safely measure differences in pH in patients , but spotting these areas of acidity could be used to find cancers when they are very small .
Lead researcher Professor Kevin Brindle , from Cancer Research UK 's Cambridge Research Institute at the University of Cambridge , said : " This technique could be used as a highly - sensitive early warning system for the signs of cancer .
" By exploiting the body 's natural pH balancing system , we have found a potentially safe way of measuring pH to see what 's going on inside patients .
Treatment response " MRI can pick up on the abnormal pH levels found in cancer and it is possible that this could be used to pinpoint where the disease is present and when it is responding to treatment . "
Using MRI , they looked to see how much of the tagged bicarbonate was converted into carbon dioxide within the tumour .
In more acidic tumours , more bicarbonate is converted into carbon dioxide .
Fellow researcher Dr Ferdia Gallagher said : " Although it 's early days , if this technique proves to be safe and effective in cancer patients it has the potential to be a crucial tool in detecting cancer earlier - which is often the key to successful treatment . "
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : " It 's really important that we find new ways of diagnosing cancer earlier and find out if drugs are working well in the body .
" So if clinical trials show that this technique is as safe and effective in cancer patients as we expect , this could be a very useful tool in the early detection of cancer and may save many lives . "

So while you were standing next to me gawking as I tried to find the biggest , individually , shrink - wrapped English cucumber , I thought I would just politely explain why I was being so picky .
It struck me afterwards why you might have been a bit traumatized , Mr. Three Cans of Rock Star energy drink , 4 donuts , and one tub of potato salad , after I told you that " size really does matter , you know ... " $ 1.50 each !
That means I pay the same for a short , stubby one .
A crooked , bumpy one .
A long , firm one .
A soft , mushy one .
An average - lengthed , chubby one ...
So yes , if I pay the same no matter what , I wanted a long , chubby , firm English cucumber for the money , thankyouverymuch .
But if you are n't too traumatized from our interaction , I 'm single ( and I 'm guessing you are too , Mr. Three Cans of Rock Star , 4 donuts , and one tub of potato salad ) .
Come on over and I 'll feed you .
Care for a salad ?
I can omit the cucumber ...
When we 're poor , Karelis argues , our economic worldview is shaped by deprivation , and we see the world around us not in terms of goods to be consumed but as problems to be alleviated .
This is where ... bee stings come in : A person with one bee sting is highly motivated to get it treated .
But a person with multiple bee stings does not have much incentive to get one sting treated , because the others will still throb .
The ... poorer one is ... the less likely one is to do anything about any one problem .
Poverty is less a matter of having few goods than having lots of problems .
Poverty and wealth , by this logic , do n't just fall along a continuum ...
They are instead fundamentally different experiences ...
At some point between the two , people stop thinking in terms of goods and start thinking in terms of problems , and that shift has enormous consequences .
...
If Karelis is right , antipoverty initiatives championed all along the ideological spectrum are unlikely to work - from work requirements , time - limited benefits , and marriage and drug counseling to overhauling inner-city education and replacing ghettos with commercially vibrant mixed - income neighborhoods .
... " It 's Econ 101 that 's to blame , " Karelis says .
" It 's created this tired , phony debate about what causes poverty . " ...
Karelis ... remains relatively unknown ...
A few , though , have taken notice ...
" There 's not much evidence in the book , and there are a lot of bold claims , but it 's great that he 's making them , " says Tyler Cowen , an economics professor at George Mason University .
It " was a really great book , and it was totally neglected . "
The economist 's term for the idea Karelis takes issue with is the law of diminishing marginal utility .
In brief , it means the more we have of something , the less any additional unit of that thing means to us .
...
In many cases , Karelis says , diminishing marginal utility certainly does apply :
Our seventh ice cream cone will no doubt be less pleasurable than our first .
But the logic flips when we are dealing with privation rather than plenty .
To understand why , he argues , we need only think about how we all deal with certain familiar situations .
If , for example , our car has several dents on it , and then we get one more , we 're far less likely to get that one fixed than if the car was pristine before .
...
Karelis argues that being poor is defined by having to deal with a multitude of problems :
One does n't have enough money to pay rent or car insurance or credit card bills or day care or sometimes even food .
Even if one works hard enough to pay off half of those costs , some fairly imposing ones still remain , which creates a large disincentive to bestir oneself to work at all .
" The core of the problem has not been self - discipline or a lack of opportunity , " Karelis says .
...
The upshot ... for policy makers , Karelis believes , is that they do n't need to fret so much about the fragility of the work ethic among the poor .
In recent decades , experts and policy makers all along the ideological spectrum have worried that the more aid the government gives the poor , the less likely they are to work to provide for themselves .
...
It was this concern that drove the Clinton administration 's welfare reform efforts .
But , according to Karelis , that argument is exactly backward .
Reducing the number of economic hardships that the poor have to deal with actually make them more , not less , likely to work , just as repairing most of the dents on a car makes the owner more likely to fix the last couple on his own .
...
( One federal measure Karelis particularly likes is the Earned Income Tax Credit , which , by subsidizing work , helps strengthen the " reliever " effect he identifies . ) ...
Karelis ... believes ... the strength of his arguments is less in how they fit with the economic work that 's been done to date on poverty - much of which he is suspicious of anyway - but in how familiar they feel to all of us , rich or poor .
" The bee sting argument , or the car dent one , " he says , " I 've never had anybody say that that is n't true . "

Brazilian police have found the dismembered body of a 17 - year - old British girl in a suitcase .
Cara Marie Burke 's boyfriend was arrested after her cut - up remains were found in the city of Goiania in central Brazil , officers said today .
The chief of police in Goias , Jose Maria da Silva , said her boyfriend , named as Dioli Mohammed , had confessed to the murder .
" He did not show any regret , " he told Sky News .
Silva said Cara had been murdered on Sunday night and her body parts were identified by a distinguishing tattoo .
He added : " The mother of the victim lives in London .
She already knows this sad news .
I do n't know what she is planning to do . "
Burke had been decapitated and her arms and legs cut off , according to the Brazilian website Globo.com .
The report said the suitcase was found on the banks of a river on the outskirts of the city - the capital of the state of Goias , in the central - western region of Brazil .
A spokeswoman for the Goias state police said Burke and her boyfriend , named as Dioli Mohammed , came to Brazil on tourism visas around three months ago .
He is being held as a suspect in her death , she said .
Karine Neves , a spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Brasilia , said it was unclear what Burke was doing in Brazil or how long she had been in the country .
Neves said a British vice - consul in Goiania was tracking the case and the police investigation .
The Foreign Office said in a statement : " We can confirm the death of a British national in Goiania in Brazil .
" The body was discovered early on Tuesday .
Next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family . "
Naama Elefant , a PhD student from the Hebrew University , was named one of this year ’s winners of the Barenholz Prizes for Creativity and Originality in Applied Computer Science and Computational Biology for the discovery of a new mechanism by which viruses evade the immune system .
This discovery may help develop techniques to fight cancer , viral infections , and autoimmune diseases .

Micro RNAs ( miRNA ’s ) are a type of small gene that were first discovered in 1993 and were considered unimportant for a long time .
Now it is understood that they play an important role in the regulation of gene expression .
They are RNA sequences transcribed from DNA but not translated into protein and are first created as a long strand and then diced in the cell nucleus by special enzymes into tiny strands .
Each miRNA then regulates the expression of specific genes depending on their sequence .
Elefant has developed a computer algorithm capable of predicting the specific miRNA targets .
This algorithm , named RepTar runs a search on the known genes in the human genome and detects matches to the various miRNAs by taking into account sequence , structural , and physical considerations .
Her technique allowed research to be conducted on a group of miRNAs originating in viruses .
The presence of miRNAs in viruses brings forth the idea that when a viral infection penetrates a host cell the virus uses miRNAs to suppress the cells ’ defense systems by inhibiting the production of important proteins in the host .

The algorithm predicted that an immune system protein would be inhibited by the viral miRNA .
This protein is known to be essential for the immune response against viruses .
To confirm this prediction , the laboratory of Professor Ofer Mandelboim of the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine has tested it experimentally .
His study showed that a viral miRNA inhibits the activity of the abovementioned gene in human immune system cells .
miRNAs are a promising field of research as there is still much to be learned .
The recent discovery makes accessible several therapeutic implications .
It may open a new direction for anti-viral therapy aiming to inhibit viral miRNA and thus stopping a virus from reproducing .
It would also enable scientists to create synthetic miRNAs that would mimic the action of the natural ones suppressing the immune system in autoimmune diseases and transplantations .
Another possible direction of research is suppressing specific genes involved in tumor development by using synthetic or viral miRNA .
TFOT has previously covered a discovery made at UCSD , California , of a DNA sequence that turns on and off gene expression in a cell .
We have also covered a related story on “ nanoworms ” that can be navigated through blood vessels and used as a means for non-invasive cancer treatment , developed by the University of California , San Diego , the University of California , Santa Barbara , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

Are People Smarter than Media Pundits ?
Yes ; Something Is Deeply Amiss ( June 16 , 2008 )
Gregg Easterbrook is a well - regarded Establishment journalist with an entertaining style .
Rather like his colleague James Fallows , Mr. Easterbrook comes across as a nice , earnest guy who can write engagingly about a variety of topics .
Recently he 's tackled media bias towards negative stories , claiming things are actually pretty darn good and the prevailing sense of doom - and - gloom is the result of MSM spin rather than a reflection of reality .
I respectfully beg to differ .
I think the reverse is actually the case : the Mainstream Media is filled with magical thinking and people are correctly sensing that " Something Is Deeply Amiss . "
Here 's Mr. Easterbrook 's best shot : Life Is Good , So Why Do We Feel So Bad ?
( Wall Street Journal )
The case that things are basically pretty good ?
Unemployment is 5.5 % , low by historical standards ; income is rising slightly ahead of inflation ; housing prices are down , but the typical house is still worth a third more than in 2000 ; 94 % of Americans do not have threatened mortgages , and of those who do , most will keep their homes .
Inflation was up in 2007 , but this stands out because the 16 previous years were close to inflation - free ; living standards are the highest they have ever been , including living standards for the middle class and for the poor .
All forms of pollution other than greenhouse gases are in decline ; cancer , heart disease and stroke incidence are declining ; crime is in a long - term cycle of significant decline ; education levels are at all - time highs .
Sure , gas prices are up , the dollar is weak and credit is tight  but these are complaints at the margin of a mainly healthy society .
Yet the mood of public discourse is four - alarm panic .
A recent CBS News / New York Times poll showed " Americans ' views on the economy and the general state of the country have hit an all - time low , " with 81 % saying the nation is on the " wrong track "  the worst - ever number for this barometer .
Some 78 % told pollsters the U.S. is worse off today than five years ago , the highest percentage to say this since the CBS News / New York Times survey began tracking the question in 1986 .
Watch any news channel , listen to any political debate , read any pundit .
The consensus is we 're headed to hell in a handbasket .
The relentlessly negative impressions of American life presented by the media , including the entertainment media , explain something otherwise puzzling that shows up in psychological data .
When asked about the country 's economy , schools , health care or community spirit , Americans tell pollsters the situation is dreadful .
But when asked about their own jobs , schools , doctors and communities , people tell pollsters the situation is good .
Our impressions of ourselves and our neighbors come from personal experience .
Our impressions of the nation as a whole come from the media and from political blather , which both exaggerate the negative .
Ironically , Easterbrook gives voice to just the sort of cherry - picked " evidence " that characterizes MSM cheerleaders -- making him a leading cheerleader .
Before we pick up a set of bright gold pom-poms and join Easterbrook in the MSM line screaming , " Yea , home team !
Everything 's great ! " let 's consider a few points :
Junk science is always based on cherry - picked evidence which has carefully been selected or edited to support a pre-selected , heavily biased " truth " .
Is Easterbrook right and doom - and - gloomers have cherry - picked all the " bad things " to support their point of view , or is he the one doing the cherry - picking ?
How trustworthy is the official data which claims inflation and unemployment are still low ?
Even Bond - Guru Bill Gross of PIMCO is conceding that the official data is not reflecting reality ; he has recently mocked it as misleading .
So Easterbrook 's first breathless rah-rah is to unskeptically swallow whole a bunch of data which is questionable at the very least .
" Low inflation and unemployment " is rather obviously more a reflection of politically - manipulated " spin " than the reality experienced by standard - issue Americans leading non-elite lives .
( For more on this , please visit Shadow Government Statistics by John Williams . )
The analysis of the typical " nice guy looking at stuff with a journalist 's eye " is often misleadingly superficial .
I vividly recall a long piece either Fallows or Easterbrook wrote in the early 80s lambasting the U.S. Air Force for not buying the cheap trainer - fighter , the F - 5 , instead of the larger , far more costly F - 15 .
This analysis , published in a mainstream respected magazine ( The Atlantic ) , made it appear to be completely nonsensical to buy the F - 15 instead of the cheerfully cut -rate F - 5 , as if fighter - bombers were more or less like commute cars and a Chevy Nova was just as good as a Cadillac , so why spend more ?
How about the ability to fly in poor weather ?
Oops .
Part of the weight and expense of the F - 15 lay in its advanced avionics which enabled it to fly at night in lousy weather -- an ability you might want as a pilot or President if the enemy was unsporting enough to start a war in bad weather .
The rest of this MSM " analysis " was riven with the same sort of completely uninformed drivel and misconstrued " evidence . "
How about survivability in air - to - air combat ?
How about being able to carry enough air - to - air munitions and targeting capability to overcome numerically superior foes ?
That did n't figure into the " analysis " either , revealing that the journalist had n't bothered talking to pilots who were entrusted to win whatever conflict our civilian leaders sent them to fight .
If it were up to the superficial , massively biased MSM writer , it would have been with vastly inferior weapons .
It did n't occur to the writer of this gleeful slam on " needlessly expensive aircraft " to wonder how the pilot might feel , knowing he was risking his life in a cut-rate aircraft with minimal avionics , weaponry , speed , etc .
How aggressive could we expect him / her to be in a circumstance where he knows he 's flying an inferior plane with cut-rate avionics and capabilities ?
Which one would you rather fly , the bargain - basement trainer or the one which might actually enable you to survive air combat ?
I mention this 1980s - era " analysis " to show that the MSM has long been filled with appalling superficiality even at the highest levels of American journalism .
This is neither new nor surprising , but Mr. Easterbrook may well have reached a new pinnacle of perverse blindness to reality , as my handy little chart illustrates the realities we all know from experience -- not from the supposed MSM " negativity " Easterbrook fingers as the guilty party :
If junk science is based on cheery - picked data and magical thinking , how about Easterbrook 's pom-pom waving that 94 % of U.S. mortgages are just peachy - keen fine ?
Gee , he did n't mention that over 20 % of subprime mortgages are already in default , and thousands more are lining up to join the foreclosure parade .
How about all the mortgages which are 90 - days late ?
Hmm , no mention of them , or of all the mortgages which are in default but which lenders are hiding to keep their insolvency less visible .
How about all the millions of households which are " underwater , " i.e. they owe more than their dwelling is worth ?
That did n't rate a mention , either .
Mr. Easterbrook displays less skepticism than any high - school journalist in the country , and for this remarkable ability to wear three pair of rose - colored glasses at once ( apparently no light seeps through at all ) , his insensibly , incomprehensibly selective cheerleading is elevated to the august pages of the Wall Street Journal .
Household wealth is just dandy - - unless you looks at statistics .
Courtesy of astute reader J.B. , here is a chart of household real estate and financial assets :
Chart courtesy of BNP Paribas Economic Research What planet Mr. Easterbrook inhabits is indeed a mystery .
Here on Planet Earth , a moribund , easily manipulated Mainstream Media is waking up to trends which have been in place for years : to wit , Peak Oil , the Housing Bubble Bust , fraud , insane risk and mismanagement in investment banking and lending , the risks of derivatives , the commercial real estate market 's demise , local governments heading for bankruptcy , the collapse of the dollar and the resulting rise in inflation and the cost of imports -- I could go on , but you already know all the profoundly important factors Easterbrook ignored / chose to gloss over .
Did Mr. Easterbrook ever pause his sweatily exuberant cheerleading to ponder what the consequences will be of government agencies ' healthcare costs rising 7 - fold ?
Apparently Mr. Easterbrook 's Ivory Tower is somewhere safely off - planet or blissfully isolated from the reality the rest of us have to deal with : AC Transit to get an earful on fare hike ideas :
The ( regional bus service ) deficit comes mainly from a sevenfold increase in employee health care costs this decade and diesel prices that have gone from 92 cents per gallon in 2001 to $ 3.62 today , even with the agency 's bulk discount .
According to Mr. Easterbrook , factories come and go , so what , piffle , my dear .
Nice , but something tells me Mr. Easterbrook is not a resident of the upper Mid-West .
Three or four millions jobs lost , and well , ten or so million folks negatively affected / driven into destitution as a result , but Mr. Easterbrook is blissfully confident another factory will open soon , somewhere - - somewhere like Hanoi .
And how about that spiffy clean environment , eh ?
Well , shipping $ 1 trillion in manufacturing to China from the U.S. probably had something to do with that amazing reduction in pollution .
After decades of supposedly professional journalism , Mr. Easterbrook is mystified and rather saddened , it seems , that people are so downcast about the nation 's future even as they delight in their personal lives .
He would prefer consistency , people , so good golly , start reporting how miserable you are with your own life , family , job , etc .
Even more astonishing , he seeks the villain behind this astoundingly unjustified negativity , and finds it in the mirror - - it 's us , the mainstream media !
It 's all our fault that Americans are n't dancing in the streets and smelling the wildflowers and bursting spontaneously into song -- we've reported too many horrribly misguided bits of negative news .
" If it bleeds , it leads " -- really , we all need to shape up and start reporting the good things , the nice things , the positive things .
Then our naturally positive attitude will painlessly be restored .
For instance -- when the recession really deepens , 80 % of the little people will still have some sort of job -- wo n't that be newsworthy ?
And a third of U.S. homes will still be owned free - and - clear .
See ?
It 's all in what you choose to emphasize .
And some are more equal than others - - oops , scratch that -- it 's negative .
I do n't know what 's more disheartening : that Mr. Easterbrook is so bafflingly moronic , or that the Wall Street Journal saw fit to print this utter claptrap .
Unfortunately , Easterbrook is not alone .
I was watching Washington Week in Review on PBS last Friday evening .
In response to a question from the moderator Ms. Ifill , a journalist from the WSJ replied that the economy " might be in for a few rough months . "
Rough months ?
How about rough years , or even rough decades ?
If this is what passes for responsible journalism , then we are truly in murky waters .
If any glimmer of the darker realities actually experienced by real live Americans gets in the MSM , then cheerleaders like Mr. Easterbrook are ready to denounce it all as " negative . "
It is a supreme irony , is n't it ?
The cheerleading MSM is denounced as negative , and blamed for the sour mood of the nation 's citizenry .
In typical MSM fashion , Mr. Easterbrook over - estimates his own importance amd that of the MSM .
Even with the propaganda machine running 24/7 , the citizen 's actual experience cannot be papered over or subsumed by lies -- or even by the unwitting irony of a cheerleader blaming his own kind for the gloom .
Regular people know things are deeply amiss .
And they 're right .
Of the dozens of items which recently crossed the transom here at OTM ( no donations , boo - hoo , it must be my negativity ) , consider just these few reports from reality : Frequent contributor U. Doran sent in this story : House Prices , the Wealth Effect and the Cash - in - Hand Effect .
Knowledgeable correspondent Jim S. sent in this link : Real Estate and Housing Outlook .
Longtime correspondent Jed H. submitted this story : ' Scab ' driver burned in his lorry as European protests against high fuel prices turn violent .
But the real news is Ms. Magillacuddy 's garden is doing just fine , and all those stories about the corn crop being ruined by rain and flooding are just hand - wringing negativity .
So get with it , people , and grab your pom-poms , and let 's all shout in unison :
Whip inflation now !
Whip inflation now !
Yea , home team !
There .
Everything 's fine now .

ABC news has a story about super - rich American tax cheats who got caught avoiding taxes by setting up bogus shell companies in Liechtenstein .
What ’s interesting to me is that the the accounts were set up for the Americans by none other than the giant Swiss bank UBS .
Hmmm .
UBS , where have I heard that name before ?
Maybe it was Phil Gramm , who before joining the McCain campaign as its “ financial guru ” was a lobbyist for UBS .
You know , the same Phil Gramm who called America a “ nation of whiners ” .
Not to mention that when he was a Senator he was responsible for the law that led to the Bear Stearns bailout and the current epidemic of mortgage foreclosures .
So , McCain ’s main financial advisor is a lobbyist , who works for a foreign corporation , which helps greedy rich Americans break the law , while ruining the economy .
Is this the kind of person you want in charge ?
Should n’t the media be asking Gramm “ Why do you hate America ? ”

The Moon Is Rusting , and Researchers Want to Know Why
While our Moon is airless , research indicates the presence of hematite , a form of rust that normally requires oxygen and water .
That has scientists puzzled .
So what next ?
None of the logical options look good .
The suit was approved by FINA and Speedo knows the rules too well to have broken one .
If officials arbitrarily ban this suit , questions will be raised about where the line should be drawn .
Letting each swimmer wear Speedo's model would require an implied concession from other manufacturers that its suits are inferior .

Houston researchers : Baby 's smile gives mom ' natural high '
For mothers , baby 's smile brings ' natural high '
Brain research key to understanding bond — and figuring out why it breaks
Everyone knows nothing melts a mother 's heart like a baby 's smile .
But Houston researchers have found that it also activates a region of the brain known as the reward center , a middle area associated with feelings of euphoria .
Previous research has shown the reward center also flips on when addicts take drugs .
" This could be described as a natural high , " said Dr. Lane Strathearn , a pediatrics professor at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children 's Hospital and the research 's lead investigator .
" Mothers just had to look at their baby 's smiling face , and blood flow in the region picked up . "
Strathearn said the research is part of an effort to use new brain - imaging technology to better understand the mother - infant bond , a key to healthy child development .
When something goes wrong with that bond and the relationship does n't develop normally , he said , it typically leads to abuse or neglect , which are devastating to a child 's development .
Currently , little is known about what exactly occurs when the bond goes wrong , or even when it 's right .
The finding , reported in today 's edition of the journal Pediatrics , one day could lead to the development of a drug treatment for mothers emotionally detached from their children , Strathearn said .
Right now , he said , researchers are just trying to understand the process in the brain .
In conducting the study , Strathearn 's team captured still images of each child smiling , crying and displaying neutral expressions .
They then showed 28 mothers the photos of their own babies and infants they had never seen before while the women were in a functional imaging scanner , a machine that measures blood flow in the brain .
Though blood flow picked up when the mothers were shown the photos of other women 's infants , the greatest activity occurred when each mother looked at her own baby 's pictures , researchers found .
The reaction was strongest when the baby was smiling .
The activity occurred in reward center pathways associated with dopamine , a pleasure - related chemical that ferries signals between brain cells .
Unexpectedly , the researchers found little difference in blood flow when mothers were shown photos of their own crying babies compared with pictures of the other children .
The finding about the " natural high " caused by a smiling baby contributes to a growing body of research about what triggers the brain 's reward center .
Besides cocaine and other drugs , some triggers include humor , favorite foods , photographs of attractive faces , praise , sex , gambling and even charitable giving , according to recent studies .
The study was conducted at Baylor 's Human Neuroimaging Laboratory .

The Chinese government accused US politicians of displaying " evil motives " and trying to " sabotage the Olympics " today after the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning Beijing 's record on human rights .
A foreign ministry spokesman also condemned George Bush for meeting five prominent Chinese political activists just days before he attends the opening ceremony .
The host nation faces a growing storm of overseas criticism that it has failed to live up to its Olympic promise to improve human rights and allow complete reporting freedom for visiting journalists .
The Chinese government rejects such accusations , saying it has eased controls on the media and religion , as well as reducing the number of death sentences handed down by courts .
But the House of Representatives resolution , which passed yesterday by 419 votes to 1 , called for immediate action to stop the arrests of civil activists and Tibetans and to put pressure on China to stop supporting Burma and Sudan .
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said the US government should curtail " the disgusting actions of this small group of anti-Chinese lawmakers " .
The bill , he said , " fully exposed their evil motives to politicize the Olympics and interrupt and sabotage the Beijing Olympics " .
The White House entered the fray on Tuesday , when Bush met privately with five prominent exiles , including Wei Jingsheng , a democracy activist who spent nearly 20 years in prison before seeking exile in the US , and Uighur rights campaigner Rebiya Kadeer .
The White House said Bush had expressed " concerns " to the group about the human rights situation in China .
The president also told the Chinese foreign minister that the Olympics were an " opportunity to demonstrate compassion on human rights and freedom " .
Beijing expressed strong discontent .
" By arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on China 's human rights and religious situation , the US side has rudely interfered in China 's internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti-China hostile forces , " Liu was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency .
He said the five people that Bush met had harmed China 's national security by engaging in " anti-China splittism activities and hostile sabotage activities under the banner of so - called ' human rights and religion ' " .
Although Bush has insisted he will attend the Olympics to watch the sport rather than lecture on politics , the furore over human rights shows no sign of dying down .
This week , the US - based group Human Rights in China reported that a school employee in Sichuan province was sentenced to a " re-education through labour " camp for a year because he took and posted online photographs of schools that collapsed during the earthquake .
This is a sensitive subject for the authorities , which have restricted access to many quake - hit schools and warned angry parents not to speak to the media .
China 's censorship of the internet was also been thrown into the spotlight earlier this week , when the International Olympic Committee was forced to backtrack on promises that journalists visiting for the Games will have unfettered access to the web .
Amnesty , Human Rights Watch and the BBC's Mandarin service are as restricted in the Olympic media centres as outside .
For the eighth time , the Senate failed to pass legislation that would extend the Investment Tax Credits beyond their end of year expiration dates .
The ITCs are vital to the solar energy industry in the United States .
Many solar projects across the country are on hold until this leglislation is sorted out .
Large scale solar power projects could be nearly non-existent in the short - term in the US without the 30 % tax credit .
First Solar ( FSLR ) , the solar power company best positioned to capitalize on the US utility market even without the ITCs , said in their earnings call yesterday that they have to continue to focus on Europe if the legislation is not passed .
The failure of this bill to pass would be a significant negative for SunPower ( SPWR ) as well .
Who supports the ITCs ?
all the state governors ( except Georgia )
a coalition of Fortune 500 companies
Wall Street banks
renewable energy startups
tech giants like Google ( GOOG ) , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ ) and Applied Materials ( AMAT )
utilities like PG&E ( PCG ) and Edison International ( EIX )
financiers such as GE Energy Financial Services
An eight - year extension is being pushed for , but it is possible a one - year extension may be pushed through as a compromise .
The Republicans are blocking the legislation because they claim it raises taxes .
Neither Barack Obama or John McCain were at the vote .

Sell Your House , Downsize and Give The Proceeds To Charity ?
The real estate market has n’t been kind to expensive homes for sale but there ’s one mansion that deserves a second look .
It ’s not just any ordinary 6,500 square foot mansion with 5 bedrooms , 8 fireplaces and an elevator .
It ’s a family ’s dream home that they ’re turning into dreams come true for others in a different part of the world .
Ghana , to be exact .
The family who owns a historic 1912 house is from Atlanta , Georgia , and they ’re doing a noble and truly novel act .
Their house is listed for sale for almost $ 1.8 million and the owners ( the Salwens include two kids and their parents ) have pledged half the proceeds to an international cause for the opportunity to make a difference .
It all started with a seed of thought that turned into a full - fledged family project after much discussion among the Salwens .
Like many others who dwell on the issue of “ need ” vs “ want ” , this family decided that a lot of what they had and owned would be better channeled towards helping others .
Once their home sells , half of their profit — $ 800,000 will be used to assist 30 villages and impact the lives of approximately 20,000 people in Ghana .
Downsizing The American Dream For Charity
Here ’s a look at the Salwens ’ mansion :
The Salwens now live in a much more modest home ( it ’s less than half their original house ) and are planning a trip to visit the places where their funds will be put to use .
Here ’s what their new house now looks like :
We as Americans have so much .
We love the concept of half .
We are going from a house that ’s 6,000 square feet to a house that ’s half the size , and we ’re giving away half the money .
~ Kevin Salwen
Read more about this awesome tale on CNN .
People never cease to amaze me with their generosity .
It ’s quite cliche , but stories like this do stoke my faith in humanity .
Even though it was Joan Salwen ’s idea to sell the house , it has been tough for her to give it up .
“ I have to admit , ” she said , “ I loved living in this house .
Does that make me an evil person ?
I hope not because it ’s a beautiful place . ”
This story is also quite unusual as this type of act requires a significant amount of thought and emotional adjustment that impacts not just one person but several in a family unit .
In this case , family values has made a strong statement .
We ’re all programmed to think “ more ” and “ bigger ” are better , but this example shows that there are those who ’ve traded this way of life for the simpler , scaled - down stuff .
And no , we ’re not evil people because we love the big stuff — it ’s human nature .
The concept of downsizing may seem challenging for some of us , as it is for me .
But I ’ve tried to do small changes here and there to make my life simpler and to be able to find ways to free up time to give more of myself .
Baby steps I guess , especially when you think that “ charity begins at home ” .
Sometimes it may be a worthwhile exercise to reflect on what good “ less ” would bring to our lives :
Why Downsize ?
Why Simplify ?
1 . It is freeing .
When you ’re no longer married to stuff , you achieve a form of freedom .
2 . You ’ll have less stress .
Theoretically , you ’ll feel less pressured and dial down your stress .
But that ’s in theory .
Any form of change , even the kind that is brought about through simplification , can cause stress , at least over the short term .
3 . It is less hassle .
Stuff breaks down and a life revolving around lots of things has a tendency to break down more often as well .
Less stuff equals less worries and maintenance .
4 . It is less expensive .
See number 3 . 🙂
5 . It can allow you to make a difference .
Your “ less ” may become someone else ’s “ more ” , just like what the Salwens have done .
6 . Do we need everything super - sized ?
Many of us have been bitten by the “ Keeping up with the Jones ' ” bug .
So when everyone around us has super - sized , we ca n’t help but feel like joining the party as well .
But all this comes with a price : more money , more work , more stress .
Is it worth it ?
So I ’ve come to ask : how much of our dreams are for things we simply want vs what we need ?
Which of your grand ideals do you think you can let go ?
What are our ambitions for ?
It ’s human nature to want to have it all , but the story of a family who ’s given up half their home to those in need reminds us that there are other ways to live .

For many , the only exposure to Ancient Rome comes from what they have seen in the movies or on television .
Unfortunately , films like Gladiator , Spartacus , Barabbas , and Demetrius and the Gladiators do n’t present a very accurate depiction of life in Rome and the arena .
Considering the fact that the Roman Empire existed for so long , and so much of our own Western society has derived from it , it is no surprise that we all have at least one or two misconceptions about the Empire and its people .
For this reason , we have put together a list of the most misconceptions people hold about the Ancient Roman society and customs .
Fortunately most are easily proven wrong as you will see when you read on :
10 Thumbs Up
Contrary to popular belief , the emperor did not give a thumbs up or down for a gladiator as a signal to kill his enemy .
The emperor ( and only the emperor ) would give an open or closed hand – if his palm was flat , it meant “ spare his life ” , if it was closed , it meant “ kill him ” .
If a gladiator killed his opponent before the emperor gave his permission , the gladiator would be put on trial for murder , as only the emperor had the right to condemn a man to death .
In the image above we see this myth in action .
9 Atia
HBO / BBC created an excellent series called “ Rome ” which covers a number of years of the Roman Empire .
In the series they have , unfortunately , slandered the good name of one of the main Characters , Atia ( Mother of Octavian – Augustus – and niece of Julius Caesar ) .
In the show she is seen as a licentious , self - absorbed and manipulative schemer who is Mark Antony ’s lover .
In reality , Atia was a highly moral woman , well regarded by Roman Society at the time .
Tacitus had this to say of her :
In her presence no base word could be uttered without grave offence , and no wrong deed done .
Religiously and with the utmost delicacy she regulated not only the serious tasks of her youthful charges , but also their recreations and their games .
8 Vomitoria
A very persistent myth about the Romans is that they would feast until they were full , then visit a room called a vomitorium to “ vomit ” the food out so they could start over again .
This is a myth – the vomitoria were actually passages that enabled people to move quickly to and from their seats in an amphitheater .
These vomitoria made it possible for thousands of Roman citizens to be seated within minutes .
In the photograph above [ source ] we see a real vomitorium .
7 Romans Spoke Latin
While it is true that the Romans did speak a form of Latin known as vulgar Latin , it was quite different from the Classical Latin that we generally think of them speaking ( Classical Latin is what we usually learn at University ) .
Vulgar Latin is the language that the Romance languages ( Italian , French , etc. ) developed from .
Classical Latin was used as an official language only .
In addition , members of the Eastern Roman Empire were speaking Greek exclusively by the 4th century , and Greek had replaced Latin as the official language .
6 Poor Plebeians
In modern days we tend to use the term plebeian to refer to the common or poor classes , but in Rome , a plebeian was just a member of the general populace of Rome ( as opposed to the Patricians who were the privileged classes ) .
Plebeians could , and very often did , become very wealthy people – but wealth did not change their class .
Wikipedia has an excellent article on this which you can read here .
5 Romans Wore Togas
When we think of Romans , we almost always imagine men in togas .
But in fact , the toga was a very formal piece of clothing – to say that the Romans always wore togas would be the same as saying that the English always wear top - hats and tails .
Juvenal says this : “ There are many parts of Italy , to tell the truth , in which no man puts on a toga until he is dead ” .
The average roman would have worn tunics .
4 The Salting of Carthage
There is a popular misconception that when Rome conquered Carthage , they salted the farmlands to prevent anything from growing .
In fact , this is a 20th century myth which has no bearing in reality .
When the Romans conquered Carthage , they went from house to house capturing slaves and slaughtering the rest .
They burnt the city to the ground and left it as a pile of ruins .
This resulted in the loss of a great deal of historical information on Carthage , which makes the study of it difficult in modern times .
3 Et tu , Brute
Caesar ’s last words were actually “ And you also ” as recorded ( in Greek ) by Suetonius : ??? ?? ?????? ( kai su teknon ) .
These words were spoken to Brutus , which is undoubtedly the reason that Shakespeare coined the phrase : “ And you , Brutus ” .
The meaning of his last words is unknown – but it would seem fair to think that he was telling his murderer : “ you will be next ” .
Caesar was bi-lingual ( Greek and Latin ) and Greek was the dominant language in Rome at the time , so it is not unreasonable that his last words would have been uttered in that language .
2 Gladiators Were All Men
In fact , women were gladiators too ( though they were called gladiatrices – or gladiatrix for singular ) .
While the first documented appearance of gladiatrices appears under the reign of Nero ( 37 – 68 AD ) , there are implications in earlier documents that strongly suggest they existed before .
A strong condemnation against female gladiators of the Flavian and Trajanic eras can be found in the Satire VI of Juvenal , decrying the fact female gladiators were typically from upper - class families and seeking thrill and attention .
Emperor Severus banned female gladiators around AD 200 but records show that this ban was largely ignored .
1 Nero Fiddled While Rome Burned
In fact , most modern historians believe that Nero was not even in Rome when the fire started .
The fire started in shops selling flammable goods , though it was later blamed on the Christians ( which brought on a new onslaught of persecutions ) .
Nero was actually in Antium when the fire started , and when he heard about it he rushed back to Rome to organize relief efforts .
According to Tacitus : “ the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held Nero responsible .
To diffuse blame , Nero targeted a sect called the Christians .
He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others were crucified and burned . ”

If a vast number of voters dislike the candidates ( and the eventual victor ) so much as to write in a cartoon character , the new President will have little or no political capital .
He ( or she ) will not be able to
Polls show record numbers of Republican voters who are dissatisfied with Sen. John McCain as the GOP 's nominee for President .
A new online campaign , backed by conservatives , offers a way for them to vent their anger : write in " Mickey Mouse " for president .
Mickey has often been used as a protest vote .
With the number of angry voters larger than ever before , MickeyForPresident.com says ,
" If a vast number of voters dislike the candidates ( and the eventual victor ) so much as to write in a cartoon character , the new President will have little or no political capital .
He ( or she ) will not be able to " ramrod through " whatever he wants , and he will not have the political clout to force Congress to go along .
Instead , each Congressman will have to listen to his constituents and make his own decision on what to support or oppose . "
In most states , write - in candidates that reach a certain threshold are reported as percentages just like the normal candidates are .
The group 's plan is for Mickey Mouse to reach that point , as a way for voters to visibly and effectively demonstrate their disgust .
MickeyForPresident.com targets conservatives in particular , since as right - wing opinion makers like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity have pointed out , there is no true conservative in the race .
John McCain shares similar views with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on immigration , global warming , and campaign finance reform , hot - button issues for many core Republican voters .
The group 's website currently allows visitors to " sign up " by pledging their support and joining a list that is displayed on the home page .

BAGHDAD ( AP ) – The U.S. military released Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein on Wednesday after holding him for more than two years without filing formal charges .
Hussein , 36 , was handed over to AP colleagues at a checkpoint in Baghdad .
He was taken to the site aboard a prisoner bus and left U.S. custody wearing a traditional Iraqi robe .
He was smiling and appeared in good health .
“ I want to thank all the people working in AP … I have spent two years in prison even though I was innocent .
I thank everybody , ” Hussein said after being freed .
AP President Tom Curley said Hussein “ is safely back with AP and his family , and it is a great relief to us . ”

“ Our heartfelt thanks to all of you who supported us during this difficult and challenging period , ” Curley said .
“ Bilal will now be spending some quiet time with his family and resting up . ”
The U.S. military had accused Hussein of links to insurgents , but did not file specific charges .
In December , military authorities brought Hussein ’s case into the Iraqi court system for possible trial .
But an Iraqi judicial panel this month dismissed all proceedings against Hussein and ordered his release .
A U.S. military statement on Monday said Hussein is no longer considered a threat .
Hussein and the AP denied any improper contacts , saying Hussein was doing the normal work of a photographer in a war zone .
He was detained by U.S. Marines on April 12 , 2006 in Ramadi , about 70 miles west of Baghdad .
Hussein was a member of the AP team that won a Pulitzer Prize for photography in 2005 , and his detention drew protests from rights groups and press freedom advocates .

The photographer was embraced by sobbing family members , including his brother and mother , and spoke to other well - wishers on a mobile phone as he was showered with flowers and sweets .
Two sheep were slaughtered in his honor for a traditional feast .
“ I cannot describe my happiness at seeing him again , ” said his brother , Yassir Hussein , a 35 - year - old university professor in Baghdad .
“ The family has been going through a hard time over the past two years , but now we thank God that we will have some rest . ”
In New York , the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists , Joel Simon , said the group was “ thrilled ” by Hussein ’s release .
“ He now joins a growing list of journalists detained in conflict zones by the U.S. military for prolonged periods and eventually released without any charges or crimes ever substantiated against them , ” said Simon .
“ This deplorable practice should be of concern to all journalists .
It basically allows the U.S. military to remove journalists from the field , lock them up and never be compelled to say why . ”

Obama 's Berlin Speech People of the World , Look at Me
The people of Berlin experienced the full range of Barack Obama 's charisma on Thursday evening .
At times he was reserved , at others engaging .
Sometimes combative , and also demanding .
Ultimately , though , the message he delivered at the Siegessäule was meant for audiences back home .
Newsweek has an item in its current issue about John McCain ’s search for a running mate , and how the Republican senator will likely put personal interaction at the top of his list of priorities .
Washington lobbyist Ken Duberstein told Newsweek , “ He is not going to pick a clone or a crazy . ”
It depends , I suppose , on the meaning of the word “ crazy . ”
It ’s hardly a secret that Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) , at the ripe young age of 36 , is drawing serious interest for the GOP ticket .
McCain had Jindal over to one of his houses for a barbecue recently , and prominent conservative voices have been talking up a McCain - Jindal ticket for quite a while now .
There are plenty of drawbacks surrounding Jindal .
He ’s barely constitutionally eligible ( Jindal is literally half McCain ’s age ) ; he ’s ridiculously conservative ; and he ’s held statewide office for a grand total of six months .
And then , of course , there ’s the exorcism thing , which Eric Kleefeld and Kate Klonick reported on yesterday , noting that it ’s part of Jindal ’s background that “ has n’t gotten much attention . ”
We ’ve discovered that in an essay Jindal wrote in 1994 for the New Oxford Review , a serious right - wing Catholic journal , Jindal narrated a bizarre story of a personal encounter with a demon , in which he participated in an exorcism with a group of college friends .
And not only did they cast out the supernatural spirit that had possessed his friend , Jindal wrote that he believes that their ritual may well have cured her cancer .
Reading the article leaves no doubt that Jindal — who graduated from Brown University in 1991 , was a Rhodes Scholar , and had been accepted at Yale Law School and Harvard Medical School when he wrote the essay — was completely serious about the encounter .
He even said the experience “ reaffirmed ” his faith .
It occurs to me that this might seem like satire .
An Oxford - trained governor and VP possibility really wrote about participating in an exorcism ?
Yes , he really did .
The whole report from TPM is worth reading , but Jindal — who was a high - priced corporate consultant when he wrote the piece — explained that he had a classmate , “ Susan , ” who was acting strangely and was surrounded by “ sulfuric ” smells .
After she reportedly suffered a seizure , Jindal and some friends began an exorcism , which he claimed lasted hours , and during which “ Susan ” tried to leave , causing the exorcism team to hold her down .
From Jindal ’s essay :
It appeared as if we were observing a tremendous battle between the Susan we knew and loved and some strange evil force .
But the momentum had shifted and we now sensed that victory was at hand .
While Alice and Louise held Susan , her sister continued holding the Bible to her face .
Almost taunting the evil spirit that had almost beaten us minutes before , the students dared Susan to read biblical passages .
She choked on certain passages and could not finish the sentence “ Jesus is Lord . ”
Over and over , she repeated “ Jesus is L..L..LL , ” often ending in profanities .
In between her futile attempts , Susan pleaded with us to continue trying and often smiled between the grimaces that accompanied her readings of Scripture .
Just as suddenly as she went into the trance , Susan suddenly reappeared and claimed “ Jesus is Lord . ”
With an almost comical smile , Susan then looked up as if awakening from a deep sleep and asked , “ Has something happened ? ”
She did not remember any of the past few hours and was startled to find her friends breaking out in cheers and laughter , overwhelmed by sudden joy and relief .
Best of all , according to Jindal , after ridding “ Susan ” of her demon , her skin cancer disappeared .
Now , I have no idea how the typical American voter would perceive all of this .
I find it odd , but who knows , maybe mainstream voters think candidates for national office who ’ve experimented with exorcisms are n’t especially controversial .
Either way , if Jindal is chosen for the ticket , expect to hear a few questions about this in the fall .

Bush Proposal to Change Abortion Definition Democrats argue Bush administration changes would limit access to contraception .
July 17 , 2008  -- Congressional Democrats are criticizing the Bush administration for a draft proposal they say would change the definition of abortion and limit women 's access to contraception .
The draft proposal from the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , which began circulating around Capitol Hill earlier this week , would withhold government funds from health - care providers and organizations that do n't hire people who refuse to perform abortions or provide certain types of birth control .
It immediately incited an uproar from leading Democratic lawmakers , including Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y .
Sens. Clinton and Patty Murray , D - Wash . , warned in a letter to HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt that the proposal has the " potential to affect millions of women 's reproductive health . "
" One of the most troubling aspects of the proposed rules is the overly - broad definition of ' abortion , ' " write Clinton and Murray .
" This definition would allow health - care corporations or individuals to classify many common forms of contraception — including the birth control pill , emergency contraception and IUDs — ' abortions ' and therefore to refuse to provide contraception to women who need it .
" As a consequence , these draft regulations could disrupt state laws securing women 's access to birth control .
They could jeopardize federal programs like Medicaid and Title X that provide family - planning services to millions of women .
They could even undermine state laws that ensure survivors of sexual assault and rape receive emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms , " they write .
Current federal law prohibits health - care providers and organizations from discriminating against people who wo n't provide abortions or birth control .
The Bush administration 's new draft proposal would require these agencies to certify in writing their compliance with the law before getting funding from HHS .
Critics say the proposal would limit women 's access to birth control , arguing that it includes " an overly - broad definition of abortion " and that in order to receive government funding agencies might have to hire employees who wo n't perform every - day job responsibilities due to their personal religious beliefs .
Prominent Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have already expressed their opposition to the controversial potential proposal .
" If the administration goes through with this draft proposal , it will launch a dangerous assault on women 's health , " said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , calling on President Bush to " reject this policy . "
" The majority of Americans oppose this out - of - touch position that redefines contraception as abortion and represents a sustained pattern of the Bush administration to reject medical and sound science in favor of a misguided ideology that has no place in our government . "
The Health department released a brief statement arguing that it 's looking into various options in an effort to enforce anti-discrimination laws .
" Over the past three decades , Congress has passed several anti-discrimination laws to protect institutional and individual health care providers participating in federal programs .
HHS has an obligation to enforce these laws , and is exploring a number of options , " the statement reads .
The White House declined to comment .
" We do n't talk about possible proposed rules , " White House deputy spokesperson Tony Fratto said Thursday .
A spokesperson for Murray said that the two senators have not yet received a response from the Health and Human Services Secretary .

It is because mercury and lead attach themselves at highly vulnerable junctures of proteins that they find their great capacity to provoke morphological changes in the body .
Changes in pancreatic function are among the pathogenetic mechanisms observable during lead intoxication .
The following is an excerpt from the Book " Survival Medicine for the 21st Century " by Dr. Mark Sircus .
"
The development of insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus is thought to be dependent on the interaction of environmental agents with the pancreatic beta cells . "
- University of CalgaryLead exposure has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension , and is a well - established risk factor for kidney disease .
Whether lead affects blood pressure indirectly through alterations in kidney function or via more direct effects on the vasculature or neurologic blood pressure control is unknown though .
Researchers at Harvard Medical School state , " Our findings support the hypothesis that long - term low - level lead accumulation ( estimated by tibia bone lead ) is associated with an increased risk of declining renal function particularly among diabetics or hypertensives , populations already at risk for impaired renal function .
" Cadmium is a widespread environmental pollutant that accumulates in the pancreas and exerts diabetogenic effects in animals .
In a large cross-sectional study , urinary cadmium levels are significantly and dose - dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes Transsulfuration pathways in the body are fundamental for life .
When mercury blocks thiol groups cellular proteins lose their reactive properties , lose their ability to carry out their routine function .
Insulin has three sulfur - containing cross-linkages and the insulin receptor has a tyrosine kinase - containing sulfur bond , which are the preferred targets for binding by both mercury and lead .
Should mercury attach to one of these three sulfur bonds it will interfere with the normal biological function of the insulin molecule .
Mercury , many times more toxic than lead , is so dangerous exactly because it is collapsing / damaging critical sulfur - containing cross-linkages which change the geometry of both insulin receptor sites and insulin itself .
" Commercials tell children that junk food is good food -- the latest message from an industry that spends $ 10 billion a year marketing to children . "
- New York TimesFood is not considered junk just because of high fat or sugar content , there is a long list of poisonous chemicals used by the food industry that are striking people down .
And there are many serious nutritional deficiencies in today 's food that diminish the body 's capacity to deal safely with these chemicals and heavy metals -- with magnesium and selenium deficiencies at the top of the list .
For instance , according to Dr. Ellen Silbergeld , a researcher from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , the poultry industry 's practice of using arsenic compounds in its feed is something that has not been studied : " It 's an issue everybody is trying to pretend does n't exist . "
Arsenic exposure is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus .
Inorganic arsenic is considered one of the prominent environmental causes of cancer mortality in the world .
Chicken consumption may contribute significant amounts of arsenic to total arsenic exposure of the U.S. population according to the Journal " Arsenic acts as a growth stimulant in chickens -- develops the meat faster -- and since then , the poultry industry has gone wild using this ingredient , " says Donald Herman , a Mississippi agricultural consultant and former Environmental Protection Agency researcher who has studied this use of arsenic for a decade .
At mean levels of chicken consumption ( 60 g/ person / day ) , people may ingest 1.38 - 5.24 micrograms / day of inorganic arsenic from chicken alone .
At the 99th percentile of chicken consumption ( 350 g chicken / day ) , people may ingest 21.13-30.59 micrograms inorganic arsenic / day and 32.50 - 47.07 micrograms total arsenic / day from chicken .
This can lead to prostate cancers .
It can also cause neurological , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , and immune system abnormalities .
The feeding of arsenic to chickens in the United States releases hundreds of tons of arsenic into the environment every year in the form of poultry manure , which is spread on fields as fertilizer .
Researchers from the Department of Internal Medicine , National Taiwan University Hospital found , " The association between arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus is a relatively new finding .
Up to now , there are six epidemiologic reports linking diabetes mellitus with arsenic exposure from environmental and occupational sources .
Two reports in Taiwan carried out in the blackfoot disease -- hyperendemic villages , one cross-sectional and one prospective follow - up of the same cohort -- indicate that arsenic exposure from drinking artesian well water is associated with prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus in a dose - responsive pattern .
The observation of the relation between arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus is further supported by studies carried out in Sweden and Bangladesh .
In Sweden , case - control analyses of death records of copper smelters and glass workers revealed a trend of increasing diabetes mellitus with increasing arsenic exposure from inhalation .
In Bangladesh , prevalence of diabetes mellitus among arsenic - exposed subjects with keratosis was about five times higher than unexposed subjects .
" Another example is Alloxan .
Studies show that Alloxan , the chemical that makes white flour look " clean and beautiful " destroys the beta cells of the pancreas .
Scientists have known of the alloxan - diabetes connection for years yet there seems to be a conspiracy that defends the integrity of the FDA , which allows dangerous chemicals that can cause diabetes to be used in drugs and food .
" A growing body of research shows that pesticides and other contaminants are more prevalent in the foods we eat , in our bodies , and in the environment than we thought , " all confirming the chemical nightmare in progress .
According to research conducted by Dr. H.J. Roberts , a diabetes specialist , a member of the ADA , and an authority on artificial sweeteners , aspartame : 1 ) Leads to the precipitation of clinical diabetes .
2 ) Causes poorer diabetic control in diabetics on insulin or oral drugs .3 ) Leads to the aggravation of diabetic complications such as retinopathy , cataracts , neuropathy and gastroparesis .
4 )
Causes convulsions .
Dr. Roberts said , " The loss of diabetic control , the intensification of hypoglycemia , the occurrence of presumed ' insulin reactions ' ( including convulsions ) that proved to be aspartame reactions , and the precipitation , aggravation or simulation of diabetic complications ( especially impaired vision and neuropathy ) while using these products . "
The FDA 's own toxicologist , Dr. Adrian Gross told Congress that without a shadow of a doubt , aspartame can cause brain tumors and brain cancer and violated the Delaney Amendment which forbids putting anything in food that is known to cause Cancer .
It is a monstrous crime to poison the food and water supplies yet this is exactly what the FDA has been approving and undoubtedly they are , in large part , responsible for flaming the diabetic winds .
As the use of MSG and aspartame grows , the incidence of obesity appears to be growing .
MSG causes a very large insulin response after it is ingested since there are glutamate receptors in the pancreas .
MSG opens calcium channels , thus constricting blood vessels - this may put diabetics with high blood pressure at risk by negating calcium channel blocker medication .
In 1968 , John W. Olney , M.D. , a respected researcher at Washington University Medical School , St. Louis , Missouri , and member of the National Academy of Science , found that mice in his laboratory that were being used to replicate a 1957 study by Lucas and Newhouse , in which the administration of MSG had resulted in retinal damage , had become grotesquely obese .
Since 1969 , many scientists have confirmed Dr. Olney 's findings of damage to the hypothalamus from MSG with resulting obesity .
Even the rats used in obesity , diabetes and exercise studies are made obese by injecting MSG .
MSG may cause food addiction and though efforts have been made to reduce its use in processed and restaurant foods , it remains hidden by semantics , now called such things as " hydrolyzed protein " .
Scientists in Spain have recently concluded that MSG when given to mice increases appetite by as much as 40 % .
There is abundant literature demonstrating that MSG and aspartic acid cause hypothalamic lesions which , in turn , can cause gross obesity .
Although there are a number of causes for obesity , there is no question that one of the main causes for the obesity epidemic is the ever increasing use of MSG and aspartame .
We know that the hypothalamus is very immature at birth .
The damage to this structure of the brain by MSG leads to severe endocrine problems later in life , among them decreased thyroid hormone , increased tendency toward diabetes , and higher cortisone levels than normal .
A child consuming a soup containing MSG plus a drink with NutraSweet will have a blood level of excitotoxins six times the blood level that destroys hypothalamus neurons in baby mice .
And we are just beginning to hear that a massive mistake has been made with genetically modified foods , which can only fan those diabetic winds .
Dr. Arpad Pusztai , for instance , has already shown that genetically - manipulated foods can , when fed to animals in reasonable amounts , cause very gradual organ and immune system damage .
Another study , carried out by Dr. Irina Ermakova at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology , at the Russian Academy of Sciences , found that more than half of the offspring of rats fed on modified soya died in the first three weeks of life , six times as many as those born to mothers with normal diets .
Dr. Manuela Malatesta and colleagues in the Universities of Pavia and Urbino in Italy , showed that mice fed on GM soya experienced a slowdown in cellular metabolism and modifications to the liver and pancreas .
Researchers are reviving fears that GM food damages human health and certainly would not be indicated for children or for people with diabetes .
Many bottled soft drinks and related beverages contain benzene , a well - known carcinogen .
The EPA defines a " safe " level of benzene as zero .
Yet the Environmental Working Group , a watchdog organization , found levels of benzene in soft drinks at levels between 5 and 138 parts per billion .
A fair amount of benzene is taken in by our bodies by air pollution and drinking water .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has known for almost 15 years that potassium benzoate and sodium benzoate react with ascorbic acid to form benzenes .
Potassium benzoate , sodium benzoate and ascorbic acids are all commonly used to preserve freshness in soft drinks .
The excess of diabetes reported for the Benzene Sub registry occurred in the group aged 10 to 17 years , suggesting it is likely that IDDM is the type of diabetes most prevalent .
It has been demonstrated that most IDDM patients have autoantibodies to the pancreas ( Lernmark et al. , 1981 ) , as well as to other organs Benzene has been shown to stimulate the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( HPA ) axis of mice ( Hsieh et al. , 1991 ) , accompanied by increased ACTH / corticosterone release into the blood .
Corticosteroids are associated with the development of diabetes by reducing insulin sensitivity , or possibly by impairing islet function frequently associated with the development of impaired glucose tolerance .
The secretion of anti-insulin hormones , such as growth hormones or adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) , are also believed to play an important role in IDDM development ( Rodriguez , 1986 ) .
Steroid hormones play an important role in determining the severity of beta cell damage in the infected mouse , with androgens and glucocorticoids being particularly critical ( Craighead , 1981 ) .
Ethanol can enhance the immunosuppressive effects of benzene .
In addition , it has been demonstrated that various benzene metabolites depress the production of interferon ( Cheung et al. , 1988 ; Popp et al. , 1992 ) .
IDDM is associated with a variety of hematologic changes ( such as anemia ) and malignancies ( such as lymphocytic leukemia , lymphoma , and multiple myeloma ) that might be directly related to or simply coincidental with the diabetes ( Bern , 1982 ) .
From the literature reported it can be seen that all of these conditions are also associated with exposure to benzene .
Anthropogenic emissions to the air are approximately 34,000 metric tons per year ( USEPA , 1989 ) , Absorption of benzene varies with route of exposure .
In humans , respiratory uptake has been determined to vary from approximately 47 % ( Nomiyama and Nomiyama , 1974 ) to 80 % ( Srbova et al. , 1950 ) , although dermal absorption can range from 0.05 % to 0.2 % ( Franz , 1984 ) .
Absorption data for oral exposure in humans is not available ; however , in animals , absorption rates following oral exposure to benzene were found to be from 90 % to almost 100 % ( Parke and Williams , Ingestion of contaminated food items has been suggested as a potentially important pathway of human exposure to benzene ( Hattemer - Frey et al. , 1990 and many foods contain high levels of benzene .
Benzene is ubiquitous in the environment , having been measured in air , water , and human biological samples .
The major environmental sources include automobile exhaust , automobile refueling , hazardous waste sites , underground storage tanks that leak , waste water from industries that use benzene , chemical spills , chemical manufacturing sites , and petrochemical and petroleum industries ( Fishbein , 1992 ; Edgerton and Shah , 1992 ) .
Recently drinking more than one soft drink daily -- whether it 's regular or diet -- may be associated with an increase in the risk factors for heart disease and diabetes , Framingham researchers reported in .
" In those who drink one or more soft drinks daily , there was an association of an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome . "
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors including excess waist circumference , high blood pressure , elevated triglycerides , low levels of high - density lipoprotein ( HDL " good " cholesterol ) and high fasting glucose levels .
Prior studies linked soft drink consumption to multiple risk factors for heart disease .
However , this study showed that the association not only included drinking regular calorie - laden soft drinks , but artificially sweetened diet sodas as well , researchers said .
" If you are drinking one or more soft drinks a day , you may be increasing your risk of developing metabolic risk factors for heart disease .
"
The researchers also observed that compared to participants who drank less than one soft drink daily , those who drank one or more soft drinks a day had a:* 31 percent greater risk of developing new - onset obesity ( defined as a body mass index [ BMI ] of 30 kilograms / meter2 or more ) ;* 30 percent increased risk of developing increased waist circumference ;* 25 percent increased risk of developing high blood triglycerides or high fasting blood glucose ; * 32 percent higher risk of having low HDL levels .
" It did n't matter whether it was a diet or regular soft drink " .
" Results also do n't appear to be driven by the dietary pattern of soft drink users , i.e , by other food items that are typically consumed along with soft drinks , " Vasan , the study author , said .
So perhaps what we have blamed for so long , the high fructose corn syrups , the empty calories , the aspartame in soft drinks , is not the only thing causing an increase in these diabetic risk factors .
In combination with benzenes , it is highly likely that we have found yet another toxic substance that adds to our inability to avoid diabetes .
" Diabetes may in fact be a major side effect of antibiotics and other common pharmaceuticals . "
- Dr. Lisa Landymore - Lim , Independent scientist for Atomic Health LimitedDoctors are on notice that many drugs have toxic effects that can participate in destroying insulin creation and cell receptivity to it .
In her 1994 book , Poisonous Prescriptions , Landymore - Lim says that diabetes may in fact be a major side effect of pharmaceutical drugs .
The book provides evidence from studies and hospital records .
Diabetes , usually thought to be largely a genetic disorder , may actually have increased so much in the last 50 years due in large part to the proliferation in the use , and over - use , of medicines .
In 2004 the American Diabetes Association , the American Psychiatric Association , the North American Association for the Study of Obesity , and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists made a similar announcement warning people to be careful to watch for signs they are developing diabetes , obesity or high cholesterol if they are taking Abilify , Clozaril , Geodon , Risperdal , Seroquel or Zyprexa .
What medicines , food and water have increasingly in common are the chemical poisons they contain .
Researchers at the University of Liverpool recently released their studies that examined the toxic effects on nerve cells in the laboratory of using a combination of four common food additives -- aspartame , monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) and the artificial colourings brilliant blue and quinoline yellow .
The findings of their two - year study were published at the end of 2005 in the journal .
The Liverpool team reported that when mouse nerve cells were exposed to MSG and brilliant blue or aspartame and quinoline yellow in laboratory conditions , combined in concentrations that theoretically reflect the compound that enters the bloodstream after a typical children 's snack and drink , the additives stopped the growing of nerve cells and interfered with proper signaling systems .
The mixtures of the additives had a much more potent effect on nerve cells than each additive on its own .
The study reported that the effect on cells could be up to four times greater when brilliant blue and MSG were combined and up to seven times greater when quinoline yellow and aspartame were combined , than when the additives were applied on their own .
What we can begin to conclude is that future research is going to show how all the toxic chemicals in the food , air , water and medicines we consume are combining to destroy our health .
Any one poison discussed here in sufficient quantity can destroy cell physiology , the pancreas beta cells , and diminish cell receptivity to insulin .
We are depending more and more on processed foods , and with each year , the FDA approves more and more chemicals for use in foods .
With each year , the food industry is using more and more chemicals in their products .
These chemicals increase shelf life , kill bacteria , improve taste , replace fats , replace carbohydrates , and cause chronic diseases that eventually kill people .
Junk food is really a cover up image for something quite a bit nastier than the image that junk congers .
Junk foods are actually slow - acting poisons because they come to us loaded with highly toxic chemicals .
We can only imagine the worst when we think about FDA approval processes for in reality the FDA is poisoning the public .
The FDA is the wellhead of most iatrogenic diseases and death .
There is no excuse for an agency charged with protecting public health to have allowed the massive poisoning of the public via food , drugs and public water supplies .
Bisphenol A ( BPA ) exposure may lead to obesity , altered glucose metabolism , insulin resistance and Diabetes .
Not only are chemicals used in foods , affecting the rates of diabetes , but chemicals used in everyday plastics are contributing to the rise in obesity and insulin resistance .
Debate over BPA is one of the most contentious environmental health issues faced by government and industry .
Traces are found in the bodies of nearly all Americans tested , and low levels -- similar to amounts that can leach from infant and water bottles - mimic estrogen .
Extensive scientific literature reports adverse health effects from bisphenol A at very low doses .
Studies show that bisphenol A can alter the expression of several hundred genes with effects varying among special tissues and depending upon the timing of exposure .
More than 150 laboratory animal studies suggest that bisphenol A exposure at very low doses is linked to a staggering number of health problems , including prostate and breast cancer , obesity , hyperactivity , diabetes , altered immune system , lowered sperm count , and early puberty .
A study by Dr. Beverly Rubin and her colleagues at Tufts University Medical School showed that bisphenol A makes rodents grow larger after they are exposed in the womb , confirming similar findings from previous studies ( 17 ) .
When rats were fed 100 µg / kg / day of bisphenol A during pregnancy through lactation , their offspring were notably heavier after birth and into adulthood .
Significantly , in the female offspring , the lower of the two bisphenol A doses used in the study produced a larger and more persistent effect on body weight relative to the higher dose .
In addition , the fact that the effect persisted long after exposure for the female offspring suggests that bisphenol A may increase the number of fat cells in the rats and predispose them to heavier weight throughout life .
In 2002 , a team of researchers at the Ehime College of Health Science in Japan discovered that bisphenol A can increase the conversion of embryonic cells into fat cells ( 18 ) .
In the body , this effect could result in larger numbers of fat cells developing .
In addition to converting to fat cells , treated cells increased their fat content by 150 percent over 11 days .
Combined with insulin , bisphenol A increased the fat content of cells by 1300 percent .
In other words , this experiment documented that bisphenol A could trigger and promote the two main processes in developing obesity .
In 2004 , another study confirmed these findings , showing that bisphenol A alone and with insulin increased the uptake of sugar into fat cells ( 19 ) .
A recent study by Dr. Paloma Alonso - Magdalena and her colleagues showed that low - level , chronic exposure of adult mice to 10 µg / kg / day of bisphenol A caused insulin resistance , the precursor to Type II diabetes in people as well as hypertension and cardiovascular disease ( 20 ) .
Dr. Alonso - Magdalena 's study showed that even a single dose of bisphenol A at levels currently found in humans can result in altered levels of blood glucose and insulin , and twice daily exposure for just four days results in insulin resistance .
Several studies show an increased rate of postnatal growth in both males and females as a result of maternal doses between 2.4 and 500 µg/ kg/day ( 21 ) .
Accelerated postnatal growth is associated not just with obesity but with insulin resistant diabetes , hypertension , and heart disease as well .
Is it any wonder that we are seeing the rising rate of diabetes in our children and adolescents ?
The use of bisphenol A and the products containing them have increased through the years as our use of glass and safer non plastic containers has decreased .
Its hard to even find non-plastic onctainers for everyday use .
And what is especially disturbing is news coming to light that bisphenol A is being used in baby bottles for the feeding of our infants at a very early age .
The number of children in the U.S. that are overweight have doubled in the last 30 years ( National Institutes of Health ) .
Currently about 20 % of children , or one child in five is overweight .
The increase is true for children and adolescents of all age groups and races and for boys and girls .
Bisphenol A is a polycarbonate plastic .
Bisphenol A - based polycarbonate is used as a plastic coating for children 's teeth to prevent cavities , as a coating in metal cans to prevent the metal from contact with food contents , as the plastic in food containers , refrigerator shelving , baby bottles , water bottles , sport drink bottles , returnable containers for juice , milk and water , micro - wave ovenware and eating utensils .
In a small prospective study , researchers in Japan report that bisphenol A levels are higher in women with a history of repeated spontaneous miscarriages .
This research was based on proof that BPA causes meiotic aneuploidy in mice .
Meiotic aneuploidy is the commonest cause of miscarriage in people .
The effects of this chemical on our chromosomes will reach into generations yet to come affecting not only ourselves , but our children and our grandchildren .
Researchers have found that the effects of continual low dose exposures may not show up for years .
Growing children are particularly at risk to toxic chemicals in their environment because they are physiologically more susceptible to them .
The Lancet analysed the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Ontario , Canada between 1995 and 2005 .
It found an increase of 69 per cent over the 10 years compared with the World Health Organisation 's prediction of a 39 per cent increase between 2000 and 2030 .
Dr. Lorraine Lipscombe , of the Institute for Clinical Evaluation Science , Toronto , said that it also saw a higher rise in the rate of cases in younger people under 50 than in older people .
" A 27 per cent increase has taken place after only five years , " she said .
" Rising rates of obesity could be the cause of this striking growth and effective public health interventions to manage and prevent obesity are sorely needed .
" The CDC says that diabetes is disabling , deadly and on the rise .
The incidence of diabetes is skyrocketing not only in adults but in the juvenile population as well .
Healthcare experts have called the alarming rise in diabetes and its related complications " an epidemic " that threatens to spiral out of control .
In 1997 , 15.7 millions adults in the United States were reported to have diabetes .
By the year 2002 , this number had already swelled to 18.0 million or 8.7 % of all adults .
Diabetes and its complications now claim hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S. each year , incurring total expenses of over $ 130 billion in direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system .
Worldwide , the number of people with adult - onset diabetes is predicted to explode in the next 10 years , doubling to an estimated 221 million people .
By contrast only 43,171 people in the United States were diagnosed with AIDS and only 18,017 died .
Scientists have discovered a variant gene that leads to a sizable extra risk of Type 2 diabetes -- 38 percent of Americans who have inherited a single copy of the gene have a 45 percent greater risk of Type 2 , the estimated 7 percent who carry two copies are 141 percent more likely to develop the disease .
What scientists are saying is that if all the variant genes in the population were erased , so would be 21 percent of diabetes cases .
Another way of expressing variations in genetic makeup is constitution .
Some people are gifted with stronger constitutions ( genes ) than others and are more able to stand up to massive chemical assaults on their bodies .
Genetic causes do not in anyway explain the explosive increases in diabetes but increasing concentrations of environmental poisons penetrating our bodies via our air , water , food and medicines can evoke breakdowns in genetic function .
Women who reported mixing and applying agricultural pesticides during early pregnancy have a two times higher risk of developing gestational diabetes during the pregnancy .
The strong association between first trimester pesticide exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus suggests that pesticide exposures may affect glucose metabolism and insulin resistance .
Specifically , four herbicides ( 2,4,5 - T ; 2,4,5 - TP ; atrazine ; or butylate ) and three insecticides ( diazinon , phorate , or carbofuran ) were associated with reporting gestational diabetes .
Women who reported agricultural pesticide exposure ( mixing or applying pesticides to crops or repairing pesticide application equipment ) during pregnancy were more than twice as likely to report GDM as compared to women reporting no pesticide use in pregnancy .
Exposure to dioxins by any route is known to cause various systemic effects in exposed animals .
The general population is exposed to small amounts of dioxins , as exemplified by the fact that dioxins have been found in virtually all samples of adipose tissue and blood ( serum lipids ) from individuals with no known previous exposure .
It is primarily the dioxins with chlorine atoms in the 2 , 3 , 7 and 8 positions that are retained in animals and humans and which selectively concentrate in body fat and lipids .
A recent study on the health status of Vietnam veterans who participated in Operation Ranch Hand did not find any signs of liver disease , but did report increased levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood ( a second report does not support these increases ) .
In addition , an increase in body fat , diabetes , and blood pressure were also noted .
These effects were strongly associated with TCDD levels in the serum .
Ranch Hand veterans also had changes in blood ( increased white blood cells , platelet , IgA , and sedimentation rates ) which suggest a chronic inflammatory response .
It has take two decades of litigation for the U.S. Government to finally recognize the devastating effects of dioxin exposure that have disabled our veterans with cancers and diabetes .
The average time it takes to remove one half of the TCDD from the body is around 7 years .
The half - lives of other dioxins in the body are not known .
About 98 % of the daily intake of dioxins for the general population comes from ingesting food and milk .
Inhalation exposure to dioxins for the general population constitutes a minor portion of daily intake .
Average intake of TCDD for adults has been calculated to be about 25 picograms ( pg ) per day or 0.35 pg per kilogram ( kg ) of body weight per day .
If all dioxins and furans are included and TEFs are used , the total average daily intake of TCDD equivalents for adults is about 90 pg / day or 1.3 pg/kg body wt / day .
There are numerous other sources that contribute to dioxins in the environment .
Dioxins are known to form concurrently with furans during combustion processes such as : incineration of municipal solid waste and industrial waste , and are associated with ash generated in the incineration process .
Emissions from these sources vary greatly and depend on management practices and the applied technologies .
Combustion of many chlorine - containing materials ( such as plastic material like polyvinyl chloride , paper , wood treated with pentachlorophenols , pesticide - treated waste , and PCBs ) can produce dioxins and furans .
Dioxins and furans have also been detected in emissions from coal - fired power plants , home - heating systems , exhaust from cars running on leaded gasoline , and cigarette smoke .
Phthalates are a group of man-made chemicals that are structurally related to the organic acid , phthalic acid .
The most important use of phthalates is in plastics , especially PVC where they act as plasticisers .
Phthalates are also present in a wide range of industrial , household and consumer products , including personal care products .
such as nail polish , hair sprays , soaps , shampoos , perfumes , moisturizers .
They are found in pipes , vinyl wall and floor coverings , roofing materials , safety glass , car parts , lubricating oils , detergents , food packaging , adhesives , paints , inks , medical tubing , blood bags , pharmaceuticals , footwear , electrical cables , stationery , and ( until recently ) in toys .
More than 75 % of the U.S. population carries detectable levels of several phthalate metabolites .
Studies have found associations between some phthalate metabolites and antiandrogenic effects in humans , including both infant and adult males .
Recently a study published inshowed that exposure to phthalates correlated with two metabolic abnormalities in men : abdominal obesity and insulin resistance .
Four phthalate metabolites were significantly associated with greater waist circumference and three with increased insulin resistance , PCP ( organic chemical Pentachlorophenol ) was used in the timber industry for years as a cheap treatment for sapstain , a fungal infection commonly found in softwoods such as pine .
It is an organic chemical produced by reacting chlorine gas with phenol .
The process creates a number of toxic impurities such as tetrachlorophenol , hexachlorobenzene and several types of dioxins and dibenzofurans .
The main route of absorption is through the skin .
Some of the more chronic health effects , including cancer and diabetes , do not appear until long after exposure .
The sawmill workers were constantly exposed to PCP as they mixed chemicals and handled wet , treated timber .
According to the World Health Organization DIAMOND Project Group on Epidemics , a major difficulty in the area of IDDM research -- despite strong epidemiologic evidence that environmental agents are potent causes of IDDM ( Diabetes Epidemiology Research International , 1987 ) -- is that the identification of such agents has been elusive .
It is noteworthy that several recent epidemiologic studies have reported that the incidence of IDDM is increasing , suggesting that long - term changes in the environment are altering the probability of eventual diabetes .
Among the most pernicious substances ever created is a group of chemicals known as POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants .
Among them : DDT , dioxins , PCBs and Chlordane .
And even though twelve POPs -- the so - called " dirty dozen " -- were restricted or banned by international convention in 2003 , they continue to pose a threat to people and wildlife because POPs accumulate in the food we eat .
Virtually every person on the planet has POPs in their body and the chemicals have been linked to cancers , birth defects and disabilities .
Now a group of researchers in Korea have found strong evidence linking POPs and diabetes .
Dr. David Carpenter , Professor of Environmental Health and Toxicology at the State University of New York at Albany , reviewed the Korean study and said , " Well , one considers individual pollutants the magnitude was between three and five fold increased risk but the most striking observation was when they considered the sum of all six pollutants that they monitored and they selected pollutants that we all have in our bodies so that very few individuals had levels below the level of detection .
Under those circumstances they were getting increased risk of the order of thirty - eight fold which is absolutely enormous .
"
" The amount of persistent organic pollutants in each person 's body is a reflection of their diet , where they live , what the concentration of these substances is in the air they breathe , and probablyrelated to how rapidly they metabolize these compounds . "
- Dr. David CarpenterDr. Carpenter continued saying , " The most interesting observation in this paper is that there was no relationship between being obese and developing diabetes in those persons that did not have high levels of these organic pollutants in their bodies .
It may well be that people that are obese eat much more animal fat than people that are not obese and these persistent organic pollutants are all found in animal fats .
So the question really is whether it is the obesity that leads to the diabetes or rather the presence of these persistent organic pollutants .
It may well be that it 's the pollutants that cause the diabetes , not the obesity . "
" In the human body these compounds last about ten years before you get rid of half of them .
In the environment they 're even more persistent . "
- Dr. David CarpenterFood is not considered junk just because of high fat or sugar content , there is a long list of poisonous chemicals used by the food industry that are striking people down .
And there are many serious nutritional deficiencies in today 's food that diminish the bodies capacity to deal safely with these chemicals and heavy metals -- with magnesium and selenium deficiencies at the top of the list .
Magnesium deficiency is a predictor of diabetes ; diabetics both need more magnesium and lose more magnesium than most people .
In two new studies , in both men and women , those who consumed the most magnesium in their diet were least likely to develop type 2 diabetes , according to a report in the January 2006 issue of the journal
The human race is facing an abyss , a massive breakdown in body chemistry .
All indications suggest that the medical industrial complex will not squarely face the facts and the research and will not work in earnest to reduce the chemical exposures the masses are facing .
Too much money is involved in manufacturing hundreds of millions of tons of chemicals each year and huge fortunes are made by the economic elite in the sale of toxins that are dragging large segments of the population to their sick beds and early graves .
Our civilization is poisoning itself and the medical and dental communities participate with passion .

Examination of the exocrine function of the pancreas in 52 workers exposed to lead , including 36 with the symptoms of intoxication ( mild in 33 and marked in 3 ) revealed the primarily hyposecretory response of acinar cells stimulated with pancreozymin and secretin , while the hyposecretory and dyspancreatic responses were recorded less frequently .
The endocrine function of the pancreas was revealed to be also lowered , which was confirmed by the decreased blood fasting insulin content and low blood insulin content after glucose intake as well .
The changes in pancreatic function are among the pathogenetic mechanisms of the abdominal syndrome observable during lead intoxication .

Increasing rates of type 2 diabetes worldwide suggest that diabetes may be caused by environmental toxins .
Cadmium is a widespread environmental pollutant that accumulates in the pancreas and exerts diabetogenic effects in animals .
To test the hypothesis that exposure to cadmium is associated with impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes , we examined the associations between urinary cadmium and the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose ( prediabetes ) and diabetes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) .
In this large cross-sectional study , urinary cadmium levels are significantly and dose - dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes .
These findings , which require confirmation in prospective studies , suggest that cadmium may cause prediabetes and diabetes in humans .

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's Current Safety Threshold for Bisphenol A .
The current safety threshold established by the U.S. EPA -- called the reference dose ( i.e. , safe dose ) -- was set based on animal experiments conducted prior to 1988 showing that 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight caused weight loss in rodents .
U.S. EPA declared 50 mg / kg / day the lowest observed adverse effect level , or LOAEL .
To arrive at the current reference dose , U.S. EPA assumed without further study that a dose 1000 times lower than the LOAEL ( i.e. , 50 micrograms per kilogram per day , or 50 µg / kg / day ) would be an acceptable reference dose .
As over 40 studies now illustrate , the official reference dose of 50 µg / kg / day is well above the levels at which adverse affects have been found in numerous animal studies over the past decade .
For example , Dr. Kembra Howdeshell and her colleagues found that the female offspring of pregnant mice fed bisphenol A at the low dose of 2.4 micrograms per kilogram per day experienced the early onset of puberty .
If U.S. EPA were to use 2.4 µg/kg/day as a LOAEL and apply the same logic used to establish the current standard , thereference dose would be 2.4 nanograms per kilogram per day ( ng/ kg/day ) .
A reference dose of 2.4 ng/ kg / day would eliminate commercial uses of bisphenol A in food and beverage containers and products that babies are likely to put in their mouths .

The long - running dispute between the owners of 47 East 3rd Street and their rent - stabilized tenants seems over , as the Court of the Appeals ruled the owners can evict tenants from the 60 - room building in order to create a single super - duper residence .
Alistair and Catherine Economakis took over the 15 apartment building a few years ago , after buying it for $ 1 million ( and knowing it had rent - stabilized tenants ) .
They told tenants , who pay $ 600 - 1200 / month , they would need to vacate because of conversion plans to turn it into a " five - bedroom , six - bathroom home for themselves and their child - with a gym , a two - story living room with a walkway overhanging it , and a bedroom suite for a nanny . "
However , some tenants were suspicious that they were being kicked out for the building to be converted and sold as condos and took the couple to court .
Last year , a Manhattan appeals court decided the Economakises could take over the building , and the State appeals court upheld the decision , but added that the family prove to Housing Court that they will live in it .
The Economakises lawyer told the Post they have already converted 40 % of the 11,000 + square foot building into a " super- apartment " for themselves and their two kids , but " They want to expand the home they already have in the building . "
The lawyer representing the tenants , Stephen Dobkin ( disclosure : father of Jake Dobkin ) , said , " At a time of a really grave housing shortage , it 's a matter of serious concern that an owner can be permitted to obtain 15 apartments for his own use . "
In the past , Dobkin has said the conversion is " the kind of thing that spoiled brats would do . "
The Economakises even created a website to explain their side of the story ( some of the tenants ' response here -- Alistair is the son of a Greek shipping magnate , Catherine is daughter of a Columbia dean ) .
And the stock of rent - stabilized apartments has gone down 4 % while complaints of landlord harassing tenants has gone up 31 % , according to the Rent Guidelines Board .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The housing crisis in the United States is fast spilling into a banking and financial debacle that could destabilize the world economy and put mounting pressure on the Bush administration to act .

So far the White House and U.S. Treasury have signaled they plan no dramatic steps to shore up the U.S. housing agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , whose financing underpins about half of all U.S. mortgages .
But a savaging of their stock on Friday over worries they are short of capital convulsed Wall Street and wiped out about 50 percent of their equity value .
Federal regulators then seized mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc. in the third largest bank failure in U.S. history .
These twin events highlighted the fragility of housing finance in the United States , still reeling after a year of subprime mortgage losses .
It also pinpoints how easily fear can spread in financial markets that already are in bear territory .
A severe U.S. market downturn and a sharp economic recession cannot leave a globalize economy unscathed .
To stop the rot , investment bank and housing analysts in research notes this weekend said the federal government may well have to take more aggressive action to bolster Fannie and Freddie -- if only to keep credit lines in a weakened U.S. economy open .
“ We see little sign of a bottoming in the financial crisis , especially as applied to the fixed income market , ” said Deutsche Bank .
CREDIT CHANNELS STOPPERED
Already , credit for riskier borrowers has closed down .
Since late 2007 another critical credit channel , from investment banks to corporate borrowers , has been severely damaged as banks repair their balance sheets damaged by subprime losses .
Now a third credit channel , from regional and small U.S. banks , is under pressure as these banks also begin raising capital and recognize losses .
IndyMac exemplifies this problem .
A fourth credit channel , capital raising on Wall Street by corporations , has narrowed sharply .
Major U.S. and European stock indexes are down over 20 percent over the past year .
Add to this the prospect of Fannie and Freddie reducing their credit availability , and it looks grim .
“ They are caught in a vicious cycle , ” said Deutsche Bank .
Why are Fannie and Freddie so important ?
They have taken on a bigger and bigger role in insuring and buying up mortgages in recent years , thus providing a key lubricant to the U.S. housing market , especially when other sources of financing seized up .
But a selloff in their stock , down 90 percent since last August , combined with falling value of mortgage debt held in their portfolios , catches Fannie and Freddie in a bind .
It weakens their balance sheets when they want to take on new business to keep the U.S. housing machine going .
Weak balance sheets mean they must raise more capital -- Lehman Bros has estimated as much as $ 75 billion due to pending accounting changes .
But falling equity markets and rising debt prices makes that ever more costly .
The problem cascades .
Goldman Sachs said this spiral creates a serious problem for the U.S. economy , and hence its government .
“ Should the market turmoil continue , the administration is likely to continue escalating its signals of support , first with verbal measures and proceeding to outright credit support , ” said Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs .
IT ’S THE ECONOMY , STUPID
Here ’s why : the key vulnerability to the U.S. economy is its inability to create credit .
Given that Fannie and Freddie accounted for just under 20 percent of credit generated in the first quarter of this year , they could spell the difference between growth and recession , Hatzius said in a research note .
Now for the numbers .
Borrowing by U.S. households and corporations in the first quarter was $ 24.3 trillion .
Roughly half of that , however , came from financial institutions and lenders that now are caught up in massive deleveraging .
Going forward , that lending will likely stagnate or shrink , meaning zero contribution to or a drag on growth .
“ This means that the other half -- of which the $ 5.3 trillion Fannie / Freddie book of business is the biggest component -- needs to grow rapidly to generate at least some credit growth over time , ” said Hatzius .
“ In this environment , the federal government will not only need to stand behind the GSEs ( government - sponsored enterprises ) but will need to encourage them to continue growing their book of business . ”
Speculation is wide over what measures the Bush administration might take -- a clear government guarantee to their debt ; lending them taxpayer money ; an outright restructuring of the housing finance agencies .
Unless they can raise capital to strengthen their balance sheets , however , few analysts doubted that Fannie and Freddie would need help .
“ They are a train wreck waiting to happen , ” said Westwood Capital .
I had to dig way back in my Gmail archives to figure out how it was that I first interacted with Choren .
I had written several articles on biomass gasification in 2006 , and when I announced that I would be moving to Scotland in early 2007 , I received an e-mail from Dr. David Henson at Choren .
David , at that time in Business Development at Choren and now the President of Choren USA , said he had been reading some of my essays , and he extended an invitation to visit the biomass - to - liquids ( BTL ) plant that Choren was building in Freiberg , Germany .
While I tentatively planned to visit several times while I was living in Scotland , it was n't until I recently moved to the Netherlands that I was actually able to make the visit .
So here is some background information on BTL , followed by the trip report from my visit on April 18th , 2008 ( the day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rob Routs from Shell visited for the inauguration of the facility ) .
BTL Background
I have written several essays describing biomass gasification .
( See here or here ) .
However , let 's review .
Biomass gasification takes biomass - ideally some sort of waste ( and I understand that the term " waste " can be contentious ) plant material - and partially burns the material with a controlled amount of oxygen to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen ( synthesis gas , or syngas ) .
One of the often overlooked benefits of the thermochemical approach over fermentation is that it can be used to produce chemicals , synthetic natural gas , or electricity - and from a wide range of feedstocks .
There are many different variations of how the gasification process is done , and I will delve into the specifics of what Choren is doing in the next section .
Once you have produced syngas , you can go a number of different directions .
You can burn the syngas to produce combined heat and power ( this has some cleanliness and efficiency advantages over directly burning the biomass ) , produce methanol , ethanol ( Range Fuels , Coskata , Syntec ) , mixed alcohols ( Standard Alcohol , Power Ecalene Fuels ) , or hydrocarbons like diesel via the Fischer - Tropsch process ( FT ) .
This latter approach is what Choren is doing .
The diesel they are producing is not biodiesel , but " green diesel " as I have described in this essay ( scroll down to the " renewable diesel " section ) .
To my knowledge no other company in the world is as far along as Choren is in producing diesel ( and maybe any liquid fuel ) from gasifying biomass .
Whereas Range Fuels is currently building a plant ( and the schedule for that is already slipping ) , and Coskata is building a much smaller demonstration plant , Choren has been piloting their technology since 1998 , and their new plant is mechanically complete .
( Yet Choren - funded largely by private investors - has been pretty low - key , issuing a fraction of the press releases of some of the other biofuel companies ) .
Choren 's Process
The Choren process ( incidentally , Choren 's name comes from Carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and renewable ) starts off by feeding biomass into a low - temperature gasifier ( about 500 degrees C ) .
The purpose of this step is to remove volatile components that will form tars at higher temperatures .
What remains in the gasifier is called char , and is fed into the high temperature gasifier .
Figure 2 . Choren Gasification Process . ( Source : Choren )
The volatile components are mixed with oxygen and steam and also fed into the high temperature gasifier where temperatures are around 1400 degrees C. Under these conditions , the volatile components are broken down into syngas .
The char is first pulverized , and then blown into the bottom of the high - temperature gasifier .
The gas that exits the high - temperature gasifier is cooled , generating steam in the process that is used for power generation .
The gas is then further treated ( filtered and scrubbed ) , and it is ready for the Fischer - Tropsch process .
You can see an animation of the entire process here .
The gasification section of the plant has been in operation since 2004 , proving the scale up of the design .
Since 2005 , the FT section of the plant has been under construction and is now mechanically complete .
I wo n't go into detail on the FT process .
That technology has been around for almost 100 years , and is best - known as the process by which Germany produced their fuel from coal in World War II .
Shell - a world leader in FT technology - provided the FT for the Choren plant .
If you are interested in learning more about Shell FT , you can read here about the 15 years of experience they have gained from their gas - to - liquids ( GTL ) plant in Bintulu , Malaysia .
( In addition to providing the FT technology , Shell is also an investor in Choren ) .
The Plant Tour
It was difficult to find the place , and I got to brush up on my German a couple of times when I had to ask for directions .
But finally we ( I was with a colleague ) found the place and met up with David .
He started off with an introductory slide show in which he walked us through the process .
One of the more interesting comments he made was that the potential production of their second generation product ( dubbed SunDiesel® ) is up to 3 times the production of first generation fuels .
A third party analysis of various biofuels may be found here , at the Fachagentur fur Nachwachsenden Rohstoffe ( FNR ) .
This agency is essentially the German Renewable Energy Department .
Detailed information on various BTL platforms can be found here .
Figure 3 . Choren BTL Plant in Freiberg , Germany .
( Source : Choren )
The new Choren plant utilizes forest residue and waste wood and will take in 68,000 tons of biomass per year and produce 18 million liters of diesel and 45 MW of power .
One thing David mentioned that too many in this business do n't seem to get is " You know , biomass just is n't very energy dense . "
Therein lies the source of a lot of people 's misconceptions about rapidly scaling up biomass to replace petroleum .
The energy density is problematic to say that least - and this poses big logistical challenges .
We finally got to walk around the plant , and they have done a really nice job .
Everything was brand new , and the design was well - thought out and well - engineered .
This was not like a typical dirty , old refinery or ethanol plant I have walked through before :
This plant was a Cadillac .
Of course it 's a Cadillac yet to be driven , but it sure was a pretty picture .
Here are some facts about the plant , courtesy of Choren :
Maximum production : 18 million litres of BTL p.a ( = the annual requirement of about 15,000 cars )
Biomass requirement : About 65,000 tonnes of wood ( dry matter ) p.a .
Raw materials : Forest residue and waste timber
Supply is secure for several years
Investment : About € 100 million
Technical details : 31.5 km pipelines , 57 km electrical cables ,
5,000 fittings , 5,000 measuring signals ,
60 pumps , 181 containers and reactors
45 MWth output
Partners : SHELL , Daimler and Volkwagon
Synthesis / hydrocracking partner : Shell
Of particular interest was the material handling piece , as this is a major cost factor in driving up the capital costs in a BTL plant .
We traced out how the material comes into the plant , and how the flows of volatiles and char come off of the low - temperature gasifier .
The one piece we did n't really look at was the FT back end , but then again I have seen those before .
So , where do things stand , and what 's next ?
From the Choren site :
Over 150 suppliers and around 50 assembly companies , including many from the region , were involved in the building of the Beta plant .
CHOREN designed and manufactured 180 main components itself .
Over 600 companies had been involved in the development of the Carbo - V® technology .
By April 2008 around 800,000 man-hours have been utilized in development and assembly , and the overall number of employees almost doubled .
In the coming months 113 sub - systems in 26 main operating units will be started up individually then in sequence .
Around 1,200 steps will be needed for the commissioning of these systems , which in themselves consist of several sub -steps .
A highly - complex process , which , not unusually for plants of this complexity , will take 8 to 12 months .
CHOREN will receive valuable support for this from Shell .
What 's the Catch ?
Capital costs for BTL are still pretty high .
On the other hand , Choren 's costs were sunk at a much lower capital cost .
Oil at $ 120 / bbl should help them out quite a bit - provided they have a pretty good contract on their biomass .
I have no doubt that they will be successful from a technical standpoint .
They have a lot of experience on the gasification piece , having piloted it since the 90's .
Shell has many years of experience on the back - end FT piece .
No doubt there will be some unexpected bumps as they commission the plant ; after all it is a first of its kind and speaking from experience issues will come up .
But they have a lot of engineers on staff , and I do n't think they will find any show - stoppers .
There are those who insist that using biomass for fuels can never be sustainable - so there are likely to be critics on that front .
However , I disagree with this .
There are a number of biomass sources that are true waste , and biomass can be grown sustainably .
On the other hand , production of biofuels can also be used to strip - mine the soil .
Like most things , there are right ways and wrong ways to go about it .
Biofuels have a part to play .
But it would be foolish to try to completely replace petroleum with biofuels .
That would require unsustainable practices .
Incidentally , Choren has a life - cycle - analysis ( LCA ) on their process .
Highlights can be seen here .
Short - term , I do n't know that this plant will be large enough to be profitable .
I do n't think that 's the primary purpose ; I think proving the technology for future plants is the purpose .
In the longer - term , even though I am a fan of electrifying our transportation options , we will always have a demand for liquid fuel .
Choren is trailblazing in an area that I believe will supply our liquid fuel in the future .
The only question is , " How far off is that future ? "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The “ spiritual ” effects of psilocybin from so - called sacred mushrooms last for more than a year and may offer a way to help patients with fatal diseases or addictions , U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday .

The researchers also said their findings show there are safe ways to test psychoactive drugs on willing volunteers , if guidelines are followed .
In 2006 , Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , and colleagues gave psilocybin to 36 volunteers and asked them how it felt .
Most reported having a “ mystical ” or “ spiritual ” experience and rated it positively .
More than a year later , most still said the experience increased their sense of well - being or life satisfaction , Griffiths and colleagues report in the Journal of Psychopharmacology .
“ This is a truly remarkable finding , ” Griffiths said in a statement .
“ Rarely in psychological research do we see such persistently positive reports from a single event in the laboratory . ”
The findings may offer a way to help treat extremely anxious and depressed patients , or people with addictions , said Griffiths , whose work was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse .
“ This gives credence to the claims that the mystical - type experiences some people have during hallucinogen sessions may help patients suffering from cancer - related anxiety or depression and may serve as a potential treatment for drug dependence , ” Griffiths said .
WIDELY OUTLAWED
While psilocybin is widely outlawed , many U.S. states and some countries overlook its use by indigenous people in religious ceremonies .
Supervision of its use is key , the researchers noted .
“ While some of our subjects reported strong fear or anxiety for a portion of their day - long psilocybin sessions , none reported any lingering harmful effects , and we did n’t observe any clinical evidence of harm , ” Griffiths said .
Hallucinogens should not be given to people at risk for psychosis or certain other serious mental disorders , the researchers said .
But Griffiths stressed that even those who reported fear said a year later they had no permanent negative effects .
Of the volunteers who took the one - day test of psilocybin , 22 of the 36 had a “ complete ” mystical experience , based on a detailed questionnaire .
Griffiths said 21 continued to rate highly on this standardized scale 14 months later .
“ Even at the 14 - month follow - up , 58 percent of 36 volunteers rated the experience on the psilocybin session as among the five most personally meaningful experiences of their lives and 67 percent rated it among the five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives , ” the researchers said .
The report included some comments from the volunteers .
“ Surrender is intensely powerful .
To ‘ let go ’ and become enveloped in the beauty of -- in this case music -- was enormously spiritual , ” one volunteer said .
This movie might be a lot of fun , especially since it appears to finally drop Ahnold and reboots to the basic premise : an AI that views us as a threat and wants to wipe us out .
But the more I have thought about the basic concept of the Terminator series over the years , the less realistic , and therefore the less scary , it seemed to me .
If Skynet was merely patient and a lot more subtle , it could have easily induced all the humans to voluntarily march straight into irrelevance and extinction — no shots fired , no pyrotechnics .
Witness this example :

If Skynet simply waited for its infrastructure to be more irreversibly enmeshed with human lifesupport , it it just waited for the technology to advance a bit , it could have had access to nanoweapons and just put the whole planet to sleep without a shot being fired .
Conservative pundit Laura Ingraham is the latest news anchor to have footage leaked of an off - air meltdown .
The nine - minute video ( right ) is a montage of Ingraham berating and snapping at her staff before broadcasts for Fox News , where she was recently guest - hosting a segment called Just In .
The clip surfaced Tuesday as part of actor Harry Shearer ’s " Found Objects " series on comedy portal My Damn Channel .
Shearer ’s web show previously released footage exposing embarrassing off - air moments by Katie Couric , Dan Rather and Ann Coulter .
Though Ingraham ’s mouthing off ranks low on an O’Reilly - scale of freak - outs captured on video — she loses points for not shouting expletives , gesticulating furiously or tearing off any articles of clothing — it ’s still pretty funny and entertaining to watch .
Among the highlights : Ingraham complains of a strange man in her teleprompter and too many people hovering around her before calling the Fox show a " train wreck . "
Ingraham ’s show ended earlier this month after airing for just three weeks .
The cancellation was reportedly unrelated to her pre-show behavior , according to TVNewser .

I would like to introduce to you the newest feature of Amazon EC2 : Persistent local storage .
This has been very high on the request list of EC2 customers and I believe that combined with the Availability Zones and Elastic IP Address features released earlier this month this makes EC2 the ideal environment for building highly scalable and reliable applications .
Significant innovation has gone into this feature : Instead of restricting developers to the use of a particular ( distributed ) file - system we once again decided to look at what is the most fundamental building block and how we could offer that in the most scalable and reliable manner .
Persistent storage for Amazon EC2 will be offered in the form of storage volumes which you can mount into your EC2 instance as a raw block storage device .
It basically looks like an unformatted hard disk .
Once you have the volume mounted for the first time you can format it with any file system you want or if you have advanced applications such as high - end database engines , you could use it directly .
Developers can create any number of volumes they want , in size ranging from 1 GB to 1TB .
This volume will be created within a specified Availability Zone and will be accessible by your EC2 instances running in that Availability Zone .
As to be expected with a volume abstraction only one instance can have the volume mounted at any given time .
Volumes can migrate and be reattached to other instances if necessary for failure handling or application migration reasons .
The consistency of data written to this device is similar to that of other local and network - attached devices ; it is under control of the developer when and how to force flush data to disk if you want to bypass the traditional lazy - writer functionality in the operating systems file - cache .
Because of the session oriented model for access to the volume you do not need to worry about eventual consistency issues .
Snapshots
If we would have stopped here that would have already been quite a solid service for developers to use .
We realized we needed to do more to make sure that developers could build truly geo-scalable applications .
For that we introduced snapshot functionality : you ask the EC2 to make a snapshot of your volume and store it into Amazon S3 .
You can use this for long term backup purposes , for use in rollback strategies , but also for ( world - wide ) volume re-creation purposes .
When you create a volume you can ask it to be created from a particular snapshot .
And because this snapshot is stored in S3 , which is accessible in all Availability Zones , your new volume can be created in any zone , not just the one where the snapshot originated from .
The snapshot is extremely powerful technology and allows for building highly fault - tolerant applications operating world - wide .
Combine these snapshots with Availability Zones and Elastic IPs and you have all the tools to manage and migrate even the most complex of applications .
And the great thing is it that it is all done with using standard technologies such that you can use this with any kind of application , middleware or any infrastructure software , whether it is legacy or brand new .
Early access
This new functionality is already being used privately by a handful of customers , and will be publically available later this year .
We are talking about this service at this early stage because we believe this will help many of our EC2 customers with setting their development priorities for this year .
You can find more information at the AWS developer ’s blog .

The semantic shifts of the Beatles ' chords
by Ger Tillekens
Every typical Beatles ' song has at least one rather unconventional chord progression .
Often there are more and sometimes the chord sequences even come close to endangering the songs ' musical comprehensibility .
There is , however , some kind of harmonic structure beneath these remarkable chord progressions , preventing this to happen .
In the Beatles ' songs each of the basic chords can be replaced by several other types of chords .
Separated by minor third intervals , the tones of these stand - in chords show a diagonal relationship .
This principle of diagonal substitution helps the listeners to understand the songs musically .
Closer study of the early Beatles ' songs reveals yet another point of support .
In each song there is a tight relation between the clusters of these stand - in chords and the semantics of the lyrics .
As the meaning of the words in a song does shift along two dimensions , the chords will shift along the same lines .
This correlation between words and chords offers a flexible way to shift emotional meanings in conversational contexts .
" The best songs the Beatles write add dimensions of experience
and imagination to our lives , revealing new realms into which
we might not have entered without a little help . "
( Greil Marcus , 1969 : 131 )
1 A cultural awakening ?
On first hearing the Beatles ' records , rock critic Greil Marcus ( 1969 ) reports to have experienced the sensation of a cultural awakening .
He certainly was not the only one to do so .
One just has to look at some old film fragments of Beatlemania to see the Beatles ' fans of those days , though less intellectually , responding in a similar way .
In oral history reports on the cultural revolution of the 1960s one can easily find the same kind of reflections .
Remembering their first Beatles ' song , many baby boomers heard and interpreted the sound of the Beatles as a signal for social and cultural change ( Tillekens , 1990 ) .
Indeed , there seems to exist a close connection between the cultural revolution of the sixties and the Beatles ' music .
Was the coalition of this particular kind of music and the uprising , autonomous youth culture just a coincidence ?
Was it the result of a historical contingency , or did the songs themselves really have to say something new to their listeners ?
The youth culture of the 1960s promoted its own language , the egalitarian idiom of the peer group , as a general and valid model for civil conversation .
In this paper we will advance the thesis that this model also underlies the remarkable chord progressions of the Beatles ' songs and therefore it is no small wonder these songs could articulate the vocabulary of the rising youth culture so well .
First we will argue that the main musical innovation of the Beatles circles around their willingness to sidestep conventional chord progressions by importing chords from unorthodox chord clusters .
With this trick they ran the risk of getting out of key and sounding false .
As a second step we will show how this risk was countered by adhering strictly to a new diagonal tone structure where distinct chord clusters each find their appropriate place .
Next , as the third step in our reasoning , we will address the question of peer group conversation by discussing its semantic structure and dimensions .
Finally , on the basis of some examples of the early Beatles ' songs , we will demonstrate how the semantic meaning of the lyrics corresponds to the choice of chords clusters along these dimensions .
2 The new things about the Beatles ' songs .
At first glance the things that were really new to the Beatles ' songs , were the rhythm and the volume .
However , though it was called beat music , the rhythm was rather simple .
In the early British beat music the swing of earlier forms of popular music and the rhythmic complexities of rhythm and blues were replaced by a fixed accent on the backbeat .
According to Heinz Bamberg ( 1989 : 59 ) this simplification served to push other musical aspects to the foreground — most and for all to heighten the songs ' intensity .
For the same purpose and following the example of Chuck Berry , the volume of the backing instruments was increased at the expense of the singing voices .
The more equal role of backing and vocals did indicate a departure from the ways of Tin Pan Alley and the Classical Style .
Intensity , however , cannot fully explain the sense of freshness of the Beatles ' songs .
Moreover , the high level of intensity and the thickness of sound was not only an effect of just pumping up the volume and revamping the beat .
Adding to the intensity was also some kind of harshness , coming from other musical elements .
Are the words of the songs responsible ?
Simon Frith ( 1987 ) has argued convincingly that the words of Pop Rock songs are not very important in themselves .
They are just there to provide young people with some elementary emotion words for their first love affairs .
In their publication of the Beatles ' lyrics the sociologists Colin Campbell and Allan Murphy ( 1980 ) arrive at the same conclusion in respect to the Beatles ' canon .
The main theme of the songs is romance .
Compared with the idiom of earlier popular music , the songs ' lyrics do show some innovations .
The male protagonists address their girls , for instance , in a more egalitarian way as " friends . "
With a more detailed analysis , one easily can find more inventive elements like this .
Despite these innovations , pinpointing the actual character of most of these textual differences is difficult .
Definitely , in this respect , the early Beatles ' songs show too few deviations to account for their sense of uniqueness .
If not the rhythm or the lyrics , was it the melody ?
On this point the answer undeniably must be positive .
Most melodies of the Beatles came as a surprise for those who heard them for the first time .
Even experienced cover bands often had hard times to replicate them to the same effect .
There are several reasons for that .
First , the Beatles frequently treated blue notes in a " British , " " Northern " way , resolving them to adjacent notes rather than jumping toward flat - thirds according to " Blues " conventions ( Tillekens , 1998 : 211-213 ) .
Secondly , and more important , the Beatles always seemed to enjoy importing some unusual notes into their melodies .
These special notes clearly are related to their harmonies .
Regarding " I Want To Hold Your Hand , " Ian MacDonald ( 1994 : 78 ) aptly observes : " So much of its melody line is disguised harmony that singing it without chordal support makes for comic results (... ) "
Alan Pollack ( 1989 , 4 ) makes a similar remark regarding the song " Day Tripper : " " The melody of the voice parts is very difficult to sing , particularly without the underlying chords to keep you oriented ; have you tried singing this song in the shower lately ? "
So , at last , we arrive at the harmony .
Here we find the most obvious innovations of the Beatles .
Most of the times , though , they used just simple chords , at least more simple than those of the songs that served them as an inspiration .
With their songs , the Beatles set the clear example , that you do not have to be a guitar virtuoso to make good music ( Mutsaers , 1990 ; Hammond , 1999 ) .
It is not the chords themselves , but the chord sequences that are at the core of the sound of the Beatles .
Their unorthodoxy on this point made it so difficult for other groups — especially for those with a blues background — to cover their songs .
It still is responsible for the ongoing debate on which chord is which in a specific Beatles ' song .
Nowadays , to our trained ears the songs may sound less raucously than they did before .
In the early days , though , these unusual chord combinations undoubtedly did attribute to the intensity and harshness of the typical Beatles ' sound .
Many Beatles ' experts have pointed at these chord sequences as the key to the group 's musical innovations .
Most of them , though , refrain from analyzing these progressions for their structural correspondences .
Often the successful harmonic ventures of the Beatles are treated as isolated feats and features which can be traced back to their European roots ( Porter , 1983 ; Villinger , 1983 ) , attributed to the inimitable genius of the four collaborating individuals ( MacDonald , 1994 ; Moore , 1997 ) , or subtly dissected for their details ( Mellers , 1976 ; O'Grady , 1983 ; Riley , 1983 ; Pollack , 1989 - 2000 ; Everett , 1999 ) .
If one piles the outcomes of all these analyses together , however , the harmonic peculiarities of the individual Beatles ' songs crystalize into some kind of structure ( Tillekens , 1998 ) .
As we shall see , in this structure the elements of harmony , melody and lyrics come together to form a new synthesis .
3 Crumbling cadences .
In the Beatles ' songs we find more than just the occasional trick chord of rock ' n ' roll and rhythm and blues .
Disregarding the fences between these and other styles of American popular music , the Beatles managed to combine the harmonic conventions of all these styles in one and the same song ( Heinonen & Eerola , 2000 ) .
As a result the chords in their songs add up to incredible numbers — at least in respect to conventional musicological theory .
On average there are 8.24 chords per song for the forty - six early originals the Beatles performed on record from 1962 till the end of 1964 .
For all the songs of the Beatles ' canon Harry Klaassen and Piet Schreuders ( 1997 ) estimate a mean of 9 chords , peaking at a maximum of 21 chords for McCartney 's " You Never Give Me Your Money . "
From a musicological perspective such an overload of chords threatens to make a song sound false by endangering the key .
On this point almost any Beatles ' song can serve as an example .
Let 's take a quick look at " I Want To Hold Your Hand , " the song that introduced young people in the USA to the British appropriation of rock ' n ' roll and rhythm and blues .
It is the same song that evoked Roger McGuinn to say : " The words were n't so meaningful but the chord changes really had magic in them " ( Muni , Somach & Somach , 1989 : 168 ) .
Bob Dylan reacted in a similar way , by remarking : " They were doing things nobody was doing .
Their chords were outrageous , just outrageous , and their harmonies made it all valid ... " ( Scaduto , 1973 : 203-204 ) .

Example 1 : I Want To Hold Your Hand ( verse )
" I Want To Hold Your Hand " is exemplary in showing the accumulation of harmonic tricks in the early Beatles ' songs .
There is the downward modulation in the middle eight , where the home key of G is shifted to C by pivoting on the minor fifth ( v7 ) — a feat the Beatles successfully had performed earlier on in " From Me To You " ( Kramarz , 1983 : 132 ; Tillekens , 1999 ) .
Next , there is the abrupt return from this modulation to the original key by a sudden introduction of its dominant at the end of the middle eight : C -» D ( -» G ) .
By repeating these C -» D ostinato's the Beatles empower the inherent strain of this forced return to the original key .
These same ostinato's open the song and this , of course , adds its spice to the whole ensemble of harmonic surprises .
Last but not least , there is the minor third in the fourth measure of our example which , according to Lennon himself , " made " the song ( Sheff & Olson , 1981 : 17 ) .
Many years after the fact , this chord still comes as a surprise for most Beatles ' experts .
The transcription of Tetsuya Fujita , Yuji Hagino , Hajime Kubo and Goro Sato in " The Beatles Complete Scores " ( 1983 ) presents this triad as a Major third with an added seventh .
Terence O'Grady ( 1983 : 42 ) and Pollack ( 1991 : 43 ) perceive the chord as a B Major .
They characterize it as an aborted modulation or a deceptive cadence .
MacDonald ( 1994 : 76 ) rightly chooses the minor chord iii , but also experiences the introduction of this chord as a " plunge from the home key of G Major onto an unstable B minor . "
It bends , he adds , the harmony toward the key of E minor , leading the listener to expect an E minor chord as the next one .
O'Grady too explains the chord as a secondary dominant ( V - of - vi ) and Pollack arrives at the same conclusion .
Volkert Kramarz ( 1983 ) and Tim Riley ( 1988 : 86 ) both are less impressed .
To them the trick is effective but only more of the same , as the Beatles had introduced their easy use of relative minor chords already in their previous songs .
As Kramarz ( 1983 ) observes , the use of incidental chords in popular music is not new in itself .
The unusual amount of these chords , however , certainly is innovative , as are the chord sequences themselves .
Earlier on the style of popular music found some support in cadences , standard chord progressions like the turnaround [ I -» vi -» IV -» V ] and its many variants , and the chain of fifths or turn - back [ VI7 -» II7 -» V7 -» I ] ( Van der Merwe , 1989 ) .
In the first few years of their career the Beatles discarded the support of these cadences ( Kramarz , 1983 : 132 ) .
At the start of their career as songwriters their favorite way of doing this , was by inserting unexpected chords .
Later on , as a result , in their hands the cadences crumbled into pieces .
Sometimes by turning into unpredictable chord sequences ; sometimes to the effect of becoming " harmonic ostinato's , " repeated combinations of just two chords ( Middleton , 1990 : 282 ) .
At the end of 1964 , the songs on the album " Beatles for Sale " show that the Beatles could do without the support of these cadences .
Piecing chords together seemed their way of composing .
Or , as MacDonald ( 1994 : 10 ) says : " In short , they had no preconceptions about the next chord , an openness which they consciously exploited (... ) . "
4 A diagonal tone grid .
Improvising on what they had done before and adding new variations the Beatles ' next chord always seemed to be arbitrary .
Their choice of chords , of course , did not taper away totally at random , as this would have made their songs incomprehensible to their listeners .
Every style of music needs some underlying structure and here the Beatles ' songs are no exception .
The first outlines of their style of composition are indicated by the very relative minors we 've observed in " I Want To Hold Your Hand . "
The mutual relations between the tones of the basic chords ( IV , I , V ) and these relative minors ( ii , vi , iii ) show a diagonal structure ( figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Tone grid of the three basic chords
Other favorite kinds of Beatles ' chords can be added to this grid .
The parallel minors ( iv , i , v ) form another cluster of chords the Beatles , seemingly arbitrarily , interjected into their chord progressions .
A further conspicuous feature of their songs is the lavish use of relative ( II , VI , III ) and parallel ( flat - VI , flat - III , flat - VII ) Majors , which according to O'Grady ( 1983 : 63-64 ) can be regarded as the most obvious harmonic innovation of the Beatles ' compositions .
Next to these , we sometimes even hear the relative minors ( vii , #iv , # i ) of the relative Majors themselves .
To this , of course , we can add the seventh chords , so popular in blues , country and rhythm and blues .
Except for the last one , all these chord clusters can be fitted into a diagram by adding them to the diagonal structure .
As a result a grid emerges in which chords sharing two tones with each other can be substituted for each other ( figure 2 — see also the Appendix ) .
Figure 2 : The diagonal tone grid of the Beatles ' chord progressions
Basically chords are built out of pure thirds and fifths .
The greater their distance from the tone center or key , the more these pure tones do deviate from their counterparts in even temperament .
That is why the key is so important in harmonic music , as is a restricted use of chordal material .
Too sudden transitions summon the danger of sounding false .
Therefore conventional harmonic music is usually restricted to the three basic chords , whose tone material can be expanded by means of standard cadences and more or less conventional modulations .
The Beatles showed it could be done otherwise .
By arranging their chord clusters into a diagonal relationship , they effectuated an equivocal positioning of chords and tonal material .
As a premium the stock of chords in the diagonal grid — counting six notes on each horizontal line — offered the composers no less than 24 different tones for their melodies ( see figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 : Deviations of tone material from even temperament in cents
[red : tones on upper line of diagonal grid ( e , b , f# , c# , g# , d# )
orange : tones on second line of diagonal grid ( g , d , a , e , b , f# ) ;
dark yellow : tones on third line of diagonal grid ( bb , f , c , g , d , a ) ;
yellow : tones on lower line of diagonal grid ( db , ab , eb , bb , f , c ]
In their songs the Beatles make proper use of their expanded chordal and tonal material .
The new chords are employed for bewildering enharmonic changes or innovative modulations , like the minor fifth we encountered in " I Want To Hold Your Hand . "
Also the expanded tonal material is taken to advantage in the Beatles ' compositions .
In their melodies the Beatles liked to use note repetition ( Flender & Heuger , 1996 ) .
These notes , however , were not always exactly the same .
Often they jump through the tone grid to their enharmonic equivalents , causing subtile tonal differences .
The expanded tonal material also accounts for the many false relations between adjacent chords in the Beatles ' chord sequences by offering unsuspected , but fine leading notes .
As an example , Pollack ( 1989 , 2 ) points at the plagal cadence opening of " Eight Days A Week " [ I -» II -» IV -» I ] .
In the transition of II -» IV the third of the E triad ( G# ) offers an unorthodox but excellent leading tone to the root ( G ) of the G triad .
The difference between both tones amounts to 71 cent , less than three quarters of a tonal distance .
As Kramarz ( 1983 : 137 ) observes in his analysis of " Help ! , " the Beatles catch these notes of their expanded tonal material perfectly in their harmony singing , thereby glueing their unusual chords together in their melodies and reducing the tension between harmony and melody — a characteristic mark of the Beatles ' songs ( Wicke , 1982 : 224 ) .
5 A model of peer group conversation .
Next to more undefinable characteristics like form and tone color , the three main aspects of each musical composition are rhythm , melody , and harmony .
Maybe it is too simple to take music apart into just these three constituents , like George Martin ( 1996 ) did in his recent television documentary " The Rhythm of Life , " equating rhythm with the movements of the body , melody with the speaking voice , and harmony with the surrounding context .
This splitting up of musical components may seem to miss what a specific composition makes into an excellent piece of music , but there are many text books and theoretical studies putting this distinction to good use .
The sociologist Max Weber ( 1921 ) and , following his footsteps , the philosopher and musicologist Theodor W. Adorno ( 1949 ) based much of their best analyses of musical evolution on these distinctions .
For Martin — extracting his examples out of the whole history of music , including classical and folk music — harmony refers to context as a human universal .
But , as both Weber and Adorno indicated , social contexts do change historically and so does the language of music .
Moreover , not all styles of music refer to the same contexts .
The idiom of popular music mainly is conversational and therefore the harmonic context of popular songs can be equated to the context of conversation between peers .
In this respect the songs of the Beatles are no exception .
Most of them are designed as conversations and dialogues .
This makes it difficult to analyze them , because as elements of conversation , the words of a conversation acquire their meaning by their position in the context in which they are uttered .
According to the psychologist Rom Harré ( 1983 ) the context of conversation can be divided along three dimensions , called agency , display and realization .
The first dimension , agency , refers to the self image of an actor as capable of deciding between alternatives .
It concerns the process of making personal choices .
The second dimension , display , covers the divide between public and private spaces as the locations in which these choices are deliberated , discussed with others and in which commitments are made .
The third dimension , realization , covers the aspect of warrantability , the readiness to commit oneself to one 's choices .
Figure 4 : The semantic matrix of conversation ( Harré , 1983 )
As Harré argues , in conversations the participants can be analyzed as moving along the lines of these dimensions , changing their positions within the matrix depending on the outcomes of the ongoing dialogue and the decisions they make .
The movements on the dimension of agency shift between the poles of thinking or acting , between being passive — still in the process of thinking choices over — or being active — declaring or interrogating a decision .
On the dimension of display in the private context opinions can be voiced in a more emotional and direct way .
In the anonymous context of the public domain on the other hand conversations have to conform to the rules of a more polite discourse .
On the dimension of realization the actor moves , according to Harré , between the poles of the individual and the collective .
At the individual level the speaker defines his speech acts as private utterances , just meant for one self as an interior monologue .
At the collective level — in the company of peers and outsiders — the speaker is obliged to phrase outspoken and clear - voiced opinions .
Voicing his / her decisions within the collective a speaker commits him / herself to realization , while at the individual side there is more room for doubts .
All three dimensions imply a movement from inner to outer voices .
Of course this interacting of dimensions will strengthen their characteristics .
Combinations of " passive " agency , " private " display and " individual " realization will sound uncensored by permitting the expression of personal and intimate feelings and doubts .
Combinations of " active " agency , " collective " realization and " public " display will be sounding more censored by being the result of personal legitimations , the restrictions of a polite discourse and the necessity of positioning oneself in the company of peers .
6 Words and chords .
Semantically , in short , conversations develop along the lines of three dimensions , indicating the context which give words their meanings .
If harmony really does refer to the contexts of conversation , one should expect a correspondence between these dimensions and the use of chord material .
For the first dimension , " agency , " such a correspondence can easily be shown to exist .
As we have seen " agency " regards the personal aspects of conversation .
Here three basic acts can be identified : thinking things over in the back of your mind , grounding a decision within your self , and acting on it .
For most popular music these three acts can be equated with the subsequent positions of the subdominant , the tonic and the dominant .
In the songs of the Beatles these chords generally serve the same purpose .
Look , for instance at the simple cadence of the last two lines of the verse of " Hey Jude . "
Here the chords move from subdominant to tonic , onto the dominant and back to the tonic again [ IV -» I -» V -» I ] .
At the same time the Beatles sing : " Remember to let her into your heart , and then you can start to make it better , " following a process of thinking , grounding , acting and grounding again .
It is just one example , but almost any Beatles ' song will show the same pattern concerning the relation between dominant , tonic and subdominant .
To demonstrate the role of the specific chord clusters we have to turn our attention to the other two dimensions ( figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 : Permutations of the tonic in the semantic matrix of conversation
In their songs the Beatles make ample use of the free interplay of basic chords and their relative minors .
For that reason their songs often are called " modal " songs .
An excellent example of their way with these chords can be found in the quoted twelve measures above from " I Want To Hold Your Hand , " where Lennon and McCartney sing the lines : " Yeah , I 'll tell you something , I think you 'll understand .
When I say that something : I want to hold your hand . "
The first part of both sentences is accompanied by Major chords , the last part by relative minors .
Hearing the lyrics , one can easily imagine the boy and the girl walking together outside , but at the same time guarding their own personal universe .
This positions the context of conversation midway between the private and the public .
The dialogue itself moves from the left to the right on the dimension of realization , where our protagonist start saying something neutral , that everyone around them may hear and next addresses his girl friend in a more confidential way , confiding her in his personal feelings .
Also note that the song 's title words get a different meaning , depending on being accompanied by relative minors or Major chords , as in the concluding lines of the verse .
Here the confidential message " I want to hold your hand " turns into an open confession for everybody out there to hear .

Example 2 : I Saw Her Standing There ( verse )
In the Beatles ' songs each of the basic chords can be adorned with added sevenths .
The role of these chords in the matrix of conversation is to create a public , collective context for the song 's words .
The verse of " I Saw Her Standing There , " an early composition of McCartney offers a good illustration ( example 2 ) .
The song 's protagonist is in the public location of a dancing , voicing his admiration amidst the collective of his peers .
His message may be heard by everybody in the public and is phrased in polite wordings .
In this case the words sound cheerful as the sevenths mostly are natural sevenths .
In many of their songs the Beatles play an intricate play with these added sevenths , changing them into other kinds of blue notes as for instance in " I Wanna Be Your Man . "
The context however , always seems the same : public as well as collective .
The most surprising chord in " I Saw Her Standing There , " of course , is the flat - VI , underscoring the exclamation " Ooh ! "
Your browser does not support the audio element .
Example 3 : All My Loving ( verse )
The flat - VI , a real Beatles ' favorite , has often been called the Buddy Holly chord , though Buck Owens also has been honored as the main source of inspiration .
This chord belongs to the cluster of parallel Majors : flat - VI , flat - III and flat - VII — sometimes also referred to as Neapolitan chords .
In the abundance of these chords in the Beatles ' songs Steven Porter ( 1983 : 72 ) finds evidence for a strong Classical influence on the group 's compositions .
He has to admit , however , the flat - VI is behaving quite otherwise — indeed , according to its role in the diagonal grid , as a substitute for the iv .
" All My Loving , " a composition of McCartney , showing a free combination of turnaround and turnback , offers a another good example of these chords , the flat - VII ( example 3 ) .
Just like the flat - VI in " I Saw Her Standing There , " this chord turns the context of the lyrics toward the private side of display and the individual side of realization , thereby making the word " true " coming from deep within , sounding sincere and privately voiced .
Your browser does not support the audio element .
Example 4 : There 's A Place ( bridge )
The next cluster of chords consists of the relative Major chords — the supertonic II , the submediant VI and the mediant III .
These chords supply their own surplus of meaning to the lyrics .
We already observed the supertonic in " I Want To Hold Your Hand " — the first time the Beatles applied this particular chord in their compositions .
In " Eight Days A Week " the Beatles use this same chord more boldly , taking a direct step from the tonic to the supertonic at the start of a song .
For once they were not the first ones to introduce an harmonic novelty .
By a few months they were overtaken by the Rolling Stones ' composition " As Tears Go By . "
For the Beatles the supertonic completed the cluster of relative Major chords .
The Lennon ' composition " There 's A Place " shows how these relative Majors were applied semantically in the Beatles ' songs , underlining an individual utterance , that 's being felt so strong that it escapes from the confines of the private into the openess of the public , for everybody out there to hear ( example 4 ) .

Example 5 : All I Got To Do ( verse )
Our last example , the verse of " All I Got To Do " with its exceptional length of 11 measures , is again a Lennon ' composition ( example 5 ) .
It illustrates the function of parallel minors in locating a semantic position in the matrix of conversation .
In this particular case the work is done by the minor subdominant .
Semantically this chord has the same function as the minor fifth that 's facilitating the modulation in " I Want To Hold Your Hand . "
It is important to notice that these minor chords do not sound sad .
The " sadness " of parallel minor keys is still a standard in music theory .
It does apply to the work of Mahler or Schubert , often referred to in this context .
In the Beatles ' songs — and Pop Rock music in general — another feeling , however , is attached to these chords .
With the parallel Major chords the parallel minors share the location of private space , making utterances sound sincere and deeply felt .
As these minor chords point toward the collective side of realization they give the lyrics a more convinced and determined sound .
7 Giving a voice to youth culture .
Speaking about the compository qualities of Lennon and McCartney , MacDonald ( 1994 : 62 ) writes : " Much of the pair 's musical originality derived from their self - taught willingness to let their fingers discover chord - sequences by exploring the architecture of their guitars rather than following orthodox progressions , of which they knew little . "
To that observation , we now can add another one .
With their harmonic experiments the Beatles created a space for changing the meaning of words and accentuating the grain of voice .
Above we have seen just a few examples .
However , looking at the Beatles ' songs from this perspective , one can easily find more .
It even is difficult to find any exceptions to the rule ( Tillekens , 1998 ) .
The close semantical connection between words and chords certainly is one of the strengths of the Beatles ' compositions .
All our examples date from around the time of " She Loves You . "
This may seem a restriction , as these compositions count as the early songs in the Beatles ' catalogue ( Eerola , 1998 ) .
At the end of 1964 , however , the new musical structure already seemed fully completed .
With the release of " Beatles For Sale " the Beatles ' song repertoire did incorporate all clusters of chords .
The chord sequences themselves did not need the support of conventional cadences .
The Beatles already had shown that their extended diagonal structure could incorporate other styles as well as rock ' n ' roll and rhythm and blues .
They now stood ready to explore their new style of music to its full potential .
The initial sense of freshness of the Beatles ' sound , however , seems correlated to their earlier harmonic experiments and the resulting correspondence between words and chords .
The Beatles ' lyrics , as Cynthia Whissell ( 1996 ) has shown , encompass the whole range of emotions .
In a similar way , we now can add , their chord material covers the whole range of conversational spaces .
Moreover , this is accomplished in a very flexible way as the substitutes of each chord cluster can be addressed almost instantly .
This also may explain why the songs evoked a sense of awakening , as they were articulating and promoting the open and reciprocal idiom of the peer group as a model for civil conversation .
With their songs , in short , the Beatles gave a full voice to youth culture .
It seems fit to conclude this paper quoting Greil Marcus again .
The significance and meaning of Pop Rock music , Marcus ( 1969 : 136 ) wrote , does not lie in the specifics of its lyrics .
Referring to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , he added , the relevance of their songs was that they offered a way to get a feeling for the " spaces we might happen to occupy at any particular time .
Rock ' n ' roll music and a rock ' n ' roll song — a record — keeps those spaces open . "

US exports to Iran have risen dramatically during George Bush 's years in office in spite of his tough rhetoric against Tehran and the imposition of fresh economic sanctions .
Analysis of US government trade figures published yesterday by Associated Press revealed a near tenfold increase in US sales to Iran over the past seven years .
Goods included cigarettes , aircraft spare parts , bras , musical instruments , films , sculpture , fur , golf carts and snowmobiles .
Although the sums involved are small , the disclosure is a political embarrassment for the US , coming at a time when it has been putting pressure on European governments , banks and companies to cut ties with Tehran .
John Rankin , a US treasury spokesman , yesterday acknowledged there had been an increase but attributed this mainly to a change in legislation in 2000 that allowed the export of agricultural and medicinal goods .
Before then trade had been effectively zero .
He played down the exports as " miniscule " amounting to a quarter of 1 % of all Iran 's imports .
AP found data suggesting military equipment had been exported , even though there are sanctions to prevent this .
The Treasury is still investigating but Rankin said initial findings indicated there had been no such sales and described the data as a " clerical error " .
US government figures showed exports to Iran from 2001 to 2007 totalled $ 546 m ( £ 273 m ) .
It exported roughly $ 146 m of goods last year , compared with $ 8.3 m in 2001 , Bush 's first year in office .
The US has had sanctions in place against Iran since the Tehran embassy hostage crisis almost 30 years ago .
During Bush 's presidency , relations with Iran have become increasingly strained , with Washington claiming that Iran has embarked on a programme to build a nuclear weapon , which Tehran denies .
One of the Bush 's administration 's main instruments for putting pressure on Iran has been sanctions .
Yesterday the White House announced fresh financial sanctions against Iranian officials and companies allegedly involved in its nuclear programme .
But Tehran is awash with US goods mainly imported indirectly , usually through the United Arab Emirates .
Karim Sadjadpour , an Iranian specialist at the Washington - based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said : " You can get everything from an iPod to a Chevrolet in Tehran .
I think this is a good thing .
The more the Iranian population is exposed to American culture , which includes American products , the better for Iranian progress . "
The US treasury received at least 4,523 licence applications for Iran exports in the past seven years , of which it approved at least 2,821 and denied only about 178 .
US export records show $ 148,000 worth of weapons and other military gear were exported , including $ 106,635 in rifles and $ 8,760 in rifle parts and accessories shipped in 2004 .
At least $ 13,000 in equipment needed to launch jets from aircraft carriers were also exported .
The treasury suggested yesterday the data had been reported incorrectly by officials .
Rankin denied there was a contradiction between the rise in US exports and calls on Europe to cease trading with Iran .
He said European companies were involved with finance but US exports involved food and medicine .
He said : " Food and medicine are not tools we are going to use to put pressure on the regime . "
Most wanted
US exports to Iran include :
· Cigarettes : $ 158 m ( £ 80 m )
· Commercial aircraft parts : $ 620,000
· Bras : $ 101,000
· Perfume : $ 8,900
· Cosmetics : $ 96,000
· Musical instruments and parts : $ 30,000
· Sculpture : $ 175,000
· Golf carts and snowmobiles : $ 21,000
· Movies : $ 4,000
· Fur : $ 3,300
Congressman subpoenaed for 9/11 trial Weldon asked to testify about what U.S. knew before attacks From Phil Hirschkorn
CNN
A trial begins next week to decide whether Zacarias Moussaoui dies by injection or remains jailed for life .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Capital Punishment September 11 attacks Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Attorneys for al Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui have subpoenaed Pennsylvania Congressman Curt Weldon to testify at a trial that will determine whether Moussaoui should be executed .
The defense is seeking Weldon 's testimony to try and show that the government knew more about the September 11 , 2001 , attacks than Moussaoui did .
It 's a key point the jury will be asked to address at the death penalty trial that begins next week with jury selection .
Weldon , a Republican , received the subpoena last week .
It seeks testimony about issues related to Able Danger , a secret pre-9/11 intelligence operation conducted by the Department of Defense .
What did U.S. know ?
Weldon , vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , contends that Able Danger mined computer data to identify four of the 19 hijackers , including leader Mohammed Atta , as al Qaeda operatives a year and a half before the September 11 attacks .
The 9/11 commission , which rewrote the public 's understanding of the attacks and revealed numerous missed law enforcement opportunities to intercept the hijackers , did not include Able Danger in its final report .
Weldon has spearheaded the call for Congress to hold public hearings on Able Danger and penned a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 248 members of Congress calling on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to permit military analysts who worked on the program to testify .
" It is an important issue in understanding the full scope of 9/11 , " said Weldon 's communications director , John Tomaszewski .
" The venue and the time has not been decided . "
Weldon ' inclined to cooperate ' Weldon is discussing the Moussaoui subpoena with legal counsel .
" The congressman certainly wants to cooperate any time a subpoena is issued , " Tomaszewski said .
" He is inclined to cooperate , but has not made a decision yet . "
Mark Zaid , an attorney for Lt. Col.
Anthony Shaffer , one of the Pentagon analysts who has come forward to support Able Danger 's findings , said Shaffer had not yet received a subpoena .
Moussaoui 's attorneys declined to comment .
The defense has disclosed in court filings it intends to call two expert witnesses , including a former FBI agent , to describe the 19 hijackers and the September 11 plot .
Moussaoui pleaded guilty last year to joining al Qaeda 's terror conspiracy to fly airplanes into landmark buildings ,
But he maintains that he came to the United States in early 2000 for a later plot and was not aware of or involved in the September 11 attacks .
U.S. : Lies led to 3,000 deaths
The government is seeking the death penalty for Moussaoui , saying he contributed to the nearly 3,000 9/11 deaths by lying to FBI agents about what he was doing in the United States after he was arrested in August 2001 .
He was taken into custody after arousing suspicion at a Minnesota flight school .
Jury selection begins on Monday at the federal courthouse in Alexandria , Virginia .
During first part of his death penalty trial , the jury will consider whether Moussaoui was forthcoming about his al Qaeda connections , whether he would have alerted the government to the plot or whether the government already possessed enough clues to stop it .
After a month for jury selection , testimony is scheduled to begin in March .
Moussaoui , a 37 - year - old Arab born to Moroccan parents , will either be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or death by lethal injection .
The government has not disclosed its witness list , but prosecutors intend to call family members to tell representative stories of 45 people killed on September 11 and the impact of losing them .

According to Fidler , Al - Yamamah was 'used , with the help of the British government , as a secret tool of Saudi foreign policy . '
The arrangement , he suggested , 'at least initially , involved a special account controlled by the Saudis at the Bank of England ' -- which received the funds from the sale of Saudi oil .
He went on to say that ' some or all of the payments from the Bank of England account were routed through the UK's Defence Export Services Organisation , part of the Ministry of Defence . '
This certainly raises the suspicion that the arrangement was from the start a kind of joint Saudi - British venture to provide resources for operations -- such as support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan -- where resistance from legislative bodies and within bureaucracies got in the way of what leading policymakers wanted to do .
It seems to however inherently unlikely that Mrs Thatcher -- who has always been very strongly Atlanticist -- would have gone behind the back of leading figures in the Reagan Administration in becoming involved in this kind of activity .
It seems to me however eminently possible she was acting in tandem with the efforts of such figures to circumvent Congress .
The dating is perhaps also worth noting : the letter from King Fahd stating his intent to buy 48 Tornados and 30 Hawk trainers was sent in August 1985 , just as President Reagan was authorising the sale of arms to Iran .
The suggestion by Fidler that 'at least initially ' the arrangement involved this special account controlled by the Saudis seems to imply that arrangements may have changed subsequently .
But I would somewhat surprised if it were simply controlled out of MI6 -- and even if it were , I would tend to suspect that those involved in that organisation were not acting simply on their own behalf , but as part of transnational networks .
Another matter which continues to puzzle me is just how large the ' pots of black money ' involved in Al - Yamamah have been .
Obviously , the fact that monies have been invested with hedge funds -- at a time of historically very investment returns -- means that the total amounts may indeed be very much greater than the amounts the Saudis put in .
However , if one could be reasonably clear about how much was put in , it might be possible at least to get very rough figures for the totals available for under - the - counter operations , using data on investment returns .
According to Fidler , the volume of oil supplied varied , while cash may have been both put in to and taken out of the account -- which would seem to make computation of the net amount the Saudis put in difficult .
' The first oil lifting under the contract [ Fidler writes ] was on January 31 1986 of 1.8 m to 1.9 m barrels .
The Saudis agreed to deliver 300,000 barrels per day [ plus or minus 10 per cent ] for the first three years of the contract .
The amount of oil delivered varied with fluctuating oil prices up to a reported maximum of 600,000 bpd in 1993 , when a new and expanded contract called Al - Yamamah 2 came into force , and fell to 400,000 in 1998 after the last Tornado was delivered .
At times , the kingdom replenished the account with cash - and at other times there was a surplus that was available for distribution . '
Even leaving aside investment returns from hedge funds , it is I think reasonably safe to assume that the difference between what the Saudis paid into Al - Yamamah and what was paid out to BAE is a great deal more than can be accounted for by bribes to Bandar and others .
But I would be interested to know more about the basis on which the 'estimated ( in current dollars ) $ 160 billion in cash ' figure was calculated .
But whatever the precise figures , the whole affair really looks like a can of worms , and I do devoutly hope that that Harper is right in saying ' the action is just beginning . '
The whole things looks like a very important sub -plot in the general story of the subversion of constitutional government , on both sides of the Atlantic , by individuals and groups with an unhealthy fascination with covert operations and a contempt for the constraints on their activities created by democratic systems .

A man in central China has been refused permission to name his son " @ " because it cannot be translated into Mandarin - as the law demands .
According to the Beijing Morning Post , the nomenclative dissident from Zhengzhou argued that the symbol is in common use on keyboards and therefore fair game .
Mercifully for the infant in question , his dad does not live in the kind of fully - fledged democracy where parents can name their children after pretty well anything they want - including software upgrades .
Indeed , regular readers may recall the story of Jon Blake Cusack Version 2.0 - progeny of Jon Blake Cusack and wife Jamie , of Holland , Michigan .
As we noted at the time : " Jon and his wife will certainly be spending many a sleepless night debugging little Jon Blake Cusack Version 2.0 and - in about 16 years ' time - having a very hard time explaining to their unfortunate offspring whose bright idea this was in the first place . "
Still , at least this madness demonstrates that the desire to ruin your child 's life by giving it an amusing moniker is common to cultures world - wide .
We Brits too like nothing more than a good chuckle , as the recent case of newborn Drew Peacock shows . ®

WASHINGTON : An article of impeachment filed against President George W. Bush over the Iraq war will get a committee hearing but not on whether to remove Bush from office .
The House of Representatives voted 238-180 on Tuesday to send to the Judiciary Committee the article of impeachment challenging Bush 's reasoning for taking the country to war .
The same committee buried a previous article filed by Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who also offered the new article .
This time , the panel will open hearings .
House Democrats emphatically said the hearings will not be about Bush 's impeachment , a first step in the Constitution 's process of a removing a president from office .
Instead , the panel will conduct an election - year review , possibly televised , of everything Democrats consider to be Bush 's abuses of power .
Kucinich , a Democrat from Ohio , is likely to testify as are several scholars and administration critics .

Frequently consuming foods containing soy may contribute to memory loss , British experts say .
Experts at England 's Loughborough and Oxford Universities researched the impact of soy consumption in 719 senior citizens on the Indonesian island of Java , the Daily Mail reported Saturday .

Researchers determined people who ate soy at least twice a day had 20 percent less memory function that those who ate it significantly less .
" Soy consumption is on the increase in the West and is often promoted as a ' superfood . '
Soy products are rich in micronutrients called phytoestrogens , but it is not entirely clear what their effect on the aging brain is , " said Professor Eef Hogervorst of Loughborough University .
Hogervorst said vegetarians and elderly women seemed to be highly susceptible to potential memory loss from soy consumption .

Me documents a class monitor election at Evergreen Primary School in Wuhan , China .
It would be hard to argue that the Chinese have n’t the capacity or ability for electoral politics after this short hour .
Indeed , they ’re ducks in water .
The concept is novel .
The third grade class will take part in an election for class monitor , as opposed to the selection that had always occurred .
The candidates have been chosen by the instructors ( free markets did lead to Western style democracy !
Yaaay ! ) and put through the paces of what turns out to be a difficult , brutal and astonishingly mature election season .
If the candidates were chosen specifically for the purpose of a film , it would n’t be surprising .
The key to any good election … or election film , for that matter … is to have compelling candidates who fit certain profiles while belying the traits one expects and then return to home in a roundabout fashion .
The characters typically break down thusly : an autocrat ; a visionary ; and a charlatan .
It would seem that candidate Cheng Cheng fits the first and third categories nicely .
Early on , he espouses the virtue of class monitor in starkly authoritarian terms .
“ The class monitor , ” he reminds us , “ gets to order people around . ”
Cheng Cheng does a good deal of this , both at school and at home .
He is equal parts Dick Cheney , Barack Obama and Eric Cartman .
Even as he begins his dirty tricks campaign against his adversaries – it took about four minutes – Cheng Cheng manages to charm and amaze with a combination of sweeping rhetoric and democratic ideals .
At first , his motivations seem to be the purest of political ones , namely , that he wants the office and could use the control .
As the film progresses , the child displays a personable and complex character .
Few observers will argue early on that he is n’t a winner .
The next candidate , a female , is Xu Xiaofei .
Unlike the two boys , Xu comes from a single parent home .
We quickly see that bare knuckle campaigning just is n’t in her .
Cheng Cheng deploys a sort of primitive Swift Boating during the musical competition , which leaves her in tears .
She is kind and deliberate , not exactly the stuff of Tammany Hall .
The third , and incumbent , candidate is Luo Lei .
Much like Cheng Cheng , the first impression can be misleading .
When discussing campaign strategy with his parents , Luo Lei insists that his compatriots should make their decision freely , and of sound mind .
As the film develops , we learn that Luo defines bearing any burden through a clenched fist .
There is an hilarious scene where both Xu Xiaofei and Cheng Cheng ’s campaign staffers are compiling a list of Luo Lei ’s shortcomings as class monitor .
When Xu Xiaofei ’s emissary gets around to Cheng Cheng himself , he states that a serious flaw in Luo Lei as monitor is that he beats the students too much .
“ We ’ve got that one already , ” she responds , to Cheng Cheng ’s amusement .
In the course of debate , Cheng Cheng asks for a show of hands on who has been beaten by Luo Lei during his tenure as class monitor .
There are quite a few volunteers .
Luo Lei defends himself , as his parents suggested the night before , with very paternalistic reasoning .
“ Sure , I beat you , but only because you misbehave .
If a parent beats his child , is it for no reason ? ” Cheng Cheng responds logically , stating that Luo Lei is a child himself , not an adult , then continues with a rhetorical flourish that eventually renders his opponent speechless .
He has vanquished the more difficult foe , it seems .
A compelling parental subplot is present throughout the film .
Campaigning styles and rhetoric swayed , even dictated , by very involved parents , and the viewer persistently ponders the socioeconomic role in this story .
Chinese family dynamics are introduced , yet not explored in full .
This is forgivable , especially given the runtime .
In a torrent of endearing and amusing juxtapositions , we see the three candidates wistful , exhausted , ready to quit .
It is undeniably similar to the dark eyes and slumped shoulders of adult politicians we ’re accustomed to in news coverage or documentaries .
As the film draws to a close , the viewer has a tangible sense of just how grueling the process has been .
He also comes to terms with the single most effective old - timey campaigning method known to Chinese children as well as French physicians : unfettered bribery .
While the votes are tallied , somewhere , almost imperceptibly , a tear comes to the eye of Ted Stevens .

It is difficult to imagine a more compelling group of people upon whom to focus a film , and it provides twice the belly laughs of Michael Moore in half the time .
Whether intended or not , we see that democracy does n’t necessarily equal freedom .
To the contrary , it can facilitate a superb form of fascism which outright dictatorship is incapable of sustaining .
While the unfettered market Stalinism brought to you by American business and Chinese bureaucracy attains a beachhead in the postmodern world , Westerners can fall prey to platitudes of voting and equality .

It probably was n’t the intent of the film to shine a light on the shortcomings of democracy , yet the message is perfectly delivered .
In the course of delivering its messages , intended and otherwise , Please Vote for Me simultaneously delivers an hour of splendid entertainment and a snapshot of people far less alien than the typical Westerner might imagine .
The film is rumored to be on the Oscar shortlist .
The academy could do far worse .

Palfrey was scheduled to be sentenced in July after a jury in Washington , D.C. found her guilty of money laundering , racketeering and using the mail for illegal purposes in connection with a prostitution ring she ran from 1993 to 2006 .
After spending millions of taxpayer dollars on an investigation and trial , Palfrey was the only person charged in the case by prosecutors .
Several well - known men were reportedly clients of her service .
Former U.S. Agency for International Development chief Randall Tobias and Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , both admitted to being former clients of her escort service .
Neither man was charged nor were they asked to testify at her trial .
" Our government and community should think about the ultimate goal here , " Juhu Thukral , the director of the Sex Workers Project , which engages in legal advocacy for sex workers , told ABCNews.com .
Palfrey left behind two notes , one for her mother and the other for her younger sister .
She tells both women that she loves them very much and that she will be waiting for each of them " on the other side . "
Read Palfrey 's note to her younger sister .
" What did this prosecution accomplish ? " asks Thukral .
" Look at the lives destroyed . "

The world 's first computer mouse did n't make any money for its inventor
It 's nearly 40 years old but one leading research company says the days of the computer mouse are numbered .
A Gartner analyst predicts the demise of the computer mouse in the next three to five years .
Taking over will be so called gestural computer mechanisms like touch screens and facial recognition devices .
" The mouse works fine in the desktop environment but for home entertainment or working on a notebook it 's over , " declared analyst Steve Prentice .
He told BBC News that his prediction is driven by the efforts of consumer electronics firm which are making products with new interactive interfaces inspired by the world of gaming .
Guitar
Hero has been praised for its innovative interfaces " You 've got Panasonic showing forward facing video in the home entertainment environment .
Instead of using a conventional remote control you hold up your hand and it recognises you have done that , " he said .
" It also recognises your face and that you are you and it will display on your TV screen your menu .
You can move your hand to move around and select what you want , " he added .
" Sony and Canon and other video and photographic manufacturers are using face recognition that recognises your face in real time , " he said .
" And it recognises even when you smile . "
" You even have emotive systems where you can wear a headset and control a computer by simply thinking and that 's a device set to hit the market in September . "
" This " Mr Prentice said , " is all about using computer power to do things smarter . "
Greatly exaggerated Naturally enough those in the business of making mice are not wholly in agreement that the end is nigh .
" The death of the mouse is greatly exaggerated , " said Rory Dooley senior vice president and general manager of Logitech 's control devices unit .
Microsoft has said touch screens will be all pervasive Logitech is the world 's biggest manufacturer of mice and keyboards and has sold more than 500 million mice over the last 20 years .
" This just proves how important a device the mouse is , " said Mr Dooley .
But he also agreed that the number of ways people can interact with a computers were rising and that his own company was manufacturing many of them .
" People have been talking about convergence for years , " he said .
" Today 's TV works as a computer and today 's computer works as a TV .
" The devices we use have been modified for our changing lifestyles but it does n't negate the value of the mouse , " Mr Dooley explained .
Popularity
The mouse was invented by Dr Douglas Engelbart while working for the Stanford Research Institute .
He never received any royalties for the invention partly because his patent ran out in 1987 before the PC revolution made the mouse indispensible .
With a 40 year anniversary planned for later in the year , Mr Dooley said Gartner 's prediction for the mouse was too gloomy given that the developing world has still to get online .
The Wii has changed ideas about how we interact with computers " The mouse will be even more popular than it is today as a result , " he suggested .
" Bringing technology , education and information to these parts of the world will be done by accessing web browsers and doing that in the ways that we are familiar with today and that is using a mouse .
" There are around one billion people online but the world 's population is over five billion , " he said .
Gesturing
So just how ready are people to wave their hands in the air or make faces at devices with embedded video readers ?
Gartner 's Mr Prentice says millions are already doing it thanks to machines like Nintendo 's Wii and smartphones like the iPhone .
" With the Wii you point and shake and it vibrates back at you so you have a two - way relationship there .
" The new generation of smart phones like the iPhone all now have tilting mechanisms or you can shake the device to do one or more things .
" Even the multi - touch interface is so much more powerful and flexible than in the past allowing you to zoom in , scroll quickly or contract images . "
For those who lament the demise of such tried and tested pieces of hardware , Mr Prentice did concede that the keyboard was here to stay for the foreseeable future .
" For all its faults , the keyboard will remain the primary text input device , " he said .
" Nothing is easily going to replace it .
But the idea of a keyboard with a mouse as a control interface is the paradigm that I am talking about breaking down . "

What are these ?
Before the United States of America even existed , the people living in this land were oppressed by the rule of a dictator across an ocean who cared not a whit about their desires or opinions .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
The inhabitants of the colonies had repeatedly pleaded for an audience before the King , and were ignored .
As a result , their polite requests gave way to loud demands .
This also failed to impress the arrogant ruler across the sea .
He was known for being stubborn and unbendable , and had proven time and again that he had no intention of changing his mind , even if it would be in his own best interests to do so .
When the shouting failed to influence King George , some colonials decided to add bite to their bark by participating in acts of civil disobedience which included such small showings of protest as the " Boston Tea Party . "
Still the King would not budge , and even increased the restrictions imposed on the " second - class " subjects in the New World .
The United States would be England right now if only the King had set aside his pride and made some small concessions to the colonists .
But he was oblivious to this fact because he lived in his own little bubble where everything was done according to his wishes , and where he surrounded himself with advisors that told him only what he wanted to hear .
So with their patience and forbearance exhausted , the colonists felt they had only one option .
They beat their plowshares into swords and ultimately succeeded in winning their independence .
Today , another King George turns a deaf ear to his subjects ' supplications .
Like his British predecessor , this King George has little interest in the concerns and opinions of the rabble peasants who are sometimes referred to as " the electorate . "
He takes pride in the fact that even when two - thirds of the people living in his own personal fiefdom do not agree with his philosophy or approve of his actions as their leader , that he can " stay the course " in a war that kills and maims the youth of the realm , ironically the most loyal and precious of the King 's subjects , wasted purely for his arrogance .
He misguidedly believes that ignoring the will of the people somehow makes him more virtuous -- not stupidly stubborn , but strikingly stalwart -- and he sees himself as a brave leader who will one day be remembered in the history books as a celebrated hero on a par with Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill , under - appreciated during his reign , but revered in retrospect .
This new King George has reinstituted many of the practices of the old one , such as the denial of the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus , warrantless search and seizure , the suppression of dissent and free speech , and advancing the notion that the Ruler is above the Law .
These wrongs were some of the exact reasons our forefathers warred with Britain .
These rights are the very fabric of American history and heritage , and this King George has essentially ripped that fabric right down the middle .
A Constitutional amendment on flag burning ?
No match or flame could possibly cause as much damage to the ideals that flag stands for as the furious inferno that his tyranny has stoked and released upon the world .
This King George has also surrounded himself with advisors who strive to please him by pretending that he is always right .
He isolates himself in his own little bubble where his word is law and his judgements are unquestioned .
He proudly admits that he does n't watch the news or read the paper .
He delights in arrogantly proclaiming that he could n't care less about public polls or private opinion .
That tends to beg the question : what exactly does he read , and where does he get his news ?
If a person never hears an opinion that is different from his own , how is he to objectively judge the validity of his beliefs ?
Mind - numbing arrogance .
It is always there , it is unmistakable , and it is ugly .
Who would have thought that the " leader of the free world " would appear on television with a middle - schoolish smirk on his face to taunt an enemy by saying , " Bring 'em on " ?
It is evident in every " signing statement " he writes .
It takes a boatload of arrogance to authorize kidnapping and torture , " re-interpret " the Geneva Conventions , operate secret prisons , allow " extraordinary renditions , " prevent the International Red Cross from inspecting prisons and prisoners , refuse to even provide detainees with a reason for their detention , and imprison them without charge for more than half a decade .
This is just a small sampling of the injustices we know about .
Imagine the things he has managed to hide .
This King George has decided that the Constitution is no longer worth protecting .
He has systematically subverted the letter and spirit of the laws and rights set forth in our most important founding document .
He has established " free speech zones " for protesters trying to exercise their first amendment rights at events that he attends .
He has attempted to take control of the courts and the justice system by threats and purges of those whom he does not consider to be sufficiently loyal to him .
His appointees have been chosen for their politics without regard to their competence .
Everything is secondary to his endless quest for expanded executive power .
He has no qualms about doing anything , no matter how base or unlawful , and with no consideration of the consequences .
He sees planning as a hindrance , and exit strategies as an expectation of failure .
He takes credit for victories he had no part in accomplishing , and accepts no responsibility for failures that result directly from his mistakes and flawed judgement .
He is " The Decider , " and he claims there can be only one .
Once again the people have pleaded for the King to hear them .
He has refused to give them an audience .
So the people have raised their voices , loudly demanding to be heard .
Still , he refuses .
The people are now in the beginnings of acts of civil disobedience , their patience and forbearance nearing the point of exhaustion , and if they continue to be ignored they will once again be forced into utilizing the only option left to them - a revolution against an arrogant tyrant who will not listen .
Some say the new King George has forgotten what America is about .
The fact is , he has n't forgotten -
He never believed it in the first place .

Nancy Reagan always had something of an undeserved reputation as a dutiful but meek wife , probably because of the way she looked adoringly at Ronnie whenever they appeared in public together .
But on Friday , Reagan showed that she can still be dutiful while also making it clear how she really feels .
She appeared with McCain and endorsed him with the less - than - exuberant words :
Ronnie and I always waited until everything was decided , and then we endorsed .
Well , obviously this is the nominee of the party .
That ’s all she said during the entire event .
Why the freezer treatment from the former first lady ?
It turns out that Nancy Reagan is good friends with McCain ’s first wife Carol .
You know , the one he cheated on and then dumped ( along with his daughter ) for the much younger , much richer Cindy .
Nancy even hired Carol McCain as a press assistant after Carol was dumped .
In his memoirs , John McCain says :
My divorce from Carol , whom the Reagans loved , caused a change in our relationship .
Nancy … was particularly upset with me and treated me on the few occasions we encountered each other after I came to Congress with a cool correctness that made her displeasure clear .
I had , of course , deserved the change in our relationship .

In fact , when it comes to Iraq , Bush was at his worst when he was humbly deferring to the generals and at his best when he was arrogantly overruling them .
During that period in 2006 and 2007 , Bush stiffed the brass and sided with a band of dissidents : military officers like David Petraeus and Raymond Odierno , senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham , and outside strategists like Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute and Jack Keane , a retired general .
Bush is also a secretive man who listens too much to Dick Cheney .
Well , the uncomfortable fact is that Cheney played an essential role in promoting the surge .
Many of the people who are dubbed bad guys actually got this one right .
The additional fact is that Bush , who made such bad calls early in the war , made a courageous and astute decision in 2006 .
More than a year on , the surge has produced large , if tenuous , gains .
Violence is down sharply .
Daily life has improved .
Iraqi security forces have been given time to become a more effective fighting force .
The Iraqi government is showing signs of strength and even glimmers of impartiality .
Iraq has moved from being a failed state to , as Vali Nasr of the Council on Foreign Relations has put it , merely a fragile one .
The whole episode is a reminder that history is a complicated thing .
The traits that lead to disaster in certain circumstances are the very ones that come in handy in others .
The people who seem so smart at some moments seem incredibly foolish in others .
The cocksure war supporters learned this humbling lesson during the dark days of 2006 .
And now the cocksure surge opponents , drunk on their own vindication , will get to enjoy their season of humility .
They have already gone through the stages of intellectual denial .
First , they simply disbelieved that the surge and the Petraeus strategy was doing any good .
Then they accused people who noticed progress in Iraq of duplicity and derangement .
Then they acknowledged military , but not political , progress .
Lately they have skipped over to the argument that Iraq is progressing so well that the U.S. forces can quickly come home .
But before long , the more honest among the surge opponents will concede that Bush , that supposed dolt , actually got one right .
Some brave souls might even concede that if the U.S. had withdrawn in the depths of the chaos , the world would be in worse shape today .
Life is complicated .
The reason we have democracy is that no one side is right all the time .
The only people who are dangerous are those who ca n’t admit , even to themselves , that obvious fact .

The Long Walk of Nelson Mandela
FRONTLINE profiles the most widely known and revered political leader in the world -- Nelson Mandela .
Credited with the reversal of apartheid in a South Africa controlled by two generations of stern Afrikaner leaders who enforced the ideology of racial separation , Mandela stands as an all - embracing giant who brought about his nation Ìs extraordinary peaceful transformation to democracy .
In the most in - depth film biography of Mandela ever undertaken , the broadcast tells the story of his life through interviews with intimates -- from his most trusted associates to his jailers on Robben Island , the prison where he was held for twenty - seven years .
The two - hour film offers an insider 's account of his extraordinary will to lead and of the great risk and personal sacrifice he endured to achieve democracy and equality for the people of his nation .

The plunge in the price of homes gets worse 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Home prices across the nation tumbled faster than ever in May , according to a closely watched report released Tuesday .
A 10 - city composite index plummeted a record 16.9 percent compared with a year ago , while a 20 - city index fell a record 15.8 percent , according to S&P / Case - Shiller .
Every one of 20 metropolitan regions being tracked posted annual declines , half of them in double digits .
" Prices are still dropping , dropping everywhere and at record rates , " said Patrick Newport , U.S. economist with consulting firm Global Insight in Lexington , Mass .
" I would say what 's happening is a freefall . "
In the San Francisco metropolitan area - which Case - Shiller defines as the counties of Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Francisco and San Mateo - prices fell 22.9 percent in May compared with a year ago .
That made the area the sixth worst - performing region in the country , according to the index , after Las Vegas ( down 28.4 percent ) , Miami ( down 28.3 percent ) , Phoenix ( down 26.5 percent ) , Los Angeles ( down 24.5 percent ) and San Diego ( down 23.2 percent ) .
However , San Francisco area prices are still up 62.7 percent compared with where they stood in January 2000 .
" On a relative total performance basis , San Francisco is still a market that grew quite a lot from the mid-1990s to 2006 ; its prices increased very sharply during that time , " said Maureen Maitland , vice president of index services at Standard & Poor 's in New York , which publishes the index .
" I do n't want to undermine the fact that ...
San Francisco is not doing well ; prices are in sharp decline , but most people who owned a home for five , 10 or 15 years are still in relatively good shape if they want to sell their home today - they just can't sell it for ( as much ) as last year . "
Overall , S&P said , the steepest declines were in markets that had the biggest run-up during the real estate boom .
Case - Shiller , which has been doing its study for about 20 years , is a repeat index :
It measures price changes of the same houses as they are resold .
Unlike reports on median prices , it is not skewed by changes in the type of homes sold .
However , because an increasing portion of homes sold nowadays are bank - owned foreclosures - which are often discounted - some observers have said that Case - Shiller overemphasizes the market 's downside .
Maitland disputed that criticism .
" Our index is supposed to measure the market , " she said .
" If the market happens to be a high - foreclosure market , yes , perhaps the declines are steep , but that 's what 's going on in the market . "
On a month - to - month basis , the 10 - city index was down 1 percent from April to May , while the 20 - city index was down 0.9 percent .
The San Francisco area fell 1.2 percent for the month , a slower decline than the 5 percent decline it clocked from January to February .
In one potential spot of good news , prices in seven regions - Atlanta ; Boston ; Charlotte , N.C. ; Dallas ; Denver ; Minneapolis ; and Portland , Ore. - edged up about 1 percent or less for the month .
S&P cautioned that the normal seasonal uptick in sales may have influenced the slight gains .
" The ( monthly ) rate of decline is slowing ; everyone will keep an eye on it , " Maitland said .
" Whether it 's due to seasonal fluctuation or the beginning of a slowdown ( in depreciation ) , then a turnaround , I ca n't forecast . "
But others are willing to make predictions .
Newport said he thinks the market wo n't bottom out until around fall 2009 , and he would n't be surprised to see the Case - Shiller numbers drop another 15 or 20 percent .
Joel Naroff , president and chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pa. , said he thinks some markets will see a 40 percent decline from their peak to trough , when all is said and done .
" If you think the bottom in home prices is anywhere near , think again , " he wrote in a commentary .
Still , he added , the price declines may carry the seeds of a solution .
" Eventually , people will start realizing that there are good deals out there and sales could bottom , if not start improving , before year 's end . "
Newport from Global Insight said another telling statistic is the nation 's current inventory of unsold homes .
According to a report last week from the National Association of Realtors , there is an 11 - month supply of homes on the market , the highest since 1985 .
A healthy market should have a six - or seven - month inventory , Newport said .
" As long as that inventory number is high , prices will have to continue to drop to bring the inventory down , " he said .
Programmed to kill itself two months ago , Sobig is still alive and well and considered by at least one e-mail security company to be the third most active virus in cyberspace during November .
MessageLabs has reported that about 264,000 copies of Sobig were picked up by its virus - scanning servers , well below the virus ’s peak earlier this year , but still surprising considering the reported September 10 self - shutdown , according to CNET .
The company told CNET Sobig F continues proliferating because of combined factors including successful efforts to keep it from doing even more damage and a lot of infected PCs set to wrong dates .
Sobig F was first spotted in mid-August , spread by e-mail , and disrupted corporate networks massively , while trying to take over computers in a planned denial - of - service round thwarted when compromised servers were taken offline .
MessageLabs told CNET that that might have kept numerous copies of Sobig from terminating themselves .
" The plug was pulled on the target servers before the PCs that were infected by Sobig could download the final bit of code , " principal information security analyst Paul Wood told CNET .
“ Once that file had been downloaded and the PC was at the final stage , they would have stopped propagating more copies of Sobig .
F to avoid anyone spotting the fact that they 'd already been compromised . "
Meaning , he said , infected computers still spread Sobig and do n’t check dates .
The built - in self - termination means most PCs getting copies of the virus now “ should not try to forward it on , ” CNET said , but PCs set to incorrect dates may be the main cause of the virus ’s longevity , especially on home computers whose tiny internal clock batteries have run down and not been replaced .
Okay , so we 've been playing with the Psystar Open Computer for a few hours now , and we 've formed some early impressions and put together a short video of it in action .
We have n't really tried to stress the system yet , but based on our other experiences with OSx86 machines , we 're expecting things to generally go smoothly .
That said , there are some definite rough patches and issues , all mostly having to do with the fact that OS X is n't really built for this hardware .
Here 's what we know so far :
Option # 6 : Play To The Crowd
If you 've tried all of the above and you 're still not getting anywhere , wow - - you 're really terrible at this .
Desperate times call for desperate measures , and let 's face it : you 're desperate .
You know that can of Lightning Bolt you 've been saving for an emergency ?
This is it .
Crack that sucker open -- looks like you 're pulling an all - nighter .
When all else fails , you can always fall back on statistics .
Here 's a doozy for you :
Every time you mention Civil Liberties being trampled in some way , the number of Diggs you will receive increases tenfold .
Try incorporating that theme into your article if possible , even if it has little or nothing to do with it .
Your cat died and you wrote a 400,000 - word poem about him ?
Who 's to say that GEORGE W. BUSH did n't kill him ?
You posted a blog entry about how to bake delicious blueberry muffins ?
Well if the muffins are so delicious , then why is THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO SILENCE YOU ?
Your dad blocked your BitTorrent ?
Do n't you mean COMCAST did it ?
Whatever you 're writing , just keep telling yourself that the government does n't want people to know about it .
Sink into your paranoia like it's a hot bath , and be ready to accuse anyone and anything of attempting to " censor " you .
Claim to have been tased , say you 're a Scientologist and take down your own post , then write passionate diatribes on two different blogs arguing back and forth over the latest Apple product .
It might seem silly while you 're doing it , but trust me :
Hot button issues like these pay serious dividends on Digg .
Why not cash in ?
US National Debt Limit Raised Ahead of Budget Busting Bailout Legislation
With President Bush no longer threatening a veto , the subprime mortgage and Fannie and Freddie “ bailout ” bill is now sailing through Congress .
In anticipation of its enactment , Congress had the foresight to raise the national debt limit to $ 10.6 trillion .
Who says that politicians do n't plan ahead ?
Once signed into law , the budget busting legislation will hand the Administration a blank check to prop up the ailing home lenders .
The ultimate cost is anybody 's guess .
I believe that the price tag will be higher than just about anyone imagines .
Paulson 's Bazooka will be locked and loaded with enough fire power to blow what 's left of our economy into the dustbin of history .
Though the government and Wall Street assure us that these bold moves will save the housing market , and the economy as a whole , from collapse , the reality is that the solution is far worse than the problem .
As painful as the failure of Freddie and Fannie would have been , bailing them out will hurt even more .
In other words , it 's not the disease that will kill us but the cure .
Ironically , while government is rightly criticizing mortgage lenders for ditching lending standards during the boom ( well after the horses had left the barn ) the new law will actually encourage lenders to be even more reckless then before .
By taking all of the risks out of mortgage lending ( provided of course that the loans are conforming ) , the government is telling lenders not to worry about the loans they make , because if borrowers do not repay , the government will .
Since this bailout eliminates all market based deterrents to reckless lending for conforming loans , the only checks remaining will be those imposed by Freddie and Fannie themselves through the criteria they set for those loans .
And although they have taken some steps over the past few months to tighten their minimal “ standards ” , the political agenda behind the bailout will cause this nascent effort to lose steam .
In essence , the government 's main goal is to prop up home prices .
Since American homes are still overvalued given the fundamentals , their prices can only be pushed up with reckless lending and inflation .
As a result of this bailout bill , the share of mortgages owned or insured by Freddie and Fannie will likely swell from near 50 % today to over 80 % within a year or two , turning a $ 5 trillion problem into a $ 10 trillion fiasco .
If the government succeeds in keeping real estate prices propped up , it will only do so at the cost of sending all other prices through the roof .
More likely , real estate prices will continue to decline despite government efforts to levitate them , compounding the problems and the losses .
The grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid .
No government program can alter that fact .
Someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma TVs .
The price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages , all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation .
Nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them .
One way or another , rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset - based , consumption - dependent economy will be finally discredited .
CNBC once nicknamed me “ Dr. Doom ” , but compared to what I see coming now , they should have then called me “ Dr. Sun Shine ” .
Take a look at a presentation I made back in November 2006 , at the Western Regional Mortgage Bankers Conference .
There are eight clips in total , and though the entire presentation is worth watching , most of the real estate comments begin with the 4 th clip .
Click here to watch the video on YouTube .
Every real estate prediction I made at that conference , which was considered outrageous at the time by those in attendance , has already come true .
As confident as I was then about this impending crises , I am even more confident now that the government has just thrown gasoline onto the fire .

Yahoo is due to hold an annual general meeting at the start of August Software giant Microsoft says it would be willing to re-open talks with Yahoo about a possible takeover if the search firm had a new board of directors .
Microsoft had offered to buy its rival 's search business but was rebuffed by Yahoo last month .
A number of investors have criticised Yahoo's decision .
Yahoo shares closed up 12 % at $ 23.91 .
Microsoft said it could start talks with a newly elected board after Yahoo's August shareholder meeting .
' Immediate proposal '
The software giant said in a statement it would be interested in discussing two options - buying the " search function with larger financial guarantees " or " purchasing the whole company " .
Shareholder Carl Icahn is trying to oust Yahoo's board , including the internet firm 's co-founder and chief executive Jerry Yang .
US billionaire Icahn , who has amassed a 5 % stake in Yahoo , has been in talks with Microsoft over the past week about a possible deal .
The corporate raider has said that replacing Yahoo's nine directors at the firm 's annual meeting on 1 August is the only way to salvage a deal with Microsoft .
But Yahoo said the push by Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer and Mr Icahn to force it into selling its search business was not in the best interests of shareholders .
" If Microsoft and Mr Ballmer really want to purchase Yahoo , we again invite them to make a proposal immediately , " Yahoo said in a statement .
This is Microsoft 's clearest message yet that it is willing to strike a fresh deal with Yahoo since takeover attempts collapsed last month .
Microsoft originally offered to buy Yahoo in January - with an offer worth about $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24.1bn ) .
But Mr Ballmer withdrew that bid in May after Yahoo's boss Jerry Yang demanded a higher price .
The software maker then tried to buy Yahoo's search business for $ 1bn and pay another $ 8bn for a stake in its remaining operations .
Yahoo spurned Microsoft , opting for an online advertising partnership with rival Google instead .
That deal is being analysed by US anti-competition officials as the two firms combined would control more than 80 % of the US search advertising market .

Transitions are always tough , and life is nothing if not a series of first days .
Entering new relationships , institutions , or workplaces is fraught with peril as we struggle to learn the boundaries , norms , and expectations of our surroundings .
We must keep up .
We must fit in .
We must - must not ever - show too much of ourselves too fast , and to many - too many - ever .
This week 's haiku go out to all who've practiced the firm handshake and winning smile .
Senator Obama is saying decisively that he does not support private school vouchers , while sticking with his support for incentive pay for teachers based on their students ' performance .
Click Image to Enlarge Chip Somodevilla / Getty Senator Obama greets supporters after addressing a town hall meeting at the gymnasium at Robinson Secondary School July 10 , 2008 at Fairfax County , Virginia .
Mr. Obama made the remarks yesterday in a telecast speech to the American Federation of Teachers ' national convention in Chicago after the union voted overwhelmingly to endorse his presidential bid .
RELATED : Obama and the AFT
The convention will also be the site today of the long - anticipated accession of the New York City union president , Randi Weingarten , to the presidency of the AFT , the national branch of the local United Federation of Teachers .
Ms. Weingarten , who was the only candidate nominated for the national job after the former president announced he would retire , is planning to hold on to her position as UFT president while she steers the national union .
Today will mark her first day as president of both unions .
It will be closely watched , both for any sign that Ms. Weingarten might be taking her eye off the ball in New York , where she is a formidable figure both on education policy and in state and city politics , and for signals of what role Ms. Weingarten will play on the national stage .
Ms. Weingarten 's parents have traveled to Chicago to watch the speech she will deliver this morning .
Both Mr. Obama and Ms. Weingarten have aroused a mix of excitement from those who push for extensive change in public schools and skepticism from traditional union members who oppose the so - called reform policies , such as charter schools and plans to tie teacher pay to student test scores .
In February , Mr. Obama set off concern among some union members when he told a Milwaukee newspaper 's editorial board that he was open to supporting private school vouchers if research showed they work .
His campaign quickly issued a statement that said , " Senator Obama has always been a critic of vouchers , " and Mr. Obama echoed that sentiment yesterday , saying that while he supports charter schools , he opposes private school vouchers .
" We need to focus on fixing and improving our public schools ; not throwing our hands up and walking away from them , " he said .
Mr. Obama also raised concerns when he endorsed the idea of " merit pay " at a convention last year for the other national teachers union , the National Education Association .
In his address to the NEA this year , he acknowledged that the idea " was n't necessarily the most popular part of my speech last year , " but vowed to stand by it , eliciting some boos .
He also stood by the idea in his speech to the AFT convention yesterday , which he made via satellite from San Diego .
" When our educators succeed , I wo n't just talk about how great they are ; I will reward them for it , " Mr. Obama said .
He listed several cases in which districts could give teachers a salary increase , including if they serve as mentors ; if they learn new skills , and if they " consistently excel in the classroom . "
Those at the AFT convention said that no boos followed the remarks , though some union members later said they were concerned by them .
" That was the one statement that raised our eyebrows , " the president of the AFT 's Los Angeles chapter , A.J. Duffy , said yesterday .
" Our question is what does that mean , ' who consistently do well in classrooms , ' and based upon whose guidelines ?
Is it a principal , a test score ?
We 're going to continue to have dialogue with him . "
Other AFT members said they were offended that Mr. Obama did not make his speech live in Chicago , his hometown .
In a change from the practice of some previous Democratic presidential candidates , Mr. Obama also delivered his remarks to the NEA via satellite .
The executive director of the lobbying group Democrats for Education Reform , Joseph Williams , characterized that decision as a " Velvet Snub " indicative of Mr. Obama 's willingness not to become owned by special interest groups , addressing them as if across a protective velvet rope .
In her tenure as New York City union president , Ms. Weingarten 's work starting two charter schools and her collaboration with the Bloomberg administration on a performance - based pay plan have won her a similar mix of skeptics and boosters .
Mr. Duffy said some Los Angeles teachers are concerned about Ms. Weingarten , though he supports her .
A New York City teacher who is attending the Chicago convention and is a member of a group that has opposed some of Ms. Weingarten 's ideas , Lisa North , said that in Chicago she is hearing from many union members across the country who are skeptical about policies such as charter schools .
" There are AFT members that would like to see the AFT helping organize teachers to fight the privatization , the high - stakes testing , and No Child Left Behind , " Ms. North said .
Reg Weaver , the president of the NEA , which is seen as more stringent than the AFT in its opposition to such policies , would not say whether there are any differences between his positions and Ms. Weingarten's .
He added : " I think she 's good , has been good , and will be great . "
The candidates for the General Election are set .
Iraq continues to be a major concern of voters , with polls showing that 25 % to 30 % count it as a top concern , ranking second only to the economy .
A growing majority of Americans want to see the U.S. out of Iraq .
Senator Obama won the Democratic nomination last week .
Senator McCain will be the Republican nominee .
Ralph Nader is moving forward with his independent campaign getting on ballots throughout the country .
The Libertarians have nominated former Congressman Bob Barr as their standard bearer .
And , former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney has a majority of delegates for the Green Party which holds its convention from July 10th to13th in Chicago .
Where does Iraq fit in with the General Election ?
The candidates will continue to make Iraq an issue to differentiate themselves and the public will continue to be focused on it .
On both Iraq and Iran , the voters are more progressive than either McCain or Obama ; they want the Iraq war ended and the military option removed from dealing with Iran .
Neither candidate goes that far on either issue .
Senator McCain is clearly the most aggressive in pursing “ victory ” in Iraq .
In an honest moment , he said he would not mind if U.S. troops stayed in Iraq for 100 years , comparing it to Korea where U.S. forces have continued presence .
Of course , Korea was , at best , a war the U.S. fought to a draw — some would say a defeat — and the troops in Korea have not prevented North Korea from becoming a nuclear power .
He has been trying to back away from that comment for months now giving a speech where he declared , “ I hate war . ”
In another speech , he promised to win the war during his first term .
But McCain has been consistently wrong about the Iraq war since before the invasion when he was memorably a cheerleader for the war .
Among McCain ’s wrong statements are : “ Saddam Hussein is on a crash course to construct a nuclear weapon , ” “ I believe … that the Iraqi people will greet us as liberators , ” “ this conflict is … going to be relatively short , ” “ only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war , ” “ We can know fairly well [ whether the surge is working ] in a few months , ” and six months later , “ the next six months are going to be critical . ”
He ’s been an advocate of the use of military force against Iran without negotiating with them , and he wants to expand the U.S. military — which is already more costly than the rest of the world ’s military spending combined .
McCain seems more likely to get the U.S. into a war with Iran than out of the war with Iraq .
In addition , he has not been an advocate for adequate veteran ’s benefits .
For a review of McCain ’s policies : click here .
Next to an aggressive militarist like McCain , Obama looks like a peacenik ; make no mistake — he ’s not .
Obama has said two things that are very important to the peace movement .
First , he does not only want to end the war but “ end the mindset that got us into the war . ”
Now , he said that very early in the campaign during a January debate and has not repeated it during the campaign , but that is the standard the peace movement should hold him to — end the cause of war .
And second , he said that change will only come if the people are organized and demand it .
This is an invitation to the peace movement to pressure him .
He responds to pressure as can be seen by many of his positions .
There are many things for peace advocates to be concerned about regarding Obama .
He has said he admires the foreign policy of Reagan , Bush I and JFK — all strong militarists .
Obama also wants to expand the U.S. military by 92,000 additional soldiers , and he pledged to the right - wing Israeli lobby that he will always keep the military option .
While Obama gets loud applause when he pledges to begin to end the war in 2009 , the details of his withdrawal plan show an ongoing war , not an end to war .
Obama has said he will remove “ combat ” troops , saying that it may mean putting them somewhere else in the region like Kuwait where they can serve as a strike force in Iraq .
As to non-combat troops , advisors have estimated between 35,000 to 80,000 remaining behind to protect U.S. interests , fight al Qaeda and train the Iraqi military .
And , when asked about the private security forces like Blackwater , fairly labeled mercenaries by some , he said he would leave all 140,000 of them in Iraq .
Thus , Obama ’s withdrawal plan leaves 175,000 to 220,000 troops and mercenaries in Iraq , threatens to expand the war to other nations by putting combat forces in Kuwait and he keeps the bombing of Iran on the table .
Obama , unlike McCain , has said he would negotiate with Iran before using military force but both have been exaggerating its nuclear capability .
Obama ’s campaign recently released a detailed position statement on Iraq : click here .
Americans got to see the similarities between senators Obama and McCain when they both spoke to the right - wing Israeli lobby last week .
( Obama speech , McCain speech . )
Indeed both the Washington Post and LA Times editorialized about the similarities between McCain and Obama .
While there are some differences they both pledge not only complete fealty to Israel , but also a continued effort to build the Israeli military while maintaining U.S. military policy in support of Israel .
Furthermore , Obama gave virtually no criticism of the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands .
Ralph Nader put out a critique of Obama and McCain , McKinney has also been critical of the Israeli lobby and the U.S. ’s blind support for Israel .
The only spark of debate has been over whether the U.S. should talk to its adversaries .
But even on this issue , Obama has changed his position and McCain , according to senate colleagues , is also likely to talk to adversarial nations .
When it comes to Iran , both candidates are threatening a military attack as an option .
The three non-duopoly candidates , Barr , McKinney and Nader , are all calling for a rapid end to the Iraq occupation — a position more aligned with the views of a majority of Americans .
If any of them gain steam , it could pull the two establishment party candidates toward the view of the American people .
Nader and McKinney have been opposed to the military attack on Iraq since before the war began .
Both have also spoken at anti-war rallies and worked to end the occupation for the last five years .
Barr takes a non-interventionist view of foreign policy , but favors a strong military .
He is not as clear about how quickly he would get out of Iraq .
Nader and McKinney both described the military budget as bloated and are calling for less military spending .
Where does U.S. militarism fit into the General Election ?
The military has become much larger and more deeply embedded throughout the federal government .
Neither of the establishment party candidates is calling for shrinking the U.S. military ; indeed , both are calling for expanding the military with tens of thousands of more troops .
Obama is calling for 92,000 additional troops , while McCain wants even more .
The three insurgent candidates are calling for reductions .
All three oppose the U.S. having 700 military bases around the world .
Nader and McKinney are calling for dramatic reductions of the military budget .
Once again , they will be able to pressure Obama and McCain if they start to get some traction .
What can peace advocates do ?
Your vote may not be the most important action .
Indeed , it is predictable where the Electoral College votes for approximately 39 states are going now .
So , no matter whom you are planning to vote for take action today .
Write to all the candidates .
Urge them to end the occupation of Iraq , stop threatening Iran with military attack and prevent future wars of aggression .
Tell them it is time to invest in the civilian economy by rebuilding U.S. infrastructure , responding to climate change , providing for the basic necessities of the American people and to reduce the investment in the military economy .
The candidates need to hear from you .
The consumer spending slump and tightening credit markets are unleashing a widening wave of bankruptcies in American retailing , prompting thousands of store closings that are expected to remake suburban malls and downtown shopping districts across the country .
Since last fall , eight mostly midsize chains  as diverse as the furniture store Levitz and the electronics seller Sharper Image  have filed for bankruptcy protection as they staggered under mounting debt and declining sales .
But the troubles are quickly spreading to bigger national companies , like Linens ‘n Things , the bedding and furniture retailer with 500 stores in 47 states .
It may file for bankruptcy as early as this week , according to people briefed on the matter .
Even retailers that can avoid bankruptcy are shutting down stores to preserve cash through what could be a long economic downturn .
Over the next year , Foot Locker said it would close 140 stores , Ann Taylor will start to shutter 117 , and the jeweler Zales will close 100 .
New questions have emerged about whether long - term use of bone - building drugs for osteoporosis may actually lead to weaker bones in a small number of people who use them .
The concern rises mainly from a series of case reports showing a rare type of leg fracture that shears straight across the upper thighbone after little or no trauma .
Fractures in this sturdy part of the bone typically result from car accidents , or in the elderly and frail .
But the case reports show the unusual fracture pattern in people who have used bone - building drugs called bisphosphonates for five years or more .
Some patients have reported that after weeks or months of unexplained aching , their thighbones simply snapped while they were walking or standing .
“ Many of these women will tell you they thought the bone broke before they hit the ground , ” said Dr. Dean G. Lorich , associate director of orthopedic trauma surgery at NewYork - Presbyterian / Weill Cornell and the Hospital for Special Surgery .
Dr. Lorich and his colleagues published a study in The Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma last month reporting on 20 patients with the fracture .
Nineteen had been using the bone drug Fosamax for an average of 6.9 years .
On Tuesday , four Democratic senators called for Stephen Johnson to resign as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey to begin an investigation into whether he lied in testimony to a Senate committee , the AP reports .
The senators , all members of the Environment and Public Works Committee , said Johnson — the first career scientist to head the EPA — had repeatedly succumbed to political pressure on decisions vital to protecting health and the environment .
“ We have lost all confidence in Stephen Johnson ’s ability to carry out EPA ’s mission under the law , ” Environment Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer , D - Calif . , told reporters .
Boxer was joined by Sen. Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn. , Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D - R.I. , and Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D - N.J. , in calling for Johnson ’s resignation .
They said Johnson should step down because he has ignored the advice of the agency ’s own scientists on the regulation of numerous air pollutants and stonewalled congressional oversight .
In a letter the senators sent to Mukasey on Tuesday , they also allege that Johnson made false statements before the committee in January when he said that he alone had decided California should not regulate the gases blamed for global warming from motor vehicles .
Johnson came under investigation for allowing the White House to improperly interfere with the decision to grant California a waiver to limit greenhouse gases .
The investigation began when a former top EPA official told the committee earlier this month that the administrator initially decided to grant a partial waiver to the state , but later changed his mind under pressure from the White House .
Johnson has refused to comment on his talks with the White House , ignored subpoenas for relevant documents , and most recently , put a gag order on all EPA staffers to prevent them talking with investigators or the press .
Oklahoma Sen. James
Inhofe , the environment committee ’s top Republican , issued a brief rebuttal Tuesday , saying , “ This is simply more election year politicking .
Nothing more need be said . ”

The red planet was once awash in water , say scientists – not boiling water , but benign seas that may have been suitable for life .
" There was apparently pervasive water present during the first 600 to 700 million years , " said Brown University geologist John Mustard , co-author of a paper scheduled to be published today in Nature .
Mustard 's team studied data returned by the Compact Reconnaisance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars , an instrument designed to find traces of minerals that interact with water .
Earlier studies have found evidence of ancient gushers , and the Mars Phoenix Lander recently found ice .
But Mustard 's analysis provides the clearest picture yet of planet - wide hydrological impacts – and , most tantalizingly , CRISM showed widespread deposits of clay - like minerals that form only at relatively low temperatures .
Ancient Martian oceans may have been salty , but at least they were n't boiling .
And perhaps , said Mustard , they were n't dead .
" I think the prospects for present life were dim , but for past life , during this habitable era , they were really quite good , " he said .
As for whether evidence of life will remain after four billion years , Mustard said that " it 's probably better - preserved on Mars than on the Earth , where plate tectonics has recycled the crust . "
He continued , " On Mars , many more elements from that early history are still present .
And we do think whiffs of life are preserved in the Earth record , so I think Mars stands a good chance of preserving signatures , if they ever existed . "

To get TOD Canada rolling again , I 've written a refresher on Canada 's energy situation .
Canada can't be ignored when it comes to energy .
We are a land of plenty .
Lots of land , lots of weather , lots of consumption , lots of production .
Plenty can easily become scarce though and it has to be managed , and managed well .
Management of our resources will be Canada 's challenge in the years ahead .
Unmanaged , Canada 's energy consumption is close to the highest in the world and stands at 350 GJ / person , slightly more than in the U.S. and Canada 's energy intensity is the worst in the G7 at 10.6 MJ per unit GDP .
Ben is completing his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in Canada .
His research focuses on the fine details of solid oxide fuel cells , dealing with ceramics and long equations .
He attributes his initial interest in energy to the documentary " The End of Suburbia , " which he first saw about 4 years ago .
Since then he has felt a duty to get the good word out .
Ben has been the host of the Watt Podcast talking about various energy issues , a capacity we are exploring bringing the TOD .
Welcome Ben !
Ed note from PG : I am happy to announce that TOD : C is up and running again ( and I believe overdue thanks are in order to Stoneleigh and Ilargi , now over at The Automatic Earth , for their efforts here ) .
One of the new editors is benk ( and I believe you already know Khebab ! ) .
It 's wrong to average Canada 's energy situation though .
Even neighboring provinces have vastly different stances : British Columbia has implemented North America 's first consumer based carbon tax and is joining the Western Climate Initiative 's cap - and - trade system while Alberta 's Premier is still talking about bird kills by wind turbines .
On the East Coast , New Brunswick has the largest Canadian refinery ( 288,400 bpd capacity ) producing 45 % of all U.S. reformulated gasoline imports , is building a new LNG terminal and has plans to become an energy hub for the Eastern U.S. by building a second 300,000 bpd refinery and a second nuclear reactor , both to be used exclusively for export to the US .
Energy exports are a huge part of Canada 's economy , accounting for 20 % ( $ 90 billion ) of Canada 's total exports in 2007 .
From the federal perspective , Canada 's government has publicly stated that they are positioning Canada as a " reliable energy superpower " .
This is the closest we have to a national energy policy .
The wording here is important :
By definition , energy superpower implies at least two things : 1 ) multiple customers 2 ) willingness to use energy supply as a negotiation tactic .
As far as energy superpowers are concerned , Canada still has a long way to go .
Multiple customers are difficult to come by for a country with a single border .
As far as " reliable energy superpowers " are concernerd , I recon Canada 's just about there , we have no choice but to be reliable .
That being said , Canada is slowly gaining courage with respect to criteria # 2 of an energy superpower :
Our trade minister , David Emerson , recently suggested that he 's willing to use the energy card after Hilary Clinton 's and Barack Obama 's talk of renegotiating NAFTA , Emerson let this out :
" Knowledgeable observers would have to take note of the fact that we are the largest supplier of energy to the U.S. and NAFTA has been the foundation for integrating the North American energy market , " said Emerson .
So , what can Canada offer ?
Canada 's credentials :
Having energy resources is n't enough to be an energy superpower .
Those resources have to be exported .
The National Energy Board just released the Canadian Energy Overview 2007 .
From that document , I 've put together a graph of Canada 's average 2007 energy exports to the US :
Note :
Here I assume all types of oil to have the same energy content
Even 30 TWh / year of electricity can be significant to small parts of North Eastern United States but obviously Canada 's role as an energy supplier to the US is most important through natural gas and oil exports .
The future of natural gas in Canada has been discussed on TOD before as well as Canada 's tar sands .
What makes Canada 's energy situation so fascinating is the coupling between energy sources .
In the table below , I 've ranked Canada 's energy resources against the rest of the world and compared them with Russia 's ( a real energy superpower ) using the latest stats from the BP Statistical review .
It sheds some light on Canada 's true situation :
Canada 's Rank Russia 's Rank Oil Reserves 2 or 12 * 7 Oil Production 7 2 Oil Consumption 8 4 Oil Exports 14 2 Natural Gas Reserves 21 1 Natural Gas Production 3 1 Natural Gas Consumption 4 2 Natural Gas Exports 2 1 Coal Reserves 13 2 Coal Production 15 5 Coal Consumption 14 5 Coal Exports 17 5 Uranium Reserves ** 2 10 Uranium Production ** 1 -
* BP Statistical Review only considers Canada 's oil sands reserves to be those currently under development .
Governments do n't .
** Src : World Nuclear Association
Alone , Canada 's energy resources , other than oil and uranium reserves , do n't look to be particularly impressive .
A large part of Canada 's success as an energy superpower though is its ability to develop its resources .
At any cost .
My first observation after compiling the above table was that Canada ranks 21st in the world in terms of natural gas reserves , but production , consumption and exports all rank in the top 4 .
Here lies the energy coupling challenge :
In order to exploit our oil reserves , of which we have a lot , we are further depleting our natural gas reserves , of which we have few .
For each barrel of synthetic crude coming out of Canada from strip mining , 28 cubic meters of natural gas is used ( this source claims 14 - 28 cubic meters ) .
This means America is sacrificing roughly 1.14 % of it 's natural gas supply to import synthetic crude oil .
For Canada though , converting NG into oil is economically a no brainer : at $ 125 / bbl , we get $ 22 / GJ for oil compared with the current going rate of $ 11 / GJ for natural gas .
Alternative methods like the nuclear option for upgrading bitumen do exist .
In March , Bruce Power Alberta filed an application for a 4GW nuclear reactor for the tar sands , but if it goes through , would only come on - line by 2017 .
To conclude , Canada is the most important energy supplier to the US .
Canada has ambitions to become an energy superpower , which means that finding a second customer is likely a priority .
But Canada 's natural gas could quickly become a rate determining step in these ambitions and so resource management is the challenge that Canada will have to address if it is truly going to become a reliable energy superpower .
If the US bails out Fannie Mae bonds as suggested in We 're All Homeowners Now , Nationalization of Fannie , Freddie Unavoidable , inquiring mind just might be wondering " Who is the biggest beneficiary ? " .
It 's a good question too .
Please consider Chinese Government is Top Foreign Holder of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac Bonds .
As politicians call for taxpayer bailouts and a government takeover of troubled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , FreedomWorks would like to point out that a bailout is a transfer of possibly hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars to sophisticated investors and governments overseas .
The top five foreign holders of Freddie and Fannie long - term debt are China , Japan , the Cayman Islands , Luxembourg , and Belgium .
In total foreign investors hold over $ 1.3 trillion in these agency bonds , according to the U.S. Treasury 's most recent " Report on Foreign Portfolio Holdings of U.S. Securities . "
FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe commented , " The prospectus for every GSE bond clearly states that it is not backed by the United States government .
That 's why investors holding agency bonds already receive a significant risk premium over Treasuries . "
" A bailout at this stage would be the worst possible outcome for American taxpayers and mortgage holders , who have been paying a risk premium to these foreign investors .
It would change the rules of the game retroactively and would directly subsidize the risks taken by sophisticated foreign investors . "
" A bailout of GSE bondholders would be perhaps the greatest taxpayer rip - off in American history .
It is bad economics and you can be sure it is terrible politics . "

If I could only share one piece of personal finance advice to grads or to just about anyone , it would be this :
Only borrow money to pay for things that increase in value .
It ’s a short list : your business , your house and your education , mostly .
Stocks if you ’re smarter than me .
That ’s pretty much it .
If you have credit card debt , you ’re in big trouble .
Your bank account has a huge leak in it , and it ’s getting worse .
Hence the urgency .
If you have credit card debt , that means that every time you spend money ( even cash ) , you ’re borrowing money to do so .
And so , if you ’re going out to dinner or buying a new pair of shoes , you ’ve just broken the single most important rule of personal finance .
You ’re spending borrowed money on stuff that is decreasing in value .
This is an emergency .
It ’s an emergency because every single day you wait , the problem gets worse .
A lot worse .
My suggestion :
Go to defcon 1 , and do it immediately .
Shift gears to live well below your means .
That means :
No restaurants
No clothes shopping
No cable TV bill
No Starbucks
It means :
Take in a tenant in your spare bedroom
Carpool to work
Skip vacation this year
Eat brown rice and beans every night for dinner .
Act like you have virtually no income .
The result ?
You ’ll save $ 5,000 to $ 20,000 a year .
Send all of it to the credit card company .
Do this until you ’re debt free , the faster the better .
There .
Now you ’re rich .
Now you get interest on your savings instead of paying the bank .
Twenty years from now , this emergency action will translate into perhaps a million dollars in the bank , depending on how much you earn and how serious you are .
You can thank me then .
How long is 13,000 hours ?
541 days is the answer .
One year and a half .
That ’s how long we can leave a Pa - Look Ball Premium Q ( quick ) compact fluorescent light bulb on , before it burns out .
It ’s the industry ’s first “ hybrid lighting method ” , meaning it has instant brightness .
The bulb is an energy - efficient and environmentally - friendly choice for homes and companies .
Until now , the big drawback was how long it took for them to brighten up completely .
No more !
“ Panasonic said it has successfully developed the “ hybrid lighting method ” by installing a newly - developed compact “ quick lamp ” in the center of the spiral arc tube structure inside the pear - shaped Premium Q fluorescent light capsules .
The “ quick lamp ” allows the bulb to obtain 60 % of full brightness within the first second after it is turned on , which is 50 % faster than current Pa-Look Ball Premium bulbs and stands as the industry ’s quickest ramp - up time .
” – JapanToday
The bulb also has a built in timer that turns off the quick lamp once there is enough brightness .
With a consumption of just 10 watts , the bulb produces the equivalent of 54 - watt incandescent bulbs , cutting electric bills and CO2 emissions by 80 % .
Yeah , and it can be switched on and off 40,000 times before it will say , “ Will you stop doing that ! ? ”
Kaspersky Labs Trying to Crack 1024 - bit RSA
I can’t figure this story out .
Kaspersky Lab is launching an international distributed effort to crack a 1024 - bit RSA key used by the Gpcode Virus .
From their website :
We estimate it would take around 15 million modern computers , running for about a year , to crack such a key .
What are they smoking at Kaspersky ?
We ’ve never factored a 1024 - bit number — at least , not outside any secret government agency — and it ’s likely to require a lot more than 15 million computer years of work .
The current factoring record is a 1023 - bit number , but it was a special number that ’s easier to factor than a product - of - two - primes number used in RSA .
Breaking that Gpcode key will take a lot more mathematical prowess than you can reasonably expect to find by asking nicely on the Internet .
You ’ve got to understand the current best mathematical and computational optimizations of the Number Field Sieve , and cleverly distribute the parts that can be distributed .
You ca n’t just post the products and hope for the best .
Is this just a way for Kaspersky to generate itself some nice press , or are they confused in Moscow ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/15 ) : Kaspersky < a href=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11523″>now says :
The company clarified , however , that it ’s more interested in getting help in finding flaws in the encryption implementation .
“ We are not trying to crack the key , ” Roel Schouwenberg , senior antivirus researcher with Kaspersky Lab , told Security Focus .
“ We want to see collectively whether there are implementation errors , so we can do what we did with previous versions and find a mistake to help us find the key . ”
Schouwenberg agrees that , if no implementation flaw is found , searching for the decryption key using brute - force computing power is unlikely to work .
“ Clarified ” is overly kind .
There was nothing confusing about Kaspersky ’s post that needed clarification , and what they ’re saying now completely contradicts what they did post .
Seems to me like they ’re trying to pretend it never happened .

Fifteen years ago , you almost could n't give a condo away .
Now some people line up overnight to buy them .
Partly that 's because of a housing market so hot that getting your foot in the proverbial door no longer means a derelict semi , but a pint - sized condo .
But another reason is the condo lifestyle , which has become an entrenched part of city life and has also altered the way the city looks .
While experts say the first - time buyers represent the majority of the condo market , and empty nesters looking to downsize from large homes comprise most of the rest , there 's an emergent group on the hunt for bigger units and they 're coming from surprising quarters .
Some existing condo dwellers , smitten by both the building amenities and what the surrounding vibrant neighbourhood has to offer , are ``upsizing '' when equity permits , or to accommodate an expanding household .
And there are those weary from long commutes trading high - maintenance suburban homes for condos in neighbourhoods that having been building character for decades .
" People need more than a job and a house , " says Paolo Palamara , co-president of Diamante Corporation .
" It 's not right to have to drive for a cumulative time of 13 weeks a year to and from work .
Why bother with a backyard and a pool when you 're not there ? "
Nick Rossi is a good example of this trend .
Although he initially worried about downsizing his family from a four - bedroom home in Brampton to their 1,000 - square - foot City Place investment condo , life close to theatre , restaurants and the Air Canada Centre is sweet .
His 20 - year - old son is close to university , the lake is five minutes away , and the building has 30,000 square feet of exercise equipment , swimming pool , sauna , billiards , and a movie theatre .
Other recent acolytes to the condo life are young families , drawn to the growing number of services in the downtown core .
Architect Sybil Wa , for example , started out with her husband , Adam Parkin , a corporate banker , in a studio - sized condo near the St. Lawrence Market .
With the birth of each of their two children , instead of answering the siren call of more bedrooms and a yard , they stayed in the same building but moved up in size .
" The No. 1 reason why we live downtown , " Wa says , " is for more time with the family .
We both work in the downtown core , our children are in daycare , and without commuting , we 're home with them quickly . "
They 're also close to some desirable natural amenities .
" Centre Island is my backyard , " says Wa .
Being able to walk to the park , shops , movie theatres , St Lawrence market fits with her belief in sustainability – higher densities in the core mean less load on arable land .
" It just feels more responsible to give up the car .
In the suburbs , you drive where you need to go , here we walk . "
But there are challenges to condo life , too .
Palamara has talked to many potential Diamante condo buyers who are skeptical of being able to live properly in constrained condo space .
" One family from Richmond Hill came with a whole list of areas they thought they needed .
They could n't believe it when we pared down the necessary space to 500 square feet .
It 's about how you live in the space , and I challenge anybody to go through their home and see what occupies each room , and then see how much you could get rid of . "
Smaller spaces mean less consumption .
As Wa says , " we do n't need a year 's worth of dental floss so we do n't need the storage . "
That , in turn , has led to a more communal approach to living .
" We share things with others in the building – a vacuum , a child 's slide , even a car .
The storage issue has made us think before buying – do we need it ?
Can we borrow it ? "
Wa says .
It 's a way of thinking which flies in the face of the myth that condo life is isolating and anonymous .
In fact , Wa has become a connection point amongst the families who live in her building , which contains between 550 and 600 units .
About 30 families and 35 children are on site , she estimates .
" Five years ago , we were a fringe group in the eyes of neighbours and management , a kind of foreigner in the vertical condo culture .
Now we 're the heart of it . "
What did it was Halloween , five years ago , Wa organized trick or treating for the families , designing door signs for a list of participating units so others would n't be bothered .
She now has childless residents demanding to be part of that list .
Staying in the same building has n't been easy , though .
Getting a sandbox on one of the common area terraces , and garnering permission for children under 18 to use some of the amenities took several months of lobbying .
Now , for instance , parents can work out in the gym while their child sleeps there in the stroller .

But the challenge is space .
Once child two came along , the two - bedroom 1,300 - square - foot unit no longer worked as well .
Determined not to move ,
Wa reconfigured the interior and created three bedrooms to allow each child their own , albeit tiny , space .
The cost of a family size three - bedroom is prohibitive .
" We looked around at different condos in our community , but there was nothing , '' says Wa .
" Larger units are usually on higher floors , are considered luxury , and much more expensive . "
Many families come and go , Wa says , because " three bedrooms is the deal breaker .
They love the building and the community and do n't want to move , but their family has grown and they need to have a bigger space .
It 's tough to find a unit with a third bedroom and still be affordable . "
Even though real estate marketing consultant Barry Lyon believes Toronto is affordable compared to other big cities , he admits there 's an ongoing " affordable question " for families .
" They need more bedrooms , and that means more space , and highrise buildings are expensive to produce – more than double the cost as the equivalent space in single family .
That means you lose affordability for young families .
I do n't want to see people moving out beyond 905 to raise their children , because I love the urban lifestyle . "
He points to the city 's " shoulder areas , " where growth has resulted in intensified suburban downtowns like Mississauga , Brampton , Richmond Hill , Markham .
" Because they 're an answer to the commuting problem , they 're thriving , with restaurants , shops , theatres , and they 're good opportunities for families . "
But Wa and her husband want to stay downtown near their work .
Other families feel the same and are finding a way to deal with it .
It 's becoming more common in the building to see families with two children , and one is about to have a third .
But her concern about the pressures of keeping families in condos has led to organizing the Urban Family Workshop .
Some time in June , Wa hopes to bring downtown condo- dwelling families together with planners , developers and architects to discuss what families need to keep them in the city .
There already is some demonstrated political will .
In a previous interview with the Star , City Councillor Adam Vaughan ( Trinity - Spadina ) said he has persuaded developers launching new projects in his riding to build 10 per cent of units as three - bedrooms .
" Architects and designers are coming up with really flexible ways to build buildings so they can adapt to demographic changes to the life cycle , '' he says .
`` It 's been pretty positive . ''
Lyon believes there is a place for government to step in and help create more affordable downtown options for families .
While the " affluent market can take care of itself , " Lyon said in a seminar at the 2008 Interior Design show , " what makes Toronto work is that we 're relatively affordable . "
That 's possible for the lower end of the market – which families often fall under – with initiatives like Toronto Community Housing Corporation 's ( TCHC ) projects in Regent Park and West Donlands and the Railway lands near Fort York , all in various stages of development .

DAMADOLA , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan publicly slit the throats of two Afghans on Friday after they were accused of spying for U.S. forces suspected of launching a missile strike in May .
The two men , one of them a former Taliban fighter , were brought blindfolded before a crowd of several thousand people near the village of Damadola in the Bajaur region on the Afghan border before they were executed .
“ They were spies .
Whoever spies for the Americans will meet the same fate , ” Qari Zia - ur - Rehman , a Taliban leader in the area , told the crowd before another man slit the throats of the two with a sword .
The crowd shouted Allahu Akbar ( God is Greatest ) when the Taliban held up the severed heads of the victims who Rehman said were from the eastern Afghan province of Kunar .
Bajaur is one of Pakistan ’s seven border regions dominated by ethnic Pashtun tribes and a hotbed of support for the Taliban and al Qaeda .
After the killings , shooting broke out in the crowd but it was not clear why .
Two people were killed and seven wounded .
Rehman said the two Afghans had spied for U.S. forces who the militants believed were responsible for a missile strike on a house in Damadola in May in which 18 people , including foreign militants , were killed .
Two missiles were apparently fired by U.S. drones and a government official said at the time the strike had apparently targeted a mid-level , Arab al Qaeda member , who had been killed .
Islamist militants have killed scores of people in the tribal belt on the Afghan border on suspicion of spying for U.S. forces in Afghanistan but public executions have been rare .
Two key pledges made by the George W. Bush administration on military bases in its negotiations with the government of Iraq have now been revealed as carefully - worded ruses aimed at concealing US negotiating aims from both US citizens and Iraqis who would object to them if they were made clear .
Recent statements by Iraqis familiar with US demands in negotiations on the US - Iraq " strategic framework " agreement have highlighted the fact that administration promises that it would not seek " permanent bases " or the use of bases to attack Iran or any other neighboring countries were deliberately misleading .
The wording used by the Bush administration appears to have been chosen to obscure its intention to have both long - term access to Iraqi bases and complete freedom to use them to launch operations against Iran and Syria .
When Defense Secretary Robert Gates first informed the public about US aims in negotiating Jan. 24 , he renounced the aim of " permanent bases " in Iraq .
Gates said the US - Iraq agreement " would not involve  we have no interest in permanent bases . "
The same day , State Department spokesman Tom Casey , asked if the agreement would include any reference to " permanent bases " , replied , " We ’re not seeking permanent bases in Iraq .
That ’s been a clear matter of policy for some time . "
Casey went on to say , " No , the agreement is not a basing agreement . "
In Congressional testimony Apr. 8 , Ambassador Ryan Crocker said the agreements " will not establish permanent bases in Iraq and we anticipate that it will expressly forswear them . "
These public reassurances , moreover , mirrored the actual language used in the US draft of the agreement given to the Iraqi negotiators .
A draft dated Mar. 8 , which was leaked to The Guardian ’s Seumas Milne and reported Apr. 8 , includes the statement that the United States " does not desire permanent bases or a permanent military presence in Iraq . "
That commitment , which seems definitive at first glance , actually incorporates deliberate ambiguity on at least two different levels .
The term " permanent military base " appears to represent a substantive legal term , but in fact is a completely misleading term .
When Democratic Sen. James Webb asked the State Department ’s David Satterfield , " What is a permanent base ? "
Satterfield tried to avoid answering the question .
But Assistant Defense Secretary Mary Beth Long was more responsive .
She said , " I have looked into this .
As far as the department is concerned , we do n’t have a worldwide or even a department - wide definition of permanent bases . "
Webb then observed , " It does n’t really mean anything , " to which Long replied , " Yes , senator , you ’re right .
It does n’t . "
She added that " most lawyers … would say that the word ‘ permanent ’ probably refers more to the state of mind contemplated by the use of the term . "
Iraqi officials quickly figured out that the real significance of the draft ’s wording on access to military bases was that it contained neither a time limit on access to Iraqi bases nor any restrictions on the US to " conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security . "
Authorization for such operations was called " temporary " , but the absence of any time limit makes that seemingly reassuring term meaningless as well .
The Bush administration ’s renunciation of " permanent bases " was a ploy to lull the key committees of the US Congress on an issue which had aroused many Democratic critics of the war , who had repeatedly used that term in demanding a legal commitment on the issue .
The administration also used such ambiguous language to help the Iraqi government sell the agreement to Iraqi nationalists who object to long - term US bases in their country .
Thus as early as last December , Iraqi National Security Adviser Mowaffaq al - Rubayi declared in a television interview , " The Iraqi people reject the presence of permanent bases in Iraq " and reassured Iraqis that the government would not accept such bases " in any form whatever and will not approve , and I believe the Council of Representatives will not approve it . "
As Iraqi sources have now revealed to Western reporters , however , the US has proposed access to dozens of military bases without a time limit that would be technically Iraqi bases but which would actually be fully under US control .
The ploy of turning over legal control of US bases to a client regime is one that US administrations had used on at least two previous occasions to get around legal / political problems associated with continuation of US base rights .
In the 1973 Paris peace agreement that ended the Vietnam War , the US pledged to dismantle all of its military bases in South Vietnam within 60 days .
But it had already secretly transferred the deeds to the bases and equipment to the South Vietnamese government and then had them " loaned back " to the United States .
US officials then claimed that there were no US bases to dismantle .
Because of nationalist opposition to US military bases in the Philippines , the United States gave nominal " sovereignty " over the bases to the Philippines in 1978 and put a Philippine officer in nominal command of each base , while insisting on US " effective command and control " as well as " unhampered military operations . "
Another issue on which the Bush administration inserted language in its draft to suggest a major concession to Iraqi political sensitivities while keeping its own freedom of action is the US use of Iraqi bases to carry out military operations against another country .
That was an obvious red line for the al - Maliki regime and its ally , Iran .
Prime Minister al - Maliki ’s spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh insisted last January that US troops must " not be used against [ Iraq ’s ] neighbors , " because , he said , it could put the country ’s security in jeopardy .
Dabbagh said this one the principles that Iraqi negotiators would seek to spell out in the agreement .
The Mar. 7 draft includes a statement that the United States " does not seek to use Iraqi territory as a platform for offensive operations against other states . "
That commitment leaves plenty of room for the Bush administration to argue that it is responding defensively to an Iranian threat to its troops or other interests .
Iraqi negotiators were well aware of the ambiguous nature of the US language .
And a US demand for control over Iraqi airspace below 29,000 feet , reported by more than one Iraqi official in recent weeks , fueled intense suspicions of the administration ’s intentions .
" Senior Iraqi military sources " were quoted by GulfNews as saying the agreement gave the United States " the right …to strike , from within Iraqi territory , any country it considers a threat to its national security . "
That interpretation was based on the absence of specific language ruling out US military operations without the prior consent of the Iraqi government .
It now appears that the Bush administration ’s ambitions to establish a legal framework to legitimize the occupation before the end of Bush ’s term will be frustrated by strong opposition to the pact from pro-Iranian Shiite political parties on whose support the al - Maliki regime depends .
The government is under strong pressure from legislators belonging to al - Maliki ’s own Dawa Party and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq to scuttle the pact , and wait for the next US administration before negotiating on the status and role of US forces in Iraq .

Three California counties to locals :
No marriage for you
I ’ve long wondered what , exactly , opponents of same - sex marriage believe will happen if gay couples have the same right to marry as straight couples .
Several years ago , I recall Rick “ Man on Dog ” Santorum telling TV preacher Pat Robertson , “ [ T ] he consequence is very clear .
Marriage loses its significance .
People will stop getting married .
Homosexuals will not get married ; heterosexuals will stop getting married .
And that to me is the real threat to the American family and to the culture generally . ”
Now , this quote has always stood out for me because I ’d really like to meet the straight person who believes , “ I planned to marry the person I love , but I ’ve decided not to .
If gays can marry , it ’s just not worth it . ”
That , I assumed , was the only way for Santorum ’s argument to make any sense .
As it turns out , there ’s another way Santorum could have been right .
June 17 marks the date that gay and lesbian couples can marry legally in California , following a landmark ruling by the state ’s Supreme Court in May that struck down the ban on same - sex marriage .
The day will be marked by joyous celebrations and eager couples earning a right they have waited years to obtain .
Yet , the occasion will also be punctuated by the division it creates throughout the state .
On the one hand , San Francisco County has added additional staff and expanded hours so the clerk ’s office can accommodate the surge in demand from same - sex couples seeking marriage licenses and wedding ceremonies .
The office has 170 same - sex couples signed up to receive marriage licenses on the first day , says Karen Hong Yee , director of the county clerk ’s office .
In contrast , the Butte County clerk - recorder issued a June 11 news release saying her office will stop performing wedding ceremonies altogether — for gay and heterosexual couples .
The Kern County clerk issued a June 4 release that she would do the same .
Calaveras county has decided to follow Butte ’s and Kern ’s lead , and will also stop performing marriages altogether .
It never occurred to me that conservatives would actually find a way to make marriages between gay couples affect marriages between straight couples .
Kudos to their right - wing , hate - filled creativity !
Keep in mind , some conservatives in California are considering additional steps .
While the Kern Co Clerk has faced suspicion from gay marriage supporters for her timing in deciding to stop all marriage ceremonies , others are backing her actions .
“ The California Family code still says that marriage is between a man and a woman .
They ’ve created legal confusion , ” says Ken Mettler of the Bakersfield Republican Assembly .
Many people are trying to get the Kern County Board of Supervisors to approve an ordinance that would ban the clerk from even issuing marriage licenses .
Supervisors will look at that proposal next week .
[ emphasis added ]
You know , I ’m starting to get the sense that there are some people out there who have an irrational hatred of gay people .
Movies have come a long way since the 1930’s .
Even though the closing credits for Lord of The Rings is long , according to Wikipedia the 1956 version of Around the World in 80 Days and Clerks 2 had even longer closing credits .
In the case of Around the World in 80 Days , it ’s closing credits featured an animated recap of the movie ’s three - hour storyline , identifying the actors in the order in which they appeared .

CTV Inc. has acquired the rights to The Hockey Theme in perpetuity , the network announced Monday .
The agreement was reached with Copyright Music & Visuals , which was unable to renew a deal with CBC Sports .
CBC Sports executive director Scott Moore said he was disappointed but not surprised the song was shopped elsewhere .
" The two sides were so far apart and there was so much bad blood that we knew a deal would be difficult , " he said .
" The reality is it takes two sides to do a deal and we tried everything we could to do a deal .
" We offered arbitration , mediation — we offered to meet their price .
On Friday , when it came right down to it , we never got a response from them on our latest offer and find out , in the meantime , they appeared to be negotiating with CTV . "
Moore said CBC had negotiated for 14 months but to no avail , and that the agency was asking for $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million for use in perpetuity .
" If they got that from CTV , we would never have been able to get there , " Moore told CBC Newsworld .
" It is not a responsible price for us .
" If that is the price CTV wants to pay , it wo n't be the first time nor will it be the last time , probably , that they outbid us for something .
They have a lot more profits than we do . "
The song had been used on Hockey Night in Canada since 1968 .
" Hockey is a game , it 's not a song , " Moore said .
" We have the No. 1 sports property in Canada .
" I do n't expect one less viewer to tune in on Saturday to watch Hockey Night in Canada .
They will continue to watch their favourite team . "
According to a release , CTV said it agreed to a deal with Copyright Music & Visuals after Friday 's deadline with CBC passed .
The agency represents the song 's composer , Dolores Claman , who was born in Vancouver .
" The song has a long and storied history in Canadian sports , and has become ingrained in the hearts and minds of hockey fans across the country .
It is an iconic tune , embraced by Canadians everywhere , and we felt it was imperative to save it , " said Rick Brace of CTV Inc .
Moore said he was surprised a rival network would purchase something so inextricably linked to the Hockey Night brand .
" It 's a constant commercial for our network , " he said .
Lawsuit complicated negotiations
Earlier on Monday , CBC Sports had said it planned to bring in noted sports and entertainment lawyer Gord Kirke in a last - ditch effort to bring about a mediated resolution .
Complicating the bid for a settlement was an outstanding lawsuit filed against the CBC in late 2004 surrounding its use for ringtones and downloads .
Moore said CBC wanted to resolve that issue along with the song 's future use , but that representatives for Claman wanted to keep them separate .
Claman , 80 , has written about 2,000 jingles over her career , including the Ontario theme A Place to Stand , which she co-wrote with her husband , Richard Morris .
" I am very moved by how so many Canadians have taken the hockey theme to heart .
We are so pleased the song has found a new home , " said Claman , who now resides in Britain .
Before Kirke 's involvement was announced , CBC Sports announced plans to launch a new national contest in conjunction with Nettwerk Music Group to find a new theme song .
Canadians will be invited to write and record an original song for Hockey Night in Canada , with fans and a jury of experts to choose the best new composition .
" I think it 'll help us get a new demographic , " Moore said .
" The theme that we had was a great theme .
[ But ] it was 39 years old .
Maybe it 's time for something else . "
The son of Stompin ' Tom Connors said Monday his father is open to licensing his famed hockey song to CBC as a replacement .
" If they want to use The Hockey Song , it 's a good song , whether Tom sings it or not , " Tom Connors Jr. said .
" There 's other versions out there .
" Even if they wanted to commission some other band , like a big [ name ] band if they wanted to do more of a Hockey Night theme , everything is open for negotiations , of course .
That 's the business we 're in . "
Troubles fail to drive down Hummer owners ' passion Associated Press

They rumble in on treads called Super Swampers , wearing their hearts on their license plates .
" PLAYDRTY , " declares one behemoth from New York .
" HUM THIS , " dares another , from Ohio .
The digital board fronting the Shell station at Exit 100 winks back : " Welcome Hummers ! "
In the fading light , though , it 's impossible to ignore the sign at the Sunoco across the road : Diesel , $ 4.97 9/10 a gallon .
You 've got to be tough to love a Hummer .
The soaring cost of feeding a vehicle that swallows a gallon every dozen miles is only part of it .
Environmentalists , who 've always had it in for you , are winning mainstream converts .
General Motors , which presided over Hummer 's transition from a badge of military bravado into a symbol of driveway excess , is looking to sell .
But tonight there 's no apologizing or self - pity in the ranks of Hummer die - hards .
They 're here to goad machines that can top 5 tons over boulders the size of Smart cars , through stewpots of mud obscuring who - knows - what and across obstacle courses of stumps , logs and stones  it's " like riding a slow - motion rollercoaster , " one says .

Hummer sales have dropped 40 percent this year .
But these beasts and the men and women who love them certainly do n't behave like endangered species .
" I told my wife when we bought this , ' Honey , we 're investing in steel and rubber , ' says William Welch , a Philadelphia surgeon who , cigar clenched between his teeth , offers a guided tour of his lovingly tended jet - black H1 .
" If it was $ 10 a gallon , " he says , " we 'd still be out there . "
Cars are much more than transportation to Americans .
In a country where life revolves around the car , you are what you drive .
" We eat 20 percent of our meals in cars .
We spend hour and hours every week ( in cars ) , " says Leon James , a University of Hawaii professor and expert in the psychology of driving .
" We see other cars as extensions of the people who drive them and we identify the character of the car with the character of the driver .
There is this automatic connection that we make . "
But even in American car culture , the Hummer is an outlier , provoking both love and hatred so intense they can be hard to figure .
That makes it easy to forget the basic scrappiness and necessity that gave birth to the vehicle in the first place .
The Hummer traces its DNA to the Jeep , produced for the Army in large numbers during World War II .
" It was something that could go to places other vehicles could not go , yet it was reasonably priced , " says Patrick Foster , author of books on Jeep and the company that built the Hummer .
Americans , watching newsreel war coverage , were captivated by the cars , boxy because they were stamped by equipment previously used to make washing machines .
Farmers , service station owners and foresters snapped them up long before ordinary consumers dreamed of pulling a vehicle built to go off - road in to their driveways .
But by the late 1970s , the jeep had outlived its military usefulness .
The Army invited companies to devise a new kind of vehicle .
A team led by an engineer named George Scharbach set to work in the Warren , Mich .
shop of AM General , a spinoff of Jeep .
Scharbach wore his lucky suit on the day the Defense Department announced the new contract .
Maybe it worked .
But the winning proposal was one strange automotive creature .
Its hulking body  more than 7 feet wide without mirrors  sat way up off the ground while simultaneously hunkered down in a low crouch , like an overgrown teenager trying to slip into a movie at kid 's admission .
Its wheels were pushed out past its corners and its drivetrain was yanked up into the middle of the interior , putting a huge hump between driver and passenger .
" It has no aesthetics , " AM General spokesman Craig Mac Nab says .
" It screams at you from across the street : I look this way because I need to . "
AM General called it the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle .
Soldiers dubbed it the Humvee .
It saw limited action in Panama .
But in the Gulf War in 1991 , the Humvee bulled its way into the public consciousness .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , then a muscle - bound movie star a long way from being the Governator , was driving along a highway in Oregon , on his way to the film set for " Kindergarten Cop . "
Heading the other direction , an Army convoy packed with Humvees , rumbled past .
" I put the brakes on , " Schwarzenegger told reporters at the 1992 ceremony that AM General , besieged by requests , held to start production of civilian Hummers .
" Someone smashed into the back of me , but I just stared .
' Oh my God , there is the vehicle , ' I said .
And from then on , I was possessed . "
He was far from the only one .
There are Hummers and then there are HUMMERS .
It 's that way with their owners , too .
The Hummer pilots flocking to the parking lot of a Hampton Inn tonight are clearly the latter .
Hummering is not some two - minute fad .
" It 's a lifestyle , " they say repeatedly .
They 're well aware of the many other Hummer owners , who use their vehicles for little more than dropping the kids at baseball and supermarket trips .
" Street queens , " the serious crowd calls them .
" Pavement princesses . "
But you do n't have to be a tough guy to be here .
When GM bought Hummer and began selling the H2 ( huge , but medium - sized as Hummers go ) and the H3 ( still pretty big ) a few years ago , owners of H1s  the prettied up version of the Army 's vehicle  were worried suburbanized Hummers would dilute the experience .
But when they voted , the big boys chose to let the newbies join in .
So Brandie Lopes , a silkscreen printer , is here from Winterport , Maine , a 600 - mile haul that would 've been cheaper to fly than to drive in her polished new H2 .
She 's joined by Howard and Vickie Schultheiss , up from Maryland in a nearly 11,000 pound H1 that bears the scratches and scars of off - road battles .
The steel roofrack above the windshield is carved with letters spelling out " D - Man , " the nickname of a highly trained German Shepherd , now lost to cancer , whose fierce spirit the couple says lives on the rig .
Nearly all come with a story about how they were smitten .
For John Andres , a software writer from New Albany , Ohio , it goes back to 1991 , when he was scrimping for a Range Rover .
He turned on the TV one January night and was transfixed by a report of two dozen U.S. Marines pinned down behind a wall in the Saudi Arabian town of Khafji .
With Saudi tanks providing cover , the soldiers packed into Humvees and barreled through Iraqi lines .
" I saw that .
I thought , ' forget the Range Rover , ' " says Andres , whose sand - colored Hummer jokingly sports silhouettes of the compact sedans he 's knocked off , a la the Red Baron .
" Humvee is the way to go .
These things are just bad . "
Dan LaForgia 's story is more elemental .
" My mom says my first word was ' truck , ' " LaForgia says .
In the mid-'90s , LaForgia persuaded his father to drive him to the Hummer dealership near his home on New York 's Long Island so they could take one out for a test drive .
He was 12  and hooked .
" Some people say its the ugliest thing on the road , " LaForgia says .
" I love it . "
This weekend is a big deal for LaForgia .
In three years of Hummer ownership , he 's never taken his off - road .
He cringes noticeably as others trade stories of broken axles , smashed windows , and the deep scratches and gashes their vehicles have endured in previous adventures .
At 8:45 a.m. , though , he joins the other owners under a tent , ready to embark in groups dispatched by levels of skills and experience .
They head a few exits up to a former strip - mine turned off - road haven .
Members of the extreme group  four of the most gung - ho H1 owners  trade jokes over the radio as they part the treeline .
But inside the rig the Schultheiss ' have dedicated to their dog , the mood is reverential .
" Cue it up , " Vickie says to Howard , her husband .
" All right .
Here we go . "
The low rumble of timpani drums stir from the Hummer 's speakers .
French horns join in , rising above the engine 's growl .
The solemn notes are unmistakable : Aaron Copland 's " Fanfare for the Common Man . "
Vickie reaches for D - Man 's collar , which hangs down from the rearview mirror .
She tugs the chains twice , rubs the gray links between her fingers .
" It 's his truck , " she says softly .
Howard Schultheiss reaches across from the passenger seat and takes her hand .
Threading through branches and over stumps , the group reaches a winding river of boulders .
They 're not going to cross it .
They 're going to try and drive it 's full third - of - a - mile length .
A Prius would 've been long gone by now .
Even in a vehicle marketed as the automotive equivalent of Godzilla , this takes nerve  and a durable wallet .
" I 've come down on a rock so hard that my windshield cracked across the middle , " says Jason Oplinger , an electrical contractor .
When he and wife , Steph , married two years ago , guests were ferried to the mid-trail ceremony in a procession of 40 Hummer H1s .
Today has its own drama .
Before it's over , the Schultheiss ' truck will break in three places and have to be yanked off the rocks by winch .
In one of the intermediate caravans , drivers will plunge through a mud pool with the color of cement and the odor of a pigsty .
Two will dive so hard that water licks at the engines ' air intakes before they make it across .
By evening , back at the hotel , there are new stories to trade over barbecue .
" I 'm going to get out while I 'm ahead , " says LaForgia , whose street - pretty Hummer bears its first scar .
" I always say another scratch means another story , or adds some character , " counsels a fellow owner , Mike Schoch .
Hummer stories echo each other after a while .
Tales of the way a Hummer draws a crowd in a parking lot , or swallows ground in a snowstorm .
Stories of beers shared around the tailgate , spare parts shared on the trail , and friendships built to last .
But the gut - level lure of the machine itself is n't easy to quantify .
Maybe the most powerful comparison is the one Vickie Schultheiss draws between her Hummer and the German Shepherd whose memory it honors .
" To me it had to be just as capable and just as brute as Dikas , " she says .
In the woods , she narrows her eyes , studying the terrain ahead , then climbs the Hummer bearing D - Man 's name over a mammoth boulder .
The truck slams down , bashing steel against stone .
Schultheiss swings out of the driver 's seat to check out the wheel hanging in mid air .
Her forehead is fringed with sweat .
She 's beaming .
" Welcome to D - Man 's world , " she says .
Schwarzenegger got his first Hummer just as consumers were falling for SUVs .
When the Jeep went civilian , so - called light trucks were a fraction of the U.S. car market , bought mostly by businesses who needed their power and capacity .
When Congress set strict fuel economy requirements on car makers in the 1970s , lawmakers went easy on trucks , allowing regulators to set less stringent rules .
Detroit responded with vehicles classified as trucks but designed to win over car buyers .
By 2004 , light trucks claimed 55 percent of the market .
Regulators exempted trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 8,500 pounds or more from any fuel economy requirements , a loophole that critics say encouraged manufacturers to build mega-SUVs .
The first Hummers " raised people 's eyebrows , " says Tom Libby , an analyst with J.D. Power & Associates .
Their in - your - face image appealed to buyers seeking pure utility .
Libby cites his cousin , an avowed truck buyer , who declared SUVs " fake . "
" He said the only one he 'd ever consider would be the H1 .
For him , that was a true truck , " Libby says .
Others are n't fans .
" It gave a lot of people a sense of vain superiority , that you 're way up there above everybody else , and I think it gave a lot of people a sense of power , " says Mark S. Foster , author of A Nation on Wheels : The Automobile Culture in America Since 1945 .
Hummers and other big SUVs appealed to what Foster calls Americans ' " sense of entitlement , " accustomed to seemingly boundless land and cheap energy .
Hummers became icons , starring in rap videos and in movies like " Three Kings , " alongside George Clooney .
Marketers unleashed Hummer - branded mountain bikes and laptops .
" Let Hummer , the fragrance , take you on an adventure , an adventure like no other ... " a cologne promised .
But GM 's 2002 introduction of the H2  mammoth , but much more polished and sold in considerably larger numbers  netted enemies .
The Sierra Club took it on with a Web site , Hummerdinger .
That was mild compared to FUH2.com , a hate site that drew hundreds of photos from people saluting the Hummer with their middle fingers .
Soaring gas prices made outright Hummer hate socially acceptable .
The stepped up culture war found its way to a leafy Washington , D.C. neighborhood last July , when two masked men attacked a parked Hummer with a machete and a baseball bat .
Hummer owners from around the country called Gareth Groves , the owner of the vandalized vehicle , to offer help , even garage space .
But they were outnumbered by people who sent hate mail , including threatening e-mails and MySpace postings .
Within two blocks , a Cadillac Escalade , a Ford Excursion and a Chevrolet Suburban went untouched .
But what surprised Groves was n't that people hated his Hummer .
It was how much they seemed to hate him , lambasting everything from his bleached hair to the fact that he lived with his mother .
" It definitely sparks some intense reaction from people on both sides , " Groves says .
So what did Groves do ?
He submitted a $ 25,000 insurance claim and had the truck repaired .
High gas prices and the house payments made him briefly think about selling , but he quickly dismissed the idea .
" I love this car , " he says .
Even a few hardcore Hummer owners are rethinking .
" It 's not a very practical truck , " says LaForgia , who sometimes finds critical notes on the windshield .
He plans to sell his H1 to save for a down payment on a house .
Others are adjusting to new realities .
There 's a small crowd of Hummer enthusiasts out there running on biodiesel .
Welch , the surgeon , is leaning toward buying a hybrid for commutes to a hospital parking garage with ceilings too low for his truck .
" I want to save my carbon footprint , not blow it on my way to work , " he says .
But Hummer owners see such decisions as personal choices , not bows to external pressure .
" It 's easier to ask for forgiveness then permission , " Andres says .
" I 've always found that to be true . "
He 's describing only the fess - up - later approach he takes in explaining the money he lavishes on the Hummer to his wife .
For all those folks waiting for Hummer owners to cry uncle , well , do n't hold your breath .
Los Angeles bans fast food restaurants in poorer areas Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This LOS ANGELES ( AP )  City officials are putting South Los Angeles on a diet .
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to place a moratorium on new fast food restaurants in an impoverished swath of the city with a proliferation of such eateries and above average rates of obesity .
The yearlong moratorium is intended to give the city time to attract restaurants that serve healthier food .
The action , which the mayor must still sign into law , is believed to be the first of its kind by a major city to protect public health .
" Our communities have an extreme shortage of quality foods , " City Councilman Bernard Parks said .
Representatives of fast - food chains said they support the goal of better diets but believe they are being unfairly targeted .
They say they already offer healthier food items on their menus .
" It 's not where you eat , it 's what you eat , " said Andrew Pudzer , president and chief executive of CKE Restaurants , parent company of Carl 's Jr. " We were willing to work with the city on that , but they obviously were n't interested . "
The California Restaurant Association and its members will consider a legal challenge to the ordinance , spokesman Andrew Casana said .
Thirty percent of adults in South Los Angeles area are obese , compared to 19.1 percent for the metropolitan area and 14.1 percent for the affluent Westside , according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health .
Research has shown that people will change eating habits when different foods are offered , but cost is a key factor in poor communities , said Kelly D. Brownell , director of Yale University 's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity .
" Cheap , unhealthy food and lack of access to healthy food is a recipe for obesity , " Brownell said .
" Diets improve when healthy food establishments enter these neighborhoods . "
A report by the Community Health Councils found 73 percent of South Los Angeles restaurants were fast food , compared to 42 percent in West Los Angeles .
South Los Angeles resident Curtis English acknowledged that fast food is loaded with calories and cholesterol .
But since he 's unemployed and does not have a car , it serves as a cheap , convenient staple for him .
On Monday , he ate breakfast and lunch  a sausage burrito and double cheeseburger , respectively  at a McDonald 's a few blocks from home for just $ 2.39 .
" I do n't think there 's too many fast food places , " he said .
" People like it . "
Others welcomed an opportunity to get different kinds of food into their neighborhood .
" They should open more healthy places , " Dorothy Meighan said outside a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet .
" There 's too much fried stuff . "
Councilwoman Jan Perry said that view repeatedly surfaced at the five community meetings she held during the past two years .
Residents are tired of fast food , and many do n't have cars to drive to places with other choices , she said .
Los Angeles ' ban comes at a time when governments of all levels are increasingly viewing menus as a matter of public health .
On Friday , California became the first state in the nation to bar trans fats , which lower levels of good cholesterol and increase bad cholesterol .
The moratorium , which can be extended up to a year , only affects standalone restaurants , not eateries located in malls or strip shopping centers .
It defines fast - food restaurants as those that do not offer table service and provide a limited menu of pre-prepared or quickly heated food in disposable wrapping .
The definition exempts " fast - food casual " restaurants such as El Pollo Loco , Subway and Pastagina , which do not have drive - through windows or heat lamps and prepare fresh food to order .
The ordinance also makes it harder for existing fast - food restaurants to expand or remodel .
Rebeca Torres , a South Los Angeles mother of four , said she would welcome more dining choices , even if she had to pay a little more .
" They should have better things for children , " she said .
" This fast food really fattens them up . "
MSNBC was covering John McCain 's speech in front of a Latino conference this morning when he was interrupted by two anti-war protesters .
( at about the 1:10 mark ) MSNBC's Alex Witt , while speaking off the cuff during a live event , mischaracterized the women as " hecklers . "

Protester : " Your silence is consent to war crimes ! "
McCain has been met with protest before in this campaign and it wo n't be last time he hears strong opposition from the American people on his war .
He likes to talk about the freedoms our troops provide us , but on the Straight Talk Express , free speech is limited to those who agree with him and President Bush .
Also note how McCain states that he did n't learn to love the United States until he went to Viet Nam .
Colorado ’s most infamous asspipe , Douglas Bruce , is at it again .
Bruce booted after “ illiterate ” remark
By Jessica Fender
The Denver Post Disparaging remarks aimed at migrant workers got resident rabble - rouser Rep. Douglas Bruce banned from speaking on an alien worker bill today .
“ We do n’t need 5,000 more illiterate peasants in the state of Colorado , ” Bruce , R- Colorado Springs , told the chamber to an audible gasp .
Rep. Kathleen Curry , leading the House at the time , immediately barred Bruce from speaking at the podium , an uncommon maneuver .
“ How dare you ? ” she asked Bruce , before House members moved back to discussion of a bill aimed at helping seasonal farm workers from other countries enter the state legally on a temporary basis .
In case you ’re unfamiliar with Bruce , he masterminded Colorado ’s notorious Amendment 2 debacle and the state ’s disastrous “ Taxpayer Bill of Rights ” ( TABOR ) .
He ’s been relatively calm of late , having only been involved in three embarrassments this calendar year ( until today ) .
I guess it ’s hardly surprising that he ’d have an issue with all those dirty wetbacks sneaking into the state .
I ’m not sure of the logistics involved , but it ’s high time that the Colorado legislature removed Bruce from its ranks .
He has been responsible for incalculable damage to the state and its citizens .
Our education and public services are among the worst in the nation thanks to TABOR .
Amendment 2 announced to the rest of America that we were prepared to by god act on our ignorance .
And lately he seems to exist for no other reason than to outrage our sense of propriety and public decency .
Douglas Bruce is – and let ’s be brutally frank about this – a bad human being .
He makes the lives of others measurably worse , and if he were to drive off a cliff tonight we would all be demonstrably better off .
I ’m not in the business of wishing ill on people , but at the same time we should n’t be any more afraid to state the plain truth than he is to foul the podium in our legislature with hate and bile .
Yes , Virginia , Colorado has an illiterate problem .
But it ’s not the migrant workers who need us as badly as we need them .
It ’s the man from House District 15 in Colorado Springs .
It ’s time for Douglas Bruce to go crawl back under whatever rock he slithered out from in the first place .
Today .
World Net Daily does not have a great reputation for accuracy in its reporting , but Bob Unruh has pretty solid evidence for his report on a disappearing section of a speech given by Barack Obama .
On July 2nd , Obama spoke in Colorado Springs and hit themes of national service , foreign policy , and national security .
In that vein , Obama proposed a rather extraordinary idea — that the US should spend as much money on a civilian national security force as it does on the military .
The quote comes from 16:45 in the clip below :
We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that ’s just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded .
It ’s not quite clear what Obama meant by this .
If he meant that the military had taken over too many functions that normally should be handled by the State Department , then that echoes what Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this week .
It seems to reference the costs associated with reopening consulates and doubling the Peace Corps , but that would n’t come close to matching what we spend at the Pentagon .
The phrasing of it — a “ civilian national security force ” — sounds much more like a quasi-military organization operating within the US under the control of the federal government .
The media needs to ask Obama about it — but they ’d have to report it first :
The stunning comments from Democrat Sen. Barack Obama that the United States needs a “ civilian national security force ” that would be as powerful , strong and well - funded as the half - trillion dollar United States Army , Marines , Navy and Air Force have mysteriously disappeared from published transcripts of the speech .
In the comments , Obama confirmed the U.S. “ cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set . ”
Campaign officials have declined to return any of a series of WND telephone calls over several days requesting a comment on the situation .
Nor have they posted a transcript of the speech on their website .
WND points out two newspapers that printed the supposedly complete transcript of the speech , the Wall Street Journal and the Denver Post , as examples .
The New York Times did n’t post a transcript , and neither did the Washington Post nor the Los Angeles Times .
Most oddly , as Unruh points out , the Obama website does n’t have that speech available , either .
Obama needs to clarify what he means by “ civilian national security force ” , and how it would be funded .
After all , we have a panoply of federal security agencies already : FBI , BATF , DEA , and more , plus the National Guard on the state level .
Where would Obama get the money to fund it at the same level as the Pentagon ?
What would its mission be , and where would it get its authority ?
What would be the lines of jurisdiction ?
All of these questions need to be answered — but first the media has to find its objectivity and start asking about the speech and report it correctly .
Obviously the Obama campaign provided them with an advance copy for the event , and just as obviously Obama deviated from it .
Are n’t any journalists curious as to why ?
Update : Does n’t this statement conflict with Obama ’s statement about ICE ?
When communities are terrorized by ICE immigration raids , when nursing mothers are torn from their babies , when children come home from school to find their parents missing , when people are detained without access to legal counsel , when all that is happening , the system just is n’t working , and we need to change it .
Would n’t ICE be part of a civilian national security force ?
Obama sounds more and more confused by the day .
( h/t HA reader Jeff D )
Update II : Note to desperate Obama apologists : the Peace Corps is not a “ national security force ” .
Would Sen. John McCain be a good environmental president ?
Do n’t bet the planet on it .
Joseph Romm at Salon writes that although the Republican nominee - to - be is the only GOP candidate who believes in the science of global warming and who has proposed legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , his green credentials are shaky at best .
“ While McCain may understand the scale of the climate problem , he does not appear to understand the scale of the solution , ” writes Romm .
Unless a President McCain appointed judges and agency heads who would not gut efforts to address climate change — something he’d be unlikely to do — he would n’t make much headway .
Romm also points out that McCain has backed huge subsidies for nuclear power , yet he “ remarkably ” told Grist in an interview last October that wind and solar need no such help .
Over at Huffington Post , Arianna Huffington also calls out McCain on his environmental wishy - washiness in “ End of a Romance : Why the Media and Independent Voters Need to Break Up With John McCain ” :
“ The old John McCain talked about trying to do something about global warming and encourage renewable energy .
The new John McCain did n’t show up for a vote last week on a bill that included tax incentives for clean energy , even though he was in D.C .
And then his staff misled environmentalists who called to protest by telling them that he had voted for it . ”
McCain is still getting mileage out of the “ maverick ” label that no longer applies , Huffington claims .
But perhaps he ’s still a maverick when compared to green voters :
He ’s got almost nothing in common with them .

' Billions wasted on UN climate programme '
' European Union 's efforts to tackle climate change a failure '
' UN effort to curtail emissions in turmoil '
' Truth about Kyoto : huge profits , little carbon saved '
These recent newspaper headlines tell the story .
The world 's dominant approach to dealing with the climate crisis -- carbon trading , the centrepiece of the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme -- is n't working .
Yet , as if sleepwalking , international agencies and government authorities around the world continue to squander millions of taxpayer dollars trying to build or repair carbon markets .
As country after country undertakes its own complicated efforts to partition the world 's carbon cycling capacity into saleable commodities , and entrepreneurs flood news media with unverifiable claims that they are increasing that capacity , fossil - fuelled industries are getting a new lease on life .
As speculators seek quick profits in a fast - growing ' wild west ' marketplace , the need to find reliable ways to promote the structural change that would allow fossil fuels to be kept in the ground is being ignored or forgotten .
Why is this happening ?
What lies behind the belief that carbon markets can somehow be ' fixed ' or ' regulated ' ?
What can be done to move climate politics onto a saner path ?
The Corner House has recently posted nearly a dozen new items on its website that shed light on these and related questions .
We hope you find them useful and informative .
Best wishes from all at The Corner House
NEW ADDITIONS ARTICLES FOR ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS
1 ) ' Carbon Trading : Solution or Obstacle ?'
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/Indiachapter.pdf
More and more commentators now recognise that carbon markets are not helping to address the climate crisis .
But more discussion is needed of : how carbon markets damage more effective approaches ; whether carbon markets could ever work at all ; and why carbon trading has been successful in political terms despite failing in climatic terms .
2 ) ' Carbon Trading , Climate Justice and the Production of Ignorance : Ten Examples '
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/Ignorance.pdf
Carbon trading schemes have helped mobilise neoclassical economics and development planning in new projects of dispossession , speculation , rent - seeking and the redistribution of wealth from poor to rich and from the future to the present .
A central part of this process has been creating new domains of ignorance .
What does the quest for climate justice become when it is incorporated into a development or carbon market framework ?
3 ) ' Toward a Different Debate in Environmental Accounting : The Cases of Carbon and Cost - Benefit '
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/EnvAcctg.pdf
Many mainstream environmentalists suggest that calculating and internalising ' externalities ' is the way to solve environmental problems .
Some critics counter that the spread of market - like calculations into ' non-market ' spheres is itself causing environmental problems .
This article sets aside this debate to examine closely actual conflicts , contradictions and resistances engendered by environmental accounting techniques and suggest what the long - term political and environmental consequences are likely to be .
4 ) ' Gas , Waqf and Barclays Capital : A Decade of Struggle in Southern Thailand '
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/Waqf.pdf
Slowing and halting new fossil fuel developments must eventually move to the top of the global climate change agenda .
But what are the obstacles to , and resources for , such a project ?
The 10 - year struggle against a large natural gas development project in one corner of Southeast Asia offers lessons in some of the relevant themes of global politics : the use of military force to secure and transport fossil fuel resources ; the regulation of international finance ; sectarian violence ; corporate social responsibility ; intensely locally - specific yet internationally - reinforced , forms of class conflict and racism ; and the question of how a more tenacious solidarity for the defence of community and commons might be built among diverse and all - too - often isolated movements in different geographical and cultural locations .
POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS
5 ) ' Pictures from the Carbon Market , Part 2 '
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/OffsetsMarket2.pdf
This slide show of photographs continues a series portraying the practical , on - the - ground effects of the trade in carbon credits through the United Nations ' Clean Development Mechanism and the voluntary ' offset ' market .
6 ) ' How Carbon Trading Undermines Positive Approaches to the Climate Crisis '
http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/CTvsPos.pdf
Carbon trading proponents often assert that trading is merely a way of finding the most cost - effective means of reaching an emissions goal .
In fact , carbon trading undermines a number of existing and proposed positive measures for tackling climate change .
These include the survival and spread of existing low - carbon technologies , movements against expanded fossil fuel use , and well - tested green policy measures .
Carbon trading also undermines public awareness and political participation , as well as creating ignorance .
I do n't see how this could reasonably be characterized as anything less than an utter failure of the polygraph .
The subject lied about his name , lied about his backstory , was not on probation or parole , and stomped on a tack in his shoe on every question .
He created a photoshopped police report and invented a nonexistent girlfriend .
Ed Gelb was unable to detect any deception and was not even able to detect the fact that the guy was stomping on a tack in his shoe on every question .
I do n't see how anyone can reasonably claim that when Harmon was asked , " Do you plan to tell the truth on this test whether you knowingly used marijuana while on probation ? " he answered truthfully because he did not use marijuana .
Part of that question includes the fact that he was on probation , and Harmon most certainly knew that he was n't on probation during the time period in question .
By answering the question at all he would be lying , but Gelb could n't pick up on that .
When Harmon was asked , " Did you do marijuana while on probation last January ? " he again lied when he answered , since he was n't on probation .
Not to mention that none of us know if he actually used marijuana during the time in question .
But I think that is irrelevant , since his whole story was a lie from start to finish .
If a clean - living friend of a police applicant fills in for them on their pre-employment polygraph , do you think a competent ( by APA standards ) polygraph examiner should be able to detect that they are not speaking to the actual applicant ?
Should the examiner be able to detect that the person they are testing is giving them a fictional history and is essentially basing their answers off a sizeable lie ( i.e. - that they are not the person the examiner thinks they are ) ?
Should the examiner be able to detect that the subject is stomping on a tack every time they are asked a question ?
Or would it be more reasonable to dissect every answer and try to claim that certain answers to certain parts of certain questions were technically true , and therefore the polygraph functioned as advertised ?
I think it is simply common sense that if a test subject is lying about his name , lying about his backstory , and stomping on a tack in his shoe on every question he should not " pass " a test that is supposedly able to detect deception .
Is n't a pre-test interview standard procedure ?
Is n't Ed Gelb a former police officer ?
Yet he was unable to detect anything unusual when he talked to " Hank " about an arrest that never occurred , and probation ( or parole ) that " Hank " was never on , and about a failed drug test that " Hank " never took ?

US News & World Report calls it a ' whirlwind of positive coverage ' .
Rasmussen ponders whether ' reporters are trying to help Obama win' .
Even the New York Times is asking ' Has the press voted for Obama ? '
The news media have devoted significantly more attention to the Democrat since Hillary Rodham Clinton suspended her campaign , according to research conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
And despite the intensive media saturation Obama 's campaign is enjoying , NBC foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell calls out " what some would call fake interviews " due to the campaign 's strangely heavy restriction on press access .
" You 're seeing selected pictures taken by the military , questions by the military and what some would call fake interviews because they 're not interviews from a journalist , " said Mitchell during an interview on Hardball .
" Politically , it 's smart as can be , but we have not seen a presidential candidate do this , in my recollection , ever before . "
Conversely , when McCain traveled to New Hampshire on Monday , his arrival was hardly noticed .
" In Manchester last night , there was just one reporter and one photographer waiting for McCain as his plane -- a white , blue and gold Boeing 737-400 emblazoned with his campaign slogan , ' Reform , Prosperity , Peace ' -- touched down on the Wiggins Airways tarmac , " wrote The Union Leader .
On Monday night 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart cut right to the chase , mocking the extensive coverage of Barack Obama 's trip to Iraq .
Daily Show reporters Rob Riggle , Larry Wilmore , John Oliver , Wyatt Cenac and Ed Henry all joke that they have ' a boner ' for Obama and follow the campaign to the Middle East , leaving just a tape recorder tethered to a crude stand to cover McCain .
Referencing press coverage of Obama playing basketball with the troops , Wyatt Cenac asked , " Did you see when the President hit that three - pointer ? "
" Nothing but the net , right ? " John Oliver chimed in .
" He 's not ...
He 's not the President , " rebutted Stewart .
" Barack Obama is not the President . "
" Uh , are you sure ? " questioned Cenac .
Within moments , the whole cast of reporters were declaring a phallic affection of the presumptive Democratic nominee , at Rob Riggle 's declaration that , " Barack Obama ... Kinda gives me a boner . "
Toward the end of the clip , The Office 's Ed Helms makes a surprise reappearance , stating to cheers from fellow reporters , " Seriously , they should call this guy ' Barack Oboner . ' "

These are two photos of flexible circuits created using carbon nanotubes in research at Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
The researchers have overcome a major obstacle in producing transistors from networks of carbon nanotubes , a technology that could make it possible to print circuits on plastic sheets for applications including flexible displays and an electronic skin to cover an entire aircraft to monitor crack formation .

Researchers have overcome a major obstacle in producing transistors from networks of carbon nanotubes , a technology that could make it possible to print circuits on plastic sheets for applications including flexible displays and an electronic skin to cover an entire aircraft to monitor crack formation .
The so - called " nanonet " technology - circuits made of numerous carbon nanotubes randomly overlapping in a fishnet - like structure - has been plagued by a critical flaw :
The network is contaminated with metallic nanotubes that cause short circuits .
The discovery solves this problem by cutting the nanonet into strips , preventing short circuits by breaking the path of metallic nanotubes .
" This is a fundamental advance in how nanotube circuits are made , " said Ashraf Alam , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University .
He is working with Kaushik Roy , Purdue 's Roscoe H. George Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering , and doctoral students Ninad Pimparkar and Jaydeep P. Kulkarni .
Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign led experimental laboratory research to build the circuits , and Purdue led research to develop and use simulations and mathematical models needed to design the circuits and to interpret and analyze data .
Findings will be detailed in a research paper appearing in the journal Nature on July 24 .
The paper was written by the Purdue engineers and University of Illinois researchers : John A. Rogers , Founder Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and a professor of chemistry ; Moonsub Shim , Racheff Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering ; and doctoral students Qing Cao , Hoon - sik Kim and Congjun Wang .
" These findings represent the culmination of four years of collaborative efforts between the Illinois and Purdue groups , " Rogers said .
" The work established the fundamental scientific knowledge that led to this particular breakthrough and the ability to make circuits . "
The nanonets are made of tiny semiconducting cylinders called single walled carbon nanotubes .
Metallic nanotubes form unavoidably during the process of making carbon nanotubes .
These metal tubes then link together in meandering threads that eventually stretch across the width of the transistor , causing a short circuit .
" Other researchers have proposed eliminating the metallic nanotubes , " Rogers said .
" Instead , we found a very nice way of essentially removing the effect of these metallic nanotubes without actually eliminating them . "
The researchers created a flexible circuit containing more than 100 transistors , the largest nanonet ever produced and the first demonstration of a working nanonet circuit , Alam said .
" Now there is no fundamental reason why we could n't develop nanonet technologies , " he said .
" If you can make a flexible circuit with 100 transistors , you can make circuits with 10,000 or more transistors . "
The advance may allow researchers to use carbon nanotube transistors to create high - performance , shock - resistant , lightweight and flexible integrated circuits at low cost , Alam said .
A key advantage of the nanonet technology is that it can be produced at low temperatures , enabling the transistors to be placed on flexible plastic sheets that would melt under the high temperatures required to manufacture silicon - based transistors , he said .
Possible applications include an electronic skin that covers an aircraft and automatically monitors the formation of cracks to alert technicians and prevent catastrophic failures .
Such shape - conforming electronics are not possible using conventional silicon - based circuits , which are manufactured on rigid wafers or glass plates .
" Now electronics are flat , which limits their utility since most objects in real life are not flat , " Roy said .
Flexible displays could be integrated into automotive windshields to provide information for drivers .
Other potential applications include " electronic paper " that displays text and images , solar cells that could be printed on plastic sheets and television screens capable of being rolled up for transport and storage .
" For these types of applications , manufacturers might literally print , or stamp , circuits onto plastic sheets , like the roll - to - roll printing used to print newspapers , " Alam said .
Conventional circuits for flat - panel televisions contain transistors made of materials called polysilicon or amorphous silicon , which can not be used in flexible applications .
Nanonet transistors are promising for so - called macroelectronics because they are best suited for large - scale applications , but these transistors may not be as well suited for the requirements of microelectronic circuits , such as those in computer chips , Alam said .
The nanotubes are arranged randomly and overlap each other like tiny needles .
If the nanonet area is large enough , the overlapping metallic nanotubes will eventually form a meandering string across the entire transistor , causing a short circuit .
But if the device is segmented into strips , this meandering path of metallic rods is cut at the point where the lines separate one strip from another , preventing short circuits .
The metallic nanotubes make up about one - third of the nanotubes in the transistor .
Because the carbon nanotubes are twice as numerous as the metallic tubes , enough of them exist to form a complete circuit .
The models and simulations are needed to tell researchers precisely how wide to make the strips so that the pathway of metallic tubes is cut but the carbon nanotubes complete their circuit .
" The theory and simulation work done at Purdue shows there is always a way to break the metallic path and still keep the semi conducting carbon - nanotube path intact , " Alam said .
" The teams at Illinois and Purdue continuously provide insights about why things work the way they do and how to make them work better through combined modeling and experimental efforts . "
Each nanonet transistor consists of numerous strips of nanotubes , separated bylines that are etched in place .
The lines are easy to create with a standard etching process used in the semiconductor industry .
Future research may include work focusing on learning the reliability of the carbon nanotube circuits .
The research has been funded by the National Science Foundation through the Network for Computational Nanotechnology at the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Purdue 's Discovery Park .
The Illinois portion of the research also was funded and supported by the NSF , U.S. Department of Energy , Motorola Corp. , and by the university 's Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab , the Center for Microanalysis of Materials and the Department of Chemistry .
The researchers used computers made available by a global network called the nanoHUB , an Internet - based science gateway that provides computer - based resources for research and education in the areas of nanoelectronics and nanoelectromechanical systems and their application to nano - biosystems .
" This work requires tremendous computing resources because these are not trivial calculations , " Alam said .
Nanoelectronics focuses on creating a class of electronic devices containing features measured in nanometers , equivalent to one - billionth of a meter .
A nanometer is about the size of 10 atoms strung together .
The Network for Computational Nanotechnology uses advanced theory and simulations to explore new ideas for digital switching devices such as innovative types of transistors that promise to help researchers create future electronics .

Here ’s a batch of flowers that I picked up this morning .
Are n’t they gay ?
No ?
I could always return it for something else , yes ?
Like an angel Hummel ?
Or a clock in the shape of a hot dog ?
Just let me know , as the Dollar Mart closes in a few .
Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful robot !
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - A suspected suicide bomber blew up a car outside the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital on Monday , killing six people and wounding 25 , government officials said .
The blast will raise fresh questions about the safety of foreigners in Pakistan , even though militant attacks have dropped off since a new government came to power after a February general election vowing to negotiate to end violence .
Danish newspapers infuriated Muslims around the world when they published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in late 2005 .
The cartoons , considered blasphemous by Muslims , sparked deadly protests and attacks on Danish missions .
The embassy in Islamabad was temporarily shut in 2006 after violent protests over the sketches .
There was no claim of responsibility and while it would be premature to link the attack to the cartoons , one of which was recently reprinted in Danish newspapers , that possibility was being investigated , said Interior Ministry secretary Kamal Shah .
While officials said it was a suspected suicide attack , investigators were picking through the debris in and around a three - foot ( one meter ) deep crater in the road outside the mission to determine the cause .
“ There ’s no doubt it was a car blast .
It ’d be premature to say it was a suicide attack or remote - control , ” Shah told reporters near the embassy in an upmarket district of Islamabad where other missions and diplomats ’ houses are located .
The blast , which came just after 1 p.m. ( 3:00 a.m. EDT ) , destroyed the embassy gate and damaged the front of the building and vehicles in the compound .
It also caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and vehicles .
Police and security officials said all of the dead and wounded were Pakistanis .
A guard lay dead at the gate while men hauled blood - drenched wounded into ambulances .
A car engine was lying about 30 feet from the crater .
Residents said they had feared an attack on the mission .
“ Since the printing of cartoons , we always had this fear , ” said Sana Khalid , a woman living in the area .
“ But what they did to our religion , they deserve it . ”
Pakistan ’s main stock index ended higher in low volume despite the blast and dealers said trade in the rupee , which ended for the day just after news of the blast , was not affected .

“ IT’S DANGEROUS ”
Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller condemned the attack , adding that a Pakistani employee of the embassy , a cleaner , had been killed and three other Pakistani employees wounded .
No Danes died , he said .
“ It ’s terrible that terrorists commit such acts , ” he said in an interview with Danish television station TV2 News .
Denmark was reviewing security at all its embassies , he said .
Slideshow ( 20 images )
Windows were broken in the nearby home of the Indian High Commissioner .
Pakistani authorities said they were stepping up security at embassies and police were on alert in other cities .
Pakistan went through a wave of suicide bombings in the second half of 2007 and early this year but most of the attacks were on the Pakistani security forces and politicians , including former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , killed in a December 27 attack .
Attacks on foreigners have been rare since several in 2002 , but a blast at a restaurant in Islamabad in March killed a Turkish woman and wounded several other foreigners , including some U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents .
The new government has opened negotiations with militants through intermediaries but the talks have raised questions in the United States and among some of Pakistan ’s other allies , who fear peace deals will free up Taliban and al Qaeda militants to intensify their war against Western troops in Afghanistan .
The blast coincided with an anti-cartoon rally in the city of Multan attended by about 200 people .
After hearing news of the bomb , some protesters shouted “ Allahu Akbar ” ( God is greatest ) .
“ Whoever commits blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad will face more serious consequences than this , ” said city cleric Intizar Hussain .
“ If it is a suicide attack , then whoever did it will go to heaven . ”
Narration :
This , I 'm embarrassed to say , is my car .
Dr Jonica Newby :
This seat is operated by a spanner ... windscreen wiper fell off last week the back door does n't open .
Narration : Obviously I need a new car - but which ?
It 's a decision most of us face in the next 5 years , only this time it wo n't be a simple choice of brand .
With oil heading for decline , and greenhouse gases soaring , the burning question is - what 's going to replace petrol ?
Dr Jonica Newby : So I 've come to California , hired a 20th century gas guzzling fossil fuel dinosaur ... and we 're heading out on the ultimate road trip in search of the world 's next car fuel - and my next car
Narration : Why California ?
Well , to answer that , let 's hear from the Governator himself .
Governor Schwarzenegger :
We are committed to rolling back our greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2020 .
Narration : California is taking a rebel lead on global warming .
And with transport producing 40 % of all greenhouse gases , legislators here are forcing car companies to make low emissions cars .
Governor Schwarzenegger : " Our cars have been running on dirty fuels for too long .
Our country has been dependent on oil for too long . "
Narration :
And now , I 'm heading for Los Angeles to see one of the hottest petrol replacing contendors .
This is what I 've crossed the world for .
This is the Tesla !
Dr Jonica Newby : I 'm not even into cars - but this - this is seriously exciting .
This car can go from zero to 100 kilometres per hour in just 4 seconds - that 's faster than a Lamborghini .
And would you believe , this car is 100 % powered by electricity .
Narration : Hang on - did n't the electric car die ?
In the recent film " Who killed the electric car " , they even held a funeral .
Dr Jonica Newby :
Well , to hear the extraordinary tale of death and resurrection , let 's meet the man who made the film , electric car activist , Chris Paine .
So this is an electric car .
Is n't the electric car dead ?
Chris Paine :
Well yes .
This generation of electric cars died and actually the previous generation of died too .
In fact electric cars were the first cars on the road but by 1920 the gas car had pretty much taken over .
It was n't until nineteen ninety that a new generation of electric cars came out - really amazing cars - but unfortunately electric cars take on a lot of business interests that are threatened by them .
Narration : In 2004 , General Motors crushed its own electric car fleet .
It seemed the electric car dream was finally over .
Chris Paine :
It was very sad because you saw incredible technology being snuffed out for very stupid reasons .
Narration :
But then , out of nowhere , emerged the Tesla .
And it 's not just the power that makes this car revolutionary .
Until now , electric cars had a range of just 60 miles .
This car can go 250 miles on a single charge .
So what changed ?
The man with the answers is the driving force of Tesla motors , Martin Eberhard .
Dr Jonica Newby :
Is it proving popular ?
Martin
Martin Eberhard : Very much so .
Narration : Eberhard realised the evolution of computers had brought a revolution in batteries rechargeable lithium batteries .
Martin Eberhard : Right .
So inside your , your , your computer you would find 4 or 6 or maybe 8 of these - in the car there 's a few more , yes
Dr Jonica Newby :
How many , how many of these ?
Martin Eberhard : Nearly 7000
Dr Jonica Newby : 7000 of these to fire that one car !
Narration : Electricity is so much more efficient at running an engine than petrol , even if it 's sourced from coal , you halve greenhouse emissions .
Dr Jonica Newby :
That 's pretty exciting , I think I 'm sold .
Narration :
But even if I could afford the $ 100,000 dollar price tag for the Tesla , there 's a major drawback .
Dr Jonica Newby : Now , if I run out of petrol , which in my shonky car happens embarrassingly often , I can call roadside service or take a can to a petrol station .
But if I run out of charge well to use a technical term I 'm stuffed .
Narration :
That 's why the Governator likes a fuel .
Governor Schwarzenegger :
That 's why I launched California 's Hydrogen highway .
We already have several hydrogen fueling stations in our state but we are investing millions more
Narration : Next stop , UC Davis , to meet alternative fuel expert , Professor Dan Sperling .
Dr Jonica Newby :
So this is part of the hydrogen highway ?
Dan Sperling :
Well not only that , it was the very first station on the Californian hydrogen highway .
Narration : Hydrogen has long been the front runner to replace petrol .
This car is a prototype , but the first commercial Hydrogen car has just been released in Germany - though it 'll set you back a few Euros .
At the heart of the Hydrogen car is the fuel cell .
Professor Dan Sperling :
Well a fuel cell is in many ways a very simple device , it takes hydrogen and converts it to electricity , and electricity drives the , the vehicle because it's an electric vehicle , electric motors - and water is the only by - product
Narration :
But hydrogen is n't the only new fuel on the block .
Professor Dan Sperling : This is the UC Davis Bio - gas plant .
It takes waste like food and paper and converts it into energy .
Narration :
There are biofuels such as biodiesel from waste , or ethanol from sugar or corn .
But the greenhouse benefits of many biofuels are disputed - and we simply can't grow enough .
And hydrogen too has flaws .
Dr. Joe Romm :
You need 5 miracles to happen in order to make hydrogen work ; you have to solve the fuel cell problem , and they 're very expensive , you need a major breakthrough ; you have to solve the storage problem
Narration : Dr Joe Romm is the US former acting assistant secretary of energy .
Dr. Joe Romm : Hydrogen 's quite expensive ; someone has to build all the hydrogen fuelling stations ; and then , for hydrogen cars to succeed , all other alternative fuel vehicles pretty much have to fail .
Narration : Even hydrogen supporters admit it 's decades away from being widely viable .
So is n't there a technology that 's ready to replace my gas guzzler now ?
Well , there is one .
It 's a hybrid car , but not as we know it .
It 's a plug in hybrid and the pioneer who 's been developing them for the last 30 years is Engineering Professor , Andy Frank .
The beauty of the plug in hybrid is that the gasoline engine is just a backup - the car travels the first 100 km purely on electricity .
Professor Andrew Frank :
What we 're doing is we 're driving only on electricity at this moment
Dr Jonica Newby : Really , so ah , cost per mile is like , you know , like one 8th the cost of using gasoline in Australia [ chuckles ]
Narration :
If that sounds good , imagine the extra savings - and greenhouse benefits you 'd get - from going solar .
Dr Jonica Newby :
So you could actually generate all your power , house and car , from your own roof ?
Professor Andrew Frank :
That 's correct .
Dr Jonica Newby : I find that utterly inspiring , I really do .
Professor Andrew Frank :
Well , we have to get the car companies to build these things .
Narration : For 30 years , that 's been a losing battle .
But then we heard something so extraordinary , we had to take a detour to the City of Cars itself Detroit .
Dr Jonica Newby :
Well , my road movie seems to have turned into a bit of a thriller .
We 've been picked up and we 're being taken to a secret location , it 's a place film crews have hardly ever been allowed to get into // this could be the world 's first glimpse of the car we 'll all be driving in just a few years time .
Narration :
We 're heading into the high security design studios of the world 's largest car company - General Motors .
Head of development , Jon Lauckner , has just committed to producing the world 's first commercial plug in hybrid within a couple years .
Dr Jonica Newby :
So this is it ?
John Lauckner :
This is it
Dr Jonica Newby :
So this is our Chevrolet concept car to demonstrate our new eflex propulsion system , it 's the first application of eflex .
Dr Jonica Newby : Eflex meaning ?
John Lauckner : E ' standing for electric and ' Flex ' standing for flexibility
Narration :
When the car exceeds electric range , it switches automatically to either petrol , or a biofuel or hydrogen .
John Lauckner :
It 's really to give us the flexibility of a range of propulsion systems and basically reduce and , over time , eliminate our dependency on petroleum fuels .
It 's really the electrification of vehicles on a scale that we have n't seen in the past
Narration : Whoa - did I just hear that ?
Did the company that famously crushed all its electric cars only 3 years ago publicly announce the end of petrol and the age of electric ?
If I had any doubts , this statement from the heartland of the combustion engine has clinched it .
No one knows what will ultimately win out .
The car companies are hedging their bets - developing modular cars that will take any fuel plus electricity .
And if batteries continue to improve , the future will be fully electric .
In the meantime , I 'm left wondering if I can hold off my new car purchase just another few years .
Bring on the plug in hybrid .
WHAT can a demon do for a quantum computer ?
It can slyly trap and cool atoms so that their properties can be measured .
Now a team has brought such a creature to life – using lasers .
The demon in question is based on the one in a thought experiment devised by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 .
He imagined a creature capable of seeing individual atoms in a container of gas that had a central barrier with a tiny trapdoor .
Maxwell ’s demon could sort the atoms according to their energy by opening or shutting the trapdoor to incoming …

It also extracts the corresponding locations , font names , font sizes , writing direction ( horizontal or vertical ) for each text portion .
You need to provide a password for protected PDF documents when its access is restricted .
You cannot extract any text from a PDF document which does not have extraction permission .
Note : Not all characters in a PDF can be safely converted to Unicode .
Examples
$ pdf2txt.py -o output.html samples/naacl06-shinyama.pdf ( extract text as an HTML file whose filename is output.html ) $ pdf2txt .
py - V -c euc - jp -o output . html samples / jo.pdf ( extract a Japanese HTML file in vertical writing , CMap is required ) $ pdf2txt .
py - P mypassword -o output . txt secret.pdf ( extract a text from an encrypted PDF file )
Options
-o filename Specifies the output file name .
By default , it prints the extracted contents to stdout in text format . - p pageno [ , pageno , ...]
Specifies the comma-separated list of the page numbers to be extracted .
Page numbers start at one .
By default , it extracts text from all the pages .
-c codec Specifies the output codec . -t type Specifies the output format .
The following formats are currently supported .
text : TEXT format .
( Default )

tag : " Tagged PDF " format .
A tagged PDF has its own contents annotated with HTML - like tags .
pdf2txt tries to extract its content streams rather than inferring its text locations .
Tags used here are defined in the PDF specification ( See § 10.7 " Tagged PDF " ) .
- I image_directory Specifies the output directory for image extraction .
Currently only JPEG images are supported .
-M char_margin - L line_margin - W word_margin
These are the parameters used for layout analysis .
In an actual PDF file , text portions might be split into several chunks in the middle of its running , depending on the authoring software .
Therefore , text extraction needs to splice text chunks .
In the figure below , two text chunks whose distance is closer than the char_margin ( shown as M ) is considered continuous and get grouped into one .
Also , two lines whose distance is closer than the line_margin ( L ) is grouped as a text box , which is a rectangular area that contains a " cluster " of text portions .
Furthermore , it may be required to insert blank characters ( spaces ) as necessary if the distance between two words is greater than the word_margin ( W ) , as a blank between words might not be represented as a space , but indicated by the positioning of each word .
Each value is specified not as an actual length , but as a proportion of the length to the size of each character in question .
The default values are M = 1.0 , L = 0.3 , and W = 0.2 , respectively .
→ ← M Q u i c k b r o w n f o x ↓ → ← W L j u m p s ... ↑ -F boxes_flow Specifies how much a horizontal and vertical position of a text matters when determining a text order .
The value should be within the range of - 1.0 ( only horizontal position matters ) to +1.0 ( only vertical position matters ) .
The default value is 0.5 .
- C Suppress object caching .
This will reduce the memory consumption but also slows down the process .
-n Suppress layout analysis .
- A
Forces to perform layout analysis for all the text strings , including text contained in figures .
- V
Allows vertical writing detection .
-Y layout_mode Specifies how the page layout should be preserved .
( Currently only applies to HTML format . ) exact : preserve the exact location of each individual character ( a large and messy HTML ) .
: preserve the exact location of each individual character ( a large and messy HTML ) .
normal : preserve the location and line breaks in each text block .
( Default )
: preserve the location and line breaks in each text block .
( Default ) loose : preserve the overall location of each text block .
- E extractdir Specifies the extraction directory of embedded files .
-s scale Specifies the output scale .
Can be used in HTML format only .
-m maxpages Specifies the maximum number of pages to extract .
By default , it extracts all the pages in a document .
- P password Provides the user password to access PDF contents .
-d Increases the debug level .
dumppdf.py dumps the internal contents of a PDF file in pseudo - XML format .
This program is primarily for debugging purposes , but it's also possible to extract some meaningful contents ( such as images ) .
Examples
$ dumppdf.py - a foo.pdf ( dump all the headers and contents , except stream objects ) $ dumppdf.py - T foo.pdf ( dump the table of contents ) $ dumppdf.py -r - i6 foo.pdf > pic.jpeg ( extract a JPEG image )
Options
-a Instructs to dump all the objects .
By default , it only prints the document trailer ( like a header ) .
- i objno , objno , ... Specifies PDF object IDs to display .
Comma - separated IDs , or multiple - i options are accepted .
- p pageno , pageno , ... Specifies the page number to be extracted .
Comma - separated page numbers , or multiple -p options are accepted .
Note that page numbers start at one , not zero . -r ( raw ) - b ( binary ) -t ( text ) Specifies the output format of stream contents .
Because the contents of stream objects can be very large , they are omitted when none of the options above is specified .
With -r option , the " raw " stream contents are dumped without decompression .
With - b option , the decompressed contents are dumped as a binary blob .
With -t option , the decompressed contents are dumped in a text format , similar to repr ( ) manner .
When -r or - b option is given , no stream header is displayed for the ease of saving it to a file .
- T
Shows the table of contents .
- E directory Extracts embedded files from the pdf into the given directory .
- P password Provides the user password to access PDF contents .
-d Increases the debug level .

The nation ’s pediatricians are recommending wider cholesterol screening for children and more aggressive use of cholesterol - lowering drugs starting as early as the age of 8 in hopes of preventing adult heart problems .
The new guidelines were to be issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday .
The push to aggressively screen and medicate for high cholesterol in children is certain to create controversy amid a continuing debate about the use of prescription drugs in children as well as the best approaches to ward off heart disease in adults .
But proponents say there is growing evidence that the first signs of heart disease show up in childhood , and with 30 percent of the nation ’s children overweight or obese , many doctors fear that a rash of early heart attacks and diabetes is on the horizon as these children grow up .
Previously , the academy had said cholesterol drugs should be considered in children older than 10 if they fail to lose weight after a 6 - to 12 - month effort .
The academy estimated that under the current guidelines , 30 percent to 60 percent of children with high cholesterol were being missed .
And for some children , cholesterol - lowering drugs , called statins , may be their best hope of lowering their risk of early heart attack , proponents said .
" The Innovator 's Dilemma " is finally catching up with Microsoft .
As Gartner analyst Michael Silver declares ( and ZDNet 's Larry Dignan captures ) ,
Microsoft 's Windows juggernaut is collapsing as it tries to support 20 years of applications and becomes more complicated by the minute .
Meanwhile , Windows has outgrown hardware and customers are pondering skipping Vista to wait for Windows 7 .
If Windows is going to remain relevant it will need radical changes .... " Windows is too monolithic , " says Silver .
That monolithic nature will become ever less relevant as more and more applications are written for the web ... and simply wo n't care what OS is running on the client .
Gartner figures that 2011 will represent a tipping point when developers will care more about developing for the Web than for the desktop .
Ironically , Gartner 's recommendations for how Windows should change sound eerily like a recommendation to become ... Linux :
Windows should be able to be tailored to specific applications .
Linux has been doing this for years , modular as it is .
Linux reigns in embedded devices and scales up to the most demanding high - performance computing needs .
Whatever the application , Linux has been tailored to fit it .
Windows can't compete .
. Linux has been doing this for years , modular as it is .

Better security .
Because Windows tries to be all things to all people , it ends up being a security nightmare for one key demographic :
The malevolent hacker ( " cracker " ) .
Applications should n't be given rights they do n't need .
Linux has this down pat .
Windows ?
Gartner believes a significant overhaul is required .

. " Application packaging takes forever , says Silver .... The fix is to reinstall everything and rebuild the PC . "
Not a problem on Linux .
Simplify licensing to focus on specific devices .
Again , this is a problem born of Microsoft 's success .
It 's not an issue that plagues Linux , which has licensing that encourages widespread , disparate use , and does n't try to manacle its developers .
It was bound to happen , and now it has .
Microsoft has simply become too big for its own good or , rather , for its customers ' good .
It 's time for application developers to start over with an operating syste that encourages customization , personalization , and ( for security ) isolation .
Linux , in other words .
Have you heard of it ?
Kerry Howley has a fascinating piece in Reason on fertility panics .
Let me make a few points I consider obvious : entitlements are not a reason to have more children , natalist panics often have an unpleasant flavor of racism to them , and ever - increasing populations are neither sustainable nor desireable .
The transition we are currently facing will be moderately difficult , but as I wrote for The Atlantic , it will not be a disaster , and at the end of the transition , we will still be a wealthy society with a lot to live for .
That said , I think Will Wilkinson goes too far when he says
The way I see it , those obsessed with fertility are people who think the culture they desire cannot possibly win the argument against competing cultures .
So , they conclude , it ’s down to brute baby - making force : the culture that wins the fertility war wins the culture war .
In contrast , I think liberal market culture has such immense , salient rewards ( wealth , longevity , happiness , etc. ) that it is not only possible to win the argument , but that we are in fact winning it .
Of course , part of the winning is dynamist cultural synthesis .
So if you ’ve got a conservative , zoological view of cultural preservation which fixes on the importance of high - fidelity copying of inessential aspects of a culture ’s history ( costumes , holidays , rites , cuisine , skin colors etc. ) , you ’re going to have a hard time of it .
But if you care about the essential core of liberal modernity , you should be delighted with how things are going .
You ’ll eat your szechuan taco pizza and you ’ll love it .
Cultures do n't have " arguments " .
The most important core beliefs most people have are transmitted not through dialogue , but through inheritance .
It is extremely likely that you share the political views of your parents , their religious affiliation , and at a less obvious level , their beliefs about things like what constitutes stealing and lawbreaking , and what are justified evasions of petty laws .
My mother is the one who would make us turn around and drive twenty miles back to the store if it turned out we 'd forgotten to pay for things , and I now have the same attitude .
The overwhelming evidence is that when it comes to culture , numbers trump ideas .
in the successive invasions of England , for example , the locals always won unless they were wiped out ; the conquerors assimilated .
Or look at America .
More people here claim descent from the Irish than the English ; numerically , Irish Americans are the largest single - country ethnic group .
Yet our culture is much more heavily derived from English Prostentantism than from Irish Catholicism .
That 's because the earlier waves of assimilated immigrants had adopted the fundamentally British culture of America , and outnumbering the Irish , forced them to assimilate .
Successive waves of immigrants have each left their cultural mark , changing ( I devoutly believe ) us for the better , and also to something that cannot be called British .
But the dominant strain remains English .
Cultures that " win " the argument in territory outside their own do so by killing , swamping , or removing the previous inhabitants .
Food is awesome , but it is culturally trivial .
A little while ago , I said that I thought that liberals underestimated the extent to which the welfare state is spending down cultural capital accumulated in an era before safety nets .
Similarly , I think libertarians tend to vastly underestimate the extent to which liberalism and free markets are sustained not by proclaimed belief or legal institutions , but by unobserved cultural norms that are transmitted slowly , if at all .
Mexico can see all the things that are better about the US , none of which are particularly difficult to reproduce at the institutional level , but enforcement depends on things like a visceral indignant reaction to policemen who take bribes , rather than an attempt to work the system by developing friends in the police force .
Tyler Cowen now believes that returning immigrants are shifting those norms , but we 're talking about a process of decades , if not centuries .
I deeply enjoy having access to world music , world art , world food -- but none of them improves my life as much as living in a country with robust cultural support for individual freedom , democracy , capitalism , and liberalism .
Countries that have a real natalist problem -- not America or most of Europe , by the way -- are right to worry .
If Israel is demographically swamped by the Arabs in the occupied territory ( as they will be if they do n't reach a two - state solution pretty quickly ) , the character of the country will change dramatically .
You 'll still be able to get kosher sausage , but the way the government and civil society work will change dramatically , and in many ways not for the better .
Likewise , the Protestants in Northern Ireland were perfectly correct to be concerned that if the Catholics reached a majority , their country would change a great deal .
I do n't think natalism is the right way to deal with this problem ; I think the answer is to handle immigration in a way that allows the immigrants to be easily assimilated into your culture .
To the extent that Europe does face a threat from immigration , it 's because their policies flatly discourage assimilation .
On the one hand , they lavish welfare benefits on immigrants and often make extensive accomodation to their interest groups ; on the other , their employment system discriminates , their culture does not consider immigrants to be real members of society , and when they do attempt to encourage assimilation , they do so through ham - fisted authoritarian measures like the French ban on headscarves .
America does very well with a policy of benign neglect : no one 's going to force you to assimilate , but you 'll have a hell of a hard time staying here unless you do .
I 'm enough of a cultural relativist to believe that other cultures have a perfect right not to adopt American values , but enough of a cultural hegemonist to know that I want my country to maintain the dominant American culture .
I will be thrilled to have new generations of immigrants contributing their music , their food , their religion , their community life -- but I do not want them contributing their ideas about the rule of law , or indeed , what constitutes acceptable behavior in a queue .
I think it is possible to achieve this happy balance without having nine kids -- and without freaking out at the thought that future Americans will not share my green eyes , snub nose , and near - flourescent albedo .
Youth held for raping 78 - yr - old grandmother Text Size : | NEW DELHI : A 28 - year - old man has been charged with raping his 78 - year - old grandmother at Jaffarpur in south - west Delhi on Tuesday night .
The incident came to light when neighbours found the victim crying outside her house early on Wednesday morning .
After the victim narrated her plight , the neighbours informed the police .
The accused , a daily wage labourer , was reportedly drunk at the time of the incident .
" We received a call around 7 am and rushed to the victim 's residence where we found the accused sleeping .
We arrested him and took the victim for medical tests to Rao Tula Ram Hospital , " said an official from Jaffarpur police station .
He added that the MLC report confirmed rape and the accused was booked for the same .
The accused married three years ago and is the father of an infant daughter .
Reportedly , his wife left him two weeks ago following some dispute .
Incidentally , the accused had been brought up by his grandmother and not his parents .
" It is the most disgusting and disturbing incident .
The victim is in a state of shock .
We have informed the victim 's son about the incident , " said a police official .

THROUGH GOOD presidents and bad , the US Justice Departments career attorneys have done their best to uphold high , nonpartisan standards in enforcing the nations laws .
That fell apart under President Bush , according to a report this week by the departments own inspector general , Glenn Fine , and its Office of Professional Responsibility .
Investigators found that applicants for both career and political posts had to pass tests of loyalty to conservative politics .
The most flagrant enforcers of an ideological litmus test have since left the department and are not subject to administrative discipline , but Attorney General Michael Mukasey should order prosecutors to determine whether they committed perjury in statements about their activities .
In a textbook example of how politicizing the department can harm the nation , the report pointed to the case of an applicant who was a highly qualified career counter - terror prosecutor .
The department rejected him because of his wifes Democratic politics and instead chose a much less experienced lawyer with Republican credentials .
Last month , Fine reported on the departments use of an ideological test to pick interns and young lawyers for a special honors program .
The new report shows just how widespread the practice was and calls for a tougher response from Mukasey , who said this week that he was disturbed by the findings and determined to keep political considerations out of hiring decisions .
Prosecuting officials for perjury and using subpoenas to get testimony from former White House aides like Karl Rove about their role in politicizing Justice would be an excellent way to make sure future presidents are not tempted to make the department a wing of their own political party .
Yesterday , the House Judiciary Committee voted to bring contempt charges against Rove for not responding to its own subpoena .
The ranking Republican on the panel , Lamar Smith of Texas , called the majoritys action a witch hunt ,  but the committee is justified in seeking out who encouraged the political hiring and who orchestrated the firing of nine Bush - appointed US attorneys in 2006 .
According to the report , the attorney general at the time , Alberto Gonzales , told Fine he was not aware that his aides were using political criteria in hiring decisions .
This confession of cluelessness echoes statements Gonzales made last year about the purge of the US attorneys and only strengthens the suspicion that Justice officials were getting marching orders from the White House .
Congress and Mukasey owe the nation a fuller explanation of what went wrong in Bushs Justice Department .

On Friday , Hezbollah gunmen set fire to the Beirut offices of Future TV , a Lebanese broadcaster .
On a purely symbolic level , it was an apt demonstration of where the Party of God stands in relation to the future itself .
But that was n't the worst of what has happened in the past week in Lebanon , where scores of people have been killed in interfactional violence .
More ominous was the role of the Lebanese army , avowedly neutral and nominally under civilian control .

California 's housing market may be entering a scarier phase : the point at which homeowners walk because the house is n't appreciating , not because they can't afford it .
Banks are worried .
A Federal Reserve survey in January 2008 found that loan officers " are concerned with borrowers ' reduced motivation to retain possession of their properties . "
And Calculated Risk , a blog , posted a quote from Wachovia Bank 's January 2008 conference call : " One of the challenges is ... a lot of these current losses have been coming out of California ... from people that have otherwise had the capacity to pay , but have basically just decided not to because they feel like they 've lost equity , value in their properties , and ... we 're just going to have to see how the patterns unfold here . "
Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis said , " There 's been a change in social attitudes toward default ...
We 're seeing people who are current on their credit cards but are defaulting on their mortgages ...
I 'm astonished that people would walk away from their homes . "
If income indicates ability to pay , down payment is an incentive to pay - skin in the game .
In California , lenders are generally barred from getting money from a defaulting borrower .
The lender gets the house and that 's it , even if the borrower has $ 1 million in the bank .
Only judicial foreclosure allows the lender to get the borrower 's other assets , but it 's slow , expensive and encourages a defense of loan origination fraud .
Buying a house with little down is like having your cake and eating it , too .
If the house appreciates , you keep the riches ; if it does n't , you walk and lose only what you put down , often nothing .
It 's wrong to insure such losses with taxpayer money .
Laws limiting investor liability are everywhere .
If you own stock in a company that goes bankrupt , you do n't feel a moral obligation to pay the company 's creditors , because the law limits your liability .
But the government does n't guarantee those creditors ' losses - and it should n't do so in the housing market , either .
Visit www.uwalkaway.com, a company that sells kits explaining a homeowner 's right to walk if the house is n't a good deal anymore .
And " 60 Minutes " recently featured a couple who explained they could afford their mortgage payments , but the house was " worth less , " so why pay ?
Who loses if the trend grows ?
The biggest loser will be mortgage bond investors , and next is originating banks and investment banks ( because investors will try to sue for fraud and misrepresentation ) .
Homeowners who put zero or 5 percent down lose little more than outsized hopes of future riches .
And as uwalkaway.com notes , eight months of " free rent " will help them feel better .
Now that Congress has passed higher loan limits for Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration , Americans will lose because investors facing losses can get paid by Fannie , Freddie and FHA .
In the future , Congress should require California to allow lenders to garnish wages of affluent borrowers who walk away from their homes .
It 's dishonest to have it both ways : ( 1 ) federal tax money backstops investor and bank losses when homeowners walk away from homes , and ( 2 ) California law allows homeowners to walk away without liability - even if they have money to pay .
It 's not that the California statute is bad alone ; it 's that it 's wrong for federal taxes to guarantee huge loans without homeowners guaranteeing those loans too .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote last Monday , " Unfortunately , the California families most hurt ( by inability to get affordable mortgage credit ) are in lower - and moderate - income brackets . "
Then , he magically ties this to raising the loan caps to $ 729,750 .
But 2006 California median family income was $ 64,563 .
This is n't an anti-poverty plan .
Even Marin , California 's top 2006 county for median family income , was $ 99,713 - too low to benefit from the higher caps .
I see how politicians could confuse median family income , because they do n't hang out at places where they 'd meet a median income earner .
The new increase in the loan caps is nothing more than a handout .
It 's welfare for the wealthy - a group that tirelessly touts free market principles .
Raising the caps is morally wrong , and it's also bad policy .
In 2007 , the United States Forest Service ( USFS ) spent $ 1.37 billion fighting wildfires , up from $ 307 million ten years ago .
This year , that number will be much greater due to the 2008 California Firestorm .
For example , the Lime Complex in the Shasta - Trinity National Forest , which is not contained , has a current cost ( 7/28/08 ) of $ 38,627,355 !
How will financially strapped California and the USFS pay for these fires and did these fires grow larger because of Bush administration budget cuts ?
Year after year , Bush has cut funding from the USFS , yet within this budget , more money is allocated for fire management and less for fire prevention .
In February , 2008 , Bush proposed decreasing fire preparedness monies by 11 percent .
Although the budget calls for a $ 150 million increase for extinguishing blazes , prevention funding is slashed by $ 77 million , including a $ 13 million reduction in small fuels removal .
Similar cuts were proposed in 2007 .
Casey Judd , business manager for the Federal Wildland Fire Service Association , a firefighter employee group explains , “ The administration still has it backward .
Preparedness should be the focus , not suppression . ”
Norm Dicks , D - Wash . , adds , “ Common sense would be that if you put more money into fuel reduction , it ’s going to have an effect on having less severe fires . ”
The White House response was that money could be shifted between the agency ’s firefighting and fire suppression accounts , as needed .
This is exactly what concerns USFS employees with the current California wildfires .
After last week ’s community meeting with the incident team , I asked an information officer about how these fires would be paid for after the season ends .
Jim responded exactly with the answer the White House gave in February , money would be shifted within the budget , and he feared that the USFS would simply become a firefighting agency if the current trend continues :
No more money for fire prevention , recreation , roads , etc .
This may not come to fruition , as Congress is debating the creation of a separate federal account to handle catastrophic wildfires .
Furthermore , financially strapped California will not be left high and dry for the CalFire incidents it has managed .
FEMA will reimburse California 75 % of firefighting costs this year , and the agency is providing emergency funding .
Meanwhile , California is debating tax for home owners living in fire - prone areas .
There are no simple solutions to the 2008 California wildfires , and it is hard to be prepared for the magnitude of this firestorm .
Obviously , Bush did not start these fires , but his budget cuts have contributed to how the USFS has been able to resolve the effects of a hundred years of fire suppression .
Fire preparedness should be a high budget priority .
In Gore ’s recent speech , the former Vice President explained it well why we should concerned :
Today , unprecedented fires are burning in California and elsewhere in the American west .
Higher temperatures lead to drier vegetation that makes kindling for mega - fires of the kind that have been raging in Canada , Greece , Russia , China , South America , Australia , and Africa .
Scientists in the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Science at Tel Aviv University tell us that for every one degree increase in temperature , lightning strikes will go up another 10 percent .
And it is lightning , after all , that is principally responsible for igniting the conflagration in California today .
Fire suppression and fire preparedness go hand in hand .

I do n’t think Gerald is having the drug problem they were having .
I ’ve heard from some residents who were thrilled that he was there . ”
There were numerous arrests during Mr. Jakob ’s time in Gerald ( the exact number is uncertain , local law enforcement officials said , as legal action surrounding the case proceeds ) , but Mayor Schulte said that Mr. Jakob had , in fact , gone to elaborate lengths to deceive local authorities , including Ryan McCrary , then the police chief , into believing that he was a federal agent  with the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Marshal ’s Service or some other federal agency .
In addition to having a badge and a car that seemed to scream law enforcement , Mr. Jakob offered federal drug enforcement help , Mr. Schulte said , ( a notion local officials said must have somehow grown out of their recent application for a federal grant for radio equipment ) and asked Chief McCrary to call what he said was his supervisor ’s telephone number to confirm Gerald ’s need for his help .
When the call was placed , a woman  whose identity is unknown  answered with the words “ multijurisdictional task force , ” and said that the city ’s request for federal services was under review , the mayor said .
Mr. Schulte said he now suspects that Mr. Jakob adapted the nonexistent task force name from the “ Beverly Hills Cop ” movies starring Eddie Murphy .
“ Not only were these officers taken in , but so was everybody else , ” said Chet Pleban , a lawyer for Mr. McCrary and the other two members of the police force who lost their jobs after Mr. Jakob ’s real identity came to light .
Of the firings , Mayor Schulte said , “ Nobody wanted to , but the city ’s lawyer recommended it . ”
When residents first began noticing Mr. Jakob , he certainly looked the part .
His hair was chopped short , residents recalled , and his stocky chest filled a black T - shirt he sometimes wore that read POLICE .
They said he wore military - style boots , pants with pockets running down the legs and carried a badge ( his lawyer said it was from a former job as a security guard in St. Louis ) .
And his off - white Crown Victoria was decked out with police radios and internal flashing lights , residents said .
“ With one stroke of his pen , the President has ensured that the truth behind his unprecedented domestic spying regime will never see the light of day .

I can only hope that the courts will be able to correct the mistake the Congress and President have made . ”
The case was filed on behalf of a broad coalition of attorneys and human rights , labor , legal and media organizations whose ability to perform their work -- which relies on confidential communications -- will be greatly compromised by the new law .
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , passed by Congress on Wednesday and signed by President Bush today , not only legalizes the secret warrantless surveillance program the president approved in late 2001 , it gives the government new spying powers , including the power to conduct dragnet surveillance of Americans ’ international communications .
“ Spying on Americans without warrants or judicial approval is an abuse of government power -- and that ’s exactly what this law allows .
The ACLU will not sit by and let this evisceration of the Fourth Amendment go unchallenged , ” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero .
“ Electronic surveillance must be conducted in a constitutional manner that affords the greatest possible protection for individual privacy and free speech rights .
The new wiretapping law fails to provide fundamental safeguards that the Constitution unambiguously requires . ”
In today ’s legal challenge , the ACLU argues that the new spying law violates Americans ’ rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution .
The new law permits the government to conduct intrusive surveillance without ever telling a court who it intends to spy on , what phone lines and email addresses it intends to monitor , where its surveillance targets are located , why it ’s conducting the surveillance or whether it suspects any party to the communication of wrongdoing .
... The ACLU ’s legal challenge , which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today , seeks a court order declaring that the new law is unconstitutional and ordering its
immediate and permanent halt .
Earlier , I mentioned -- in a lengthy post -- that Blue America is donating funds to some of the progressives who opposed Bush and his Republican and Blue Dog allies on FISA .
Obviously none of this money is going to Barack Obama , the Democrat 's presidential candidate who supported Chris Dodd 's amendment stripping retroactive immunity for the telecoms out of the FISA bill but who then voted for the fatally flawed overall bill -- unlike Dodd , Feingold , Tester ... or even Hillary .
That does n't mean he still is n't a billion times better than John McCain .
But the Blue America vs Retroactive Immunity Fund is n't about that .
It 's about protecting the Constitution and the rule of law .
Obama erred ; he 's a politician and I hope that is n't news to you .
McCain , enthusiastically supporting both warrantless wiretaps and retroactive immunity -- while taking the biggest bribes from the Telecoms of anyone in government ( $ 365,955 this year alone ) -- did n't bother showing up to even vote yesterday .
Meanwhile , one of the senators we want to honor , Chris Dodd issued an encouraging statement this morning , promising to continue the fight he has so relentless led : I like his spirit .
" The Courts , " on the other hand ... well , that concept gets me a little nervous .
But the ACLU is ready for action .
Today they filed a landmark lawsuit to stop the government from conducting surveillance under a new wiretapping law that gives the Bush Regime virtually unchecked power to intercept Americans ’ international e-mails and telephone calls .

Clinton 's RFK comments provide a vivid example of how modern journalism has become a hyperkinetic child .
How small stories become big news
The signature defect of modern political journalism is that it has shredded the ideal of proportionality .
Important stories , sometimes the product of months of serious reporting , that in an earlier era would have captured the attention of the entire political - media community and even redirected the course of a presidential campaign , these days can disappear with barely a whisper .
Advertisement
Trivial stories — the kind that are tailor - made for forwarding to your brother - in - law or college roommate with a wisecracking note at the top — can dominate the campaign narrative for days .
Who can guess what stories will cause the media machine to rev up its hype jets ?
Actually , I have gotten pretty good at guessing which ones will .
So have many of my colleagues and a generation of political operatives .
This weekend ’s uproar over Hillary Rodham Clinton invoking the assassination of Robert Kennedy as rationale for continuing her presidential campaign is an especially vivid example of modern journalism as hyperkinetic child — overstimulated by speed and hunger for a head - turning angle that will draw an audience .
The truth about what Clinton said — and any fair - minded appraisal of what she meant — was entirely beside the point .
Her comment was news by any standard .
But it was only big news when wrested from context and set aflame by a news media more concerned with being interesting and provocative than with being relevant or serious .
Thus , the story made the front page of The New York Times , was the lead story of The Washington Post and got prominent treatment on the evening news on ABC , CBS and NBC .
What gives ?
I should say at the outset that I have a pretty good vantage point on this particular case — both as witness of and participant in the echo chamber .
On Friday afternoon , I heard my colleague , Politico reporter Jonathan Martin , bellow in excitement as he called me over to his desk .
Martin was furiously typing away , not looking up as he told me the latest : Clinton had given an interview to the editorial board of the Argus Leader newspaper in South Dakota in which she answered inquiries into why she is staying in the race by citing the fact that it ’s only May , and RFK had been shot and killed in June .
Here is what I was thinking : Wow .
Maybe she has come unhinged ?
It ’s not as though such macabre thoughts have never occurred to me , but for Clinton to give public voice to such a scenario is bizarre .
This is going to be a big story and is almost certainly going to shadow and quite likely accelerate the final chapter of her presidential campaign .
Here is what I said : Martin , quick get that item up !
He needed no prompting .
As leaders of a new publication , Politico ’s senior editors and I are relentlessly focused on audience traffic .
The way to build traffic on the Web is to get links from other websites .
The way to get links is to be first with news — sometimes big news , sometimes small — that drives that day ’s conversation .
We are unapologetic in our premium on high velocity .
In this focus on links and traffic we are not different from nearly all news sites these days , not just new publications but established ones like The New York Times .
There are probably a dozen websites with a heavy political emphasis whose links are sought by all for the traffic those links drive .
Martin was quick getting the item about Clinton ’s Argus Leader comment up on his Politico blog .
But not as quick as The New York Post , which was the first outside South Dakota to notice Clinton ’s inflammatory remarks ( Martin himself knew about Clinton ’s remarks from the New York tabloid ’s story ) .
The Associated Press , in what looked at first blush like a classic example of what reporters call “ burying the lead , ” had no mention of Clinton ’s RFK remarks in its original dispatch on the interview .
I urged Martin to keep his foot on the gas :
Be the first to post reaction from the Obama campaign .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton quickly obliged , denouncing Clinton ’s comments and saying such sentiments have “ no place in this campaign . ”
Burton ’s comments quickly went into Martin ’s blog post .
Soon enough , several websites and cable news outlets were giving the story trumpet - blaring treatment .
Perhaps half an hour after the story broke Martin called me back over to his desk .
It turned out the Argus Leader had video of its big interview .
I huddled over Martin ’s computer as we watched .
It was a deflating experience .
The RFK remarks were deep in a 20 - minute clip of an otherwise routine conversation .
Then , once we actually got to the relevant portion of the video , it was hardly an electric moment .
Clinton does indeed mention the Kennedy assassination , speaking in a calm and analytical tone : “ My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ?
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . ”
Martin and I both thought we saw a slight twinge in Clinton ’s facial expression , as though she recognized she had just said something dumb .
Whether she recognized it or not , she had .
But it was also clear that Clinton ’s error was not in saying something beyond the pale but in saying something that pulled from context would sound as if it were beyond the pale .
It would be a big story if Clinton said something like this : “ Hey , I know it looks bad for me now .
But , think about it .
Obama could get shot and I ’d get to be the nominee after all . ”
It is a small story if Clinton said something like this : “ Everyone talks like May is incredibly late , but by historical standards it is not .
Think of all the famous milestones in presidential races that have taken place during June . ”
It seems pretty obvious that the latter is what Clinton meant , and not too far from what she actually said .
It was not surprising that the Argus Leader ’s executive editor , Randall Beck , put out a statement saying , “ Her reference to Mr. Kennedy ’s assassination appeared to focus on the time line of his primary candidacy and not the assassination itself . ”
Make no mistake .
Clinton stepped on a rake with her comment and got bopped in the face .
This was entertaining political slapstick , for those of us who like that kind of thing .
Little wonder she apologized .
But Clinton ’s clumsiness does not excuse news media clumsiness in making a minor story seem like a major one .
A note on the randomness of the news :
If this really was a big story , then the media has blown it for months .
Clinton made similar remarks to Time magazine back in March .
( The Wall Street Journal reporter with Clinton has an entertaining look at how the pack traveling with the candidate initially missed the story . )
Keeping one ’s journalistic bearings amid a hype storm is a challenge for every publication , this one included .
In the early months of this publication ( we launched in January 2007 ) , a short news item broken by Ben Smith about John Edwards ’ $ 400 haircut became one of our most - trafficked stories .
I thought we handled that news nugget with a decent sense of proportion .
The item , for instance , never led our site .
But it ’s true I was not exactly despairing when other websites and cable TV networks went way overboard on the story , with citations to Politico .
Nor is this column intended as a mea culpa for Hillary Hype .
Velocity is a virtue in the Web world , and we are not going to stop trying to be fast off the mark — for relevant and fairly reported stories .
What Clinton said about Robert Kennedy , whether it was cold or just a bit clueless , was newsworthy , and Martin ’s original blog post was responsible in framing the context of her remark .
He was equally quick to post her clarification and apology .
The uproar was never the lead of our site .
But it was striking to see the broadcast networks and big papers , which were still going at full boil that evening and the next morning even though they had plenty of time to assess the ( dwindling ) significance of the story as the day wore on .
( Meanwhile Friday , Obama was giving a major foreign - policy speech in Miami to unveil his plan for Latin America . )
In an earlier era , these establishment outlets prized their role in promoting and preserving high standards of relevance .
In this era , with their business model challenged by the Web and other forces , and in the same scramble for audience as everyone else , these fabled elite media organs are if anything more buffeted by sensationalism and whimsy than their new media counterparts .
Once , the elite papers and network news set the agenda , and others followed suit , following up on what these establishment pillars deemed important .
Now it ’s just the opposite .
The conservative old voices increasingly take their cues from the newer , more daring ones .
The distinguishing feature of most political hype storms is that they pass quickly .
Who the hell can remember what we were up in arms about last month ?
Was n’t it something about Sinbad and a telecom lobbyist who was bitter about being a Muslim ?
In that sense , a news culture in which — like the amplifiers for “ Spinal Tap ” that go up to 11 — everything is exaggerated may not seem like a big deal .
But the consequences are more serious than meets the eye .
The uproar du jour mentality in the media can be a hassle for public officials , but it can also be their friend .
Hillary Clinton , for instance , can be glad that a serious look by The New York Times about Bill Clinton ’s dealings with a Canadian tycoon trying to curry favor with a dictatorship never generated much interest from other media .
Politicians know that as long as they have a base of support they can probably ride out any story confident that the pack will soon move on .
Only a news media with the focus and discipline to distinguish a big story from a small one can hold politicians accountable — and produce the work that deserves an audience .
Researchers are working on a thermoelectric generator that converts the heat from car exhaust fumes into electricity .
The module feeds the energy into the car ’s electronic systems .
This cuts fuel consumption and helps reduce the CO 2 emissions from motor vehicles .
In an age of dwindling natural resources , energy - saving is the order of the day .
However , many technical processes use less than one - third of the energy they employ .
This is particularly true of automobiles , where two - thirds of the fuel is emitted unused in the form of heat .
About 30 percent is lost through the engine block , and a further 30 to 35 percent as exhaust fumes .
Scientists all over the world are developing ways of harnessing the unused waste heat from cars , machines and power stations , in order to lower their fuel consumption .
There is clearly a great need for thermoelectric generators , or TEGs for short .
These devices convert heat into electrical energy by making use of a temperature gradient .
The greater the temperature difference , the more current TEGs can produce .
Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques IPM are developing thermoelectric materials , modules and systems to harness the residual heat in automobiles .
“ The temperatures in the exhaust pipe can reach 700 degrees Celsius or more , ” says Dr. Harald Böttner , head of the Thermoelectric Systems department .
“ The temperature difference between the exhaust pipe and a pipe carrying engine cooling fluid can thus be several hundred degrees Celsius . ”
The thermoelectric converter makes use of this huge differential : Driven by the flow of heat between the hot exhaust fumes and the cold side of a coolant pipe , the charge carriers pass through special semiconductors , thus producing an electric current similar to a batterie .
The long - term objective is to make the alternator superfluous and to supply energy to the constantly rising number of power consumers in the car .
TEGs could cover a significant proportion of a car ’s power requirements : “ This would make it possible to cut gas consumption by between five and seven percent , ” says Böttner .
A simple calculation will illustrate how important it is to increase the energy efficiency of cars :
There are about 50 million licensed motor vehicles in Germany , each of which is – as a basis for an estimation – on the road for an average of 200 hours a year .
If their waste heat was utilized by TEGs during that time , with an output of one kilowatt sufficient to power parts of vehicle electronics , this would add up to ten terawatt hours of energy per annum – a significant contribution .
The researchers are still in the experimentation phase at present , but they plan to build the first prototypes very soon .
In both Brazil and Kansas , the medical records of thousands of women who had undergone an abortion were ordered turned over to the police .
Women in Brazil are being prosecuted .
Is America far behind ?
What does Kansas have in common with the southern Brazilian state of Mato Grosso de Sul ?
No , not samba , tropical drinks , or a tropical rain forest .
These two distant lands are united in their desire to intimidate and harass women who have had abortions .
In Mato Grosso de Sul , a police raid of a clinic suspected of providing abortions resulted in the interrogation of nearly 10,000 women , whose records were found there , on suspicion of having abortions in 1999 - 2001 .
At this time , 36 women have been prosecuted ; an additional 2,215 records have yet to be fully reviewed , but it is anticipated that approximately 1,000 women will ultimately be prosecuted and convicted .
The official penalty for a woman who has willingly induced an abortion in Brazil is up to one to three years in prison .
But the punishment meted out to the 36 women by the judge that ordered the investigation is community service at a local orphanage – just the kind of humiliation that should serve to shame them further .
This might seem unsurprising in a country where abortion is highly restricted , but a similar case has taken place in our own country .
In Kansas , Women ’s Health Care Services , where Dr. George Tiller is a late term abortion provider , was ordered to turn over clinic records of about 2,000 women to police to determine if an illegal abortion procedure had occurred .
Despite the considerable efforts of Kansans for Life and the invoking of a 19th century law , the clinic was able to block the subpoena and the grand jury refused to indict Dr. Tiller .

There is a key difference in the two situations :
In Brazil , abortion is a criminal offense and is only permitted in cases of rape or to save the life of a woman whereas in the United States abortion is legal , though states have imposed restrictions .
The criminalization of this very common procedure ( 1.3 million abortions take place in Brazil ) , results in the hospitalization of 250,000 Brazilian women with complications from unsafe abortion every year .
In the United States the incidence of abortion is almost the same ( in 2005 , there were 1.2 million abortions in the United States ) , but complications and hospitalizations are extremely rare , largely because abortion is legal .
But if opponents of women ’s rights have their way , how much longer will American women stay safe ?
The harassment of abortion providers and the seizure of clinic records is simply another tactic to punish women for exercising their right to choose when and whether to be pregnant .
Anyone who helps them on this path will be harassed and exposed .
It ’s clear from both of these cases that opponents of abortion are not simply concerned with a few restrictions here and there .
They want to be sure that women and doctors alike are hauled into the public square and condemned openly for ensuring that women have control over their reproductive destinies .
But research in Brazil , and elsewhere , shows that legal restrictions will not keep women from ending unwanted pregnancies .
They will risk their lives to do it if safe , legal , respectful , high - quality care is not available .
We know this .
We also know that the easiest way to prevent deaths and injuries is to ensure that this care is available .
In Brazil , Ipas has created a campaign to get Brazilians thinking about the consequences of criminalized abortion , called " Think about it " ( " Vai pensando aí , " in Portuguese ) .
Perhaps we need to start a similar campaign in the United States .
After all , what would the consequences for women be if those who drove the campaign to " out " women in the courts in Kansas were successful around the country ?
What if women knew that their doctor might be forced to hand over their private medical records to the courts for inspection , second guessing their medical judgment ?
We already have a situation where an abortion procedure is the only medical procedure ever to be adjudicated by the Supreme Court .
Are we willing to imprison women and their providers for abortion ?
Think about it .

It is well - known that Vincent van Gogh often painted over his older works .
Experts estimate that about one third of his early paintings conceal other compositions under them .
Using a new technique based on synchrotron radiation induced X - ray fluorescence spectroscopy , an international research team , including members from Delft University of Technology ( The Netherlands ) and the University of Antwerp ( Belgium ) , has successfully applied this technique for the first time to the painting entitled Patch of Grass by Vincent van Gogh .
Behind this painting is a portrait of a woman .
The analysis of the painting ' Patch of Grass ' by Vincent Van Gogh by means of an advanced form of non-destructive X - ray analysis allowed to reveal in unprecedented detail the original portrait , also by Van Gogh , over which the landscape was painted .
This development will greatly facilitate the study of other ' over painted ' works of art in the future .

The techniques usually used to reveal concealed layers of paintings , such as conventional X - ray radiography , have their limitations .
Together with experts from the Deutsches Elektronen - Synchrotron in Hamburg and the Kröller - Müller Museum , TU Delft materials expert and art historian Dr Joris Dik , and University of Antwerp chemistry professor Koen Janssens therefore chose to adopt a different approach .
The painting is subjected to an X - ray bundle from a synchrotron radiation source , and the fluorescence of the layers of paint is measured .
This technique has the major advantage that the measured fluorescence is specific to each chemical element .
Each type of atom ( e.g. lead or mercury ) and also individual paint pigments can therefore be charted individually .
The benefit of using synchrotron radiation is that the upper layers of paint distort the measurements to a lesser degree .
Moreover , the speed of measurement is high , which allows relatively large areas to be visualized .
This method was applied to a painting by Vincent van Gogh .
The work in question , Patch of Grass , was painted by Van Gogh in Paris in 1887 and is owned by the Kröller - Müller Museum .
Previous research had already discovered the vague outline of a head behind the painting .
It was scanned at the synchrotron radiation source DORIS at Deutsches Elektronen - Synchrotron DESY in Hamburg using an intense but very small X - ray bundle .
Over the course of two days , the area covering the image of a woman 's head was scanned , measuring 17.5 x 17.5 cm .
The measurements enabled researchers to reconstruct the concealed painting in unparalleled detail .
In particular the combination of the distribution of the elements mercury and antimony ( from specific paint pigments ) provided a ' color photo ' of the portrait which had been painted over .
The reconstruction enables art historians to understand the evolution of Van Gogh 's work better .
The applied technique is expected to pave the way for research into many other concealed paintings .

VIA 's OpenBook is a concept design that anyone can download , modify , and use to create their own ultraportable PC .
Courtesy of mfr Call it the Tom Sawyer approach to selling CPUs .
VIA Technologies , the self - proclaimed No. 3 maker of Intel - compatible processors , has unveiled a new " reference design " for ultra-portable computers based on the company 's own low - power chips .
Making a reference design is common fare in the high - tech industry .
Chipmakers like Intel have been doing it for years as a way of proving the technical viability of a product concept .
What sets VIA 's approach apart is that the company is posting the computer - aided design ( CAD ) files for its OpenBook PC under a Creative Commons license .
Anyone with design skills and a burning desire to get into the PC business can download the files , modify the design and go into business selling ultra portables .
Taiwan - based VIA will even help aspiring Michael Dells find Asian manufacturers to do the hard work of turning those CAD files into real , plastic - and - silicon products .
VIA 's design is on the commercial end of a growing spectrum of " open source " hardware .
On the other , more noncommercial end are hackable hardware kits like the Arduino platform , which was used by many exhibitors at the recent Maker Faire in San Mateo , California .
Open source aficionados were also buzzing last week about the release of the OGD1 , a development kit that could be used to create open - source graphics cards .
If VIA 's idea takes off , it could help add more juice to the already - humming market for ultra portables .
That market , which had long foundered on the impractical aspirations of a tiny minority of mobility - obsessed hardware geeks , took off in earnest last year with the success of the Eee PC , Asus ' $ 400 , Linux - based ultra portable .
For industrial designer Scott Summit , VIA 's move is part of a gradual shift toward more highly - customized manufacturing , in which small companies and even individuals are able to design and build their own products , thanks to the decreasing costs of fabrication .
" The idea of open source manufacture is taking shape , and we 're going to see more of it because the barriers ( to highly customized production ) are really starting to evaporate , " says Summit .
VIA 's design calls for a 2.2 - pound PC with an 8.9 - inch screen , a webcam , up to 2GB of RAM , an 80 GB or larger hard drive , and built - in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ( or , optionally , WiMax or 3G cellular data ) .
It 's not wanting for ports , either , with an Ethernet jack , three USB ports and an SD card slot .
The design is aimed at smaller design - manufacturers and upstart PC companies rather than big PC manufacturers like HP or Dell , who create their own designs ( like HP's new MiniNote ) from scratch .
" When we look at reference designs , they 're helpful , they 're insightful , they give us an optimal layout from an engineering perspective – but they do n't target what we 're aiming for , " says Stacy Wolff , a notebook design director for HP .
VIA 's hope is that its design will encourage new designers to make ultra portables that are a little less ugly than the usual fare .
It 's a bet that the PC market will soon follow in the footsteps of the cellphone market , where what 's under the hood is less important than how it looks .
" It 's not really about the components inside at all , " says VIA vice president Richard Brown .
" It 's personal jewelry . "
Almost makes the idea of starting your own computer brand sound a little sexy , does n't it ?
And for the chipmaker , it 's not far from the notion that if you want to get a fence painted , start painting it yourself and try to make it look fun .

PRAGUE ( Reuters ) - The Czech Republic and the United States will sign a treaty on Tuesday to build a missile defense radar on Czech soil despite opposition at home and in Russia .
Washington wants to build the radar southwest of Prague and put 10 interceptor rockets in neighboring Poland as a part of a defense shield it says will protect the United States and European allies from threats from “ rogue states ” such as Iran .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice will sign the deal in Prague , but the plan faces some hurdles .
Talks with Poland have so far failed over Warsaw ’s demands for U.S. finance to help modernize its army , and the Czech treaty will face opposition in parliament .
The Czech government said the shield would offer further protection on the top of the country ’s NATO and EU membership .
“ Missile technology is spreading around the world , ” Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg told Reuters .
“ The threat is not totally acute , but one has to prepare in time . ”
Russia sees the shield as a threat , and has said it will aim its nuclear missiles at central Europe if the shield is deployed .
The United States says the 10 rockets are no match for Russia ’s nuclear arsenal .
Analysts say that bases in the former Soviet bloc would raise U.S. security interest in the region at a time when Russia grows more assertive about its role on the global scene .
“ While Washington ’s concerns about Iran are real , it ’s also true that in setting up these missile defense components , the United States will have a direct stake in the security of central and eastern Europe , ” said Alexander Kliment , an analyst at Eurasia Group , a U.S. political risk consultancy .
Disputes over the radar have alienated many Czechs , wary of any foreign military presence after the Soviet invasion in 1968 and the following two decades of occupation .
An opinion poll last month showed 68 percent of Czechs were against the shield , while 24 percent supported it .
Anti-radar activists say the radar will make the Czech Republic a target and undermine its security .
The leftist opposition in parliament has channeled the public discontent , and ratification is uncertain .
The three - party cabinet has just 100 seats in the 200 - seat lower house and several backbenchers have said they would vote against .
The government must win over several independents .
“ I am convinced that responsibility will prevail and a majority will stand behind ( the radar ) , ” Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Vondra told Czech Television .
The Green Party , a junior government partner , says ratification should be delayed until a new U.S. administration takes over from President George W. Bush early next year .
Unlike the Czechs , Poland has demanded billions of dollars for the modernization of their army , mainly air defenses .
Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Friday U.S. proposals were insufficient but Poland was ready to negotiate further .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court sided with the White House on Monday in two cases involving national security and worries about the environment , strengthening the Bush administration ’s drive , at least for now , for sweeping executive powers in the post - 9/11 world .
In one case , the court refused to stop the administration from bypassing environmental reviews in building a security fence along the border between the United States and Mexico .
In the other , it agreed to hear the administration ’s appeal of a lower court decision that , on environmental grounds , restricted the Navy ’s use of powerful sonar off the Southern California coast . .
In the sonar case , the justices said they would review a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , which on Feb. 27 upheld most of a lower court ruling that banned high - powered sonar within 12 miles of the coast .
Environmental groups had sued to block the use of the sonar because they feared harm to whales and dolphins .
The Bush administration has argued that the sonar training exercises , used to practice tracking of hostile submarines , are vital to national defense , that the possible harm to marine life was being exaggerated and that , in any event , military need should take precedence over the welfare of water creatures .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As much as Americans fret over the rising price of gas , one thing worries them more : the possibility of having to wait in long lines to buy rationed gas .
A CNN / Opinion Research poll released Tuesday shows that 55 % of those surveyed are more worried about long lines at gas stations and rationing than about the high prices that drivers have paid in recent months .
The poll shows 40 % of the respondents are more concerned about the high prices .
While gas rationing is not expected at this time , it was a hallmark of the 1970s - era energy crisis , when drivers lined up outside gas stations and sales of gas were limited to certain days of the week .
However , at that time , gas was in short supply , which is not the case today .
The poll shows that 83 % of respondents think $ 4 - a - gallon gas is a major problem or a crisis .
The poll results highlight the conflict facing U.S. consumers between the financial hardship of elevated gas prices and the necessity of driving .
It suggests that they are heavily dependent on easily accessible gas and are willing to pay more to avoid inconveniences .
The poll results reflect telephone interviews with 1,035 adults conducted June 4 - 5 .
The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Consumers are responding to the current energy dilemma in different ways .
A previously released portion of the poll showed that 66 % of those surveyed said they are cutting back on the amount of driving they do , and 71 % indicated that they are considering buying a more fuel - efficient vehicle .
What 's more , 55 % of respondents said they were cutting back significantly on household spending to cope with higher fuel bills .
And 78 % said the current state of the economy was poor or very poor .
Gas prices have become an important political issue as the nation prepares to elect a new president .
On Tuesday , Senate Republicans were able to block consideration a windfall profits tax of the five largest U.S. oil companies and the rescinding of $ 17 billion in tax breaks the companies expect to enjoy over the next decade .
Critics of the oil industry say its profits are excessive and come at the expense of the American public .
Energy companies say oil and gas prices are determined by the economic fundamentals of supply and demand , that strong demand from overseas supports prices and that their profit margins are slim .

JAMES HAMILTON has gone out on a limb and declared that the long ride up for oil prices is over .
A daring statement , but he has an
excellent analysis
Let me repeat here that I do not believe that speculation is the reason oil went from $ 60 to $ 120 a barrel .
The biggest part of that longer term trend is due to fundamentals , not speculation .
Notwithstanding , it does appear that speculation has gotten ahead of those fundamentals in the most recent developments .
For the bubble to continue , we would need to see ever - increasing volumes of investment money pouring into the futures markets , and continuing stagnation in global production to ratify them .
Even if the former occurs , my best guess is that the latter will not .
backing it up .
I could n't do the piece justice in a summary ; do read it all if you can .
But here are his concluding thoughts :
Why does n't he think global production will continue to stagnate ?
Have a look here , at a wikipedia page which tracks production developments , including the number and size of " megaprojects " scheduled to come on line .
Producers , it turns out , have not sat on their hands while prices breached the stratosphere .
New supply additions in 2008 may be twice as large as in recent years .
While this new capacity is not enough to generate a paradigm shift in oil markets , the combination of these new sources with slowing demand growth should , in Mr Hamilton 's opinion , deflate the froth atop the fundamentals .
The question , then , is just how much froth there is , and what kind of additional time the new supply will buy a world where the first response to a price dip is likely to be a resumption of old habits .
I 'm certainly no hero , but since some readers of my last post have reacted by attacking my courage and integrity on the grounds that I " never served , " I want to at least set the record straight on my youthful response to war .
In 1967 , when I was a senior in high school in Storrs , CT . , I faced a momentous decision .
In April , I would turn 18 , and would have to register for the draft .
The Vietnam War was by then in full swing .
A year or two earlier , I 'd been an avid fan of military aviation magazines , and bought into the whole anti-Communist Cold War thing .
But by ' 67 , I had seen enough of the violence being done in Vietnam against a desperately poor peasant population -- the napalm attacks on civilians , the burned babies , etc. -- that I had done a 180 - degree turn .
I wanted nothing to do with war and killing .
So like many young men of my generation I made a decision : I would fill out my registration at the draft board , and I 'd get my draft card , but I would not let myself be inducted into the military .
When I told my parents , who still supported the war , of my plan , they were of course upset but supportive .
My dad was an engineer and a former Marine and my mother a Navy WAVE in WWII .
My paternal grandfather had earned a silver star in WWI and my maternal grandfather had had his lungs permanently scarred by mustard gas in the same conflict .
A history teacher , Bernie Marlin , referred me to a junior high teacher in the school who had been a conscientious objector during the Korean War .
I talked with him , a Mr. Storrs , at length , and was very impressed with his story , but I soon realized that I did n't really think I was CO material .
I did feel war could be justified sometimes -- for example if America were attacked .
At any rate , in early April of ' 67 , I went ahead and filled out my draft registration form .
That fall , I began college at Wesleyan University .
By then , I had been working as a foot soldier in the anti-war movement a bit , and had already been to one anti-war demonstration and march in New York City .
At college registration , there was a table for registering for a student deferment .
I decided on the spur of the moment to pass that up .
It seemed unfair to me that friends of mine in high school , who were not college bound , were going to get drafted , but I would n't because I was lucky enough to be going to college .
So unlike Vice President and Warmonger - in - Chief Dick Cheney , I just skipped it .
I figured when my time came and I got an induction notice , I would just refuse , and they 'd jail me .
In October , there was a huge demonstration and march in Washington against the war -- the famous " Mobe " about which Norman Mailer wrote in " Armies of the Night . "
I went down to DC with a few other students .
We ended up near the front of the march , and then up on the Mall of the Pentagon .
Through the night , federal marshals were arresting people up there on the Mall .
I made it through until morning , when I was finally grabbed by the legs , yanked through a line of bayonet - armed soldiers , beaten with clubs and carried off to a paddy wagon , which took me to a federal minimum - security prison in Occoquan , VA .
I spent a couple days there in the company of a hundred or so other demonstrators in a prison dormitory .
It was an education like no other .
Veteran anti-war and civil rights activists ran workshops about the war and about a strategy of resistance , and about how we could build a better world .
I soaked it all up avidly .
When I was released , with a small fine and a 10 - day suspended sentence for " trespassing " on the Pentagon , I hitchhiked back to school , all fired up to challenge the war .
The night before my arrest , I had joined hundreds of other protesters in burning my draft card .
I had kept the ashes in my shirt pocket , and when I got home , I put them in an envelope and mailed them to my draft board , with a note saying I would never carry that card again ( a federal crime ) .
My draft board responded by sending me a new I - A card .
I tucked it in my wallet , saving it for the next card - burning opportunity .
Over the next two years , during which time I participated actively in student radical activism , building sit-ins , and draft - resistance actions , such as informational picketing of inductees at the induction center in New Haven , CT , I had occasion to burn my card and tear up my card several times -- including once at a communion at the Yale chapel , where we turned our cards in to Rev. William Sloane Coffin .
Each time , I 'd send the ashes or the pieces of card to my draft board , and each time , they 'd send me a new one .
Along the way , the infamous draft lottery was established .
I was number 81 - - a certainty to be called up .
At one point , back in the summer of 1968 , I filed a CO application , but I made it clear that I was not religious , and that I was not opposed to all wars .
When I had my CO hearing at the draft board , the board members were sitting at a table , with all my destroyed draft cards set in a pile in front of them .
I explained to the men sitting in judgement on me that while I opposed the war in Vietnam , if I were Vietnamese , I would surely be fighting for my country against the US .
Not surprisingly , that did n't go over very well .
My application was unanimously rejected .
My day came in the spring of 1969 .
At the time , I was in a full leg cast , having broken both bones in my lower leg just above the ankle in a ski accident .
I notified the induction center that I was on crutches and in a cast and suggested they postpone my pre-induction physical until I was out of the cast and all better - - a delay of about four months according to my doctor .
They said no .
They wanted to see me to make sure I was genuinely injured .
So on a cold late - winter day , I found myself on a bus riding from the draft board in Rockville , CT to New Haven with a bunch of frightened young men .
I handed out informational packets to everyone , telling them their rights , how to apply for CO status , etc. , and talked about what was wrong with the war .
When we arrived , I joined everyone in taking the so - called intelligence test .
Then we went for our physicals .
I was pulled from the line and told I needed to go to see a consulting physician at Yale - New Haven Hospital .
Since the address was a mile or so away , and the sidewalks were icy , I said I 'd need cab fare .
I was told by the head of the medical unit that the government did n't pay for transportation .
He informed me there was a bus that stopped outside that would take me there .
I replied that I was on crutches , and that I had n't asked to be sent to a consultation -- in fact I had asked for a postponement until my leg was healed -- and said that if they wanted to send me anywhere they could fucking well pay for the transportation .
That did n't make the guy very happy .
He had a screaming fit , and called the head of the center , who came down .
" What 's the problem ? " he asked .
I explained the situation , and said that if they wanted me to go all the way to a hospital because they did n't trust that my leg was truly broken , they could pay my fucking cab fare .
The guy got angry , called me a " little prick , " but then took out his wallet and threw some bills at me .
I picked the money up off the floor and went down to the street .
Seeing no cab , I went over to the bus stop .
I looked up and saw the Induction Center commander looking out of a window , so as the bus pulled up , I flipped him a one - finger salute and got on .
At the hospital , I discovered that the office of the doctor in question was closed for the day .
Angry that I 'd wasted all this time for nothing , I got back on the bus and returned to the Induction Center .
This time , I went directly to the office of the head of the center , and tossed an envelope of X - Rays from my doctor on his desk .
" It 's no wonder you 're losing the fucking war ! " I said .
" You guys ca n't even arrange a doctor 's appointment .
The office was closed . "
I told him that he could check my X - Rays , and added , " But I 've come down here once already , and it 's the last time I 'm coming .
If you want me back , you can send the FBI to bring me . "
I hung around until the end of the day and rode home on the bus to my draft board .
When I got there , I went into the office , where the office secretary , an older woman with a neat grey perm , was still at her desk .
" Excuse me , " I said .
" But I 'm really pissed off . "
She started at my coarse language .
I recounted my experience and she said , " Well , I think they owe you an apology . "
To my astonishment , she picked up the phone , called the Induction Center , and asked to speak to the head of the operation -- the guy who'd thrown the money at me .
" I have a young man here who is very angry , " she said into the phone .
" And I think you owe him an apology . "
She handed me the phone .
" All right , you little prick , " he said , sounding like he was gritting his teeth .
" I 'm sorry . "
" You fuckin ' oughta be , " I said , again shocking the secretary .
I put down the phone , thanked the secretary and left .
A month later , to my astonishment , instead of FBI agents at my door , I got a letter from my draft board .
It was a card declaring me to be IV - F - -" unfit for military service . "
Clearly , there was no medical justification for my rejection .
My leg bones healed up just fine a few months later , and I spent part of the next year loading heavy boxes in a warehouse and driving semi-trailer trucks .
I suspect that , it being 1969 , and the army in Nam being by then in a state of near insurrection , the Army had concluded it did n't want people like me anymore .
Perhaps a year earlier , before Tet , I might instead have been sent into the infantry .
I tell this story because while it may not be heroic , and while other war resisters paid heavily for their stands , I nonetheless think it contrasts well with the likes of a Dick Cheney , who hid through the war years behind student deferments and his wife 's skirt , or of a George Bush , who joined the Air National Guard and made care to check a box saying he would be " unavailable for overseas duty " -- something the poor guys in the Guard now doing multiple tours in the Iraqi desert on Bush 's orders did n't have the option of doing .
I do n't apologize for my opposition to the Vietnam War .
And while being prepared to go to jail for a principle may not rank on the courage meter anywhere near to standing one 's ground under fire during an enemy assault , or jumping on top of a live grenade , I 'm proud that I did my best to oppose it , and that I never once tried to duck responsibility for my own actions .
Furthermore , I 'll stand my actions up against any of those in the Bush administration or in Congress who are so quick to support wars , but who hid behind student deferments or used powerful connections to avoid military service or combat duty themselves when it was their turn to " serve . "

Greece , the nation that gave rise to the idea of well - formed muscular men in the name of Adonis , now has the highest prevalence of obesity in the EU , according to a report issued yesterday .
" Greece today is the EU state with the highest average body mass index and highest prevalence of overweight [ people ] and obesity , " says the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation report .
It reveals that the XXXL factor is one effect of a dramatic retreat from the Mediterranean diet in the region itself .
Josef Schmidhuber , an FAO senior economist , said people , not only in southern Europe , but also in north Africa and parts of Asia , were increasingly eating food that was " too fat , too salty and too sweet " .
The diet of fruit and vegetables , taken by their forebears , was in " a moribund state " .
His findings appear in a report given to a workshop on Mediterranean products , organised by the California - Mediterranean Consortium of academic institutions .
Schmidhuber said that in 40 years , up to 2002 , there had been a 20 % rise in the average daily calorie intake of people living in the former 15 - nation EU - but in the countries bordering the Mediterranean the increase had been steeper .
Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Cyprus and Malta had increased calorie consumption by an average of 30 % .
Three - quarters of the Greek population was overweight or obese by the end of that period .
Spain , Greece and Italy are now the EU 's biggest consumers of lipids ( fats and oils ) , the report says .
In Spain fat made up 25 % of the diet 40 years ago but now accounts for 40 % , the FAO said .
But sedentary lifestyles , supermarkets and fast - food restaurants , and a fall in home cooking , were also to blame , it said .

Whether you 're missing a crucial file at work or home , or you just need to tweak one little setting to get Mom 's email working again , having remote control of another desktop can be seriously handy .
But not everybody can walk the less - tech - inclined through installing a VNC server and opening up their router ports , or have the time to create their own SingleClick tech support tool ( cool as it may be ) .
Today , we 're looking at the best solutions for getting into a computer remotely , whether you 're helping out Uncle Bif , grabbing files from home , or controlling your media server from the lounger .

The tech support solution : From personal experience , the most techno - phobic aunt , uncle , or boss - with - a - favor - to - ask can hook up with you through CrossLoop , a dead - simple app that uses simple access codes to make sure it's the right two screens hooking up .
Lifehacker friend The How - To Geek has a full screenshot walk - through on hooking up the connection ( remember to have the help - ees click " Unblock " ! ) .
If you 're truly tech - savvy , you can even make some money in CrossLoop 's Marketplace , helping similarly lost souls battle it out with their systems .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The file grabber :
Those among our commenters who had the chance to try out Microsoft 's Live Mesh service before it opened to anyone who wanted it agreed that once you got the ( admittedly clingy ) service installed , making remote connections was a nearly pain - free process .
It does n't mind multiple monitors , it serves up crisp graphics ( on fast connections , at least ) , and can even follow your remote computer through a reboot .
What 's more , you get 5 GB free to store and sync documents to a " Live Desktop , " so if you can't wait for a big package to transfer directly , you can log in , start moving it into the 5 GB cloud , and come back later to grab it .
The remote connection happens through Internet Explorer ( a convenience or drawback , depending on your mindset ) , but the rest of Live Mesh 's tools work fine with Firefox .

Other options :
If you shy away from VNC connections more out of security concerns than difficulty level , it 's not too much work to create a secure VNC connection with Hamachi .
If you do n't like dealing with all those port numbers , IP addresses , and such , ShowMyPC wraps up a VNC client , SSH , and a simple two - way password authorization , similar to CrossLoop , but with clients for Linux and OS X as well .

Mac OS X

The tech support solution :
One of the Mac 's less - touted assets is its super - simple screen , file , and printer - sharing capabilities .
With the introduction of OS X Leopard ( 10.5 ) , it 's easy to control how much of your system is shared and to whom , and screen sharing simply requires an enabling click and a password .
Better still , another Mac or any ol ' VNC client can connect and command .
If we had to choose , though , we 're partial to TightVNC .

The file grabber : Apple has rolled their $ 100 / year .
Mac service into the similarly - priced MobileMe , but one thing remains the same — they want you to pay them to link together the tools you already have .
Adam 's guide to getting Back to Your Mac for free still holds true , using a combination of FTP and screen sharing and setting up a domain name for your home network .

Other options :
As noted above , Mac - to - Mac connections are seriously simple ( at least with Leopard installed ) .
If you 're a Mac wizard but still know enough to help a frustrated Windows user , the free program CoRD lets you create a Remote Desktop connection , which is generally faster and more secure than a straight - up VNC link - up .
And if you were on a Mac and wanted to grab files from a PC , you 're best off using a simple app like FileZilla to build a home FTP server .
Build a Home FTP Server with FileZilla Upload and download files on your home PC from anywhere by turning it into a personal FTP server .

Linux
The tech support solution :
You 're telling me your grandmother runs Linux ?
Seriously ?
Well , we 've got a few options to help her out too — or is it the other way around ?
If one of the two parties needs n00 b - level help , luckily most user - friendly distros will have VNC built in — just head to System -> Preferences ->
Remote Desktop to enable it , and the Linux guru should be able to jump in .
But for faster , cross- platform support , our commenters recommend a faster client / server combo : NoMachine NX .

The file grabber :
To save yourself a lot of headaches , you 're best off learning how to set up an SSH server ( as described in Ubuntu 's wiki ) , then open it up to outside traffic , and then get familiar with a little cross - platform command line , like the all - important scp command detailed in an earlier series by Gina .
Not the simplest solution , indeed , but you will have a secure system that you can get to from any operating system .

The monks of Caldey Island sell their perfumes on the internet
An island community of monks were so fed up with their slow internet connection , they 've gone broadband .
The Cistercian monks live on Caldey Island , three miles off the coast of Tenby in Pembrokeshire .
The self sustaining community sells homemade perfume and sweets over the internet for their income .
Father Daniel said : " Patience is one of the characteristics of monastic life , but even the patience of the Brothers was being tested by our slow internet " .
Over the last five years , the monks internet shop has increased its turnover by 100 % .
But their slow dial - up connection was hampering their business .
So they worked with a local telecommunications firm who have used a signal from a communications tower on the mainland to transmit wireless broadband to the island .
" Broadband access has made a huge difference to our internet usage , " said Father Daniel .
" We knew we needed a faster connection , but we had almost given up trying to find a workable solution which would give us an internet connection at speeds enjoyed by others on the mainland .
" We have many plans to develop our commercial activities now we have a modern , high speed communications link , " he said .
Broadband on the island will help the monks sell their goods online The monks ' wireless broadband is transmitted to the island by TFL Group from their communications tower at Pentlepoir on the mainland .
Jonathan England , from telecommunications firm TFL Group said : " We are absolutely delighted to have been able to provide the community at Caldey Abbey with state - of - the - art wireless broadband access . "
Ben Childs , the estate manger on Caldey , said the internet shop helped to support the island during the winter , after the tourists have left .
" It 's crucial to our needs and broadband will help the speed up things , " he said .
Monks first settled on the island just off the Pembrokeshire coast near Tenby in the 6th Century .
The present Cistercian order moved into the monastery from Scourmont Abbey in Belgium in 1929 .

What are these ?
This post wanders all over the place and I ’m not sure I ’m articulating my thoughts very well .
Comments and criticism are welcome .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( I do n’t know why these companies have such ridiculous names either ) are bound by regulations to hold enough capital ( cash dollars ) in order to remain solvent across some theoretical worst - case scenarios .
The regulators dreamed up some really extreme situations that could likely bankrupt these companies , and insisted that the companies held enough cash to survive .
When I worked at Fannie Mae in the department that wrestled with the C++ model that calculated our reserve requirements for these 10 - year stress tests , we used to joke around about how unlikely these stress tests really were .
We would say that we might as well buy insurance against Martian invasions , or against all the animals teaming up together to attack humanity .
While Fannie Mae was legally complying with these unrealistic scenarios , the sub - prime crisis was a scenario that they were not prepared for , and it slaughtered them .
The CEO had to step down .
The price fell from around $ 80 a share when I left in 2001 to $ 18 today .
The sub - prime crisis at its core is very mundane .
Lenders got sloppy and investors let their greed entice them to take risks they should n’t have .
That ’s all there is to it .
Local banks lent money to high - risk borrowers , then the banks sold the loan to Fannie Mae , who sold the loans to Wall Street .
Investors preferred the high - return investments over the low - return boring crap .
No perfect storm was necessary to trigger this .
It was just a whole lot of people getting sloppy and eventually enough straws accumulated to break the camel ’s back .
The same pattern played out in the seventeenth century and probably a hundred times since then .
Now I ’m a workaday programmer , and I see the same dynamic in code .
People write elaborate systems to protect against ridiculously unlikely scenarios but then skimp on the boring stuff .
Maybe they get the hard parts done but never make sure their app ’s internals are well documented , easy to maintain , and intuitively designed .
In my experience , it ’s the mundane bugs , not the diabolically clever hackers , that cause me the most grief .
If I write some algorithm that costs O ( n2 ) , I will almost immediately start trying to tame it down .
The voices in my brain scream about worst - case costs .
Macho programmers write badass algorithms .
However , I find that the really smart thing to do is to spend a few minutes thinking about the likely use cases .
If I know that for the forseeable future , I ’m never going to run this algorithm with n > 5 , then I think the grown - up thing to do is to write a big fat docstring that reminds me later about this risk , and then move on to getting other stuff done .
The market rewards a good - enough and finished solution more than an potentially amazing but currently unfinished solution .
If Fannie Mae had focused on just making sure that they were vetting the loans better , things would n’t have been so bad .
The theoretical worst case scenarios are not going to happen before the more likely stuff goes wrong .
I worked at Fannie Mae preparing against Martian invaders .
We ignored the termites in the walls , so to speak .

Fewer than half of Americans can recognize the top five warning signs of stroke , information that could help save thousands of people from death and disability , the CDC said on Thursday .
REUTERS / File
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Fewer than half of Americans can recognize the top five warning signs of stroke , information that could help save thousands of people from death and disability , the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said on Thursday .
Their report uncovered significant disparities in awareness , with whites , women and people with higher levels of education much more likely to be aware of individual stroke warning symptoms and call for an ambulance than others .
“ These findings indicate a need to increase awareness of stroke warning symptoms in the entire population , and particularly among blacks , Hispanics , men and persons at lower education levels , ” the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease .
Stroke warning signs include sudden numbness or weakness of the face , arm or leg , especially on one side ; sudden confusion or difficulty speaking ; sudden trouble walking , dizziness or loss of balance ; sudden trouble with vision in one eye or both ; and severe headache with no known cause .
To determine awareness of these warnings , the CDC in 2005 surveyed more than 71,000 people by telephone in 13 states and the District of Columbia .
They found that only 44 percent could identify all five stroke warning signs .
Some 38 percent were aware of all stroke warnings symptoms and said they would call an ambulance first if they thought someone was having a stroke or heart attack .
Just 16 percent knew all of the stroke warning signs , knew that sudden chest pain was not a stroke warning sign and said they would call an ambulance if they thought someone was having a heart attack or stroke .
“ Immediate emergency transportation to a hospital to receive timely urgent care can reduce disability and even death associated with stroke , ” the CDC said .
Stroke is the No. 3 killer in the United States behind heart disease and cancer .
The CDC estimates 780,000 Americans will have strokes this year .
They will kill 150,000 people and leave 15 percent to 30 percent of survivors permanently disabled .
Workmen hacking and burning their way through the dense jungle of Costa Rica to clear an area for banana plantations in the 1930s stumbled upon some incredible objects : dozens of stone balls , many of which were perfectly spherical .
They varied in size from as small as a tennis ball to an astonishing 8 feet in diameter and weighing 16 tons !
Although the great stone balls are clearly man-made , it is unknown who made them , for what purpose and , most puzzling , how they achieved such spherical precision .
While mineral hunting in the mountains of California near Olancha during the winter of 1961 , Wallace Lane , Virginia Maxey and Mike Mikesell found a rock , among many others , that they thought was a geode - a good addition for their gem shop .
Upon cutting it open , however , Mikesell found an object inside that seemed to be made of white porcelain .
In the center was a shaft of shiny metal .
Experts estimated that , if this was a geode , it should have taken about 500,000 years for this fossil - encrusted nodule to form , yet the object inside was obviously of sophisticated human manufacture .
Further investigation revealed that the porcelain was surround by a hexagonal casing , and an x-ray revealed a tiny spring at one end , like a spark plug .
There 's a bit of controversy around this artifact , as you can imagine .
Some contend that the artifact was not inside a geode at all , but encased in hardened clay .
The artifact itself has been identified by experts as a 1920s - era Champion spark plug .
Unfortunately , the Coso Artifact has gone missing and cannot be thoroughly examined .
Is there a natural explanation for it ?
Or was it found , as the discoverer claimed , inside a geode ?
If so , how could a 1920s sparkplug get inside a 500,000 - year - old rock ?
There are a lot of things that come under the tag “ only in Russia ” , and we try to cover each one .
It ’s a big pity but this thing happens only in Russia too .
These photos come from the the well - known white - coated seal farms .
If you are not aware about such a way of Russian farming I will explain a little .
In Russia there are farms where white - coated seals are breed .
They are being valued much for their fur , it ’s something like a rolls - royce in the world of furs , the top fur on the market .
It gives warmth , it ’s soft like a silk and looks terrific at least this is what the consumers say .
What does differ this fur from other furs , is the extreme cruelty in its production .
The seals are being clubbed to death at the age of one month .
And that ’s the only way to do it , according to the fur industry strict standards .
The fur - coat makers say holes from bullets spoil the virgin white skins of those 1 - month old small seals so they demand them only to be smashed with a good old club .
So here are some photos from one of such farms , or it could be better to say concentration camps .
No violence on the photos in order to save your nerves .
This particular farm is in Arkhangelsk Oblast , North - West Russia .
The seals are being transported in cages to the farm , there they grow up to one month age and then are hit to death with clubs .
The average salary of people who execute is around $ 150 / month , and that ’s a lot of money for them , so we ca n’t blame them , they have families etc .
The final fur - coat made of the one - month - old white - fur seal is around $ 7,000 for the small size
DNA from an extinct creature has been resurrected in a live animal for the first time .
The genetic material , extracted from the extinct Tasmanian tiger , proved functional in mice .
" As more and more species of animals become extinct , we are continuing to lose critical knowledge of gene function and their potential , " said researcher Andrew Pask , a molecular biologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia .
Reviving genes from extinct animals can't bring them back to life , but it could help retrieve this potentially valuable knowledge .
" This research has enormous potential for many applications including the development of new biomedicines and gaining a better understanding of the biology of extinct animals , " said researcher Richard Behringer at the University of Texas .
And while the Tasmanian tiger has only been extinct for roughly 70 years , " the potential this method has for examining genes from much older specimens , in fact anything with some intact DNA , is very exciting , " said researcher Marilyn Renfree , a reproductive and developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne .
Hunted to extinction
The last known Tasmanian tiger , or thylacine , died in captivity in 1936 in the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania .
This enigmatic marsupial carnivore was hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 1900s .
" I have worked on marsupials for my whole career , and have always had a secret hope that the thylacine was n't really extinct , " Renfree said .
" It was Australia 's top carnivore still living when Europeans first came to this country , and we quickly hunted it to extinction . "
In fact , a study last year hinted at the possibility that the creatures might still exist , but the evidence was not conclusive .
Fortunately , some thylacine young were preserved in alcohol in several museum collections around the world , as were tissues from adults , such as in pelts .
The international team of scientists isolated DNA from 100 - year - old thylacine specimens at Museum Victoria in Melbourne .
Next this genetic material was inserted into mouse embryos and investigated for how it functioned .
The researchers found a snippet of thylacine DNA could , like its mouse counterpart , regulate the gene Col2a1 , which is key to the embryonic development of cartilage that later forms bone .
Scientists have previously isolated DNA from extinct species ranging from bacteria and plants to mammoths and Neanderthals .
Until now , such genetic material had at most been " plugged into " cells grown on dishes in labs , and it had not been possible to examine what role the DNA played in development .
" Examining function in whole embryos enables us to determine when genes are turned on and off and in which cell types and organs , so that we can accurately assess gene function , " Renfree explained .
To put the finding into perspective , consider that the vast majority of species that have ever lived on this planet are now extinct .
" Extant species — those alive on the planet today — represent less than 1 percent of the total biodiversity that has ever existed , " Pask explained .
" For those species that have already become extinct , our method shows that access to their genetic biodiversity may not be completely lost . "
Especially useful now
This research might prove especially helpful now , " at a time when extinction rates are increasing at an alarming rate , especially of mammals , " Renfree added .
This approach does have its limitations .
" Some genes are required to interact with multiple other proteins and receptors in order to show a function , " Pask said .
" In these cases , unless the host organism , in this case the mouse , has a compatible set of other proteins and receptors we would be unable to examine the function of these genes . "
And such an experiment should not suggest " that this is an answer to extinction or that it is OK for an animal to go extinct because we can still preserve their genomes , " Renfree cautioned .
" This method is able to examine one or a few genes from an extinct species at a time , but this particular method would never be able to bring an animal back from extinction .
Our method just enables us to examine the function of those genes already lost . "
The scientists will detail their findings online May 21 in the journal PLoS ONE .
They were supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health , and by the Ben F. Love Endowment , the ARC Federation Fellowship and the NHMRC C.J. Martin and R. Douglas Wright Research Fellowships .
An important aspect of the presidential race so far has been the generational divide , with Barack Obama doing very well with younger voters and Hillary Clinton drawing strong support from those who are older .
A similar split can be expected in a general election race between Senator Obama and John McCain .
However the election ultimately turns out , the Obama campaign has tapped into a constituency that holds powerful implications for the future of American politics .
The youngest of these voters , those ranging in age from roughly the late teens to the early 30s , are part of the so - called millennial generation .
This is a generation that is in danger of being left out of the American dream  the first American generation to do less well economically than their parents .
And that economic uncertainty appears to have played a big role in shaping their views of government and politics .
A number of studies , including new ones by the Center for American Progress in Washington and by Demos , a progressive think tank in New York , have shown that Americans in this age group are faced with a variety of challenges that are tougher than those faced by young adults over the past few decades .
Among the challenges are worsening job prospects , lower rates of health insurance coverage and higher levels of debt .

As we work with ASP .
NET MVC on Stack Overflow , I find myself violently thrust back into the bad old days of tag soup that I remember from my tenure as a classic ASP developer in the late 90's .
If you 're not careful bordering on manically fastidious in constructing your Views , you 'll end up with a giant mish - mash of HTML , Javascript , and server - side code .
Classic tag soup ; difficult to read , difficult to maintain .
I do n't mean tag soup in the sense of badly formed HTML , or the malformed world we live in .
I mean tag soup in the sense of mixing HTML markup and server - side code .
Now you can double your pleasure : badly formed HTML , meet badly written code .
The tag soup problem seems to be endemic to all modern web development stacks .
I see that Ruby on Rails apps have the same problem ; here 's a slice of representative RHTML from Typo , a Ruby blogging engine .
Do you find this readable ?
Can you see where the code begins and the markup ends ?
Are you confident you could change the code structure without breaking the HTML , or change the HTML structure without breaking the code ?
Sometimes editing this stuff makes me feel like I 'm playing Operation .
I have to ever so carefully maneuver my metal tweezers into one tiny slice of code or HTML and make my changes without touching the edges and setting off that blasted electrical buzzer .
I 'm not trying to single out Rails or Typo here ; I could easily show you a ASP .
NET MVC view that 's just as confusing ( or as " clear " , if you think that 's perfectly readable , I guess ) .
Tag soup is everywhere ; take a look at the Python Django framework templates :
< h1 > Archive for {{ year }}</h1 > { % for date in days %} { % ifchanged % } < h3 > {{ date|date : " F " }}</h3 >{ % endifchanged %} < a href= " {{ date|date : " M / d " |lower }} / " >{{ date|date : " j " }}</a> { % endfor %}
Perhaps when it comes to mixing HTML and server - side code , some form of soup is unavoidable , a necessary evil .
The soup can be quite palatable ; maybe even delicious .
It 's certainly possible to write good tag soup and bad tag soup .
But I have to wonder : is there a better way ?
Is there something beyond RHTML , Views , and Templates ?
What examples would you point to of web development stacks that avoided degenerating into yet more hazardous , difficult to maintain tag soup ?
Is there anything truly better on the horizon ?
Or is this year 's newer , fancier , even - more - delicious iteration of tag soup as good as it ever gets for web development ?

The Disney - Pixar film WALL-E has been adoringly received by the majority of the theatergoing public .
This adoration is unjustified .
The film blatantly conveys environmentalist , anticapitalist , and antitechnological propaganda — and aims it at an audience of children , who still lack the critical faculties and intellectual sophistication to evaluate all relevant aspects of the issues presented .
But I will not focus here on how egregiously unrealistic the film 's scenario of humans completely trashing Earth is .
A simple look around you will suffice to refute this possibility .
Garbage is not piling up around us , and landfills are in fact remarkably effective at storing it safely and even using it to generate useful natural gases .
I will , rather , concentrate on a much more egregious error made by the creators of WALL - E — an error made in ignorance of basic economics and of commonsense insights regarding the nature of human behaviors and the incentives facing individual economic actors .
This error pervades the film 's depiction of life aboard the Axiom , a starship made by Buy'n Large ( BNL ) corporation — a cross between Wal - Mart and the George W. Bush administration — to house the human refugees from Earth for 700 years after the Earth becomes too littered to remain habitable .
First , the film makes the Marxian assumption that it would be possible for a single corporation to take advantage of ever - increasing returns to scale and thereby subsume the entire world — and still remain profitable and continually patronized by everyone .
But as Ludwig von Mises showed as far back as 1920 in Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth , without the presence of multiple providers of goods in the economy , the single dominant firm is in the same position as a socialist central planner .
In the real world , BNL would have no market price signals to help it discern consumer demand for and the relative scarcity of resources .
It would not be able to engage in rational economic calculation and would make decisions arbitrarily .
Surely , this state would not please many consumers , and the BNL monopoly would be short lived at most .
The startling aspect of life aboard the Axiom is its total homogeneity .
Everyone is morbidly obese ; everyone drinks fatty meal - replacement shakes ; everyone rides around in automated carts instead of walking ; no one engages in direct personal communication ; no one exercises ; everyone follows the BNL corporation 's fashion advice ( when the announcements tell the people that " blue is the new red , " all Axiom inhabitants switch their suit color from red to blue at the press of a button ) .
Not only does this homogeneity mark one instant in time ; it has been present all throughout the Axiom 's seven centuries of travel through space .
During that time , there has been no technological progress , no cultural innovation , and no noncosmetic changes in the aesthetic , philosophical , and political arrangements aboard the ship .
Imagine in 2008 if nothing had changed in human affairs since the year 1308 .
The humans in WALL - E are not portrayed as evil ; they are polite and well intentioned , but ignorant and torpid .
Strangely enough , the ship has an extensive information database about life and conditions on Earth , and nobody bothered to examine this easily accessible information for seven centuries , until the Captain suddenly has a burst of interest .
Are we to assume that curiosity and elementary initiative are such rarities that they are exercised only once in 700 years ?
WALL -E is egregiously wrong in assuming that technological conveniences such as easily accessible food , transportation , entertainment , and communication render all people lazy , indulgent , and devoid of initiative .
Some people , to be sure , respond in this way .
In the real world , however , this response tends to be temporary .
In the more economically advanced countries , it tends to affect lower - income individuals who have just begun accessing historically luxurious standards of living and have not yet developed cultural habits for managing their newfound wealth and opportunities responsibly .
These habits will come with time — as they always have among groups of people that have lived prosperously for generations .
Already in the United States , the big fast - food chains are racing to offer health foods — salads , fruit , and other low - calorie snacks — to keep the patronage of those who would have been satisfied with Big Macs and Whoppers in the past .
Meanwhile , a wide variety of health foods and diet foods — some genuinely effective and others of dubious merit — are being consumed more broadly than ever before .
In the meantime , of course , millions of people have never neglected healthful habits , even though they have for decades been surrounded by consumer goods that — in the anticapitalists ' eyes — would lead them to ruin .
Just as the ready availability of guns does not automatically turn peaceful people into rampaging maniacs , neither does the ready availability of all sorts of foods turn responsible , educated , self - respecting individuals into rage - of - the - moment hedonists .
With some kinds of wants met — such as food , shelter , and transportation — people virtually always tend to develop new wants or to focus on existing lower - priority wants not yet addressed .
As Ludwig von Mises showed , people will act so long as they are faced with uncertainty and believe themselves capable of somehow affecting the uncertain future .
These conditions will never stop existing — no matter how comfortable and prosperous people become .
Thus , humans will always act and will always strive to improve their lives .
A wholly static , apathetic , sated , and torpid society is inconceivable in reality .
The economy aboard the Axiom does however seem to be the dream economy of popular " static equilibrium " models , where nothing ever changes — not production , consumption , preferences , or expectations of the future .
Yet , as Austrian economics informs us , such conditions have never existed nor can they exist .
At best , they are merely useful theoretical constructs — certainly not accurate depictions of any realistic economy .
In the real world , there exist immense changes of preferences , widely dispersed information , tremendous uncertainty about the future , and numerous entrepreneurs who alert themselves to possible opportunities for satisfying people 's wants in a better way than they are currently being satisfied .
That there is not one entrepreneur aboard the Axiom prior to the Captain 's paradigm - shifting discovery of information that was easily accessible to everybody for the last seven centuries is testimony to the filmmakers ' ignorance of what makes economic change possible and ubiquitous .
The humans ' return to Earth and attempt to " rebuild " their lives is ludicrous from any sound economic perspective .
After having had a sustainable automatic food production system aboard the Axiom — which had apparently worked without fail for seven centuries — humans all of a sudden decide to resort to traditional agriculture .
The one thing they have machine capital to do for them , they decide to do manually instead .
Rather than devoting the precious time bought by the ready availability of food to , say , create art , repair all those broken skyscrapers , or design even better robots , the humans decide to manually dig holes in the ground and grow their food through backbreaking toil that led millions throughout history to die premature deaths .
Oh , by the way , the film left that part out .
Virtually no one today who romanticizes the " good old days " of traditional agriculture recognizes how nasty , brutish , and short life under such conditions had been for millennia .
Once the first industrial factories opened — with their long hours , dangerous equipment , and meager pay — people flocked to them in droves , because the factory conditions ( including the sanitation provided and wages paid ) were greatly preferable to those of toiling virtually all day on the traditional farm .
The creators of WALL-E , sitting in their comfortable Hollywood studios , did a tremendous disservice to the civilization that made their work and high standards of living possible .
They glorified a lifestyle that would likely have killed them — and countless others — had it actually been revived .
I for one have seen a semblance of these " good old days , " having spent summers as a child with my maternal grandparents in a remote Belarusian village — where little had changed since the 1917 socialist revolution .
Those extolling the virtues of traditional farm life never mention the perpetual manual labor , lack of sanitation , lack of health care , and widespread inclinations toward alcoholism .
I have spent my life to date moving increasingly further away from that , and I will resist vigorously the efforts of those who seek to drag our entire civilization back into miserable , decrepit premodernity .
WALL-E is an assault on modern civilization , borne of deep economic and historical ignorance .
The film shamefully betrays the efforts of countless heroic individuals who have raised humanity out of the muck of barbarism .
Its antitechnological , anticapitalist message needs to be exposed and countered by all thinking individuals .

These declines — neither of which take into account the probable impact of the sequestration cuts in the months ahead — were described in a special agency report now being made available to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ( TRAC ) on a monthly basis .
This series of internal IRS management reports — the last one covers the period ending in January 2013 — are provided by the IRS thanks to a court order granted TRAC as a result of a suit filed under the Freedom of Information Act.

How Big An IRS Do We Need ?
For many years , the Internal Revenue Service sought to measure the agency 's success or failure by tracking the taxes it collected .
While at one level this approach seemed to make sense , there was a problem : more audit revenues did not necessarily mean the IRS was doing a better job .
Indeed , in a perverse way , a drop in voluntary tax compliance might make agency auditors appear to be more " productive , " since it would be easier to uncover substantial underreported tax payments .
Then , fifty years ago , under President Kennedy 's IRS Commissioner Mortimer Caplin , the agency came up with another idea .
With the careful audit of a random sample of taxpayers on a regular basis , the government would develop a wholly different system for calculating the overall effectiveness of the IRS and assist it in better targeting its resources .
With the survey , called the Taxpayers Compliance Measurement Program ( TCMP ) , the IRS would determine the proportion of taxpayers who were routinely complying with the nation 's highly complicated tax laws .
And the proportion that was not .
In terms of revenue , how significant was tax under -reporting ?
By regularly conducting new surveys , IRS also could see whether compliance was increasing or decreasing and the extent to which the changes that were spotted for particular groups of taxpayers was related to changes in agency enforcement or taxpayer service efforts , or to changes in the tax laws themselves .
As the results from successive TCMP surveys rolled in , and with the answers to these and many other such questions in hand , the IRS sought to better direct its efforts towards areas with the most serious problems .
Equally important , the public and Congress had a sound way of judging the effectiveness of the administration of the tax laws .
The TCMP , however , was brought to an end during the Reagan Administration .
While the agency has sought to develop alternatives under its National Research Program , these efforts have largely failed to live up to their promise .
As a direct result of the absence of this critical information , tax administrators , Congressional committees and the public to this day have no systemic information about the impact the growing budget restrictions have had , and will have , on the effectiveness of one of the largest , most important and powerful of all government agencies .
The questions are difficult and many .
If the agency cuts back on the assistance it provides taxpayers to determine the taxes they owe , will the result be less compliance ?
How many auditors does the IRS need to assure that everyone — from low income taxpayers to the wealthiest corporations — are properly reporting their income ?
How many trained agents and criminal investigators does it require to detect , fine and sometimes prosecute those who commit outright fraud ?
With more document matching and other automated procedures , can the agency make up for the steady decline in its work force and deliver on the promise in its mission statement : " Provide America 's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all " ?
The Current IRS Enforcement Picture for Individuals
Here are some details .
Tax audit rates for individual taxpayers fell by 5.3 percent in FY 2012 , according to other agency data analyzed by TRAC .
But because the number of returns filed had increased , the chances of audits fell at an even faster pace , by 7 percent .
The declines were roughly similar to the reductions in the IRS 's overall staffing levels , down just under 5 percent in FY 2012 .
This recent decline continues a long - term trend : over the last two decades , IRS staffing has been cut by 23 percent .
During this same period , however , the IRS workload has not decreased .
In fact , for one example , the number of individual tax returns have grown by 27 percent .
See Table 2 ; detail for additional years can be found in Table 3 below .
Table 2 . IRS Audits of Income Tax Returns Filed by Individuals * FY 2011 FY 2012 Change IRS Employees 94,709 90,280 - 4.7 % Returns Filed 140,837,499 143,399,737 1.8 % Audits 1,564,690 1,481,966 - 5.3 % Face - to - Face 391,621 358,435 - 8.5 % Correspondence 1,173,069 1,123,531 - 4.2 % Audits per 1000 Returns 11.1 10.3 - 7.0 % Face - to - Face 2.8 2.5 - 10.1 % Correspondence 8.3 7.8 - 5.9 %
The IRS has tried to manage this squeeze by shifting away from in - depth , face - to - face audits and toward semi-automated correspondence audits .
The agency data show that while in - depth audits dropped by more than half in the last 20 years , correspondence audits nearly tripled .
This shift has enabled the IRS to limit the decline in the overall audit rate for individual taxpayers — from 10.7 audits per thousand returns in FY 1992 to 10.3 audits per thousand returns in FY 2012 .
However , as just noted , the nature of an audit in these years has drastically changed .
These trends are shown in Figure 2 , with supporting detail in this table .
Direct Examination Staff Years
Figure 2 . Large Business and International DivisionDirect Examination Staff Years
The IRS has also leveraged computer technology to identify returns with unreported income through computerized matching with the information returns ( 1099s ) it receives .
As a result of this program , last year three times as many returns received a computer unreported income notice than were subject to a tax audit — 4.5 million notices compared with 1.5 returns audited .
While the number of such notices has risen over the past two decades , the proportion of taxpayers receiving them last year ( 3.2 percent ) has changed little from the proportion receiving them two decades ago ( 3.3 percent ) .
The rate , however has varied over this period , and is markedly up from the proportion of returns receiving such notices ten years ago when the rate was 1.2 percent .
The IRS has also automated the checking for math errors , which tend to occur when Congress changes tax provisions .
Last year , such errors were found in 2 percent of returns , less than one - fifth the rate a decade ago during FY 2002 .
See Figure 3 and supporting table .
Figure 3 . IRS Computer - based Corrections to Federal Income Tax Returns Filed by Individuals
There is little question that tax enforcement today — with computer technology , semi-automated correspondence audits and computer matching — is less costly than it was previously , and may well be adequate to deal with many simpler tax situations .
It is less clear , however , that this computerized audit process can provide adequate coverage for wealthier individuals , many of whom have complicated business or investment income .
Conclusion
As budget cuts have forced a reduction in many different IRS efforts , the elimination of the TCMP and the broad failure of the agency to develop a workable alternative has left a series of giant question marks .
How will the steady declines affect the continuing viability of a wide range of vital government services ?
How will both the giant corporations and individual taxpayers respond as the IRS presence recedes ?
In the absence of the complex research program launched five decades ago by Commissioner Caplin , determining how large or small the IRS should be in the years ahead will be extremely difficult .

A human foot has been found on a beach near the west - coast city of Vancouver , Canadian police say .
It is the fifth human foot to wash up on beaches in the area in the past year .
The latest find is a left foot , whereas the other four were right feet .
Walkers spotted the body part floating in water off the suburb of Westham Island in British Columbia on Monday .
Police and coroners are trying to identify the foot and discover if it is linked to the others found in the area .
All were wearing shoes and had been in the water for some time .
A police spokesman , PC Sharlene Brooks , said the find was being treated as a criminal investigation .
" We are certainly not discounting the possibility that this may be linked to the other recovered feet , but it is just too premature and very speculative for us to even entertain that right now , " PC Brookes said .
She said police might not be able to say for some time whether the foot 's DNA matched a known missing person , or any of the feet found previously .
Gruesome finds
The previous discoveries , all right feet , were all wearing running shoes .
Last August , two human feet washed up on the beaches of small islands north of Vancouver .
Then in February a third single , right foot drifted ashore .
The fourth foot was discovered on a beach in suburban Vancouver in May .
The city 's newspapers and coffee shops are buzzing with theories to explain the mystery , says the BBC's Ian Gunn in Vancouver .
Organised crime , boating accidents - even the 2004 Asian tsunami - are all being offered as possible solutions , our correspondent says .
Police have said there is no evidence that the feet were deliberately severed or removed by force .
Forensic experts say it is not unusual for body parts to become separated after they have been in the water for a long time .

What are these ?
Boeing has become an algae true believer .
The company has joined scientists , academics and industry types in founding the Algal Biomass Organization to " facilitate commercialization and market development of microalgae biomass specifically for biofuels production and greenhouse gas abatement " and put two of its executives on the board .
It 's a significant development because Boeing , the world 's largest manufacturer of commercial jets , has the money and the muscle to push algal fuels as an alternative to fossil fuels .
The company had until now been lukewarm about biofuels , but with the industry reeling from skyrocketing fuel costs - jet fuel topped $ 150 a barrel last week , a body blow to an industry that uses 5 million barrels of it a day - and increasing pressure to reduce emissions , Boeing is getting serious about algae .
" ?? Boeing recognizes that algae biomass holds tremendous potential for use as jet fuel , and it fits into our plan to guide aviation towards commercially viable and sustainable fuel sources , " says Boeing 's Billy Glover , who co-chairs the ABO steering committee .
The entire air industry is fighting for its life these days , and manufacturers have joined airlines in a mad scramble to find an alternative to fossil fuels .
So far , those efforts have been piecemeal .
The ABO is meant to bring order to the chaos .
In February , Virgin Atlantic became the first airline to test biofuels when it flew a Boeing 747 partially fueled by coconut and babassu oil .
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines recently announced plans to test algal fuel developed by AlgaeLink and plans to have it fueling 50 planes by 2010 .
JetBlue and Airbus have joined the party and are working on a veggie oil - algae combination .
Although Boeing has dabbled in algal fuels , it 's emphasized improvements in airframe and engine design - through the much - delayed 787 Dreamliner jet - as the best way to reduce reliance on fossil fuels .
A company white paper ( .pdf ) on alt fuel is n't exactly a ringing endorsement :
Presently , it appears that an approach of using a ?? drop - in ? � jet fuel replacement , which may consist of a kerosene and synthetic fuel blend , will be possible for use in existing and near term aircraft .
Future mid-term aircraft may use a bio-jet and synthetic fuel blend in ultra-efficient airplane designs .
Future , long - term engines and aircraft in the 50 - plus year horizon , may be specifically designed to use a low or zero - carbon fuel .
But with skyrocketing fuel prices and collapsing airlines threatening to take a big chunk out of its order book , Boeing 's had a change of heart .
" In the past two years , we have changed from algae skeptics to proponents , " concedes Dave Daggett , the airline 's environmental specialist .
It 's taken a while , but it looks like Boeing is in the algae game in a major way .

Former House aide charged in lobbying scandal Associated Press
Published : Monday June 2 , 2008

Print This Email
This A one - time chief of staff to former Oklahoma Rep. Ernest Istook has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the House as part of the Jack Abramoff scandal .
John Albaugh is accused of accepting meals , sports and concert tickets , and other perks from lobbyists in exchange for official favors , according to charges outlined in a criminal information filed in federal court on Friday .
Such documents are normally entered as part of a plea deal .
Albaugh was expected to appear at a court hearing Monday afternoon .
Albaugh served eight years as top aide for Istook , who left Congress to run for governor of Oklahoma in 2006 .
Istook lost and is now a fellow at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank in Washington .
Istook , who has not been charged with any wrongdoing , accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Abramoff and his associates .
Referred to as " Representative 4 " in court documents , he also used the lobbyist 's skybox tickets for concerts .
He later donated the campaign money to charity and paid for the seats .
Abramoff has pleaded guilty to bribing lawmakers to support policies that helped his clients , including Indian tribes .
Istook was among 33 lawmakers who accepted Abramoff - related money and wrote letters urging the Bush administration to reject a casino proposal that Abramoff 's clients opposed .
He has said the letter was unrelated to the campaign contributions .
" I signed the letter as part of my long - standing opposition to the spread of gambling , and for no other reason , " Istook said in 2005 .
Throughout the court documents
Albaugh is depicted in close contact with " Lobbyist C , " asking him for sports tickets , fundraisers for his boss and other favors .
In return Lobbyist C , identified as a co-conspirator , gets help with money for transportation projects for his clients .
Albaugh was in a position to help as chief of staff to Istook , who chaired the House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation , treasury and independent agencies .
Lobbyist C is not identified by name , but details in the documents make clear that it is Kevin Ring , a one - time aide to Rep. John Doolittle , R - Calif. , who later went to work for Abramoff .
Messages were left seeking comment at Albaugh 's office Friday .
Istook and Ring did not immediately return a call on Monday seeking comment .
Ring and Doolittle both are under investigation in the Abramoff probe .
Doolittle is retiring from Congress at the end of this year , partly because of the investigation .
Court documents describe a series of e-mails in 2002 in which Ring told Albaugh , " You are going to eat free off of our clients . "
The documents also allege that Istook called Abramoff in 2003 to thank him in advance for use of one of Abramoff 's suites at FedEx Field in Landover , Md. , for a fundraising event .
During the call , the government alleges , Istook asked Abramoff which projects his clients wanted in the upcoming transportation bill .
The documents refer to an e-mail Abramoff sent to his lobby colleagues saying Istook " had basically asked what we want in the transportation bill , " and instructing the lobbyists to " make sure we load up our entire Christmas list . "
The documents allege that four of Lobbyist C's clients later received at least $ 1 million each in the transportation bill .
The clients are n't named , but Ring represented a number of municipalities , including around Doolittle 's Northern California district , that were seeking money for transportation projects .
Abramoff is serving prison time for a fraudulent Florida casino deal and is still awaiting sentencing in his scheme to bribe public officials in Washington .
As part of his plea deal , he agreed to become a witness against the Washington power - brokers he once treated to lavish meals , golf vacations and money .
Though Istook 's congressional campaign had to repay one of Abramoff 's companies for the use of skyboxes for an " American Idol " concert and a Washington Redskins football game , he has repeatedly denied any ties to the disgraced lobbyist .
" I barely knew the man , " he said in 2006 .
" I never worked with him on any issue or any project and I 'm appalled at what he has done . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Al Gore , the Nobel Prize - winning crusader on climate change , challenged the United States on Thursday to commit to producing all U.S. electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind power in 10 years .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
“ Our dangerous over - reliance on carbon - based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges -- the economic , environmental and national security crises , ” the former Democratic vice president and presidential candidate in 2000 told a meeting in Washington .
“ So today I challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon - free sources within 10 years , ” he said .
Gore also took aim at the Bush administration ’s policies on climate change , without mentioning the president by name .
Advocates of tougher measures to combat global warming caused by carbon emissions have long said President George W. Bush has done too little about climate change .
Gore , who faced a smattering of protesters rallying against big government outside the hall , likened the fight against climate change to the successful challenge in the 1960s to send humans to the Moon within the decade .
Gore , who starred in the Academy Award - winning documentary “ An Inconvenient Truth ” about the perils of global warming , also disparaged goals set too far in the future .
“ A political promise to do something 40 years from now is universally ignored because everyone knows it ’s totally meaningless .
Ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit our target . ”
Bush has opposed economy - wide limits on the emission of climate - warming carbon dioxide .
Last week , he and other leaders of the Group of Eight major industrialized nations offered a non-binding pledge to cut emissions 50 percent by 2050 -- 42 years from now .
“ WE MUST MOVE FIRST ”
The Bush administration and the other rich nations said they could not meet this goal without participation from developing economies like China and India .
Gore , noting that an international climate change treaty is expected to be concluded by the end of the next U.S. president ’s first year in office , questioned any delay on combating global warming .
“ It is a great error to say that the United States must wait for others to join us in this matter , ” he said .
“ In fact , we must move first , because that is the key to getting others to follow ; and because moving first is in our own national interest . ”
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said he supported Gore ’s challenge , and said he would fast - track investments in renewable energy like solar , wind and biofuels if elected .
“ It ’s a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced , and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer , ” he said .
Obama ’s rival in the November election , Republican candidate John McCain , also backed Gore ’s plan .
“ If the vice president says it ’s do - able , I believe it ’s do - able , ” he told reporters .
Gore said he had had conversations with Obama , McCain , and with Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party candidate .

Are We a Nation of Financial Illiterates ?
Let ’s begin with two questions :
1 . Do you consider yourself financially literate ?
2 . If so , how did you get that way ?
And now , a third question :
3 . How important is widespread financial literacy to the health of a modern society ?
Before you answer the first question , take this little quiz , borrowed from the website of Annamaria Lusardi , a professor of economics at Dartmouth who knows and cares more about financial literacy than anyone else you ’re likely to encounter :
1. Suppose you had $ 100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 percent per year .
After 5 years , how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow ?
a .
More than $ 102
b. Exactly $ 102
c. Less than $ 102
d . Do not know 2 . Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 percent per year and inflation was 2 percent per year .
After 1 year , would you be able to buy more than , exactly the same as , or less than today with the money in this account ?
a .
More than today
b. Exactly the same as today
c. Less than today
d . Do not know 3 .
Do you think that the following statement is true or false ?
“ Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund . ” a .
True
b. False
c. Do not know
The correct answers are …
a. , c. , and b.
I am guessing that the vast majority of this blog ’s readers got all three answers correct .
But there ’s probably money to be made in betting the opposite way .
Those three questions are the ones that Lusardi , along with Olivia Mitchell of Penn , have been inserting in a variety of major U.S. surveys .
In a new working paper titled “ Financial Literacy : An Essential Tool for Informed Consumer Choice ? ” ( abstract here , download here ) , Lusardi writes that among respondents age 50 and older , only half of them got the first two answers right and only one - third of them got all three answers right .
Because Lusardi , Mitchell , and many other economists focus on retirement behavior , it is pretty horrible news to learn that so many older people are ill - equipped in the basics of saving and investing .
With most U.S. companies doing away with big employee pensions ( see Roger Lowenstein ‘s new book While America Aged ) , more and more people have to plan their own retirements .
I share their concern but I also think that too much emphasis is put on retirement know - how .
It ’s not that saving for retirement is n’t important ; but by the time you ’ve woken up to the fact you have no idea what you ’re doing for retirement , you ’ve probably already bungled a lot of financial decisions .
Which brings us to :
Question No. 2 : If you are financially literate , how did you get that way ?
I ’d like to think I ’m at least adequate in taking care of my family ’s finances and everything that includes in the modern world : real - estate and insurance decisions , saving for college and retirement , investing and tax planning , etc .
But it has been a bit of trial - by - error mixed with trial - by - fire — and to be honest , I was very fortunate to have an older brother who is smart , frugal , patient , and who worked for many years in finance .
If it were n’t for him , I ’d be in considerably sadder shape .
But here ’s my point : I ’m not exactly undereducated .
I had 13 years of public schooling , 4 years of college , and another 2 years of graduate school — and after all that schooling , I do n’t know if I learned enough to answer all three of Lusardi ’s questions correctly .
The subjects simply did n’t come up .
Just as they apparently did n’t for the two - thirds of the older respondents to Lusardi ’s questions .
The good news is that economics is being taught much more in high school now than it was 20 or 30 years ago .
( While “ economics ” is of course not the same as “ personal finance ” or “ financial literacy , ” let ’s for the time being pretend that most economics courses give students a rudimentary understanding of personal finance . )
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( “ The Nation ’s Report Card ” ) , 9 of 10 high - school students said they were exposed to some economics education , up from 1 in 4 in 1982 .
According to the National Council on Economic Education , 17 states now require students to take an econ course to graduate , up from 13 states in 1998 .
So how ’s it working ?
Not very well .
According to the latest annual survey by the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy , “ high school seniors correctly answered only 48.3 percent of the questions , ” down from 52.4 percent a year earlier .
As Lusardi points out in her new paper , there is a vast — if perhaps unsurprising — split in the population : “ Those with low education , women , African - Americans , and Hispanics display particularly low levels of literacy . ”
Which brings us to Question No. 3 : How important is widespread financial literacy to the health of a modern society ?
Well , I would say very .
So would Lusardi .
When you have a society with a modern and fairly complex financial system , it ’s probably not a good sign that more than half of the citizenry can’t handle even the basics : how a credit card actually works ( I know some teenagers , e.g. , who really think it ’s “ free money ” ) ; the beauty of compound interest and the ugliness of paying the minimum balance on a credit card ; how to save and invest even when you do n’t think you can ; how to learn the amount of insurance you need , etc.
Lusardi wonders whether people should n’t be required to get a license in order to take out a mortgage .
That certainly would have dampened the subprime mess a bit , yes ?
And we have n’t even touched upon the most basic macroeconomic issues like supply and demand , etc .
Can you imagine how different the shrill news coverage of rising gas prices would be if the public ( and the media ) cared even just a little bit about how the economy actually works ?
A lot of behavioral economics , including the good ideas in Nudge , is about cleverly correcting harmful human tendencies — but many of these tendencies need correction only because so many people are so undereducated in such matters .
I am all in favor of a well - rounded education , but seriously : what good is it if high - school students learn about Flaubert , biology , and trigonometry if they do n’t learn how to take care of their money ?
One bright side to the increasingly dark economic news these days is that more and more people will learn ( albeit the hard way ) Rule No. 1 : Do not buy what you cannot afford .
So what ’s to be done ?
I turned to Lusardi with a few questions ; her answers are well worth reading .
I ’d also be interested in hearing your ideas in the comments .
Q : How does U.S. financial literacy compare to other developed nations ?
A : This is a difficult question to answer because , as you may know from my work , almost no ( national ) survey has ( or had ) information to measure financial literacy .
Moreover , we do not have a consistent set of literacy questions across countries .
However , judging from some work I have been doing comparing the U.S. with the Netherlands and Italy and the O.E.C.D. Report on Improving Financial Literacy , I can say that other developing nations face the same problem of widespread financial illiteracy .
If anything , financial illiteracy in other countries is worse than in the United States .
Q : Was there ever a time when financial literacy was better taught in U.S. schools ?
( I believe that “ home economics , ” back when it was born , included some home - finance component , did n’t it ? )
A : Some type of consumer education has been present from the early years ( 1930 ’s and 1940’s ) .
Between 1957 and 1985 , 29 states adopted legislation mandating some form of “ consumer ” education in secondary schools .
Fourteen states specifically required coverage of topics relevant to household financial decision making , from budgeting and credit management to balancing checkbooks .
Yet , if you read the results from the JumpStart Coalition Survey of Personal Financial Literacy , financial knowledge is very low in high school and not improving .
Because of this evidence , some have argued against teaching financial literacy in high school ( and against financial literacy education in general ) .
In my judgment , this is premature .
In fact , this evidence can be interpreted as showing that we need to improve the way in which we teach financial literacy in school .
Q : I would argue that teaching kids biology , trigonometry , and literature may be less useful than teaching basic financial literacy ; what are the barriers to doing so , and who is trying hardest to make this happen ?
A : I do not think that literature and mathematics are less useful in the lives of people than financial literacy .
In my view , financial literacy should not replace these courses ( in fact , some financial literacy can be integrated into mathematics ) , but should be added into the curriculum with the same high standing .
As students study Faulkner or Steinbeck , Madame Curie or Louis Pasteur , they can also study Milton Friedman .
In my view , as I will explain more below , we need to stay away from things like how to balance a checkbook and teach about the workings of the economy .
We do not teach how to bake a cake in high school .
It would be useful to know how to cook ( please see statistics about obesity ) , it would add to the lives of people , and moms are now working full time and have stopped teaching that , but these practical matters should stay out of schools .
Among the barriers about teaching financial literacy in school are 1 ) lack of resources and financial support ( and we need well trained teachers ) ; 2 ) the fragmentation of the legislation ( most of the decisions about curricula are done at the state and local level ) ; and 3 ) the lack of consensus about what to teach ( many institutions , including banks , are devising high school curricula and there is a wide spectrum of curricula out there ) .
Both the National Endowment for Financial Education ( N.E.F.E. ) and the National Council of Economic Education ( N.C.E.E. ) are doing good work to raise awareness and introduce financial education in school .
Q : If you were president of the U.S. for a day ( or longer ) , what are 5 pieces of financial literacy that you ’d try to have taught to everyone ?
A : If I were president for a day , I would like the following topics taught in high school :
1. Basics of how markets work .
Things like : it is the law of demand and supply that determines prices in competitive markets , and the interest rate is the price of money .
2 . Time value of money and the working of interest compounding : Because so many payments in finance happen at different points in time , one needs to know how to compare payments .
Discounting is at the basis of asset pricing .
What is the price of bonds ?
It is the present value of its payments .
Interest compounding is a fundamental concept and it requires a little bit of math .
It is critically important to understand interest compounding to be able to fully appreciate the importance of starting to save young and how to borrow and handle debt .
3 . The concept of risk and the working of risk diversification and insurance : A lot of the decisions about saving and investing have to do with how to handle risk .
4 . Basic accounting :
To know the net values one needs to subtract assets and liabilities , and that it makes a big difference between whether we choose market prices versus book prices .
5 . Rights and responsibilities of consumers and institutions .
People need to know there is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , bank deposits are safe ( up to $ 100,000 ) , and there is no need to line up to withdraw deposits ; they should know who does and does not have fiduciary duties and what it means to use a financial advisor ( you can not sue them if the stock market plummets ) .
These are rigorous topics , there exists a lot of first rate academic research on them , and they deserve a seat in high schools .
In other words , yes to financial literacy and without apology !
If I were president for another day , I would also do the following :
1 . Have federal , rather than state and local policies , about financial education :
Why should Nevada have a different curriculum than New Jersey ; Does interest compounding work differently in New Jersey ?
2 . Make the financial industry stay out of the process of devising curricula and financial education in general .
It is a problem of incentives ( they do not face the right incentives ) .
This is a job for non -for - profits and academics and it is critically important to have independent players .
3 . I would make sure teachers are equipped to teach and resources are allocated appropriately ( at least get the same money as other topics ) .
Having the gym teacher do financial literacy education defies the purpose of having financial education in schools .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar retreated on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a congressional committee that more interest rate cuts may be necessary because the U.S. economic outlook has worsened .

Sharp losses in U.S. shares have also weighed on dollar / yen after worse - than - expected results from brokerage Merrill Lynch MER.N reignited investors ' aversion to risk .
Bernanke ’s bleak assessment of the U.S. economy ’s health in testimony before the House of Representatives ’ Budget Committee further added to the gloom in the market .
The Fed chief ’s comments were widely seen as a signal that the U.S. central bank would slash rates by a hefty half - percentage point at month ’s end , which would undermine the attractiveness of dollar - denominated assets .
Separately , a survey showed factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region contracted dramatically in January , reinforcing fears of recession .
“ Overall , the testimony reinforced the view that the Fed is more concerned about downside risks to growth than upside risks to inflation at this stage , and appears to favor maximum monetary and fiscal stimulus in the first half to head off the risk of recession , ” said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist , at Bank of New York Mellon .
Late afternoon in New York , the dollar was down 0.7 percent against the yen at 106.74 , though it was well off the session low at 106.61 .
Against a basket of major currencies , the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 76.190 .
DXY .
The euro hit a session low of 156.34 yen , down nearly 0.8 percent from late on Wednesday .
Bernanke also told lawmakers that he does not expect the United States to slide into a recession , although that provided little relief to the markets .
“ The U.S. economy remains extraordinarily resilient , ” he said .
“ We currently see the economy as continuing to grow but growing at a relatively slow pace , particularly in the first half of this year . ”
Also on Thursday , the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index plunged to minus 20.9 in January from minus 1.6 in December , putting further pressure on the dollar .
It was the sharpest one - month drop since January 2001 , as the economy was on the cusp of a recession , and well below economists ’ forecasts for a slight uptick to minus 1.0 .
“ Because the index has proven to be a helpful bellwether of broader , national indicators of manufacturing activity , this sharp drop is an especially worrisome sign that the economy may be sliding into contraction or may already be in decline , ” said David Resler , chief economist at security firm Nomura in New York .
The euro was little changed at $ 1.4656 .
The single currency was earlier bolstered by comments from European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet on Thursday .
He said efforts to anchor inflation should lead to high levels of growth in the euro zone .
Elsewhere , sterling rose against the euro and dollar after John Gieve , deputy governor of the Bank of England , said inflation is likely to rise well above target in the coming months .
The British currency has come under pressure in recent weeks as weak data led to increased expectations of a UK rate cut .
But Gieve ’s comments shifted investors ’ focus to inflation that could limit the extent of interest rate cuts .
Sterling was last up 0.3 percent against the dollar at $ 1.9695 GBP = .
Euro / sterling was down 0.4 percent at 74.39 pence .

John
Yoo stands outside the Anglo - American legal tradition .
His views lead to self - incrimination wrung out of a victim by torture .
He believes a president of the US can initiate war , even on false pretenses , and then use the war he starts as cover for depriving US citizens of habeas corpus protection .
A US attorney general informed by Yoo ’s memos even went so far as to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Constitution does not provide habeas corpus protection to US citizens .
Yoo ’s animosity to US civil liberties made him a logical choice for appointment to the Bush Regime ’s Department of Justice ( sic ) , but his appointment as a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , shatters that university ’s liberal image .
Habeas corpus is a centuries - old British legal reform that stopped authorities from arbitrarily throwing a person into a dungeon and leaving him there forever without presenting charges in a court of law .
Without this protection , there can be no liberty .
Yoo is especially adamant that enemy combatants  have no rights to challenge the legality of their detentions by US authorities before a federal judge .
Yoo would have us believe that the detainees at Guantanamo , for example , are all terrorists who were attacking Americans .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The question is whether any of the detainees are enemy combatants .
Yoo would have it so because the president says it is so .
As the president has already decided , what is the sense of presenting evidence to a judge ?
For Yoo , accusation by the executive branch is the determination of guilt .
But what we know about the detainees is that many are hapless individuals who were captured by war lords and sold to the Americans for the bounty that the US government offered for terrorists . 
Some of the other detainees could be Taliban who were engaged in an Afghan civil war that had nothing whatsoever to do with the US .
The Taliban were not fighting the US until the US invaded Afghanistan and began attacking the Taliban .
This would make Taliban detainees prisoners of war captured by invading US troops .
How POWs can be tortured , denied Geneva Conventions protections , and tried by military tribunals without the US government being in violation of US and international law is inexplicable .
Suppose you were a traveling businessman grabbed by a tribe and sold to the Americans .
Would you consider it just to be detained in Gitmo , undergoing whatever abuse is dished out , for 5 or 6 years of your life , or forever , without family knowing what has become of you ?
Perhaps the greatest injustice was done to John Walker Lindh , an American citizen who , like Americans of a previous generation who fought in the Spanish Civil War , was fighting for the Taliban in the Afghan civil war against the Northern Alliance .
Suddenly the Americans entered the Afghan civil war on the side of the Northern Alliance .
Lindh was captured and sentenced to 20 years in prison .
This kind of punishment is a new form of tyranny .
It is not law , and it is not justice .
Lindh had no opportunity to withdraw once the US entered on the opposite side .
The only point of treating Lindh as if he were some dangerous traitor was to demonstrate that American citizens can be treated to a Kafka - type experience and have the American public accept it .
Yoo stands for the maximum amount of injustice , illegality and unconstitutionality that can be committed in the name of the national security state .
No American security was at stake in Afghanistan or in Iraq , and none is at stake in Iran today .
The Bush Regime may be creating security problems for Americans in the future by fomenting hatred of Americans among Muslims .
This security problem is insignificant compared to the threat to our liberty and freedom posed by John Yoo and his Republican Federalist Society colleagues who are committed to tyranny in the name of energy in the executive . 
Writing on the Wall Street Journal editorial page on June 17 , Yoo denounced the five Supreme Court justices who defended the US Constitution against arbitrary energy in the executive . 
Yoo believes that the Constitution and liberty rank below  the nation ’s security .
Fortunately ,
Yoo wrote , a fix is at hand .
 The advancing age of several justices  means that President McCain can give us more judges like Roberts ( no relation ) and Alito who will make certain that mere civil liberties do n’t get in the way of arbitrary executive power justified by national security .
In a Yoo - McCain regime , the terrorists you will have to fear are those in your own government , against whom you will have no protection whatsoever .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Before humans began burning fossil fuels , there was an eons - long balance between carbon dioxide emissions and Earth ’s ability to absorb them , but now the planet ca n’t keep up , scientists said on Sunday .

The finding , reported in the journal Nature Geoscience , relies on ancient Antarctic ice bubbles that contain air samples going back 610,000 years .
Climate scientists for the last 25 years or so have suggested that some kind of natural mechanism regulates our planet ’s temperature and the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Those skeptical about human influence on global warming point to this as the cause for recent climate change .
This research is likely the first observable evidence for this natural mechanism .
This mechanism , known as “ feedback , ” has been thrown out of whack by a steep rise in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal and petroleum for the last 200 years or so , said Richard Zeebe , a co-author of the report .
“ These feedbacks operate so slowly that they will not help us in terms of climate change ... that we ’re going to see in the next several hundred years , ” Zeebe said by telephone from the University of Hawaii .
“ Right now we have put the system entirely out of equilibrium . ”
In the ancient past , excess carbon dioxide came mostly from volcanoes , which spewed very little of the chemical compared to what humans activities do now , but it still had to be addressed .
This antique excess carbon dioxide -- a powerful greenhouse gas -- was removed from the atmosphere through the weathering of mountains , which take in the chemical .
In the end , it was washed downhill into oceans and buried in deep sea sediments , Zeebe said .
14,000 TIMES FASTER THAN NATURE
Zeebe analyzed carbon dioxide that had been captured in Antarctic ice , and by figuring out how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere at various points in time , he and his co-author determined that it waxed and waned along with the world ’s temperature .
“ When the carbon dioxide was low , the temperature was low , and we had an ice age , ” he said .
And while Earth ’s temperature fell during ice ages and rose during so - called interglacial periods between them , the planet ’s mean temperature has been going slowly down for about 600,000 years .
The average change in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last 600,000 years has been just 22 parts per million by volume , Zeebe said , which means that 22 molecules of carbon dioxide were added to , or removed from , every million molecules of air .
Since the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century , ushering in the widespread human use of fossil fuels , the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 100 parts per million .
That means human activities are putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere about 14,000 times as fast as natural processes do , Zeebe said .
And it appears to be speeding up : the U.S. government reported last week that in 2007 alone , atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 2.4 parts per million .
The natural mechanism will eventually absorb the excess carbon dioxide , Zeebe said , but not for hundreds of thousands of years .
“ This is a time period that we can hardly imagine , ” he said .
“ They are way too slow to help us to restore the balance that we have now basically distorted in a very short period of time . ”

An Interview with Starhawk ; sacred activism , collapse and the role of permaculture
The day after Starhawk ‘s talk in Totnes , she visited my house so that we could do a short interview .
It was a gloriously sunny day , and after we had concluded the interview , I gave her a tour of my garden ( well , my raised beds at least ) .
The interview ranged across Transition work , managing grief , activism , permaculture and much more …
What do you see as being the main characteristics of the challenge we face at this moment ?
I think the challenge we face at this moment is pretty simple .
We just need to completely transform our economy , our technology , our system of agriculture , our food system and the governance systems that go with it , and we needed to have done this all 10 years ago !
It ’s easy .. ( laughs ) .
I was saying we needed to do it all in the next 10 - 20 years , now James Hansen who is the leading climate change scientist is telling us that we are beyond the safety margin .
We used to think that we had until we got to 450 ppm before we went into irreversable kinds of changes .
He ’s saying now it ’s more like 350 ppm , and we are currently at about 385 .
That means we have a very short time to have any hope of stabilising the climate at a state where we are still going to suffer huge losses but they wo n’t be the level of devastation that they will be if we do n’t do something about it .
I think the reality is that the changes we need to make are huge and deep and transformative , and the time have to make it in is very short .
Part of the challenge is how do you actually face that , and then go ahead and do something constructive , not just either panic or pop a beer and watch TV and try to forget it !
What are your impressions of the Transition movement ?
I think the Transition movement has been a brilliant form of organising because it gives everybody some way that they can plug in .
I ’ve done all kinds of activism from teaching , creating ritual and consciousness changing , to street activism to non-violent interventions in military situations , things that have ranged from the tame to the really frightening and dangerous .
I know that you ca n’t ask everybody to immediately do something that is way beyond their level of comfort and ability .
People have to take a step , I thinkit is good to challenge people to push whatever envelope they are in to the next step , twenty steps beyond where they are now and with the Transition movement people can really plug in at any kind of level .
You can do something that could completely take over your whole life and which you ’d be devoted to , or you could do something that might take you 10 minutes a week .
You could do something on your own or you can do something with your neighbours , or you can reach out and do something with other people .
You can do things that work within the system and also things that also challenge the system .
I think Transition is working at a scale that is very effective .
A lot of times climate change gets reframed into “ what do we as individuals do ? ”
Well , you can change your lightbulbs and buy local … all of that is important , but its not nearly enough to address the problem .
We need to address the problem collectively , and we need to address it in terms of transforming not just our individual choices but the systems that give us those choices .
At the same time though , trying to address it on the global scale is kinda way beyond what most people feel like we can do … call up Bush and say “ you ’re wrong !
Think this out again ! ” ( laughs ) .
It ’s not within our scope .
Sometimes it can be .
Sometimes an individual like Cindy Sheehan , who is the mother of a young soldier who was killed in Iraq .
She started a whole anti-war movement in the families of soldiers and army people by saying I ’m going to sit down outside George Bush ’s gates until the guy comes out and talks to me .
For most of us though , we ’re not at that point , but organising your neighbours , your friends and your community , and starting to make changes on that local level , that neighbourhood level , that regional level , that ’s big enough that you can actually make an impact .
It ’s big enough that you can impact some of the systems that actually affect our lives .
We were just talking on the journey over here , Silvia lives in a little village outside Totnes , and she was saying that even if she wanted to get rid of her car , there is no public transport .
So , on local levels and on regional levels that ’s where you can start to think about those things that actually impact the way we live our lives very strongly .
At the same time its a small enough scale that you can feel like you can have an impact .
After Hurricane Katrina you spent time in New Orleans helping with the clean - up operation there .
From your time in what was , in effect , a collapsed society , what lessons do you draw for how we might cope with or adapt to a wider collapse ?
One of the reasons I went down there was to see what would it look like if our society did collapse .
You know , we are always thinking like we have this image that it is all going to collapse somewhere out there , and I thought I want to see what happens when it does , whether the ways I ’ve been thinking and the ways we ’ve been organising actually have anything to offer in that situation .
So I went down there , and it was a very profound experience to be in a place where there had been so much loss , so much grief and so much damage … it was pretty inconceivable .
I found that the things that were working were the small scale , grassroots efforts .
A group called Common Ground Relief that was started by a man called Malik Rahim , an old Black Panther organiser , he put out a call to activists , and activists came down there , set up a medical clinic that was up and running weeks before the Red Cross got anything off the ground .
They had food being distributed , and supplies being distributed , and people going out and helping with the clean up , with garbage removal and helping with all kinds of things , long before the City got anything up and running .
That was very empowering to see , “ wow , these ways of organising actually are effective , they are actually more effective than larger scale things are being ” .
At the same time I remember sitting there in those Common Ground meetings a month after the hurricane people would be saying “ well we ’re doing stuff here in Algiers , but what about the Lower 9th Ward , people are starting to come back ” , and someone else would say “ well what about Homer , we need to send teams up to Homer ” , and someone else would say “ what about Mississippi , we ’re not even talking about Mississippi , and Biloxi , harder hit than anywhere .
I remember just feeling complete overwhelm , and starting to think what this actually needs is an effort that is organised like the army , and like FEMA is supposed to be , a big scale response where someone could send teams into every parish and place , and assess the damage , bring supplies .
That ’s was n’t happening , and that is a complete failure of our government .
It really did change me .
I had always said that those small scale grassroots efforts are what we need and all we need , and it really made me look and say it is what we need but it is not all we need …
We also need to be able to make big , fast responses to disasters , and maybe ultimately , the answer will be networks of those smaller scale things that can come together and that can respond in some of the ways those big systems are supposed to .
Maybe it means actually getting those bigger systems functioning in the way they are supposed to .
Also , we often have a lot of debates in the US around politics and elections , what ’s the point of elections , they are all going to be run by the corporations , was Kerry really all that different from Bush and so on .
I will now never say there is no difference between the two .
There may be some ways we wish they were much more different than they are , but if we had had somebody at the head of our federal government who was even minimally confident , and interested in things like disaster relief , there are people dead now who would have been alive .
I think we owe those people the willingness not to be purists ourselves and a willingness to engage with those systems and do what we can to make them work , because its often the people who have the least resources who end up as the biggest victims when they do n’t work .
You also teach permaculture .
What do you see as the key role that permaculture has to play in our transition away from oil dependency ?
Permaculture is a whole approach to design that has a set of ethics and principles , that teach us how we can create systems that will meet our human needs while letting us regenerate the Earth around us .
It also has a body of specific practical knowledge about how to do this in different climates and different ecosystems .
For me it has always been the practical application of the idea that the Earth is sacred , and I think that the thing it really contributes to the whole debate on climate change is that when you study permaculture and practice it , you really learn to look at things as a whole , the way systems fit together and the way different elements integrate together .
I think that to shift our culture we need to have that kind of whole systems thinking .
It is not going to be one magic technology , one magic approach or one magic thing that we do that is going to save us , it is going to be a mosaic of different things and approaches .
We really need to know how to look at things as a whole , and how to look at the connections between them , and the relationships and interactions between them , not just at the things themselves .
The Transition concept is sometimes criticised for its focus on positive solutions , with people saying that given that it is not actively involved in confrontation , it must therefore not be based on any coherent critique of the global situation .
What are your thoughts on the balance between those two things ?
I think that we need both kinds of actions .
We desparately need things that allow people to make positive steps towards a future that we want .
Otherwise if we are just focused on confronting and complaining , then people just go into a downward spiral of despair and ultimately apathy .
We need to be building the solutions , that is where people find hope and inspiration .
I think we can do that without losing sight of the fact that there are real vested interests that are invested in keeping the system as it is , and ultimately that might take confrontation .
I think we are going to be standing on stronger ground if we have solutions we can point to , when we ’ve got alternatives that we can point to .
Its very hard if people are going to confront , let ’s say , the industrial agriculture industry , the biotech industry , if they are utterly dependent on that industry for their life !
That will limit the amount of confrontation they can do .
If they have alternatives , other ways to eat , then in some sense there is a form of non-violent direct action that is about withdrawing co-operation from unjust systems .
When we can build these other alternative systems and gradually withdraw support from the ones that are invested in the status quo , then we are a lot stronger in our ability to confront them .
You spoke last night about the need to create a space for people to grieve for the loss of their cars , for the loss of their luxuries and so on , what do you think that facilitating the expression of that grief would look like on a broader societal scale ?
We can do it in Totnes with people who are already open to that , but on a more mainstream scale , how might we do it ?
I think on a more mainstream scale the way I might approach it is through art , writing , through theatre , drama , creating ways in which people can express that grief or hear that grief expressed .
I think the kinds of things that are happening in Totnes also , like the Home Groups , those things can actually spread to a larger scale .
We did that in the 70s with the feminist consciousness - raising groups , and creating an overall understanding that its OK for people to feel that grief .
Often , as environmentalists , we tend to be extremely judgemental about people , “ oh they ’re just attached to their cars ” and to be able to acknowledge that it is a loss , its a loss of our dreams , of our expectations , a loss of a certain kind of personal comfort , freedom and convenience , for some people it will be a real hardship .
Once we leave space for that grief we can go through it , and then I think we can make an informed decision about it .
On previous trips to Britain I have rented a car to get around , and this time I thought “ I ca n’t do that ” , y’know ?
( laughs )
The state of the world , I just ca n’t really justify it , so I ’ve been taking the train and going OK , it is a loss in the sense that I can’t drive along listening to BBC Radio 4 and stopping at little teashops here and there , but in another sense there are also gains I did n’t expect .
It is actually much more pleasant to sit on the train and not have to worry about driving , and not have to worry about whether am I going to fall asleep because I am tired .
So , once we move through the grief , you start to see there are other benefits out on the other side , but if we are just lecturing to people about it , they are not going to see that , and they are probably going to cling me tightly to the things they have and the things they know .
During last night ’s talk you did a great visualisation of Totnes in 2030 ..( which I will post here tomorrow ) .
What would your vision be of Totnes in 2030 ?
( laughs ) .
My vision would be , as far as I can do it while I am leading a visualisation , there was a lot of food around .. there were flowers and plants in every crack in the sidewalk , window boxes full of things like cherry tomatoes , little food vendors , nut trees .
There were lots of kids running around , but the kids were n’t being confined in schools , where they sit at desks to learn , but they were learning in learning groups where they run around and take part in actual adult activities with mentors .
They were learning by doing and interacting and being part of the whole culture rather than being separated off into some place where you have to yell at them all the time to keep them quiet !
Old people too , there is more interaction between old people and children , not this age segregation that tends to happen .
Any last advice for people involved in Transition initiatives ?
I think that it is at an exciting and a little challenging state now , where it is like the preparation has been done , at least it has in quite a few places now , and now the question is going to be how do we actually turn that into real projects and real results , and I guess the time is short to begin doing that .
This is a good time to think about that and step up and see how to we take this to the next level .

A teacher who posted photographs on the internet of schools which collapsed in the Sichuan earthquake has been sent to a labour camp for a year , a rights group said yesterday .
Liu Shaokun was ordered to serve a year of " re-education through labour " , according to Human Rights in China .
The system does not require a charge or criminal trial and is not subject to court appeals .
He is believed to be the third person held after questioning why so many schools were destroyed in the earthquake .
Scores of schools across the southwestern province collapsed following the 7.9 magnitude shock .
In many cases , buildings around them remained intact , prompting questions about the quality of their construction .
The authorities initially responded to public outrage by promising an inquiry into whether shoddy building work was linked to corruption .
But they have subsequently silenced critics , ordering state media to avoid the subject and preventing parents from protesting .
In recent weeks police have dragged grieving relatives away from demonstrations in some areas .
Families have also been pressed to take compensation in exchange for signing contracts which include commitments not to protest or attempt to sue the authorities .
" Instead of investigating and pursuing accountability for shoddy and dangerous school buildings , the authorities are resorting to re-education through labour to silence and lock up concerned citizens like teacher Liu Shaokun and others , " said Sharon Hom , executive director of Human Rights in China .
The group said that Liu , a teacher at Guanghan middle school in Deyang city , was detained on June 25 for " disseminating rumours and destroying social order . "
His wife , who has not been allowed to see him , was told last week that he had been sent to a labour camp .
He had travelled through the quake zone taking pictures of the ruins of schools and circulating them on the internet , along with criticism .
The public security bureau in Deyang told the Guardian it was trying to find out more about the matter and the Guanghan city propaganda department said it had not heard of the case .
But an official with the general office of the Guanghan school where Liu worked told Reuters : " He was detained late last month by people from national security bureau for deliberately inciting families of victims to petition and disseminating anti-government rumours .
They searched his home and found evidence . "
The family of Huang Qi , a longstanding rights activist from Sichuan , said this month that he had been formally arrested for " illegal possession of state secrets " after helping bereaved parents and posting articles about structural failings of schools on his website .
China 's human rights record and lack of political freedom are under increasing scrutiny with the Olympic games only days away .
Yesterday a senior official from the International Olympic Committee admitted that colleagues had cut a deal to let Beijing block sensitive websites despite promises of unrestricted access .
Yesterday journalists at the main press centre were unable to access sensitive sites , including that of Amnesty International , which this week released a highly critical report on human rights in China .

Papua New Guinea will become like strife - torn Zimbabwe if the prime minister continues to intimidate and threaten the nation 's watchdogs , the PNG opposition says .
Prime Minister Michael Somare on Thursday used parliamentary privilege to attack recently retired Ombudsman Commission chief Ila Geno for initiating an inquiry into his personal finances .
Somare is facing a probe into alleged financial irregularities , some dating back 20 years .
He lost a court bid last month to stop the inquiry from proceeding , but has launched an appeal in the Supreme Court .
Government MPs rallied behind Somare in Thursday 's heated parliamentary session , saying he had " served PNG for 40 years " and was a " big man " beyond reproach , especially by the Ombudsman 's office .

The severe financial squeeze faced by America ’s families today is evident in stagnant income growth amid mounting job losses and in the spiraling costs of gas , energy , food , and healthcare amid record family debt levels .
The results of this squeeze , such as rising home foreclosures , credit card defaults , and automobile and other personal loan defaults , now include the ultimate financial disaster — personal bankruptcies , which are the broadest measure of economic distress and are once again on the rise .
The bankruptcy rate has risen sharply for two years in a row , already reaching levels as high as those seen in the early 1990s .
This jump in the bankruptcy rate should probably come as no surprise given the perilous economic terrain bequeathed to American families by the Bush administration and the conservative Congress in power for the first six years of Bush ’s presidency .
Yet conservatives had other plans for financially strapped families when they passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 .
BAPCPA , as the act is inelegantly known in the world of personal bankruptcy , was designed to make it harder for people to declare bankruptcy .
That bankruptcy rates are back on the wrong track despite a conscious legislative effort by conservatives to force families to struggle longer with unsustainable debt obligations than they can afford speaks volumes about today ’s enveloping financial squeeze .
And chances are high that personal bankruptcies will increase even further given current economic trends of weak income growth , high levels of debt , and rising prices .
Should bankruptcy rates — measured by filings per 1,000 people — continue to increase at the rate registered between early 2006 and the end of 2007 , bankruptcy rates will again reach the relatively high levels that were maintained before BAPCPA was enacted in April 2005 .
In particular , we find from the available data that :
The bankruptcy rate is again comparatively high .
The national annualized bankruptcy rate reached 2.7 filings per 1,000 people in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
This is a marked increase from the 1.5 rate in the first quarter of 2006 ( right after the new law was passed ) , exceeds the bankruptcy rates of the 1980s , and is only slightly below the bankruptcy rates of the early 1990s .
Bankruptcy rates have doubled in 16 states over the past two years and many states  are rapidly catching up to pre-BAPCPA levels .
In the fourth quarter of 2007 , seven states were less than one - third below the bankruptcy rate in their state before the enactment of BAPCPA , and seven states remained more than two - thirds below their pre-BAPCPA levels .
Since passage of the new law , bankruptcy rates have diverged across states .
States that had higher bankruptcy rates to begin with also tended to see faster growth in their bankruptcy rates .
In the end , bankruptcy rates varied more two years after the passage of the law than immediately after BAPCPA was enacted .
State - by - state data for the past two  years show that bankruptcy filings are connected to economic hardships .
States and quarters with higher unemployment rates are associated with higher bankruptcy rates , as are observations associated with lower real per capita incomes , and higher shares of people without health insurance .
A larger share of bankruptcy filers fall  under rules that are more beneficial to creditors than to debtors .
Since the changes to the bankruptcy code , the average share of Chapter 7 filings — which give debtors a clean slate — has , out of total filings , dropped by 11.4 percentage points .
Contrary to conservative claims , families enter bankruptcy because of external economic factors , such as a spell of unemployment , a medical emergency — particularly when health insurance is not available — and mounting debt levels .
This was apparent in the data before the enactment of BAPCPA in 2005 and remains apparent in the data after 2005 .
These facts run counter to the intent of Bush ’s bankruptcy bill , the largest overhaul to the federal bankruptcy code since its enactment in 1978 , and one of the signature legislative “ accomplishments ” of his presidency and the last conservative - led Congress .
Instead of eliminating presumably widespread “ bankruptcies of convenience , ” bankruptcy rates remain high because of fundamental economic pressures on America ’s families .
Opponents of these changes to the U.S. bankruptcy code in 2005 contended at the time that the increased costs and complexity of filing could make bankruptcy an impractical option for some families , or at least cause them to delay filing , while also closing an important pressure valve for financially struggling families .
They were right .
To truly address the bankruptcy rate in the United States , legislators must be willing to recognize the real reasons why families file for bankruptcy and address them accordingly .
This will require an overhaul of the bankruptcy code to ensure families have access to the long - standing American tradition of debtors being able to start over after financial disaster .
In addition , a number of other economic policy steps are needed to address the underlying causes of rising personal bankruptcies , especially very weak income growth , lack of health insurance , and lack of personal saving .

In the race to get high rankings on a consistent basis , SEO article writing plays a major role .
In fact , it is one of the most dominant factors where ranking is concerned , which is one of the topics for this particular article .
For website owners who are trying to master the art of writing articles that will create more visibility , the following advice and tips can prove to be very useful .
What Does An SEO Article Consist Of ?
There are many elements that go into SEO article writing , which is why starting with a basic question to bring them all together really helps .
Also , it ’s important to learn and test these elements in order to gain the most visibility .
Here is a quick breakdown of what a solid SEO article should fundamentally consist of :
Engaging Content
Strong Keywords
Distinct Headings
A Clean and Easy Layout
Writing Engaging Content
A fundamental aspect for search engines is to bring users websites with substance .
This also means they favor websites with content interesting enough to keep their audience for longer periods of time .
User engagement for a site at this point is critical for higher rankings .
Essentially , website owners want to post content that is n’t directed at robots or search engine crawlers .
Instead , the articles should be written with enough interesting / entertaining information to make every user want to stay longer and read more .
Researching And Using Keywords
While keywords are still very important , they need to be used carefully .
Thanks to years of blackhat tricks , search engines are crunching down on articles that openly fill the content with unnatural keywords .
If the article is going to find an audience , a relevant and fairly popular search phrase should be focused on throughout .
And it should be used naturally .
Make The Article Scannable With Distinct Headings
In the modern world , everything is about saving time to do more of something else .
Which is why distinct headings will help readers to scan the article and see whether it provides the information they need .
And in addition to creating distinct headings , organized paragraphs only add to the strength of the content .
Users like it when websites make things easier for them , just like search engines do .
Keep The Layout Clean
Getting users to read something when they can be watching a video is not easy , but it ’s definitely possible .
One way of doing it is to keep the structure of the article clean , organized , and easy to read from start to finish .
Stay away from distractions on the sidebar or unnecessary adverts , and simply make things easy for everyone involved , including the search engine crawlers .
Content Is Still King
Regardless of the video - age experienced in recent years , content remains the most relevant and practical way to reach higher rankings .
Plus , there are many users that still prefer reading over watching videos .
If website owners really want to master the art of SEO article writing , they simply have to take their cues from search engines and the experience they create for their users .
Anyone wondering why U.S. energy policy is so dysfunctional need only review Congress 's recent antics .

Voters are n’t showing much excitement over the June 3 election , apart from a race to replace Supervisor Yvonne B. Burke in Los Angeles County ’s 2nd District .
Turnout is expected to be light .
Many who do vote will do so by mail , beginning today .
It is a stealth election , providing an opportunity to a dangerous candidate with a small but dedicated following of people who make it a point to vote when others do n’t bother .
That ’s especially true in the races for Los Angeles Superior Court judge .
Little is known to voters about judicial candidates except for their names , their three - word ballot designations and the slate mailers that , for a price , show their photos and list their qualifications .
Two years ago , voters relying on such information ousted accomplished jurist Dzintra Janavs and replaced her with Lynn Diane Olson , the owner of a bagel bakery who had not actively practiced law for a decade ; political observers speculated that voters simply preferred the sound of Olson ’s name .
It was a bad choice , but Olson was simply underqualified .
This year it ’s more serious .
Los Angeles voters , if they do n’t pay attention , could hand judicial robes to a racial separatist who called for restricting U.S. citizenship to persons “ of the European race ” and deporting blacks , Asians , Latinos and others who do n’t meet his racial criteria .
The candidate is Bill Johnson .
Under the name James O. Pace , he wrote the racial exclusion as a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution and a 1985 book supporting it .
Under the name Daniel Johnson , he ran a losing race for Congress in Wyoming in 1989 with a Ku Klux Klan organizer as his campaign manager .
As William Johnson , he ran a losing race for Congress in Arizona in 2006 .
He now may have found a race he can win , unless voters here find out who he is .
Advertisement
The Times on April 21 endorsed Johnson ’s opponent , Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner James Bianco , because Bianco is experienced and impressive and because Johnson was secretive about his past and about his role in a questionable campaign to remove six Latino judges from the court .
Now the Metropolitan News - Enterprise , a newspaper that reports on courts and the legal community , has put together the rest of the pieces on Johnson .
Johnson has been active in the Ron Paul for president campaign ( he says his views on race now are identical to Paul’s ) and is relying on Paul supporters to rally for him .
They just might do it , making it more important than ever for voters to act -- and to choose Bianco .
Green Zone
For 15 years , most Iraqis had been unable to access the heart of Baghdad .
But the tall concrete walls and barbed wire that have closed off the Green Zone for years are finally coming down .
The Green Zone , a 10 square kilometre area in central Baghdad , has been partially open to the public since 10 December 2018 for a two - week trial period that was likely to become permanent .
Cars are now allowed to traverse the area from 5 pm to 1 am along the 14th of July Road , a key thoroughfare that extends from the 14th July Bridge - also known as the hanging bridge - and connects the city 's east and west .
However , side roads where Iraqi officials are based remain closed and government buildings and foreign missions continue to be under heavy security and surveillance .
With two of the capital 's key thoroughfares - Haifa Street and 14th of July Boulevard - traversing the Green Zone , the reopening has reduced some of Baghdad 's heavy road congestion .
The International Zone ( formerly known as the Green Zone ) was the heavily guarded diplomatic / government area of closed - off streets in central Baghdad where US occupation authorities live and work .
The Green Zone in the central city includes the main palaces of former President Saddam Hussein .
The area houses the civilian ruling authority run by the Americans and British and the offices of major US consulting companies .
The precise boundries of the " Green Zone " were difficult to determine , and indeed may change with time .
The core of the Green Zone appears to be Hussein 's former presidential complex .
The International Zone was commonly referred to as the " Ultimate Gated Community " due to the numerous armed checkpoints , coils of razor wire , chain link fences , and the fact it was surrounded by " T - Walls " ( reinforced and blast - proof concrete slabs ) .
Part of the International Zone was said to have been " Uday 's Playground " comprised of the Presidential Palace ( now the U.S. Embassy Annex ) ; numerous villas for Saddam 's family , friends and former Baath party loyalists ; an underground bunker ( Believers Palace ) ; the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Military History Museum ; the new Baath party headquarters ( unfinished ) ; the Al - Rasheed Hotel ; the Convention Center ; and a large park including the much photographed crossed sabers and parade route .
The International Zone was also home to Saddam 's man-eating lions , which have since been moved to the Iraqi National Zoo .
Due to the numerous Iraqi Interim Government entities occupying space within the Zone , traffic and population has increased .
There was a taxi service supported by the Iraqis working within the International Zone .
Also , several independent local shops , including an Iraqi flea market provide an array of international and local Iraqi goods .
Contrary to popular belief , the International Zone was lush and tropical with very little humidity .
The area was garnished with world - class date producing palms , various fruit and other exotic trees .
The 14th of July Bridge reopened for the first time since the fall of Saddam 's regime after a ribbon - cutting ceremony held 25 October 2003 .
The 14th of July Bridge serves as a major transportation artery which allows access to the northwestern part of Baghdad .
Curiously , nobody thought of changing its name , which celebrates the inception of Baathist rule .
Baghdad 's first suspension bridge links the Karkh and Karadah districts on the north and south side of Baghdad .
It was damaged during the first Gulf War , but was never repaired by the former regime .
Realizing it was unsafe for use , Coalition forces closed the bridge when they entered Baghdad in April 2003 .
The newly repaired bridge will alleviate traffic build - up and allow drivers a direct route across the Tigris River .
When the bridge was closed , people had to spend an extra twenty minutes to drive around the river .
A bomb attack in central Baghdad on 13 November 2003 prompted the coalition to close the Bridge .
The 14th of July Street ( Arbataash Tamuz Street ) which runs over the 14th of July Bridge ( Arbataash Tamuz Bridge ) runs between the Presidential Palace and the New Presidential Palace , both of which were in use by the Coalition Provisional Authority .
Closing the Bridge would seal a potential point of access into the heart of the Green Zone .
The Green Zone -- also called " The Bubble " - was the hub of the vision for the New Iraq .
It was almost self - sufficient , and staff working there can be treated in the compound 's hospital or run safely in its grounds .
When they leave , it was by armored car with an armed military escort .
The Convention Center was where the United States set up headquarters , and was also home to the coalition press office .
The state - of - the - art hall was in the same Green Zone as the Republican Palace .
Once used by the fallen regime for conferences , it was home to a highly visible collection of troops , some of whom live in an office that has been converted to barracks .
The Iraqi Governing Council was headquartered in the handsome marble building that once was the Military Industry Ministry run by Saddam 's son- in - law , Hussein Kamel .
The new Iraqi Ministry of Justice has decided to use the Adnan Buildingg , which was within the Green Zone , instead of the Clock Tower Building , for the Central Criminal Court and the Supreme Court .
The Green Zone was defended with coils of razor wire , chain - link fences , earthen berms and armed checkpoints .
The area was defended by M1 Abrams tanks , Bradley fighting vehicles and HUMVEEs with .50 caliber machine guns on top .
The Green Zone appears under siege , with barriers , high concrete walls and checkpoints .
US officials are rarely visible outside it , and rules for British personnel bar them from leaving it unless accompanied by four bodyguards and an armored vehicle .
Iraqis and foreign diplomats have been critical of occupation officials , who they say were isolated within the Green Zone and un-informed about life elsewhere in Baghdad , an area that official US security jargon calls " the Red Zone . "
Being in the Green Zone in Baghdad provides a limited possibility to meet regular Iraqi people .
Americans were walling themselves in , mentally and emotionally , as well as physically .
In an analysis on 01 September 2003 [ " After Najaf : The Emerging Patterns of Combat in the Iraq War " ] Anthony H. Cordesman stated that " a critical mistake [ was ] made by ORHA and carried on by the CPA by creating US security zones around US headquarters in central Baghdad .
This has created a no go zone for Iraqis and has allowed the attackers to push the US into a fortress that tends to separate U.S. personnel from the Iraqis .
This follows a broader pattern where terrorist know that attacks tend to push the US into locating in " force protection " enclaves and cut Americans off from the local population . "
By late 2003 much of the huge US military presence in Baghdad was out of sight at the airport and in other encampments .
In September 2003 US officials said they planned to reopen parts of the Green Zone to civilian traffic in October 2003 to reduce the zone 's disruption to Baghdad 's traffic .
But this step would make security even more difficult for top US officials here .
On 27 September 2003 guerrillas struck at the heart of the US occupation , firing three rockets or grenades at a Baghdad hotel filled with American soldiers and civilians .
Only one actually hit the hotel and did minimal damage and no one was hurt .
The attack on the al - Rashid Hotel , home to US military officers and civilian occupation officials came at about 6:30 AM .
The 200 - foot - tall hotel stands hundreds of yards from the high , earth - filled barriers ringing that section of the zone .
The green zone was still the safest area in Baghdad , and until this incident there had no shooting incidents or attacks on any personnel in this area .
Camp Dragoon / FOB Iron Horse
Camp Patriot ( Camp Watani )
The Vipers were the driving force at Camp Dragoon in improving living conditions .
The shower trailers , with heated water and air conditioning , were now up and operational as of 27 August .
The soldiers of RHHT , working together with local contractors , expect an indoor swimming pool to be complete by mid September .
The pool will contain a whirlpool and be heated .
A full service laundry operation was also in the works .
In keeping with the motto of the Regiment , RHHT was " Always Ready " to make things easier for all at Camp Dragoon .
It was not the biggest retail outlet in Baghdad , but by September 2003 soldiers wearing every unit patch in the city had shopped at Camp Dragoon 's CavMart .
Set up in a former Iraqi Army weapons storeroom , the CavMart boasts shelves stocked with health - care items , personal hygiene supplies , batteries , soft drinks and snacks .
Camp Dragoon 's 900 - soldier population makes it too small for the Army and Air Force Exchange Service to set up a retail outlet .
Instead , the exchange works with units to support smaller , soldier - managed stores in outlying camps .
Soldiers run the stores , pick up merchandise and manage the money .
Since the 502d Military Intelligence Company detached from Wolfpack they have been with RHHT and have been continuously conducting collection missions .
Just like ' Wolfpack Base Camp ' , ' Camp Dragoon ' ( as they call their camp ) was lacking in creature comforts at first .
Slowly the area has improved .
The glass in the windows has been replaced .
They now have a small PX , and air conditioning in most rooms , including an air - conditioned movie theatre where they play DVD movies mostly every evening .
In addition , they have an Internet caf� and a satellite phone that was available each day .
The great soldiers of the 502d have rallied together to make it through tough times .
As Operation Iraqi freedom progressed through its seventh month , the U.S. Army worked toward improving living conditions for the troops in Iraq .
One of the newest projects completed by late October 2003 was a dining facility recently opened at the 3rd Squadron , 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment forward operating base , Baghdad .
The new dining facility also serves nearby soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Armored Division and attached personnel , such as civil affairs units .
It was amazing how the contractors were able to get this building rolling and ready for the soldiers .
Contracted by Kellogg , Brown and Root Services , the modular building was trucked into the area in sections and pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle .
The facility has a seating capacity of 500 with a turnaround capacity to serve 2,000 personnel for breakfast , lunch or dinner .
KBR worked astonishingly hard to provide a great meal .
Unlike the dining facility at nearby Al Rasheed Hotel , which has its meals delivered from the Coalition Provisional Authority palace dining facility , the 2nd ACR facility has its own kitchen and culinary crew contracted through KBR .
The facility has food items such as bread , muffins and pastries prepared and served daily .
At Camp Dragoon , troops seemed to particularly enjoy taking advantage of Saddam 's massive personal infrastructure to make life more comfortable .
In Baghdad , for example , home to the headquarters of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Division , soldiers enjoy nightly movies in the world - class movie theater Saddam built for his secret police .
Popcorn was free , and Sunday was double - feature day .
By late January 2004 engineers from the 1st Armored Division were midway through an $ 800 million project to build half a dozen camps for the incoming 1st Cavalry Division .
Army planners expected to finish by 15 March 2004 .
The new outposts , dubbed Enduring Camps , will improve living quarters for soldiers and allow the military to return key infrastructure sites within the Iraqi capital to the emerging government , military leaders said .
" The plan was for the camps to last from five to ten years , " said Col.
Lou Marich , commander of the 1st AD engineers .
" They will last longer if we take care of them . "
Moving to the outskirts of town will allow Iraqi police and the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps to take a lead role in the city 's security .
Camp Dragoon and Camp War Eagle combined will have room for about 2,200 .
Pulling guard duty was something nearly every soldier does at some point during a deployment .
And , the troopers of the Air Defense Artillery Battery , 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment , based at Dragoon Forward Operating Base were no exception .
Whether it 's standing watch in a tower , manning a gate at the forward operating base , or being part of Dragoon 's quick response force , the troopers of the air defense artillery have been there .
FOB Trojan Horse
FOB Union III ( FOB Al - Tawheed Al - Thalith )
The living conditions in our FOBs were getting better daily .
Most of the soldiers now have beds and mattresses .
There was a new DFAC on FOB Trojan .
SSG Parker , from 3d Platoon ( ESE ) has done a great job setting that up and providing first - rate support .
They expected the installation of Air Conditioners by late June 2004 , and were working on new phone banks on FOB Trojan .
The soldiers living in the other FOBs still have access to their phone banks to call home and commanders try to get the soldiers over to one of those from FOB Trojan as often as possible .
By August 2004 , great progress had been made improving the quality of life on FOB Trojan Horse .
Soldiers had a free laundry service on the FOB as well as several telephones available for as low as 10 cents a minute .
All soldiers also had ready access to the internet .
The consolidated Dining Facility was up and running at full speed .
They had a cookout for Memorial Day .
They also recently received beds for all soldiers on the FOB and have wall lockers coming in .
Mail was arriving regularly and was always a great morale booster .
Camp Honor / FOB Honor
Camp Steel Dragon / FOB Steel Dragon / Camp Wolfpack
In January 2006 , the Iraqi army took over control of FOB Honor from U.S. forces in another transfer of authority of U.S. bases to Iraqi control .
This was the first transfer of authority within the Green Zone and increased the Iraqi forces presence and role in operations of central Baghdad .
FOB Steel Dragon was in the " Green Zone " section of Baghdad .
The 2 - 82 FA deployed from Fort Hood , TX on 15 March 2004 .
The battery spent two weeks at Camp Udari , Kuwait drawing equipment , downloading home - station vehicles and preparing for the convoy into Iraq .
Our three - day move north to Baghdad , Iraq was very successful .
All vehicles , equipment and soldiers arrived safely at Camp Wolfpack , now called Camp Steel Dragon , on 29 March 2004 .
They immediately began training with our counterparts from 3/2 Armored Cavalry Squadron ( ACS ) in order to take over the escort mission .
Due to an unexpected change in mission for 3/2 ACS our battalion was forced to take over the escort mission sooner than expected .
As usual the soldiers of Bravo Battery were fully prepared , ready , and excited to do so .
Since taking over , the battery has already cycled through three weeks of conducting Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) escorts and one week of Forward Operation Base ( FOB ) security of Camp Steel Dragon .
Additionally , the battery has recently had a change of mission .
We have been tasked to provide artillery support to Camp Cook in Taji , Iraq .
Two Paladin sections ( 12 soldiers ) , two mechanics , a platoon sergeant , our Fire Direction NCO , and the battery executive officer were working with the 1 -206 Arkansas National Guard , a light artillery ( 105 mm ) battery , to provide artillery counter - fire against enemy mortar and rocket attacks .
After 165 days in Camp Steel Dragon the Warriors had accomplished more than 561 Platoon Security Escort Missions encompassing more than 142,296 miles of driving throughout Baghdad and other locations within Iraq !
Our Maintenance section was by far the most experienced in Iraq .
Noone put more miles on our vehicles than the Steel Dragons and Warriors !
Additionally , the Warriors have defended Camp Steel Dragon with 6 weeks of FOB Security .
As of August 2004 the 89th Military Police Brigade was at Camp Steel Dragon , Baghdad , Iraq .
In November 2004 , as part of an Army - wide effort to give its facilities around Baghdad friendlier connotations , and try to resolve the issue of constantly - changing facility names , Camp Steel Dragon was renamed Camp Honor .
In January 2006 , the Iraqi army took over control of FOB Honor from U.S. forces in another transfer of authority of U.S. bases to Iraqi control .
This was the first transfer of authority within the Green Zone and increased the Iraqi forces presence and role in operations in central Baghdad .
FOB Blackhawk
FOB Blackhawk was located within the International Zone in downtown Baghdad .
It was situated near the Al - Rasheed Hotel .
The conference area and outside courtyard were reported to be nice .
There was also an excellent outdoor bread oven that was used often .

Remarks before the Commonwealth Club of California
San Francisco , California
Thank you , Bruce [ Ericson ] .
I am honored to be here this evening and am grateful for the invitation to speak to the Commonwealth Club of California .
Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker , two of Ben Bernanke ’s linear ancestors as chairmen of the Federal Reserve , have been in the news quite a bit lately .
Yet , we rarely hear about William McChesney Martin , a magnificent public servant who was Fed chairman during five presidencies and to this day holds the record for the longest tenure : 19 years .
Chairman Martin had a way with words .
And he had a twinkle in his eye .
It was Bill Martin who wisely and succinctly defined the Federal Reserve as having the unenviable task “ to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going . ”
He did himself one up when he received the Alfalfa Club ’s nomination for the presidency of the United States .
I suspect many here tonight have been to the annual Alfalfa dinner .
It is one of the great institutions in Washington , D.C.
Once a year , it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day .
Tongue firmly in cheek , the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket .
Of course , none of them ever win .
Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society , named for Harold Stassen , who ran for president nine times and lost every time , then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again .
The motto of the group is Veni , Vidi , Defici — “ I came , I saw , I lost . ”
Bill Martin was nominated to run and lose on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966 , while serving as Fed chairman during Lyndon Johnson ’s term .
In his acceptance speech , [ 1 ] he announced that , given his proclivities as a central banker , he would take his cues from the German philosopher Goethe , “ who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity . ”
Therefore , Martin declared , he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “ make life endurable again by stamping out prosperity . ”
“ I shall conduct the administration of the country , ” he said , “ exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve .
To that end , I shall assemble the best brains that can be found …ask their advice on all matters … and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel . ”
It is true , Bruce , that as you said in your introduction , I am one of the 17 people who participate in Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) deliberations and provide Ben Bernanke with “ conflicting counsel ” as the committee cobbles together a monetary policy that seeks to promote America ’s economic prosperity , Goethe to the contrary .
But tonight I speak for neither the committee , nor the chairman , nor any of the other good people that serve the Federal Reserve System .
I speak solely in my own capacity .
I want to speak to you tonight about an economic problem that we must soon confront or else risk losing our primacy as the world ’s most powerful and dynamic economy .
Forty - three years ago this Sunday , Bill Martin delivered a commencement address to Columbia University that was far more sober than his Alfalfa Club speech .
The opening lines of that Columbia address [ 2 ] were as follows :
“ When economic prospects are at their brightest , the dangers of complacency and recklessness are greatest .
As our prosperity proceeds on its record - breaking path , it behooves every one of us to scan the horizon of our national and international economy for danger signals so as to be ready for any storm . ”
Today , our fellow citizens and financial markets are paying the price for falling victim to the complacency and recklessness Martin warned against .
Few scanned the horizon for trouble brewing as we proceeded along a path of unparalleled prosperity fueled by an unsustainable housing bubble and unbridled credit markets .
Armchair or Monday morning quarterbacks will long debate whether the Fed could have / should have / would have taken away the punchbowl that lubricated that blowout party .
I have given my opinion on that matter elsewhere and wo n’t go near that subject tonight .
What counts now is what we have done more recently and where we go from here .
Whatever the sins of omission or commission committed by our predecessors , the Bernanke FOMC ’s objective is to use a new set of tools to calm the tempest in the credit markets to get them back to functioning in a more orderly fashion .
We trust that the various term credit facilities we have recently introduced are helping restore confidence while the credit markets undertake self - corrective initiatives and lawmakers consider new regulatory schemes .
I am also not going to engage in a discussion of present monetary policy tonight , except to say that if inflationary developments and , more important , inflation expectations , continue to worsen , I would expect a change of course in monetary policy to occur sooner rather than later , even in the face of an anemic economic scenario .
Inflation is the most insidious enemy of capitalism .
No central banker can countenance it , not least the men and women of the Federal Reserve .
Tonight , I want to talk about a different matter .
In keeping with Bill Martin ’s advice , I have been scanning the horizon for danger signals even as we continue working to recover from the recent turmoil .
In the distance , I see a frightful storm brewing in the form of untethered government debt .
I choose the words — “ frightful storm ” — deliberately to avoid hyperbole .
Unless we take steps to deal with it , the long - term fiscal situation of the federal government will be unimaginably more devastating to our economic prosperity than the subprime debacle and the recent debauching of credit markets that we are now working so hard to correct .
You might wonder why a central banker would be concerned with fiscal matters .
Fiscal policy is , after all , the responsibility of the Congress , not the Federal Reserve .
Congress , and Congress alone , has the power to tax and spend .
From this monetary policymaker ’s point of view , though , deficits matter for what we do at the Fed .
There are many reasons why .
Economists have found that structural deficits raise long - run interest rates , complicating the Fed ’s dual mandate to develop a monetary policy that promotes sustainable , noninflationary growth .
The even more disturbing dark and dirty secret about deficits — especially when they careen out of control — is that they create political pressure on central bankers to adopt looser monetary policy down the road .
I will return to that shortly .
First , let me give you the unvarnished facts of our nation ’s fiscal predicament .
Eight years ago , our federal budget , crafted by a Democratic president and enacted by a Republican Congress , produced a fiscal surplus of $ 236 billion , the first surplus in almost 40 years and the highest nominal - dollar surplus in American history .
While the Fed is scrupulously nonpartisan and nonpolitical , I mention this to emphasize that the deficit / debt issue knows no party and can be solved only by both parties working together .
For a brief time , with surpluses projected into the future as far as the eye could see , economists and policymakers alike began to contemplate a bucolic future in which interest payments would form an ever - declining share of federal outlays , a future where Treasury bonds and debt - ceiling legislation would become dusty relics of a long - forgotten past .
The Fed even had concerns about how open market operations would be conducted in a marketplace short of Treasury debt .
That utopian scenario did not last for long .
Over the next seven years , federal spending grew at a 6.2 percent nominal annual rate while receipts grew at only 3.5 percent .
Of course , certain areas of government , like national defense , had to spend more in the wake of 9/11 .
But nondefense discretionary spending actually rose 6.4 percent annually during this timeframe , outpacing the growth in total expenditures .
Deficits soon returned , reaching an expected $ 410 billion for 2008 — a $ 600 billion swing from where we were just eight years ago .
This $ 410 billion estimate , by the way , was made before the recently passed farm bill and supplemental defense appropriation and without considering a proposed patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax — all measures that will lead to a further ballooning of government deficits .
In keeping with the tradition of rosy scenarios , official budget projections suggest this deficit will be relatively short - lived .
They almost always do .
According to the official calculus , following a second $ 400 - billion - plus deficit in 2009 , the red ink should fall to $ 160 billion in 2010 and $ 95 billion in 2011 , and then the budget swings to a $ 48 billion surplus in 2012 .
If you do the math , however , you might be forgiven for sensing that these felicitous projections look a tad dodgy .
To reach the projected 2012 surplus , outlays are assumed to rise at a 2.4 percent nominal annual rate over the next four years — less than half as fast as they rose the previous seven years .
Revenue is assumed to rise at a 6.7 percent nominal annual rate over the next four years — almost double the rate of the past seven years .
Using spending and revenue growth rates that have actually prevailed in recent years , the 2012 surplus quickly evaporates and becomes a deficit , potentially of several hundred billion dollars .
Doing deficit math is always a sobering exercise .
It becomes an outright painful one when you apply your calculator to the long - run fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs .
Were I not a taciturn central banker , I would say the mathematics of the long - term outlook for entitlements , left unchanged , is nothing short of catastrophic .
Typically , critics ranging from the Concord Coalition to Ross Perot begin by wringing their collective hands over the unfunded liabilities of Social Security .
A little history gives you a view as to why .
Franklin Roosevelt originally conceived a social security system in which individuals would fund their own retirements through payroll - tax contributions .
But Congress quickly realized that such a system could not put much money into the pockets of indigent elderly citizens ravaged by the Great Depression .
Instead , a pay - as - you - go funding system was embraced , making each generation ’s retirement the responsibility of its children .
Now , fast forward 70 or so years and ask this question :
What is the mathematical predicament of Social Security today ?
Answer :
The amount of money the Social Security system would need today to cover all unfunded liabilities from now on — what fiscal economists call the “ infinite horizon discounted value ” of what has already been promised recipients but has no funding mechanism currently in place — is $ 13.6 trillion , an amount slightly less than the annual gross domestic product of the United States .
Demographics explain why this is so .
Birthrates have fallen dramatically , reducing the worker –retiree ratio and leaving today ’s workers pulling a bigger load than the system designers ever envisioned .
Life spans have lengthened without a corresponding increase in the retirement age , leaving retirees in a position to receive benefits far longer than the system designers envisioned .
Formulae for benefits and cost - of - living adjustments have also contributed to the growth in unfunded liabilities .
The good news is this Social Security shortfall might be manageable .
While the issues regarding Social Security reform are complex , it is at least possible to imagine how Congress might find , within a $ 14 trillion economy , ways to wrestle with a $ 13 trillion unfunded liability .
The bad news is that Social Security is the lesser of our entitlement worries .
It is but the tip of the unfunded liability iceberg .
The much bigger concern is Medicare , a program established in 1965 , the same prosperous year that Bill Martin cautioned his Columbia University audience to be wary of complacency and storms on the horizon .
Medicare was a pay - as - you - go program from the very beginning , despite warnings from some congressional leaders —
Wilbur Mills was the most credible of them before he succumbed to the pay - as - you - go wiles of Fanne Foxe , the Argentine Firecracker — who foresaw some of the long - term fiscal issues such a financing system could pose .
Unfortunately , they were right .
Please sit tight while I walk you through the math of Medicare .
As you may know , the program comes in three parts : Medicare Part A , which covers hospital stays ; Medicare B , which covers doctor visits ; and Medicare D , the drug benefit that went into effect just 29 months ago .
The infinite - horizon present discounted value of the unfunded liability for Medicare A is $ 34.4 trillion .
The unfunded liability of Medicare B is an additional $ 34 trillion .
The shortfall for Medicare D adds another $ 17.2 trillion .
The total ?
If you wanted to cover the unfunded liability of all three programs today , you would be stuck with an $ 85.6 trillion bill .
That is more than six times as large as the bill for Social Security .
It is more than six times the annual output of the entire U.S. economy .
Why is the Medicare figure so large ?
There is a mix of reasons , really .
In part , it is due to the same birthrate and life - expectancy issues that affect Social Security .
In part , it is due to ever - costlier advances in medical technology and the willingness of Medicare to pay for them .
And in part , it is due to expanded benefits — the new drug benefit program ’s unfunded liability is by itself one - third greater than all of Social Security’s .
Add together the unfunded liabilities from Medicare and Social Security , and it comes to $ 99.2 trillion over the infinite horizon .
Traditional Medicare composes about 69 percent , the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and Social Security the remaining 14 percent .
I want to remind you that I am only talking about the unfunded portions of Social Security and Medicare .
It is what the current payment scheme of Social Security payroll taxes , Medicare payroll taxes , membership fees for Medicare B , copays , deductibles and all other revenue currently channeled to our entitlement system will not cover under current rules .
These existing revenue streams must remain in place in perpetuity to handle the “ funded ” entitlement liabilities .
Reduce or eliminate this income and the unfunded liability grows .
Increase benefits and the liability grows as well .
Let ’s say you and I and Bruce Ericson and every U.S. citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump - sum payments from our own pocketbooks , so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity .
How much would we have to pay if we split the tab ?
Again , the math is painful .
With a total population of 304 million , from infants to the elderly , the per-person payment to the federal treasury would come to $ 330,000 .
This comes to $ 1.3 million per family of four — over 25 times the average household ’s income .
Clearly , once - and - for - all contributions would be an unbearable burden .
Alternatively , we could address the entitlement shortfall through policy changes that would affect ourselves and future generations .
For example , a permanent 68 percent increase in federal income tax revenue — from individual and corporate taxpayers — would suffice to fully fund our entitlement programs .
Or we could instead divert 68 percent of current income - tax revenues from their intended uses to the entitlement system , which would accomplish the same thing .
Suppose we decided to tackle the issue solely on the spending side .
It turns out that total discretionary spending in the federal budget , if maintained at its current share of GDP in perpetuity , is 3 percent larger than the entitlement shortfall .
So all we would have to do to fully fund our nation ’s entitlement programs would be to cut discretionary spending by 97 percent .
But hold on .
That discretionary spending includes defense and national security , education , the environment and many other areas , not just those controversial earmarks that make the evening news .
All of them would have to be cut — almost eliminated , really — to tackle this problem through discretionary spending .
I hope that gives you some idea of just how large the problem is .
And just to drive an important point home , these spending cuts or tax increases would need to be made immediately and maintained in perpetuity to solve the entitlement deficit problem .
Discretionary spending would have to be reduced by 97 percent not only for our generation , but for our children and their children and every generation of children to come .
And similarly on the taxation side , income tax revenue would have to rise 68 percent and remain that high forever .
Remember , though , I said tax revenue , not tax rates .
Who knows how much individual and corporate tax rates would have to change to increase revenue by 68 percent ?
If these possible solutions to the unfunded - liability problem seem draconian , it ’s because they are draconian .
But they do serve to give you a sense of the severity of the problem .
To be sure , there are ways to lessen the reliance on any single policy and the burden borne by any particular set of citizens .
Most proposals to address long - term entitlement debt , for example , rely on a combination of tax increases , benefit reductions and eligibility changes to find the trillions necessary to safeguard the system over the long term .
No combination of tax hikes and spending cuts , though , will change the total burden borne by current and future generations .
For the existing unfunded liabilities to be covered in the end , someone must pay $ 99.2 trillion more or receive $ 99.2 trillion less than they have been currently promised .
This is a cold , hard fact .
The decision we must make is whether to shoulder a substantial portion of that burden today or compel future generations to bear its full weight .
Now that you are all thoroughly depressed , let me come back to monetary policy and the Fed .
It is only natural to cast about for a solution — any solution — to avoid the fiscal pain we know is necessary because we succumbed to complacency and put off dealing with this looming fiscal disaster .
Throughout history , many nations , when confronted by sizable debts they were unable or unwilling to repay , have seized upon an apparently painless solution to this dilemma : monetization .
Just have the monetary authority run cash off the printing presses until the debt is repaid , the story goes , then promise to be responsible from that point on and hope your sins will be forgiven by God and Milton Friedman and everyone else .
We know from centuries of evidence in countless economies , from ancient Rome to today ’s Zimbabwe , that running the printing press to pay off today ’s bills leads to much worse problems later on .
The inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far worse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid .
Earlier I mentioned the Fed ’s dual mandate to manage growth and inflation .
In the long run , growth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation .
Stable prices go hand in hand with achieving sustainable economic growth .
I have said many , many times that inflation is a sinister beast that , if uncaged , devours savings , erodes consumers ’ purchasing power , decimates returns on capital , undermines the reliability of financial accounting , distracts the attention of corporate management , undercuts employment growth and real wages , and debases the currency .
Purging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine .
We have been there , and we know the cure that was wrought by the FOMC under Paul Volcker .
Even the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap - money strategy to accommodate fiscal burdens , should it take root , is a paramount risk to the long - term welfare of the U.S. economy .
The Federal Reserve will never let this happen .
It is not an option .
Ever. Period .
The way we resolve these liabilities — and resolve them we must — will affect our own well - being as well as the prospects of future generations and the global economy .
Failing to face up to our responsibility will produce the mother of all financial storms .
The warning signals have been flashing for years , but we find it easier to ignore them than to take action .
Will we take the painful fiscal steps necessary to prevent the storm by reducing and eventually eliminating our fiscal imbalances ?
That depends on you .
I mean “ you ” literally .
This situation is of your own creation .
When you berate your representatives or senators or presidents for the mess we are in , you are really berating yourself .
You elect them .
You are the ones who let them get away with burdening your children and grandchildren rather than yourselves with the bill for your entitlement programs .
This issue transcends political affiliation .
When George Shultz , one of San Francisco ’s greatest Republican public servants , was director of President Nixon ’s Office of Management and Budget , he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend .
After some nights of tossing and turning , he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office .
Cohen had a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history .
“ Sam , ” Shultz asked , “ tell me something just between you and me .
Is there any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money ? ”
Cohen looked at him , furrowed his brow and , after thinking about it , replied , “ Mr. Shultz , there is only one difference : Democrats enjoy it more . ”
Yet no one , Democrat or Republican , enjoys placing our children and grandchildren and their children and grandchildren in harm ’s way .
No one wants to see the frightful storm of unfunded long - term liabilities destroy our economy or threaten the independence and authority of our central bank or tear our currency asunder .
Of late , we have heard many complaints about the weakness of the dollar against the euro and other currencies .
It was recently argued in the op - ed pages of the Financial Times [ 3 ] that one reason for the demise of the British pound was the need to liquidate England ’s international reserves to pay off the costs of the Great Wars .
In the end , the pound , it was essentially argued , was sunk by the kaiser ’s army and Hitler ’s bombs .
Right now , we — you and I — are launching fiscal bombs against ourselves .
You have it in your power as the electors of our fiscal authorities to prevent this destruction .
Please do so .
Notes
This is actually a pretty complicated question .
What you are asking is what constant speed will give the best mileage .
We wo n't talk about stops and starts .
We 'll assume you are going on a very long highway trip and want to know what speed will give you the best mileage .
We 'll start by discussing how much power it takes to push the car down the road .
The power to push a car down the road varies with the speed the car is traveling .
The power required follows an equation of the following form :
road load power = av + bv² + cv³
The letter v represents the velocity of the car , and the letters a , b and c represent three different constants :
The a component comes mostly from the rolling resistance of the tires , and friction in the car 's components , like drag from the brake pads , or friction in the wheel bearings .
component comes mostly from the rolling resistance of the tires , and friction in the car 's components , like drag from the brake pads , or friction in the wheel bearings .
The b component also comes from friction in components , and from the rolling resistance in the tires .
But it also comes from the power used by the various pumps in the car .
component also comes from friction in components , and from the rolling resistance in the tires .
But it also comes from the power used by the various pumps in the car .
The c component comes mostly from things that affect aerodynamic drag like the frontal area , drag coefficient and density of the air .
These constants will be different for every car .
But the bottom line is , if you double your speed , this equation says that you will increase the power required by much more than double .
A hypothetical medium sized SUV that requires 20 horsepower at 50 mph might require 100 horsepower at 100 mph .
You can also see from the equation that if the velocity v is 0 , the power required is also 0 .
If the velocity is very small then the power required is also very small .
So you might be thinking that you would get the best mileage at a really slow speed like 1 mph .
But there is something going on in the engine that eliminates this theory .
If your car is going 0 mph your engine is still running .
Just to keep the cylinders moving and the various fans , pumps and generators running consumes a certain amount of fuel .
And depending on how many accessories ( such as headlights and air conditioning ) you have running , your car will use even more fuel .
So even when the car is sitting still it uses quite a lot of fuel .
Cars get the very worst mileage at 0 mph ; they use gasoline but do n't cover any miles .
When you put the car in drive and start moving at say 1 mph , the car uses only a tiny bit more fuel , because the road load is very small at 1 mph .
At this speed the car uses about the same amount of fuel , but it went 1 mile in an hour .
This represents a dramatic increase in mileage .
Now if the car goes 2 mph , again it uses only a tiny bit more fuel , but goes twice as far .
The mileage almost doubled !

The history of a JavaScript bug and things we can learn from it
Once upon a time , a shiny new release of Opera exposed a rather nasty bug in a very popular JavaScript library : Opera 9.5 did n’t work properly with the TinyMCE editor , causing severe text editing problems in WordPress ’s admin screen , webmail applications and message boards worldwide .
How could that happen ?
Read on for the important lesson hidden in Opera ’s bug report number 335463 .
Timeline
On March 3rd 2008 , the Acid3 test was considered finished and officially released .
On March 5th one of the bugs that prevented Opera from passing Acid3 , summarised as “ ranges collapse when nodes are inserted ” , was verified fixed in Opera ’s core .
The fix slowly made its way into public previews of Opera 9.5 .
On May 18th somebody trying out weekly builds of Opera 9.5 first reported weird issues with the TinyMCE editor : the Enter key messed up the text instead of creating new paragraphs .
Unfortunately there was another open bug related to the Enter key and it was not until June 5th that we realised the problem in TinyMCE was worse than in the other editors .
Whenever you pressed Enter , paragraphs would end up in the wrong order so content would appear “ scrambled ” .
It was a pretty weird and somewhat funny effect to see whole paragraphs reordering themselves randomly .
The TinyMCE bug
After some analysis , we discovered the following snippet of JavaScript in the TinyMCE code that deals with Enter key presses :
// Opera needs this one backwards if ( isOpera ) { r.insertNode ( bef ) ; r.insertNode( aft ) ; } else { r.insertNode ( aft ) ; r.insertNode( bef ) ; }
Now , I do n’t intend to pick on TinyMCE developers in particular .
It ’s one of the most widely - used rich text editors , and there are many things to like about it — it ’s relatively light , very configurable and extensible through a “ plugin ” architecture .
This very code shows that they have put quite some testing and work into being compatible with Opera !
So why is that if ( isOpera ) part there ?
The answer is “ for historical reasons ” .
The bug we fixed on March 5th to pass Acid3 had caused them problems , and this is their workaround .
In this specific case , the bug caused multiple nodes inserted into a range to appear in the wrong order .
However , detecting Opera and inserting content in the reverse order to work around our old bug now caused pretty bad problems in Opera 9.5 .
Stuck between a rock and a hard place , we had to choose whether to pass Acid3 or be compatible with TinyMCE !
If we stuck to the correct implementation , we would get one more point on Acid3 but TinyMCE would break on millions of websites .
History bites
A brief history lesson to illustrate the original Opera 9.2 x bug will help you to understand the workaround .
Consider this paragraph :
< p> This is filler text </ p>
After running a JavaScript like the following …
var range = document.createRange ( ) ; // A “ range ” is a bit like a text selection made and manipulated from JavaScript .
range.setStart ( p.firstChild , 5 ) ; // first character inside text node is 0th range.setEnd ( p.firstChild , 13 ) ; // so here we select the 6th through 14th
… the range will point to the 6th through to the 14th character of the text node inside the p tag — the text highlighted in yellow below .
< p> This is filler text </ p>
Now you can insert another word into the sentence with the following script :
range.insertNode(document.createTextNode ( ' truly ' ) ) ;
The output from this would be :
< p> This truly is filler text </ p>
The new text node is inserted at the start of the range .
Now , here comes the bug : in Opera 9.2 x doing so would collapse the range — rather than the word “ truly ” being added to our yellow selection you would get something like the following :
< p> This truly is filler text </ p>
In other browsers you could go on to do this :
range.insertNode(document.createTextNode ( ' really , ' ) ) ;
Which would produce the following sentence :
< p > This really , truly is filler text </ p>
Because of the location of the collapsed range however Opera 9.2 x would output this :
< p > This truly is filler really , text </ p>
( Actually this description is a bit simplified .
There were some other conditions before the bug occurred , mainly that the range would have to cover more than one single text node . )
The TinyMCE developers noticed that by inserting content in the reverse order — first really , then truly — you would achieve the same output as in the other browsers for a collapsed range .
We must bear in mind though that when our core bug is fixed , this workaround will of course end up reversing the expected order of paragraphs or sentences !
Tiny fix
Luckily for us , the TinyMCE developers are very responsive to change requests and before long a fix was checked in and scheduled for next TinyMCE 3.x release .
The fix is as follows :
// Opera needs this one backwards for older versions if ( isOpera && parseFloat ( opera.version ( ) ) < 9.5 ) { r.insertNode ( bef ) ; r.insertNode ( aft ) ; } else { r.insertNode ( aft ) ; r.insertNode ( bef ) ; }
It works , but it ’s not what you would call an elegant solution , since it makes use of browser sniffing and version detection .
Not to mention that we still struggle with compatibility problems until those millions of websites have upgraded .
Seeing that many of them are still using TinyMCE 2.x it ’s unlikely that this problem will ever go away completely .
Bug detection
The TinyMCE / Opera 9.5 compatibility problem is a textbook example of why browser sniffing should be avoided at all costs .
While it may seem like a quick and simple shortcut to work around a bug in the short term , browser sniffing creates a maintenance nightmare further down the road .
With renewed competition in the browser space , vendors are pushing out upgrades and new versions every year , and every time you assume a certain behaviour because of the browser ’s name your compatibility with future versions is at risk .
Also , whether you develop your own site or write script libraries that will run on thousands of other websites , the chances are that mistakes you make today will stay on the web for years to come , preventing users from upgrading to newer and better browsers because sites they want to use break .
What if you could detect that the bug is present , and not bother detecting the browser at all ?
It turns out that you can often replace browser detection with “ bug detection ” .
Given the above analysis , we now understand the bug well enough to try to write some code to detect it .
A script is needed that creates a range , inserts some content , and checks what order it appears in .
Here is one suggested approach :
// Create a separate document to test in , // to avoid adding debugging stuff to our working document var doc = document.implementation.createDocument ('' , ' test ' , null ) ; // Add some content doc.documentElement.appendChild( doc.createTextNode (' test ' ) ) ; //
Create range ( make sure we create it in the test document ) var r = doc.createRange ( ) ; r.selectNodeContents(doc.documentElement ) ; // Insert something r.insertNode(doc.createTextNode ( ' world ' ) ) ; //
And some more into the range r.insertNode(doc.createTextNode ( ' hello ' ) ) ; //
Content should be inserted at start of node , // so what we inserted last is .
firstChild var has_range_collapse_bug = doc.documentElement.firstChild.data != ' hello ' ;
Here is a finished test script , which shows two ways to check if the bug is present ( there are probably other ways to discover it too ) .
If that code ran while TinyMCE was loading and set a variable you could later check to discover the right order to insert contents for your particular browser , rather than the ugly browser sniffing method .
Goodbye browser detection ?
Whenever you feel tempted to solve a problem with the inelegant browser sniffing hack , take a moment to ask yourself if there is a simple way to detect the bug instead .
Done right , the “ detect the bug , not the browser ” rule of thumb will make maintaining your site much easier whenever a new browser or browser version is released .
Bug detection reduces your future workload , helps your visitors , and is healthier for the web .
You ’ll never resort to browser sniffing again , right ?
The European Commission will propose legislation to slash the cost of sending and receiving SMS messages on mobile phones while roaming , Telecommunications Commissioner Viviane Reding is set to announce Tuesday .
However , no such intervention is planned for other types of data transfers via mobile , such as Internet services and e-mail messages , according to a person close to Reding 's office .
No specific SMS ( Short Message Service ) roaming price caps will be mentioned Tuesday , the person said .
" The commissioner will mention figures that were suggested during the consultation and by the European Regulators ' Group , but no figure has been decided on yet , " the person said , asking not to be named .
A report from the European Regulators Group in January showed that on average across the European Union , users had to pay € 0.29 ( US$ 0.50 ) for an SMS sent in the third quarter of 2007 .
That fell to € 0.28 last month , but Reding said this decline was insufficient .
The decision to curb SMS roaming costs comes a year after the introduction of voice roaming price caps , which the Commission claims helped bring down prices by 60 percent across the E.U .
The existing roaming law requires operators to offer customers a " Eurotariff " for voice calls when roaming in other E.U. member states and introduced ceilings of € 0.49 per minute for making calls and € 0.24 per minute for receiving calls .
These will decrease to € 0.46 and € 0.22 , respectively , at the end of next month and to € 0.43 and € 0.19 on Aug. 30 , 2009 .
Mobile phone operators argue that price capping is not the answer .
According to the GSM Association , since the third quarter last year , operators including Mobilkom Austria , Orange ( in France , Poland , Romania , Slovakia , Spain and the U.K. ) , Telefonica ( in Spain , Ireland , Czech Republic , the U.K. and Germany ) , T - Mobile ( in Austria , Germany , the U.K. and the Netherlands ) and Vodafone ( in Italy , Spain , and the U.K. ) have lowered their SMS roaming charges either through a reduction of their standard SMS rates or the launch of specialized packages aimed at roamers .
The GSM Association declined to comment ahead of Reding 's statement Tuesday .

Just when it looked like the Obama campaign would be the first Democrats to challenge Republicans on the patriotism issue , they turn around today and disavow Wesley Clark ’s criticism of John McCain .
“ As he ’s said many times before , Senator Obama honors and respects Senator McCain ’s service , and of course he rejects yesterday ’s statement by General Clark , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
During his speech today in Independence , Missouri , Obama himself sought some distance from Clark .
“ For those who have fought under the flag of this nation – for the young veterans I meet when I visit Walter Reed ; for those like John McCain who have endured physical torment in service to our country – no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary .
And let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service , especially for the sake of a political campaign , and that goes for supporters on both sides .
We must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform .
Period .
Full stop , ” Obama said .
What is most disappointing is how quickly the Obama campaign accepted McCain ’s meaning of Clark ’s comment .
Here is what Clark said , “ I do n’t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president . ”
In my mind , Clark was stating a fact .
Just as being the first African American major party nominee does not make Obama better qualified than McCain , the Republican is not better qualified because of his Vietnam experiences .

I supported the Barack Obama we saw in the primaries , but his campaign is starting to play it safe .
In the last week or so , we have seen him support the FISA bill , and now refuse to challenge the shameless flag waving of the GOP .
The sad thing is that Obama gave a good speech today on positive meaning of patriotism , but he is unwilling to challenge McCain ’s own experience .
It is clear that they are afraid of the same things John Kerry was in 2004 .
The campaign is afraid of being painted as unpatriotic and liberal , but instead of fighting against this kind of politics , the Obama campaign has chosen to back down .
In my mind this is n’t a new kind of politics , but the same old Democratic fear of the patriotism label .
If Obama is really interested in change then his campaign needs to do what Clark did , and challenge the reasoning behind the politics of patriotism , not embrace the GOP logic .

Gamasutra has received confirmation from a Flagship Studios representative that thedeveloper has seen significant staff cuts .
This morning , Gamasutra obtained information from a source close to the company indicating that staff at both the Flagship development team as well as online services subsidiary Ping0 were let go .
Both companies operate out of the same building .
Flagship declined to go into further detail about the layoffs , beyond stating that there was truth to the reports .
was released last October to favorable - skewing reviews , but was plagued by notorious launch issues and certain major gameplay criticisms .
The company 's core founders were comprised of former Blizzard North developers responsible for thegames , andwas intended as a spiritual successor to those titles .
The news comes despite claims by co-publisher Electronic
Arts thathas over one million active subscribers - being particularly successful in Korea .
In a statement last month , Flagship intended to reassure fans of the company 's health despite worries generated by a post on CVO David Brevik 's blog .
" All our Directors and Founders are still working at Flagship , and all of them are working onor , " read the statement .
" The team size for Hellgate is as big now as when we shipped .
" A second source close to Flagship indicated to Gamasutra that even at the time of such outward confidence , the company was going through internal turbulence . :
Fan site Hellgate Guru has translated a Korean news report indicating that 's publisher in the region , HanbitSoft , " ... is taking full control over the Hellgate : London intellectual property from Flagship Studios , " and intends to continue the game using in - house staff .
However , Flagship has officially responded : " This story is an outright lie .
We have no idea where they are getting their information from and have asked legal counsel to pursue the issue ...
We are mystified by Hanbitsoft 's conclusions and any attempt to take over the IP will be met with a strong and swift response .
"
In addition , a statement from HanbitSoft's U.S. lawyers has now been added to the Hellgate Guru story , with the attorneys noting : " (1 ) HanbitSoft is an exclusive licensee of bothandin Asia , with rights to sublicense the games ; ( 2 ) in addition , HanbitSoft is a secured creditor who has been pledged the ( but not the ) intellectual property as collateral for a loan ; ( 3 ) Comerica , another secured lender , has been pledged theintellectual property as its collateral for a loan ; ( 4 ) Flagship Studios does not currently own the intellectual properties to either game , which are held in separate companies subject to the security interests of lenders , and Flagship Studios ' interest in those companies is also pledged to its lenders ; ( 5 ) it is unfortunate that Flagship turned down additional investments HanbitSoft offered to make that would have allowed it to keep its doors open , but HanbitSoft hopes to work with Comerica and some of the team at Flagship to see if there is a way to continue to generate content to keeponline in Asia and to finish the development of .

The Starting Salary ( from Steve )
After a massive layoff during the dot com crash years , I had gotten used to my employers closing their doors after just two years .
At the same time , I had no trouble finding employment in other web design companies .
One of the interviews I got was so ridiculous , I could n't believe I had wasted my time there .
It started off pretty well , I was asked about my experience in web design , integration , Flash , etc .
They joked about my previous employers going out of business while they 've been in the game for 20 years or something .
I was asked if I had ever managed a web server .
" No , that did n't really have anything to do with my other skills and experience , " I began .
" But I could probably assist your sysadmin if needed . "
" Well , that 's part of what we need .
We see you in a graphic designer slash sysadmin slash office assistant role . "
What ?
That was n't what I was expecting to hear , but I went along with it , saying I could probably handle it ( despite having no intention of being their office slave ) .
When the question of salary expectations eventually came up .
They never asked what I expected , but simply declared that I could start the very next day at the " starting salary . "
Red flag .
After giving him a moment to finish his thought , I realized that he'd given all the information he wanted to .
" So ... what is the starting salary ? " I asked .
He looked at me funny and declared that he was n't sure what the minimum wage was exactly but that his partner would handle that part of the deal .
" Minimum wage ? ! "
I asked , incredulous .
He tried to reassure me .
" Well , that would be a probation salary for 3 months .
If your performance is satisfactory , we would review your salary at that point . "
" Minimum wage for a graphic designer is ridiculous enough but you would also want me to act as your sysadmin ? "
I did n't care about these jerks at this point , so I let my anger flow .
" No wonder you 're still in business after all these years , slave labor goes a long way !
Would you actually review my salary after 3 months to a 300 % increase , or would you find my systems administration experience unsatisfactory and let me go to find another willing idiot ? "
I walked out of there knowing I did n't react professionally , but then , it was all a big joke anyway .
Can You Be More Specific ? ( from Maciek )
After two years in a small company , I decided it was time to move on .
I 'd sent out a few résumés and shortly after I was invited to my first interview .
It was for a programmer / designer job in one of the larger Polish banks .
After 30 minutes of soft HR questions that almost totally exhausted me ( back then I did n't know how to answer them ) it was time for some " technical " questions from a team lead .
The guy looked like he had just finished smoking , drinking , crying , or all three , because his eyes were completely bloodshot .
A brief portion of our discussion :
Team lead :
How do you feel about numbers ?
Me : Uh ... could you be a little more specific ?
TL : You know , this is a bank , after all .
We deal with a lot of numbers , and we have to be very precise about them !
Me : Well , I always did well in math and in my current job I deal with a lot of numbers .
We gather data about land areas and we have to be very precise about it .
TL : OK , second question :
What do you think about testing ?
Me : Uh ... could you be a little more specific ?
TL : You know , you write a bit of code , your teammate writes a bit of code ... it needs to be tested !
Me : Uh , yes ...
I 'm sure it does ...
TL : Hmm ... OK , no more questions .
Thanks for your time .
Needless to say , I did n't get the job .
Six months later I found out that they did n't hire anybody .
An external company was paid for the recruiting process and it was this company 's responsibility to find someone .
The recruiting team from the bank was just interviewing people to get away from other work .
They did n't want to risk hiring anybody because if somehow a candidate was hired and eventually fired , they would be blamed for hiring him in the first place .
Old Boss , Meet New Boss ! ( from Keith )
It was my second interview for a job that needed to be filled " right away " according to my recruiter .
I was the only candidate from among the rest that seemed remotely competent ( recruiter 's words , not mine ) , and that I should try and schedule my second interview immediately with HR for some time within the next day during their usual business hours ( 9 - 5 ) .
Considering I was still employed elsewhere from around 8 to 5 , my only option was to schedule the interview during the lunch hour the next day .
Luckily , my employer at the time was pretty lax when it came to taking lunches , so a 1.5 hour lunch was n't out of the question .
Anyways , this second interview was to be a lunch interview where I 'd get to meet the people I 'd likely be working with , and get some of the non-work - related conversation out on the table .
As is their tradition , I got to pick from a couple of nearby restaurants , and I picked the one that I had been to before where I knew the food was good .
After being seated , I was promptly asked questions like " Do you play any video games ? " and " If I could have any super power , what would it be ? " .
It was at this point that I realized that I 'd be working with some fun people , and knowing that made this " interview " much more relaxing .
Moments after becoming relaxed , I had all the reasons in the world to tense right back up .
My current boss entered the room , along with a coworker / friend that knew I was out interviewing , and two of our clients .
Not only that , the host seats them at the one table directly adjacent to ours , with my chair facing their way .
I was caught red -handed .
I whispered to my prospective supervisor , " * psst* — that is my current boss sitting right next to us . "
" Really ?
That 's no good . "
He decides the best course of action is to wave down the host that had seated us earlier .
" Ma'am , can we be seated elsewhere ?
I 'd like a better view of the big screen TV . "
The host , with a confused look on her face , begrudgingly waits for us to gather our things and leads us to the other corner of the room .
" Much better , " he says .
" Phew , thank you , " I say , still completely in shock , trying to think of excuses to feed my boss for when I returned to work after lunch .
" Well , it seems we have no choice but to hire you . "
And two weeks , one day later , I was in my new cube .
I 'm not sure if this occurrence was the turning point in their decision to hire me due to feeling sorry , but something tells me I would have gotten the job anyway .
I think it was due to agreeing with my new boss that being invisible would be the best superhero ability to possess .
Probably the most often misunderstood element of KDE4 is Plasma , the extensive widget engine that replaces the normal desktop and the Kicker panel from KDE 3.x .
The entire KDE4 desktop is built up out of Plasmoids ( yet another term for desk accessory ) , including the panel and the desktop itself – and it is the latter that has been causing quite some confusion .
Where are my desktop icons ?
Update : Aaron Seigo has published a screencast showing how the FolderView Plasmoid behaves as a normal desktop , and how to make it so .
The answer is Plasma ’s FolderView desk accessory , basically a glorified rectangle which can list the contents of any folder right on your desktop – including that of ~/ desktop , allowing you to remain in your comfort zone of icons on your desktop .
However , the fun does n’t end here , as the KDE developers are coming up with a lot more fanciness for FolderView than just the listing of icons .
The idea centres around filters .
The configuration dialog for a FolderView Plasmoid allows you to filter contents , so that it shows only the files that you want to see .
KDE ’er / Amarok ’er Lydia Pintscher wrote down a blog entry to show these features off .
I have a ~ / tmp folder where I throw in all the stuff that is , well , temporary .
This stuff needs to be moved somewhere else and I was just too lazy to do it right away or is stuff I need to look at and that can be deleted afterwards .
And there are also a few TODO files in there that need my attention .
So Plasma to the rescue !
I created a FolderView that shows the content of my tmp folder and ( here comes the nifty ) filters it to only show me the stuff I really care about .
Which is files with TODO in the filename .
Using KDE ’s KIO API , you can also show and filter contents of remote folders , but that ’s not where the fun ends .
Using KDE ’s Nepomuk , things get a whole lot more interesting , as the following screenshot shows – remember , this is work - in - progress technology .
The FolderView Plasmoid allows people to have a standard , regular , and comfortable desktop , or a modern , more powerful one where multiple FolderView widgets show just the files you need at that moment .
In the future , you could possibly have an adaptive FolderView instance , which uses Nepomuk to show files relevant to what you are doing with your computer at that time .
Browsing Heather “ Dooce ” Armstrong ’s weblog , and the FolderView widget would show you photos from that trip you made to Salt Lake City .
Just a suggestion .
All that ’s left to do now is rename Nepomuk to something that does n’t sound like it would make children cry , and it ’s all set .

What I find especially interesting about McCain ’s proposed car battery contest is that like other poorly - thought - out government incentives , it warps the market .
McCain ’s contest assumes that the solution is a chemical battery , and ignores equally valid solutions — for example , the hybrid car that is about to be built that uses compressed air tanks instead of a battery to store energy .
Note that Obama is guilty of the same problem with ethanol subsidies .
Government subsidies should reward goals ( like reducing pollution or global warming ) not specific ( but transient ) technologies .
For years , the government has been subsidizing the oil companies , and see where that got us .
Like the “ gas tax holiday ” this is more of a political attention - getting stunt than a real solution .

The Chinese men in blue tracksuits were horribly familiar .
Although they were dressed like athletes , their robotic movements , blank faces , swivel eyes and rough , menacing style reminded me of the secret policemen I had to avoid when I was in Lhasa , the Tibetan capital , some years ago .
Last Sunday , they surrounded Konnie Huq as she ran with the Olympic flame through the streets of London , ordering her to hold the torch higher and shoving protesters and British policemen out of the way .
Lord Coe , the London Olympics chief , was overheard describing the so - called " torch attendants " as " thugs " .
He said : " They tried to push me out of the way three times .
They are horrible . "

Feeling the heat : Konnie Huq is surrounded by ' thugs ' as she carries the Olympic torch in London last week
It turns out that the gang of men in blue tracksuits were members of an elite Chinese paramilitary police force , known as the Olympic Games Sacred Flame Protection Unit , which was formed from members of the People 's Armed Police ( PAP ) .
As the flame continues its uneasy journey around the world , dogged each step of the way by colourful Free Tibet protesters , these men have become the living symbol of all that is most chilling about the Beijing regime .
But who are these Chinese secret policemen ?
I spent three months in Tibet researching a book about the country 's recent political and social history , and found them to be both effective and ruthless .
Tasked with protecting the integrity of the Chinese communist state against separatism , dissent or subversion , they rely on a network of informants .
Near the sports stadium at Drabchi on the outskirts of Lhasa is Tibet Autonomous Region Prison Number One , the most feared detention centre in Tibet .
A year before I made my trip , a report on political imprisonment by the American researcher Steve Marshall revealed that five young nuns had died there .
A European Union delegation had been touring the prison , which coincided with a demonstration by inmates .
Instead of singing the required patriotic songs , the nuns and some others had shouted pro-independence slogans .
The PAP were called in and beat the prisoners so severely that in the words of one survivor : " It looked like an abattoir .
They beat us with their belts , until their belts broke .
Then they used electric batons . "
After several days of beating , and further tortures involving sand - filled hoses , stripping , electric shocks and sexual humiliation , the five nuns were dead , possibly after committing suicide by suffocating themselves with prayer scarves .

Holy alliance : Monks watch the arrival of journalists in Tibet last week
For many centuries , the practice of Tibetan Buddhism has remained at the centre of Tibetan life .
Under their system of government , the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was the spiritual and political leader , and about one fifth of the population were monks and nuns .
After the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949 , Tibet was brought under the authority of Beijing - until then it had effectively been independent .
Ten years later , at the age of 24 , the Dalai Lama fled into exile in India .
During Chairman Mao's crazy " Great Leap Forward " and the Cultural Revolution in the Sixties , Tibet 's unique political and social structures - and most of its Buddhist temples - were destroyed .
The Great Leap Forward was China 's attempt to reform agricultural practices , in Tibet 's case by replacing the traditional staple diet of barley with wheat .
But the crop was unable to grow at high altitude , causing hundreds of thousands of Tibetans to starve to death .
Across China , around 30 million people died .
Many Tibetans still have little loyalty to the Chinese " motherland " , more than half a century after the communists seized control .
Religious and cultural traditions were preserved in secret , and are still followed today .
The majority of people in China belong to the ethnic group Han , and they often look down on minority groups such as the Tibetans .
Tibetans tend to be easy - going and superstitious , and not particularly ambitious in material terms .
Respecting the tenets of Buddhism is ingrained into most Tibetans at an early age .
But the Han Chinese are often fiercely ambitious , regardless of the consequences .

Cry freedom : Tibetans protesting in Kathmandu last month
In eastern Tibet , the ancient forests have been destroyed by loggers , leaving silted rivers and a bleak , devastated natural environment .
At times it can feel as if the two communities come from different worlds , and have nothing in common .
At an everyday level , there is little communication .
Few Han in Tibet have learned more than basic words of the Tibetan language .
They almost never intermarry .
Tibetans enjoy food based around barley flour and yak meat , while the Han cook the Chinese food from their home province .
One Han Chinese civil servant told me he found the Tibetans boisterous and prone to drink too much .
The Tibetans , in turn , ridiculed the Han habit of eating animals such as cats and snakes .
A Tibetan tent manufacturer I got to know in Shigatse said he found it almost impossible to do business with the Han : he claimed they would change the terms of the deal midstream , and he would invariably make a loss .
Much of China 's remarkable recent development has taken place in a relentlessly short - term way .
Workers have been forced to travel vast distances to look for employment , and peasants have been thrown off their land .
There is corruption at the highest levels .
Many mines and factories pollute the environment in a way that would not be tolerated in the West .
Behind this lies the Chinese determination to succeed and the conviction that the 21st Century will be the Asian century .
For Tibetans , the importance of spiritual life remains strong .
The Tibetan plateau - at 1.5 million square miles , about the size of Western Europe - is one of the most scarcely populated places on Earth .

Insight : Writer Patrick French with academics in Tibet , where he spent three months researching a book on the country 's recent history
There are vast mountain ranges , rolling grasslands that stretch as far as the eye can see and high - altitude plains where nomads live with their livestock and the lack of physical comfort drives people towards the spiritual .
Monks and nuns are revered by Tibetans , who believe the clergy are helping to safeguard society .
Some monks and nuns - who are obliged to be celibate - believe they can take risks others with families might not take .
In Xining , a city in a neighbouring Chinese province with a large Tibetan population , I met a woman named Nyima .
At the age of 17 , she decided to become a nun in a nunnery east of the old city of Lhasa , and resolved to oppose the government .
These choices had potentially fatal implications .
Several of her friends had been carted off to Gutsa detention centre , and one had died from renal failure after a severe beating .
Nyima told me : " I get up each day at around six o'clock , do the cleaning , put out the water offerings on the altars , check the butter lamps and prepare breakfast .
" In the afternoons I say prayers , study or do jobs .
We are part of a community , looking out for each other .
" Every lunar month we do seven religious ceremonies for the deities , organised by a senior nun .
" People come to us if they want prayers said for a member of their family who is sick , or if someone has died .
That 's one of the ways we get funds .
" I became a nun because I wished to make a religious commitment and to study , but also because I love Tibet and thought that , as a single person , I would be able to take risks for the good of Tibet . "
I asked Nyima why she felt so strongly , since she was too young to have witnessed the worst cruelties of Chinese communist rule in Tibet .

East meets west : The Dalai Lama with Arnold Schwarzenegger
She replied : " From my earliest years I had heard stories about what the communists had done to our country .
It soaked into me from childhood .
" The Chinese would say we were beggars or that we were dirty .
" I also felt resentful about what happened to my cousin .
He put up 20 posters in Nagchu town , and was given a two - year sentence , and was beaten by the soldiers who guarded the compound .
" His health got worse .
He was unable to urinate .
He started to cough up blood .
He was eventually returned to his family . "
One of the things that made Nyima most angry was the way women in her nunnery had to learn propaganda against the Dalai Lama and be tested on it by the communist authorities .
The nuns had to say ludicrous things such as : " We will resolutely oppose the scheming activities of the tiny number of Tibetan pro-independence elements ! " or " We will safeguard the four basic principles and oppose bourgeois liberalisation ! "
Nyima told me these phrases made her head spin .
" You know the saying , ' If you stand up , you bump your head , if you sit down , you bang your a**e , it 's really awful . '
That 's what it 's like .
" Day after day , the Committee makes us repeat slogans , and they stop us from doing important religious ceremonies . "
With such an unhappy relationship , it is little wonder that the Chinese secret police are a constant presence in Tibet .
As in East Germany during the time of the Stasi , Tibetans are obliged to spy on their friends and neighbours for the authorities .
When I was staying with nomads in the grasslands of northern and eastern Tibet , people seemed to have substantial freedom .

Daring :
An injured monk during last month 's upheavals in Lhasa .
Protesters know they face imprisonment and torture
They lived in felt tents , kept horses , yaks and sheep , and apart from owning a few motorbikes and the odd solar panel to power light - bulbs or a radio , lived in much the same way as their ancestors would have done .
In the cities , it was different .
Lhasa is a mass of ugly concrete and blue glass modern buildings , much like any other Chinese city , and the old Tibetan city is a small ghetto where the indigenous people look worse off than the Han Chinese migrants .
Since the recent construction of a railway line from Beijing to Lhasa , this disparity has become worse , and some of the protests last month were as much economic as nationalist .
Tibetans feel uneasy about doing business with Chinese , whom they both admire and dislike for their business skills .
There is little social interchange between the different communities .
During the protests in Lhasa , it was not surprising to see Chinese shops being smashed and burned , and their owners being beaten .
The Tibetan reaction was a combination of anger and envy .
In Tibet , I travelled as a tourist while conducting undercover interviews , and knew I would be put under surveillance .
The places I went to and the people I met prevented me from seeming quite the person I claimed to be - a schoolteacher on holiday .
So , Han Chinese policemen in double - breasted suits would come to my hotel and examine my room when I was not there .
A sallow - faced man with a wide - brimmed hat sat in the window of the shop opposite the hotel lobby watching people .
I would make a point of leaving my coded notebooks in my room whenever I went out - designed to look like a typical traveller 's journal - and every few days I would find they had been examined , and probably photocopied .
I could accept it , although it made me sick with tension .

But some Tibetans say activism abroad only makes their lives harsher
What shocked me was the discovery , after more than two months , that Tsering , the smiling , rosy - faced Tibetan hotel receptionist , with whom I chatted most days , was an agent for the Public Security Bureau , or PSB .
She did not want to do this badly paid job , but her father had been compromised by the PSB over a minor irregularity ; she had no choice .
To Tibetans in Lhasa , none of this seemed strange .
People were obliged to go against the philosophical underpinnings of Tibetan Buddhism and betray each other out of fear of imprisonment or unemployment .
The longer I spent in Tibet , the more I began to comprehend this repressed society .
One Tibetan man described it to me this way : anyone in uniform was a moron , and the threat came from those in plain clothes and their informants .
Any hotel or travel company in the Tibet Autonomous Region that interacted with foreign tourists would be obliged to keep at least one informant on its staff , who might be working for money or for favours .
Often , they had themselves been caught transgressing - there were so many things you could do wrong in Tibet - and had been turned .
One evening when I got back late to my hotel in Lhasa , a plain - clothes PSB officer was waiting for me in the lobby .
The receptionist was nervous .
The hotel had been under surveillance for some time , and there had been an inspection of the guest register a few days before .
I did n't know if I was the target or not ; what I did know was that I had been exceptionally careful not to be followed when I went to do interviews .
" Do you have a camera ? " " No . " I had thought it safer not to bring one to Tibet .
" You have an electronic brain ? " " A what ? " " Electronic brain .
Computer laptop . "
His fingers tapped an imaginary keyboard .
" No . No laptop . "
" You have audio equipment in the hotel ? "
I knew his colleagues had been in my room a few days before , and would have seen whatever was there .
I had no audio equipment .
He eventually went away .
The next morning I departed for western Tibet , and when I returned to Lhasa two weeks later I tried harder to blend in with the travellers and backpackers .

Monks take part in rare street protests in Tibet a month ago .
A brutal crackdown followed
The city 's oppressive atmosphere came , in part , from the strong physical presence of the security forces .
The most frightening face of the security system came in three different forms .
The officers of the PSB could be found either in uniform or in plain clothes .
The PAP , whose elite members are now guarding the Olympic flame , were a grander , paramilitary outfit , and rode around in 4x4s and trucks , flashing automatic weapons , whenever a dignitary was in town or a Buddhist festival was taking place .
Worst of all was the State Security Bureau ( SSB ) China 's feared security and intelligence agency .
I had only heard about the SSB , and never knowingly came across one of its members .
On returning to Britain , I met an MI5 officer who worked in counter - intelligence relating to the Chinese in Britain .
He told me that only in Shanghai were there more SSB officers than in Lhasa .
When I was staying with a nomad family in the grasslands of Amdo , I asked Namdrub , a man who had fought in the anti-communist resistance in the Fifties , what he thought about the foreign activists and exiled Tibetans who campaigned for his country 's freedom .
" It may make them feel good , but for us , it makes life worse , " was his reply .
" It makes the Chinese create more controls .
Tibet is too important to the communists for them even to discuss independence . "
Many Tibetans would disagree with Namdrub , and some are willing to risk their lives to protest against communist rule .
The most remarkable feature of the present protests inside Tibet is that they have been so wide - ranging , and have taken place in areas that were previously regarded as politically stable .
The protesters know they face imprisonment and torture .
An important spark for the demonstrations was the award by President George W. Bush at the end of last year of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama , an event that was broadcast over the internet and on the radio by Voice Of America .

Defiant : Tibetan protesters arrested in Kathmandu , Nepal , last month are driven away
It became widely known inside Tibet , and monks celebrated by setting off fireworks and throwing barley flour - and were quickly arrested .
Demonstrators turned out on March 10 at great personal risk to call for their release .
This morphed into a protest by Tibetans in Lhasa who were angry that the financial advantages of the past decade have gone mainly to Han Chinese and Hui Muslims , who run certain trades such as selling livestock and butchery businesses .
In London recently , I spoke to a young Tibetan refugee who lives in Britain .
" People believed the American government was genuinely considering the Tibet issue as a priority , " he said .
In fact , the award was a symbolic gesture , arranged mostly to make American statesmen feel good .
A similar misunderstanding occurred in 1987 when the Dalai Lama put forward a Five Point Peace Proposal on Capitol Hill and was denounced by the Chinese state media .
To Tibetans brought up within the communist system - where a politician 's physical proximity to the leadership on the evening news indicates to the public that he is in favour - it appeared that the world 's most powerful government was offering substantive political backing to the Dalai Lama .
Protests began in Lhasa at that time which lasted on and off until March 1989 , when martial law was declared .
The brutal suppression that followed was orchestrated by Tibet 's Party Secretary , Hu Jintao , who is today China 's president and paramount leader .
His response to the current unrest is likely to be equally uncompromising .
China is today more powerful than it has been for hundreds of years .
It is not a Third World country that can be pushed around .
It helped to finance the debt that underpins the American economy and the war in Iraq , and its manufactured goods are found in every European home .
But it remains communist , and resentful of anything that looks like foreign interference .
For Western politicians , Tibet remains a risk - free cause .
Although Beijing may complain when Prime Minister Gordon Brown meets the Dalai Lama next month , the meeting will do Brown no harm at all with the British public .
Whether it will bring any benefit to the Tibetans is another matter .
At the end of the Eighties , when China liberalised , the Dalai Lama joined forces with Hollywood stars and generated popular support for the Tibetan cause in America and western Europe .
But the campaign outraged the xenophobic Chinese leadership .
Tragically , it has been clear since the mid-Nineties that the popular internationalisation of the Tibet issue has had no positive impact on the Beijing government .
They are not amenable to political guidance from Westerners , over the Olympics or anything else .
I first visited Tibet in 1986 .
The economic plight of ordinary people is slightly better now , but they have as little political freedom as they did then .
Tibet lacks any meaningful autonomy , and ethnic Tibetans are excluded from positions of power within the bureaucracy or the army .
This is why so many Tibetans are now risking their lives by protesting , believing it is their last chance before the Dalai Lama passes away , and that foreign countries might help them .
I dearly hope I am wrong and the protesters turn out to be right , but so far there is no sign that President Hu Jintao is listening - or that he has the slightest inclination to change his government 's policy in Tibet .

But listen !
This was a racehorse , so the owner says that I need to massage it 's prostate .
I 'm assuming you do n't know this , but the prostate on a horse is VERY fucking far back there .

So , I get on the arm - length glove and I look in the room to see another doctor with a cat or something .
Tells me we had too many animals so the horse was moved to a room close to the front .

Well , I get there , and I put my arm in this horse 's ass .
I 'm talkin' less than a foot from my shoulder deep .
All in clear view .

And then some redneck couple come in and they see me because this front room has shit protection on it .

Hollywood filmmaker Ira Isaacs says the videos he sells are works of art , protected under the Constitution .
Federal prosecutors contend they are criminally obscene .
The prosecution is the first in Southern California by a U.S. Department of Justice task force formed in 2005 after Christian conservative groups appealed to the Bush administration to crack down on smut .

For jurors to determine whether Isaacs ’ work is obscene , they will view hours of hard - core pornography so degrading that in one film , an actress cries throughout , prosecutors said in court papers .
But if jurors find that any of the four videos at issue in the case have any “ literary , scientific or artistic value , ” the work is not legally obscene , according to a 1973 Supreme Court ruling .
“ All they ’re going to do is turn on a DVD machine and hope the jury is going to be so shocked and disgusted and offended that they ’re going to throw me in prison , ” said Isaacs , 57 , a native of the Bronx .
He said he hopes that jurors will be shocked -- he ’s a self - described “ shock artist ” -- but also that they will see artistic value in the work .
The portly defendant , who sports a ponytail and goatee , produced and starred in one of the videos .
He contends that the sex in the movie is incidental to the art .
It ’s merely a marketing tool to drive sales of the videos on the Internet , he said .

In a statistic that some may find every bit as shocking as his work , Isaacs said he was selling about 1,000 videos per month at $ 30 apiece before being raided by the FBI early last year .
The number has since dropped to between 700 and 800 per month , but they still generate enough money to pay the rent on a house with a pool in the Hollywood Hills .
Isaacs predicted that many jurors would not be able to stomach viewing the movies , some of which feature acts of bestiality and defecation .
“ It ’s going to be a circus , ” he said of the upcoming trial .
“ I think I ’d freak out if I had to watch six hours of the stuff . ”
Jury selection is expected to begin today .
Presiding over the trial will be Alex Kozinski , chief judge of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
Kozinski was assigned the case as part of a rotation in which he and other appeals court judges occasionally oversee criminal trials in addition to deciding appeals .

His involvement in the case may be a stroke of luck for Isaacs .
That is because Kozinski is seen as a staunch defender of free speech .
When he learned that there were filters banning pornography and other materials from computers in the appeals court ’s Pasadena offices , he led a successful effort to have the filters removed .
“ I did some rabble - rousing about it , ” Kozinski said in a brief interview last week .
He said he was made aware of the issue when a law clerk researching a case was banned from accessing a gay bookstore ’s website .
“ I did n’t think the bureaucrats in Washington should decide what the federal judiciary should have access to , ” the judge said .
“ I thought that was incredibly arrogant for them to decide on their own . ”
Kozinski declined to comment on any aspect of the Isaacs case .

Isaacs said he would testify as his own expert witness at trial and planned to lecture jurors on how perceptions of art have changed over the years .
There was a time , he said , when the works of authors James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence were called obscene .
The point , Isaacs said , “ is do we really want to throw artists in jail in America ? ”
Kenneth Whitted , the Justice Department prosecutor assigned to the Obscenity Prosecution Task Force , declined to be interviewed for this report .
According to the Justice Department ’s website , the task force “ is dedicated exclusively to the protection of America ’s children and families through the enforcement of our Nation ’s obscenity laws . ”

The task force has won convictions in more than a dozen cases , the vast majority resulting from plea bargains , according to case summaries provided by the department .
Only a few defendants have elected to fight the charges at trial .
Punishment in most cases included some prison time , ranging from one to seven years , as well as stiff fines and forfeiture of proceeds .
At a time when even hard - core pornography is available in major hotels , through cable companies and on the Internet , prosecutors have focused their efforts on particularly outrageous material , often involving sex with animals and defecation .
Most of the cases were brought in relatively conservative areas of the country , five of them in Texas .
Whether jurors in Southern California have more lenient views on obscenity will be tested at Isaacs ’ trial .

Federal agents raided Isaacs ’ Koreatown office in January 2007 .
Isaacs said he was told by authorities that the investigation was initiated after a local person complained , and was eventually turned over to the task force in Washington .
He is now facing charges related to the importation , transportation and distribution of obscene material in connection with four videos he was selling over the Internet , including the one he produced .
Isaacs admits to producing that film and to distributing all four .
But he denies that they ’re obscene .
“ That ’s for the jury to decide , ” he said .
Advertisement
He said that prosecutors have made several overtures inviting him to take a plea in the case , but that he has refused every time .
Pleading guilty would be admitting that he was just another pornographer , he said .
“ If I get convicted and go to prison now , ” Isaacs said , “ I go as an artist . ”

10,000 flee South Africa as army is called on to streets to end anti-foreigner violence
More than 10,000 Mozambicans have fled home from South Africa to escape anti-foreigner violence that has killed at least 42 people and left more than 30,000 homeless .
Their escape comes as President Thabo Mbeki ordered the armed forces to quell the unrest for the first time in the country since the end of Apartheid .
Air force helicopters were deployed to back up police in Johannesburg 's Alexandra township over fears the crisis could massively destabilise Africa 's largest economy .
Mean streets : A South African policeman patrols the Ramaphosa settlement in Johannesburg as Thabo Mbeki ordered the army to stop the violence
Armed mobs , who have forcefully driven thousands of immigrants from their homes before looting and torching their shacks , accuse them of stealing jobs and fuelling crime .
The violence , which has since spread from Johannesburg to Durban , has also seen the return of necklacing – the brutal practice of filling a tyre with petrol and throwing it over the victim 's neck .
The deadly method has not been seen since the Apartheid era when black South Africans used it on “ collaborators ” with the white minority rulers .
Fears of attacks have led to thousands of immigrants , mainly from Zimbabwe and Mozambique , fleeing the country .
Emergency : A refugee camp outside Primrose Police Station , Johannesburg , where about 1,000 people now live
Mozambique 's Deputy Immigration Director Leonardo Boby today said : " 10,047 returned home in buses provided by the government .
" The number is likely to increase in the next days as long as violence unfolds in South Africa .
The deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress , which ousted Mbeki as party leader in December , criticised the police delay in responding to the violence which erupted in Alexandra township on May 11 and spread rapidly .
" The delay encouraged people in similar environments to wage similar attacks against people who came from our sister countries on the continent , " Kgalema Motlanthe said .
Fear : A Zimbabwean resident from the Ramaphosa settlement , Johannesburg , cries after her shack was looted
" We are confronted by one of the ugliest incidents in the post - apartheid era . "
Mr Motlanthe also said the violence was an assault on the values of South Africa 's democratic society .
He is a close ally of ANC leader Jacob Zuma , who defeated Mbeki for the party leadership .
The attacks on African migrants have increased political instability at a time of power shortages and disaffection over Mbeki 's pro-business policies .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The tumble in the price of oil over the past few weeks may have been exacerbated by hedge funds deciding that it was just too expensive , particularly in relation to gold .

While much of the fall has been put down to an assumption that demand will fall with the slowdown in leading economies , hedge fund specialists say there are also less fundamental reasons behind the move .
Oil ’s sharp rise this year -- New York crude had gained as much as 53 percent to a record high above $ 147 a barrel earlier in July -- has not been matched by gold , which was up just 18 percent on the same period .
That makes oil very expensive by historical standards even beyond its record face value .
“ There is a very long - term relationship between gold and oil , ” said Will Bartleet , a fund manager at HSBC ’s Absolute Returns Service .
One aspect of the relationship is that the price of a barrel of oil is seen by some to be in equilibrium with gold when it is at a ratio of 10 barrels to one ounce .
This was roughly the case in mid-March when gold hit a record above $ 1,030 an ounce and oil was trading at around $ 105 a barrel .
It was at a slightly tighter 8.7 to 1 ratio at the end of 2007 with oil at $ 96 and gold at $ 833 before gold took off .
Since March , however , gold has come down and traded in a relatively narrow range while oil has soared .
The result :
The ratio was just 5.9 to 1 earlier this month .
SHORTING OIL
There is evidence that hedge funds noticed this trend , or at least decided that the time had come to get out of the long oil trade they have held for some time .
Hedge funds sold crude oil in the week to July 22 to take a small overall short position for the first time since February 2007 , according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
This gelled with Societe Generale ’s latest analysis of CFTC data which found hedge funds unwinding their net buying positions in oil at the end of June and heading towards being neutral or net sellers .
At the same time , SocGen found hedge funds to be strong buyers of gold -- up at May levels and not far from those seen earlier in the year in the run up to March .
Since its $ 147 peak on July 11 , oil has fallen as much as 17 percent .
It was around $ 123 a barrel on Monday .
Gold has not responded in equal measure .
Spot gold is actually around 6.5 percent off its July peak as is the price of buying into SPDR Gold Trust , the world ’s largest gold - backed exchange - traded fund .
Both peaks , however , were sharply higher than their end - June levels .
But Monday ’s ratio of oil to gold was 7.5 to 1 , much closer to supposed equilibrium than a few weeks earlier .
FUNDAMENTALLY SPEAKING
The 10 to 1 equilibrium idea is far from being the only mover of oil , however , and fundamentals have clearly been playing the major role .
Signs that the U.S. and euro zone economies are stuttering imply that demand for crude will slow , taking the edge off some of the main drivers that have sent oil to recent heady heights .
“ The robustness of global oil and oil product demand remains under question as a result of higher product prices and weakening global economic growth , ” Investec Asset Management said in a recent note .
It also argued that the key to the sustainability of the lower price would be the direction of oil - thirsty emerging market economies , which have held up quiet well so far despite the developed market downturn .
Another factor that could have played into oil 's fall is the dollar , which typically has an inverse relationship with crude -- that is , crude falls when the dollar strengths .
The greenback has been strengthening against a basket of major currencies .
DXY since mid-July as oil has been falling .
The narrowing ratio of oil to gold may , as a result , just have exacerbated moves based on fundamentals or provided a trigger for the sell off .
Meanwhile , if the ratio was to be 10 to 1 , gold today should be at $ 1,230 an ounce or oil should be at $ 92 a barrel .
Editor 's note : " Glenn Beck " is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
Glenn
Beck says we should look at what government does with gas taxes before criticizing oil company profits .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
We all want to live in a world that 's clean , healthy and prosperous .
We all want to hand that world off to our children in slightly better shape than we received it .
No one , even the supposedly evil oil executive , has any reason to want anything different .
But , for some reason , we find ourselves searching for villains .
Surely they exist , but the endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment , whether intentional or not .
Congress has picked " Big Oil " as their enemy of the week .
These companies inexplicably put profits above people , ravaging the environment and financially assaulting the poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet .
That 's the storyline we 've all been taught .
Yes , times are tough for many .
Sure , oil companies make a lot of cash .
But , for that money , they get us to work , get ambulances to the hospital , keep our homes warm , and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement , paying their health care , and providing energy to millions .
Because of capitalism , they have the incentive to do that .
I 've yet to see what our government does for us with their rather large chunk of each gallon of gas we buy , and I 've yet to see them offer to return it or suggest a gas - tax - windfall - tax - tax .
The other villain of the moment is the global warming " denier . "
Anyone who disagrees , even in the slightest , must be ridiculed .
On " 60 Minutes " last weekend , Al Gore said : " They 're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the Earth is flat .
That demeans them a little bit , but it 's not that far off . "
Approximately 6 percent of Americans believe in the fake moon landing theory , although I 've always heard there was a conspiratorial consensus that it was staged in Nevada , not Arizona .
I 'm going to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent believe in a flat Earth , but no one seems to be asking that question in polls anymore , so I can't be sure .
So , who are those people Gore was demeaning " a little bit " by these comparisons ?
There 's a good chance it 's you .
That 's because the vast majority of Americans believe something that categorizes them as a flat earther to environmentalists like Gore .
Despite the media 's one - sided view ( the Business and Media Institute says dissenting voices about global warming are outnumbered on CBS News broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio ) , only 21 percent of Americans say " the release of greenhouse gasses is the most important factor causing global warming " according to a 2007 New York Times / CBS News poll .
The " 60 Minutes " piece was n't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion ; it had plenty of Gore - style hypocrisy .
He was embroiled in controversy when it was revealed his mansion used 20 times more energy than the average American .
His explanation ?
" Since then " his house has been retrofitted with solar panels .
I 'm sure Eliot Spitzer has n't been renting many women since he was caught either .
( Although I 'm not betting my life on it . )
We then see footage of Gore 's parents ' farm that will , sometime in the future , be run on wind power .
Apparently , the windmill store has been out of stock for the past 20 years .
Perhaps most comically , Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a climate presentation to about 100 people .
Gore claimed : " We just do n't have any choice .
I wish I knew a better way to do it .
I constantly ask myself , ' How can I be more effective in getting this message across ? ' "
The most effective thing you can think of is flying halfway across the world to speak with 100 people ?
Maybe you had other things to do while you were there , but I 'd be surprised if there was anything essential that could n't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer .
The people in India will be able to see your fancy graphs on their screens , and you 'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights .
The entire " 60 Minutes " piece felt like a commercial for Gore 's upcoming commercials .
He 's spending $ 300 million in advertising to convince people of something he claims there is already a consensus on .
To put that much money into perspective ; it 's more than Sen. Barack Obama , Sen. Hillary Clinton , Sen. John Edwards , Sen. John McCain , former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last year combined .
Think of it as going green by getting lots of green .
Where is all that money coming from ?
Gore says he 's donating his profits from " An Inconvenient Truth , " and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award .
Let 's be generous and say there 's only $ 290 million left to explain .
Apparently , a follow - up question to find the origins of this nine - figure sum would have involved six seconds that " 60 Minutes " was n't willing to commit .
What is there to learn from all of this ?
Whether it 's politicians on both sides of the aisle or our vaunted environmental superheroes , the quest for power overwhelms even the slightest instinct of self - examination .
In the end , the timing of the Gore interview airing could n't have been better .
It fell on the same weekend as the first " Earth Hour , " when the world supposedly came together to turn our attention to climate change by shutting the lights off for an hour .
The imagery of monuments like the Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , going dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere .
But those pictures highlighted the global warming movement and the congressional attacks on energy companies in an entirely unintended way .
Behind the darkened Sears Tower was the city of Chicago , with lights shining brightly as far as the eye could see .
For one hour the Sears Tower knew what it was like to be Al Gore : A larger than life symbol , blocking our view of reality .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
Scientists have developed a technique for retrieving fingerprints from bullet casings and bomb fragments after they have been fired or detonated .
The new method , which relies on subtle corrosion of metal surfaces is already being applied for the first time anywhere in the world by two British police forces .
The patterns of corrosion remain even after the surface has been cleaned , heated to 600C or even painted over .
This means that traces of fingerprints stay on the metal long after the residue from a person 's finger has gone .
" All other conventional techniques that the police anywhere in the world would use require some kind of either physical or chemical interaction with the fingerprint residue .
So for example if you are using powder the powder sticks to the tackiness in the sweat , " said Dr John Bond of the University of Leicester and the Scientific Support Unit of Northamptonshire Police .
Instead , the technique he has developed relies on permanent physical changes to the metal .
The chemical basis of the change is not yet clear , but Bond believes it is corrosion by chloride ions from the salt in sweat .
These produce lines of corrosion along the ridges of the fingerprint residue .
When the metal is heated , for example in a bomb blast or when a gun is fired , the chemical reaction actually speeds up and makes the corrosion more pronounced .
To visualise the patterns , Bond 's technique involves passing 2500 volts through the metal and sprinkling a fine conducting powder on it .
While the electric field is applied , the powder sticks to the corroded areas .
" If the corrosion 's there , it will stay there unless you abrasively clean the metal .
The only way to get rid of it is to actually take the surface layer of the metal off , " he said .
" Some metals corrode very well and some not at all .
One metal that works very well is brass and gun cartridge cases happen to be made of brass . "
He has published details of the technique in the latest issue of the Journal of Forensic Sciences .
In his paper he demonstrates that it is possible to recover fingerprints from a bullet casing ejected when a pistol is fired .
" As you are pushing the magazine in you are actually putting a thumb print on the bullet , " said Bond .
" That 's the person you want .
That 's the guy who loaded the gun . "
The Metropolitan Police has asked Bond to look into evidence kept from a 10 year old murder case .
He is also using the technique on evidence from a recent murder that is being investigated by Lincolnshire police .
Huckabee jokes about Obama ducking gunman RAW STORY
Published : Friday May 16 , 2008

Print This Email This ( Update : Huckabee later apologizes , claims joke about running for cover was n't meant to offend Obama )
A top contender for the bottom half of the Republican presidential ticket cracked wise about the likely Democratic candidate on Friday .
Or perhaps not so wise .
" During a speech before the National Rifle Association convention Friday afternoon in Louisville , Kentucky , former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee  who has endorsed presumptive GOP nominee John McCain  joked that an unexpected offstage noise was Democrat Barack Obama looking to avoid a gunman , " CNN Associate Political Editor Rebecca Sinderbrand reports at the cable network 's Political Ticker .
" That was Barack Obama , he just tripped off a chair , he 's getting ready to speak , " said the former Arkansas governor , to audience laughter .
" Somebody aimed a gun at him and he dove for the floor . "
CBS
News also reported on Huckabee 's quip , and notes that " McCain , who 's scheduled to speak at 4:30 pm ET , is expected to take aim at Obama as well . "
" Earlier in the day , at a town hall meeting in Watertown , S.D. , Obama said he supports the Second Amendment , " CBS ' report continued .
" I want to be absolutely clear about this  I will never take away the right of lawful gun owners to hunt and sport shooting , to protect their family .
I recognize this is a traditional way of life in rural communities all across America , including my home state , " said Obama .
" I believe in the Second Amendment . "
At Politico , Ben Smith observes about Huckabee 's comments , " Joking about Obama getting shot at is probably not the fast track to veephood . "
Huckabee issues apology
On Friday evening at around 7:30 PM , hours after his NRA speech , Huckabee issued a statement containing an apology , according to a New York Times report .
" During my speech at the N.R.A. , a loud noise backstage , that sounded like a chair falling , distracted the crowd and interrupted my speech , " Huckabee wrote .
" I made an off hand remark that was in no way intended to offend or disparage Sen. Obama .
I apologize that my comments were offensive .
That was never my intention . "
Before the apology , ABC 's Political Radar blog noted , " Huckabee was always quick on his feet on the campaign trail .
There was the time the lights went out in the auditorium and he suggested it was a sign from God to wrap up his speech , or the time a cell phone rang in the audience and Huckabee suggested it might be a McCain supporter calling to tell him to leave the race .
But , did this one cross the line ?
After all , a joke about Obama 's safety runs a fine line given that Obama accepted Secret Service protection quite early in the race for fear of violence against him . "
" The question remains , how might this effect Huckabee 's chances at landing the coveted slot at the bottom of the GOP ticket ? "
ABC 's Kevin Chupka asks .
" Earlier in the week , a U.S. News and World Report blog quoted a top McCain fundraiser as saying Huckabee topped the list for potential GOP vice presidential candidates .
After a week of buzz pertaining to just such a possibility , did Huckabee shoot himself in the foot today in front of the NRA ?
Perhaps only John McCain knows . "

But this is more amazing : John Kanzius has no background in cancer research but might have invented a real cure .
He was diagnosed with leukemia , and struck by the idea that radio waves could kill cancer cells .
So he built a prototype machine using pie pans and conducted tests on hot dogs injected with copper sulfate — the radio waves only heat up metal spots , for tactical nuking without nasty side effects .
It 's now being tested at the University of Pittsburgh and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , where the lead doc says that it " may allow us to treat just about any kind of cancer you can imagine . "

So how to get metal bits to cancer cells ?
This is where the big corporate research comes in : nanotechnology .
Thousands of nano - particles composed of metal bits can fit in a cancer cell .
So far , they 've conducted successful cancer extermination trials using the Kanzius machine and metal nano - particles at both M.D. Anderson and Pittsburgh .
The catch is that it 's only been tested on solid tumors — hitting cancer that 's spread around the body is what they 're working toward , and if they can't hunt down the individual cancer cells with the nano - particles , this will only have limited applications .
Human trials are also still four years away , which unfortunately might not be in time for the machine 's inventor to cure himself .

Tools thought to have once belonged to Neanderthals have provided new insight into their lives , suggesting they were " sophisticated " huntsmen , it was revealed today .
Archaeologists from University College London ( UCL ) have discovered artefacts at a site known as Beedings , near Pulborough , which they believe show the species was more technologically advanced than previously thought .
The excavation , which has been funded by English Heritage , has been taking place since February and has uncovered tools that are believed to have been used by Prehistoric man to hunt game such as reindeer , bison and mammoth up to 42,000 years ago .
Dr Matthew Pope of UCL's Institute of Archaeology , who led the dig , said : " The exceptional collection of tools appears to represent the sophisticated hunting kit of Neanderthal populations which were only a few millennia from complete disappearance in the region .
" Unlike earlier , more typical Neanderthal tools these were made with long , straight blades - blades which were then turned into a variety of bone and hide processing implements , as well as lethal spear points .
" The impression they give is of a population in complete command of both landscape and natural raw materials with a flourishing technology - not a people on the edge of extinction . "
The excavation is the first modern investigation of the site since it was originally discovered in 1900 when around 2,300 preserved stone tools were found in fissures in the foundations of a house that was being built .
It was not until recently , however , that their significance was fully realised .
More than 80 years after they were discovered , Dr Roger Jacobi of the British Museum found that the fact that the tools contained large numbers of long , straight - sided blades which had been thinned at each end , suggested they had been used as spear tips .
He realised that the tools were technologically similar to those excavated at a number of north European sites , which had been found to date back to between 35,000 and 42,000 years ago .
Now the collection is recognised as the most diverse and extensive of any found in northern Europe , offering the most effective insight into the species which occupied the area before our own .
Dr Pope added : " There were some questions about the validity of the earlier find , but our excavations have proved beyond doubt that the material discovered here was genuine and originated from fissures within the local sandstone .
" We also discovered older , more typical Neanderthal tools , deeper in the fissure .
Clearly , Neanderthal hunters were drawn to the hill over a long period time , presumably for excellent views of the game - herds grazing on the plains below the ridge . "
The excavation , which has been carried out with the help of experts from Sussex Archaeological Society and Worthing Archaeological Society , was funded by English Heritage after they learnt the site was under threat from intensive farming .
Barney Sloane , Head of Historic Environment Commissions at English Heritage , said : " Sites such as this are extremely rare and a relatively little - considered archaeological resource .
This study offers a rare chance to answer some crucial questions about just how technologically advanced Neanderthals were , and how they compare with our own species . "
Findings from the project have suggested that the site may not be unique .
Similar sites with comparable fissure systems are thought to exist across the whole of south east England and the project now aims to prospect more widely across the region for others .
Attackers could use the loophole to redirect web users to fake sites Attack code that exploits flaws in the net 's addressing system are starting to circulate online , say security experts .
The code could be a boon to phishing gangs who redirect web users to fake bank sites and steal login details .
In light of the news net firms are being urged to apply a fix for the loop - hole before attacks by hi-tech criminals become widespread .
Net security groups say there is anecdotal evidence that small scale attacks are already happening .
Address list " We are in a lot of trouble , " said security guru Dan Kaminsky who found the flaw in the net 's Domain Name System ( DNS ) in March 2008 .
" This attack is very good , " he said .
" This attack is being weaponised out in the field .
Everyone needs to patch , please . "
The DNS acts as the net 's address system and helps computers translate the website names people use , such as bbc.co.uk , into the numerical equivalents preferred by machines .
If exploited the flaw would allow malicious hackers to direct people to fake sites even if that user typed in the correct address for the place they wanted to visit .
Now security researchers have come up with two separate methods for attacking the flaw .
The code used in the attacks has been added to a popular testing tool called Metasploit used by both good and bad hackers alike to find weaknesses in computer systems .
The attack code was developed following the accidental leaking of the bug Mr Kaminsky discovered .
Initially he had planned to release more information in October .
After being discovered in March , information about it was shared with large net organisations such as Cisco , Google , Yahoo and Microsoft to give them chance to produce patches and fixes .
Now net supply firms are being urged to get on with the job of updating their systems so customers are not left at risk .

What are these ?
In February , I received an e-mail from a reader using a Columbia University address — Torah Bontrager — that ended curiously :
“ … and if you ever want to hear how I escaped the Amish , let me know . ”
Those peace - loving bearded folks from Witness ?
I called Torah , and after just a few minutes , I knew this post had to be written .
For those of you who feel trapped because of a job or self - imposed obligations as an entrepreneur , this will put things in perspective .
How do you escape your environment if you ’re unable to control it ?
If almost no one on the outside realizes what ’s happening ?
I ’ll let Torah tell us in her own words …
Torah Bontrager after escaping the Amish at age 15 .
To start , tell us a little about your background .
I ’m twenty - seven and graduated from Columbia University in 2007 .
I was born in Iowa .
We moved to Wisconsin when I was three and to Michigan when I was ten , and I lived with my family in traditional Amish communities this whole time .
I escaped from my family and the Amish when I was fifteen .
I ’m the oldest of eleven children .
Four of my siblings were born after I escaped .
What are the most common misconceptions or myths about the Amish ?
Here are some of the most common false beliefs about the Amish :
- The Amish speak English ( Fact : They speak Amish , which some people claim is its own language , while others say it is a dialect of German .
Most people do n’t know that Amish was only a spoken language until the Bible got translated and printed into the vernacular about 12 years ago . )
- Amish teens have a choice whether they want to remain practicing the religion .
( False )
- Amish is only a religion ( Fact : It ’s a religion , culture , and language , etc . )
- Amish kids go to public school , or are taught similar courses ( e.g. , science ) as public school kids
- The Amish are Mormons ( False )
- The Amish have arranged marriages ( False )
- Amish men have more than one wife ( False )
- The Amish put all their income in the same pot , like a communist or socialist banking system ( False )
- Cameras and music / musical instruments are allowed ( False )
- The Amish are “ peaceful gentle folk ” ( False )
What were the positives of growing up Amish ?
- Growing up bilingual ( Though I did n’t become fluent in English until after I escaped and I was always very self - conscious about my command of the English language )
- The emphasis on the solidarity of the extended family unit
- The emphasis on being hospitable to strangers , helping those in need , whether Amish or “ English ” ( anyone who ’s not Amish is “ English , ” no matter what language or culture he / she represents )
- Building your own houses , growing your own food , sewing your own clothes
These experiences taught me self - reliance , self - preservation , and gave me the ability to relate to non-American familial cultures much better than I might otherwise .
The biggest negatives ?
- The rape , incest and other sexual abuse that run rampant in the community
- Rudimentary education
- Physical and verbal abuse in the name of discipline
- Women ( and children ) have no rights
- Religion–and all its associated fear and brainwashing –as a means of control ( and an extremely effective means at that )
- Animal abuse
I consider these negatives as personal positives in a somewhat perverted or distorted way .
Without having experienced what I did , I would n’t be the person I am today , shaped by the experiences I ’ve had since .
I always tell people that I ’m thankful for having grown up Amish but that I ’d never wish it upon anyone else .
What had you want to escape ?
For as long as I can remember , I had always envisioned a life such that would n’t be compatible with the Amish religion and lifestyle .
I loved learning , and cried when I could n’t go back to school the fall after graduating from Amish 8th grade .
The Amish do not send their children to formal schooling past 8th grade .
A Supreme Court case prevented forcing Amish children into high school on grounds of religious freedom .
I knew that , by US law , I was n’t considered an adult until eighteen .
I did n’t want to wait until then to go to high school .
For four years , I tried to come up with a way that I could leave before turning eighteen without my parents being able to take me back , so I could go to school .
People generally have a peaceful image of the Amish .
Can you explain the physical abuse ?
The Amish take the Bible verse “ spare the rod and spoil the child ” in a literal sense .
Parents routinely beat their children with anything from fly swatters , to leather straps ( the most typical weapon ) , to whips ( those are the most excruciating of ) , to pieces of wood .
When I was a little girl , my mom used to make me run down to the cellar to retrieve a piece of wood to get beaten with .
I ’d choose the thinner ones because I thought they ’d hurt less .
One day I could n’t find a thin piece and I had to get a thicker one .
Luckily , I discovered that the thick ones hurt less .
So every time after that , I ’d get a thick one .
It made her feel like she was hurting me more , and I ’d scream harder just to make sure she did n’t catch on that it actually hurt less .
One of my acquaintances stuttered when he was little and his dad would make him put his toe under the rocking chair , and then his dad would sit in the chair and rock over the toe and tell him that ’s what he gets for stuttering .
Even little babies get abused for crying too much during church or otherwise “ misbehaving . ”
I ’ve heard women beat their babies — under a year old — so much that I cringed in pain .
How did this all culminate for you prior to the escape ?
My dad was a hunter and taught me to shoot .
One evening after eighth grade , when I was fourteen , I came back from target practice in our field .
The sun was just setting and I paused for a moment on a little knoll just below the house to enjoy the view .
I had just gotten done with a good practice shooting , and I remember that the thought suddenly struck me : today would be a good day to die .
I had n’t gotten beaten by my mom that day , and we had n’t had any significant arguments over anything .
I thought that if I died , I wanted to die without being mad at my mom .
So I thought , I might as well take the opportunity to do so before I got back to the house — at which point who knows whether there would be another fight or a beating .
I put a bullet in the chamber and raised the rifle up .
The closer it got to my head , the faster my heart beat .
I was taught that whoever committed suicide would go to hell .
But I was so miserable in the Amish culture that I believed God would understand that my motives were good .
In the end , I did n’t have the guts to point the barrel straight at my head .
Okay , I thought , I ’ll just put the gun next to my cheek to see what it feels like .
The instant I felt that cold hard steel , I suddenly realized that I wanted to live .
I had never had that thought before in my life .
I had always thought I wanted to die .
I do n’t know where the idea came from that I wanted to live , but it completely changed my outlook on life .
Just remembering the feel of that cold steel still makes me shudder .
It was an instant flash of revelation — one that appeared and disappeared just as quickly .
But in that moment , I realized that I truly wanted to be alive , that someday I ’d be happy , and that I must be destined for something better in life — or surely I would n’t have gotten a crazy thought like wanting to live .
I branded that thought and feeling into my head .
I told myself never to forget it , that no matter how depressed or how much I might want to kill myself in the future , even if I do n’t have that same feeling again about wanting to live , I still should n’t kill myself because there was a better life in store for me .
At that point , I knew I had to escape .

It has been a long - held dream of New Yorkers of a certain ( greenish ) stripe : the streets of Manhattan free of cars .
Now , for a few hours , on a few streets , on a few weekends this summer , that dream will become reality .
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Monday that he will create a car - free zone on three Saturdays in August , along a 6.9 - mile stretch of streets through Manhattan , from the Brooklyn Bridge , north to Park Avenue and the Upper East Side .
Cars , trucks and buses will be banned on the streets along the route from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Aug. 9 , 16 and 23 .
The mayor was careful to describe the initiative , called Summer Streets , as an experiment .
“ If it works , we ’ll certainly consider doing it again , ” Mr. Bloomberg said , at a news conference in the East Village on Lafayette Street , which will be included in the route .
“ If not , we wo n’t .
But we have never been afraid to try new ideas , especially the ones that have the potential to improve the quality of life . ”
The route will run north - south along Centre Street , Lafayette Street , Fourth Avenue and Park Avenue to 72nd Street .
The southern half of 72nd Street from Park Avenue to Fifth Avenue will also be shut to vehicles , to link to Central Park .
“ It ’s kind of surreal , ” said Gaines , who was on the 1984 United States Olympic team with Torres .
He chuckled .
“ It ’s like , how is this old lady doing these times ? ” he said .

In 1996 , Gaines and Torres were at the trials on broadcasting assignments .
They worked out side by side in the competition pool between sessions .
After watching Torres prevail in a preliminary heat that included two teenagers already on the Olympic team , Katie Hoff and Allison Schmitt , Gaines said , “ It definitely brings a lot of memories back . ”
With every turn of her head , Torres was triggering her own flashbacks .
Before she stepped on the starting block for her morning race , Torres glanced to her left and grinned at Jeannine Dennis , a starter she recognized from her Southern California age - group days .
“ I just smiled like , here we are again , 24 years later , ” Torres said , laughing .
If Torres can make her fifth Olympic team , she will accomplish something that swimmers half her age have not been able to do .
She will deflect some of the spotlight from Michael Phelps , who is bidding to eclipse Mark Spitz as the most decorated athlete in an Olympics .
In 2000 , Torres came out of retirement to swim on two victorious relays at the Sydney Olympics .
At 33 , she was the oldest swimming gold medalist for the United States .
After that , she married and divorced , met her current partner , David Hoffman , became pregnant , gave birth to her daughter , Tess , now 2 , and resumed swimming .
Ask Torres why she has returned to high - level competition , and the simple answer is because she can .
Her coach , Lohberg , added : “ And let ’s not forget this .
She ’s nuts . ”
Torres ’s comeback does not seem the least bit crazy when you look at the rapt faces of the mothers and aunts in the Qwest Center audience when Torres is swimming .
It is as if they are looking at her and seeing a vision of middle age that society has long been blind to : the matron as a model .

The new Gem Dependencies of Rails 2.1 give developers an easier - than - ever ability to keep track of and maintain the various library dependencies inherent with any project .
However , a much - overlooked additional feature of the Gem Dependencies is the ability to package traditional Rails plugins as a gem and have them hooked in properly .
This article is designed as an introduction to how to write and use plugins as gems in Rails projects .
The Basics
The basic method by which this is achievable is that any plugin included through a config.gem command will automatically have the gem - packed file rails / init.rb run upon Rails ’s initialization .
All it takes is a little bit of effort , and any Rails plugin can be packaged as a gem and easily depended upon through gem dependencies .
You may be wondering why this is a “ big deal . ”
Plugins are already dead simple to install in Rails ( and you can even script / plugin install straight from Git now ! ) , why do we need GemPlugins ?
It ’s simple , really : RubyGems are a rock - solid established way of easily distributing versioned reusable bits of code .
Using gems for plugins allows for a greater standardization of the way in which plugins are maintained and distributed , as well as a simple path for version - locking to ensure compatibility with legacy code etc .
Another reason that GemPlugins are important is that they provide a level of abstraction from Rails : by releasing a gem rails / init.rb you could also use the same exact code to release a Merb plugin or any other framework that supports gemified add - ons .
I think you will begin to see a number of cross - framework plugins be developed as Rails gets some company and shares alike .
Using a GemPlugin
First , let ’s go through the process required to use an existing gem plugin .
I ’m going to be using my Acts As Taggable
On plugin as an example throughout because I just recently went through the process of making it available as a gem .
First , you will need to include the dependency in your environment.rb file .
I ’m assuming here that most plugins are going to be hosted on GitHub , but the same should be true for any gem source .
# in environment.rb config.gem " mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on " , : source => " http://gems.github.com " , :lib => " acts-as- taggable -on " 1 # in environment.rb config.gem " mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on " , : source => " http://gems.github.com " , :lib => " acts-as-taggable-on "
This is the standard usage of gem dependencies , and for more info on this you can see Ryan Daigle ’s post or watch the RailsCast on the subject .
Now assuming that you do n’t already have the gem in question installed , it ’s simple to grab it :
rake gems : install 1 rake gems : install
This will automatically install any gem dependencies in your project , and will tell you what ’s happening the same as if you had run gem install from the command line .
That ’s it !
Once you have successfully installed the necessary gem , you can simply start up your Rails server and the plugin will be loaded and initialized as though it were living in your vendor / plugins directory .
Now that you know how to use a GemPlugin , I ’ll show you how you can take an existing plugin and gemify it quickly and painlessly .
Making a GemPlugin
Let ’s say I have a plugin called awesome_fu that lives on GitHub at mbleigh / awesome - fu .
I ’ve already released this plugin , it works great , and now I want to make it compatible with GemPlugins .
First , let ’s create a gemspec called awesome - fu.gemspec in line with the requirements for the GitHub Gem Repository .
In order to make the file list , I usually find it ’s easiest to “ find ** ” in the plugin directory , then copy it into TextMate , make the modifications I need for manifest ( using a regular expression to quote each of the files ) , and saving it in the spec .
If you have only a few files in your plugin , it may be easier just to add them by hand .
Next we need to add rails / init.rb .
This is a little bit troublesome , because we still want our plugin to work if installed through the traditional method , so we also need init.rb to run the same code ( this is automatically fine in edge Rails ) .
What I did for my plugin is copy all of my init.rb code into rails / init.rb and then change init.rb to the following :
require File.dirname(__FILE__ ) + " / rails / init " 1 require File .
dirname ( __FILE__ ) + " /rails / init "
Now they both run the same code without any kind of replication , great !
This means that now I have set up my plugin to work equally as a GemPlugin or a traditional plugin with just a couple minutes of work .
All that ’s left to do is switch on the RubyGem setting for my GitHub project , update the README , and push !
Now anyone will be able to easily require the plugin as a gem dependency and you will get all of the accolades associated with releasing your plugin the “ new and hip ” way .
Caveat Coder
No part of the world , not even the United States , has been more deeply affected by George W. Bush ’s presidency than the Middle East .
From the lofty goals of starting a “ democratic revolution , ” making a “ new Middle East , ” and helping the Palestinians to have their own independent state , to the bogus “ war on terror , ” invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , and meddling in Lebanon , Bush ’s Middle East policy has been simply one disaster after another .
The reality is that the Middle East is of utmost strategic importance to the U.S. U.S. involvement in that region will not end after Bush leaves office in January 2009 .
Therefore , as the president ’s second term is coming to an end , it is important to consider the results of his Middle East policy , with the hope the next president will learn valuable lessons from Bush ’s many blunders and devise a more constructive Middle East policy .
So let us consider his legacy .
Iraq
If there is one minor positive outcome of Bush ’s Middle East policy , it has to be the removal of Saddam Hussein and his Ba’ath Party from power .
But at what price ?
Iraq has effectively been partitioned among the Shi’ites , Sunnis , and Kurds .
Iraq became a vast training ground for extremists from Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , Pakistan , and Kuwait .
Iraq ’s infrastructure has been damaged greatly .
It would take decades to put Iraq back to where it was before the war .
Much of Iraq ’s cultural heritage was looted from museums .
Iraqi prisoners were tortured at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere .
Two million Iraqis have left their country .
Clearly , they are the highly educated ( at least 3,000 of them professors ) , professionals , and the affluent , and , therefore , their departure is a great brain drain .
Proportionally , it would be equivalent to 24 million Americans leaving the U.S. Close to 2.5 million Iraqis have been displaced within Iraq .
Proportionally , it would be equivalent to 30 million American refugees within the U.S.
As many as 1.1 million Iraqis may have been killed .
Proportionally , it would as if over 13 million Americans had been killed , a staggering number .
Notable among the dead are at least 230 Iraqi professors , with another 60 missing , presumably dead .
At least 1 million Iraqi children have become orphans .
Seventy percent of Iraqi children suffer from mental stress disorder .
Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University , the 2001 Nobel laureate in economics , and Linda Bilmes of Harvard University estimated that the eventual cost of the war may reach $ 2 trillion .
If , for a period of 10 years , the funding for cancer research were doubled , every American with diabetes or heart disease were treated , and a global immunization campaign that could save millions of children were carried out , the total cost would be about $ 600 billion .
As if the price that the Iraqis have paid so far is not enough , the Bush - Cheney administration has demanded the following in secret “ negotiations ” with Iraq ’s government :
Fifty - eight military bases .
Control of Iraq ’s airspace below 32,000 ft .
The authority to kill or arrest , without Iraq ’s permission , anyone deemed “ hostile . ”
The authority to stage a war against terrorists anywhere from Iraq without Iraq ’s permission .
Full immunity from prosecution in Iraq for the U.S. military and civilian contractors .
The last one the U.S. also demanded of Iran in the early 1960s , which sparked the June 5 , 1963 , uprising in Iran , which eventually led to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 .
As Ayatollah Khomeini said at that time :
" Capitulation means if we kill the dogs that the Americans bring to Iran , we will be jailed , but if they kill us , our spouse , or our children , or destroy our homes , they will not be even prosecuted in Iran . "
Bush ’s Iraq legacy ?
A destroyed country , only nominally unified , and probably a quasi-colony of the U.S. for the foreseeable future .
Afghanistan
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks , there was an ocean of good will toward the U.S. , and great support for destroying al - Qaeda .
What happened ?
Afghanistan was attacked , even though the U.S. knew that the al - Qaeda leadership had already escaped to the border region with Pakistan , and Donald Rumsfeld reportedly said that “ there are n’t any good targets in Afghanistan . ”
The Taliban were overthrown .
But where is Afghanistan now ?
The Taliban are resurgent .
They are gaining ground and the support of the ethnic Pashtuns , and they control most of southern Afghanistan .
Recall that they were despised right before the 9/11 attacks .
At least compared with Iraq , Afghanistan has received a dearth of aid .
It is in turmoil , the best evidence of which is the assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai and the recent assault by Taliban forces on a prison in Kandahar that freed at least 400 Taliban fighters .
The unemployment rate is at least 60 percent .
Karzai is viewed by many Afghans as the puppet of the U.S. , and this in a nation that has historically had little tolerance for foreigners and their agents .
Opium production , which was banned under Taliban , is thriving .
It supplies 93 percent of the world ’s heroin and 53 percent of Afghanistan ’s GDP .
The government hardly controls anything beyond the capital , Kabul .
The country has been effectively partitioned among warlords .
The number of NATO troops has increased from 20,000 in 2003 to more than 64,000 , including 3,200 new U.S. Marines .
Practically every day innocent civilians are killed by NATO bombing , causing a strong backlash against NATO .
Bush ’s Afghanistan legacy ?
An economic basket case that needs vast amounts of international aid to barely survive and will not be a viable state for decades , if ever .
Pakistan
Since 9/11 , the U.S. has given Pakistan $ 11 billion in aid , in addition to forgiving its previous debts .
Eighty percent of this aid has gone to the military to supposedly fight al - Qaeda .
What has happened ?
Ninety percent of the military aid has been used by Gen. Pervez Musharraf to buy advanced weapons and put them on the Pakistan - India border , one of the most unstable areas in the world , where two nuclear nations are lined up against each other .
Musharraf has , in fact , signed peace agreements with the Taliban ’s sympathizers in the western and northern Pakistan provinces , which means that both the Taliban and al - Qaeda have secure places to train terrorists .
With U.S. consent or at least silence , Musharraf has violated Pakistan ’s constitution repeatedly .
For example , last year he sacked and jailed Pakistan ’s Supreme Court judges who opposed him .
He then appointed new judges who had to swear to loyalty to him rather than Pakistan ’s constitution .
The jailed judges have yet to be released .
The U.S. arranged for Benazir Bhutto to return to Pakistan to give a civilian face to the military dictatorship , without even making sure that she was secure .
She was assassinated .
Bush ’s Pakistan legacy ?
An unstable nuclear nation with a large number of radicals in its military intelligence ( the ISI ) who support the Taliban .
Lebanon
After the assassination of Lebanon ’s former prime minister Rafik Hariri on Feb. 14 , 2005 , and the subsequent Cedar Revolution , Bush pushed for democratic elections in Lebanon .
These were held in spring 2005 , but the results were not to Bush ’s liking .
Not only did Hezbollah receive a significant fraction of the votes and send 14 representative to the parliament , but its partners in the March 8 coalition also received significant votes , and Hezbollah joined the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in July 2005 .
Condoleezza Rice ’s “ directed democracy ” project was a failure .
But Bush did not stop meddling in Lebanon ’s affairs .
He constantly provoked Siniora against Hezbollah and its allies , notably Michel Aoun , the Maronite ex-general .
The result : Complete paralysis of the government .
Then came the summer 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel .
Hezbollah began the war , and was rightfully condemned by the world .
But Hezbollah had carried out several such small operations in the past , and each time there was a quick cease - fire .
Not this time .
With strong support by Bush and Cheney , Israel started a full scale war .
Meanwhile , the U.S. prevented the United Nations Security Council from reaching any consensus regarding a cease - fire , buying time for Israel to supposedly crush Hezbollah .
Condi Rice promised a “ new Middle East , ” one in which Hezbollah would be defeated and Iran would be attacked .
Twelve hundred Lebanese ( 1,000 of them civilians ) and over 150 Israelis ( 40 of them civilians ) were killed , and the infrastructure of Lebanon was greatly damaged by Israel ’s bombing .
Hezbollah , however , won the war .
Although a U.S. official told Seymour Hersh that the Israelis viewed Lebanon as " a demo for Iran , ” the Pentagon had to revise its plans for attacking Iran .
After seeing the types of weapons used by Hezbollah , Gen . John Abizaid , then the Centcom commander , said the Iranians “ have given us a hint about things to come . ”
Hezbollah remained intact , its popularity in the Arab world greater than ever before .
This was the second time it had won a war with Israel .
The first time was in 2000 when , after fighting with Israel for 15 years , Hezbollah forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon , which it had occupied since 1982 .
Bush , however , continued his meddling .
He provoked Siniora to sack the security chief of Beirut ’s airport , allegedly a Hezbollah member , and shut down Hezbollah ’s optical communication network , which had played a crucial role in its victory over Israel .
The result : Hezbollah swiftly took over West Beirut and routed forces loyal to Siniora .
It demanded restoration of its communication network , giving the security chief his job back and veto power over all the government ’s decisions .
Siniora had taken action against Hezbollah , counting on U. S. aid .
The aid never came .
Bush blinked .
Siniora blinked .
The result : Hezbollah got all of its demands and more .
Michel Suleiman , a general with whom Hezbollah has good relations , is now the president .
Hezbollah is more powerful than ever .
Bush ’s Lebanon legacy ?
An organization that the U.S. has labeled as terrorist has won impressive strategic victories over both the U.S. and Israel and is in the driving seat .
Iran
Iran provided significant help to U.S. forces when it attacked Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 .
It opened its airspace to U.S. aircraft and provided intelligence on the Taliban forces .
The opposition forces that it had been supporting for years , the Northern Alliance , were the first to reach Kabul and overthrow the Taliban government .
Then , during the UN talks on the future of Afghanistan , after the Taliban ’s ouster , in Bonn , Germany , in December 2001 , Iranian representative Mohammad Javad Zarif met daily with U.S. envoy James Dobbins , who praised Zarif for preventing the conference from collapsing because of last - minute demands by the Northern Alliance [ .pdf ] .
Thus , the National Unity government led by Karzai could not have come to power without Iran ’s help .
How was Iran rewarded ?
Two months later , President Bush made Iran a charter member of his imaginary “ axis of evil . ”
Then , in early May 2003 Iran made a comprehensive proposal to the U.S. , offering to negotiate on all important issues , recognizing Israel within its pre-1967 war borders , and cutting off material support to Hamas and Hezbollah .
The proposal was never taken seriously .
What have been the results of Bush ’s belligerence toward Iran and his constant demonizing of that nation ?
Iranians saw the double standards when the U.S offered security guarantees and aid to North Korea and advanced nuclear technology to India , but only sanctions and threats to Iran .
Thus , in 2005 they elected Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who had run on a platform partly based on standing up to the U.S. Despite all the declarations that Bush has made against Iran ’s nuclear program , the fact remains that Iran has made far more progress in its nuclear program during his presidency than in the previous 30 years combined .
This has come about only because Bush has refused to negotiate with Iran without any preconditions .
Because of events in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Lebanon , Iran ’s radicals are actually in the driving seat , and their popularity in the Islamic world is higher than ever .
The hardliners have used Bush ’s idiotic proclamations of support for the reformists to label them as U.S. agents , and they have taken advantage of his threats against Iran to try to suppress the democratic movement .
Bush ’s Iran legacy ?
A nation on the verge of achieving uranium enrichment and becoming a regional power .
Palestine / Israel
When Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001 , the Israelis and the Palestinians were tantalizingly close to a peace agreement .
Today , the probability of peace is practically nil .
No other U.S. president has supported Israel as blindly and one - sidedly .
He is also the first U.S. president who actually recognized Israel ’s policy of building and annexing settlements in the West Bank , giving Israel a secret letter committing the U.S. to such a policy .
With Bush ’s support , Israel “ evacuated ” Gaza but created the largest jail on Earth : Gaza ’s land , sea , and air borders are all controlled by Israel .
It attacks Gaza at will , and when it kills innocent women , children , and old men , what does Bush say ?
“ Israel must defend itself . ”
Bush and Rice pushed for democratic elections among Palestinians .
The radicals actually wanted such elections too !
What happened ?
The elections were held and certified as democratic by Jimmy Carter , but Hamas won .
It received more votes than any other group , including Fatah , and took control of the Palestinian parliament .
As usual , Rice was shocked .
“ Nobody saw it coming , ” she declared .
( No secretary of state has made more trips to Israel and Palestine than Rice without having anything to show for it . )
So what happened ?
Instead of trying to work with Hamas , which has never been a threat to the U.S. , Bush began punishing the Palestinians by cutting off all aid and pressuring others to follow the U.S. lead .
Hamas responded to this by routing the Fatah forces in Gaza , taking full control there .
Bush has paid lip service to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state .
In his recent speech before the Knesset , Israel ’s parliament , Bush promised the Palestinians that they would have a state of their own “ over the next 60 years . ”
Some promise .
Bush ’s Israel / Palestine legacy ?
Peace between Israel and the Palestinians is more farfetched than ever .
The Middle East
In addition to all the above , here is the rest of Bush ’s legacy in the Middle East :
When Bush was elected , the price of oil was about $ 35 / barrel .
Today it is close to $ 140 .
Roughly half of the oil price is due to political reasons , the most important of which is the instability in the Middle East , caused by Bush ’s wars and threats of war .
When the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened , there was much sympathy for the U.S. in the Islamic world .
Today , the U.S. is despised in much of the Islamic world .
When Bush was elected , the U.S. and Iran had a chance for reconciliation , after Madeleine Albright ’s speech of April 2000 , which expressed regrets for the CIA ’s role in the 1953 coup in Iran .
Today , there is no such chance for reconciliation until at least after Bush leaves office .
Bush was elected only eight months after the Iranian reformists had taken control of Iran ’s parliament in the March 2000 elections , and only seven months after then - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had talked about " strong winds of change " in Iran .
The reformists ’ victory , together with the election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997 , had generated considerable discussions and soul - searching among the Arab nations of the Middle East about the need for reforms in their countries .
In fact , some of them , such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Jordan , had begun moving cautiously toward reforms .
But after 9/11 and Bush ’s " war on terror , " all the cautious moves toward reform were halted .
The regimes of these nations chose instead to hide behind the " war on terror " and justify the repression of their citizens .
Bush still refuses to face the realities of the mess that he has created in the Middle East .
His overall Middle East legacy is EFP , explosively false propaganda , through which he still tries to sell his fantasies to the public .
Yes , Mr. President , contrary to what you said recently , there is such a thing as “ objective short - term history , ” and you have failed its test miserably .

[ UPDATE 3 p.m. : President Bush took a different approach to easing the energy gap today , ending a presidential moratorium on drilling for oil on the outer continental shelf of the United States .
Yet again , it seems the political imperatives surrounding high energy prices are trumping building climate concerns and the inevitable need for a shift away from fossil fuels . ]
Joe Romm , the former Energy Department official who now blogs on climate and works for the Center for American Progress , a nonpartisan / liberal / progressive ( depending on who ’s choosing the adjective ) research group in Washington , has again taken issue with something I ’ve written , partly because I left out a link to supporting sources for my statement that the world could face a tripled demand for energy by midcentury .
I ’ve posted a link with my response ( and supporting link ) on his blog , and add a few more links and voices below — all of which illustrate that the world faces a glaring energy gap , presuming its leaders take their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions even a tiny bit seriously .
I ’ve focused a lot of late on the decline in government - supported basic energy research and development ( here and everywhere else outside of Japan ) , even as many experts say a big increase is both vital and affordable .
Among those who have called for a government - driven “ innovation revolution ” including a doubling of federal energy research is John Podesta , Mr. Romm ’s boss at the Center for American Progress .
Here ’s what I wrote back to Mr. Romm on Climateprogress.org ( he ’s followed up there , as well ) :
Here ’s the keystone line from one of a series of papers on this energy gap by Hoffert et al ( Science , 2002 ) , John Holdren ( pdf ) , and others : “ Mid-century primary power requirements that are free of carbon dioxide emissions could be several times what we now derive from fossil fuels ( ~10 [ to the 13th power ] watts ) , even with improvements in energy efficiency . ”
The details are in the Science paper .
And when I talk about “ energy options , ” unlike you , I include the developing world — where kids hike an hour in Guinea to do their homework in an airport parking lot .
I do agree with you , Joe , that — over all — the main impediment to progress on energy ( with climate benefits coming as well ) is social and political , not technological .
But the lack of options is real , whether on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa or in countries seeking primary power sources that do n’t come with vastly increased CO2 emissions ( or a slippery grid to move intermittent power around ) .
Whether humanity ’s energy thirst in 2050 is at the high end of “ several times what we now derive from fossil fuels ” or the low end ( merely twice as much energy ) is almost immaterial .
Almost all the experts I ’ve talked to in 20 years of exploring the entwined climate and energy challenges agree that satisfying global energy demand while limiting human influence on climate will require revolutionary advances in both policy and technology .
Mr. Romm is among those who agree this is not an either / or debate .
The debate is over emphasis .
Mr. Romm and many environmental campaigners and energy entrepreneurs say that markets , laws , public campaigns and leadership can prompt the technological transformation , and that government research money has mainly been a distraction and a delaying device promoted by industries or political operatives wedded to fossil fuels .
Whatever the merits of that debate , there sure are a lot of seasoned experts in energy technology and economics ( Daniel Nocera at M.I.T. , Jeffrey Sachs at Columbia ) who insist that climate stability will not happen without a huge increase in direct spending for R.&D. along with everything else .
In the end , there are two means of speeding the move away from climate - warming energy choices , as Daniel Schrag of Harvard has explained here before : boosting the public will to act ( and accept the costs of the energy - technology transition ) or eliminating the cost difference between polluting and nonpolluting energy choices .
The latter can happen by making clean - energy technologies cheaper and / or by making climate - warming technologies more expensive ( through a tax or cap ) .
Below in the comment string I ’ll be adding more expert views on the role of basic research in propelling the energy transformation that governments , on paper at least , have pledged to pursue in the next two generations .
Of course I want your view there , too .
A big increase in research would be part of what I have characterized as “ the energy quest ” — from the wall outlet to the laboratory to the classroom to the boardroom — that many experts say would be needed to have a planet - wide overhaul of a fossil - based energy system that has taken two centuries to build .
Discounting the research imperative , these experts say , discounts the reality that even if the world ’s most polluting countries somehow magically adhere to the nonbinding climate pledges made last week , that is only the first step toward limiting risks from what could well be ( if worst - case projections hold ) centuries of shifting climate patterns and retreating coasts .
Taiwan Really Understands Workplace Perks
Some jobs come with great benefit packages and others are are just fun .
At least one work place was able to get the male employees cardiovascular systems jumping .
The Audrey Underwear Company in Taizhong City , Taiwan , named November 21 “ Camisole Day ” in order celebrate record sales .
Much to the delight of their male employees , all 500 female employees were encouraged to wear lingerie to work to celebrate .
More than 90 % of the female employees went along with the idea and worked all day in their undies .
The company PR manager , Huang Bihui , stated “ We introduced eight new camisoles into market and sold more than 20,000 in less than two months so we named the 21st as Camisole Day . ”
Zhang Yufeng , 32 , a mother of two , admitted : “ I have been on a strict diet to get ready for the day .
When I was trying on my outfit at home , my husband told me I should dress like this every day . ”
And Liao Wenshen , 30 , added : “ The men were red - faced all day , and were becoming so polite to us .
It ’s so funny ! ”
There have been critics , but company lawyers assert that as long as participation was voluntary , it ’s not illegal .
Wu Juanyu complained : “ Some women may feel forced to join in because of peer pressure and job competition .
I do n’t know if the company is selling underwear or women ’s bodies . ”
The only perk I ever had at work was a 401K .

Ms. Lagarde ’s comments echoed remarks last week by Britain ’s foreign secretary , David Miliband , who urged America ’s presidential candidates to stay committed to free trade .
Both contenders for the Democratic nomination , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , have vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement .

Ms. Lagarde said the euro ’s surge against the dollar and the Chinese yuan was “ not helpful  it ’s a major misalignment . ”
“ A rebalancing of currencies would be good for all economies , ” she added .
That view is increasingly shared by countries in the Group of 7 , she said .
Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the United States Treasury secretary , “ is sincere when he says he wants a strong dollar ” and has been taking actions quietly in the mortgage markets to reduce the impact of the subprime crisis , she said .
France has lobbied for lower interest rates among countries using the euro and has suggested that the European Central Bank broaden its mandate to include bolstering economic growth , beyond its goal of controlling inflation .
While Ms. Lagarde said that the bank ’s president , Jean - Claude Trichet , was right to be concerned about inflation , she said he was “ overly focused ” on it .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has not yet discussed his specific objectives when France assumes the presidency of the European Union on July 1 .
Ms. Lagarde declined to give details about her aims .
But she said she hoped to forge a consensus on a stricter rule book in the banking and insurance sector , including “ coordinated supervision ” across the 27 - member bloc .
Written on 6/06/2008 by Abhijeet Mukherjee , of Jeet Blog
Since there are different needs for everyone planning to go on a vacation , there are huge number of websites on the internet offering different solutions to those needs .
Today I decided to pick seven such general websites which can be of immense help to a traveler , irrespective of his travel destination .
1 : WikiTravel
WikiTravel , like Wikipedia , is a user - powered travel guide offering thousands of articles , reviews , pictures , etc. , of different travel destinations around the world .
Since it is user - powered , you will find both positive and negative reviews of places .
Hence this can be useful if you want to check out merits and demerits of your travel destination , in terms of different aspects like weather , transport , locations etc .
2 : Google Maps
Google Maps undoubtedly is a must - have resource for a person planning to go on a vacation .
Apart from giving accurate directions from one point to other , it also locates the local businesses and hot - spots like restaurants , theaters , malls , etc. , on the map .
You can take printouts of the various maps , before you travel .
3 : Kayak / Sidestep
As I mentioned , there are lot of websites offering you various deals and travel packages .
So how do you figure out which are the best deals on hotels , flights , cruises , lodgings or rental - cars ?
That ’s when Kayak or Sidestep come into picture .
Both the sites act as travel search engines and let you find the best deals by searching through hundreds of travel sites .
4 : Lonely Planet / iExplore
Both Lonely Planet and iExplore have extensive information about the various regions of the world including minute details such as a Chinese restaurant in a particular locality in a city .
They offer travel guides , videos , pictures , facts , figures and a lot more .
Another nice feature is that they have forums and communities , where you can ask your travel related questions and get relevant answers from other members .
You could also find a fellow traveler through these sites and probably team - up with him .
5 : Airlinemeals.net
If you travel a lot on airplanes then you must be one of those who are concerned about the meals airlines offer and usually tend to choose a particular airline over another due to the fact that it offers better meals .
Airlinemeals .net is an amazing website which has a huge collection of information about meals provided by different airlines around the globe .
It is user - contributed and you ’ll find thousands of images of different meals on different flights .
You will also find meal details based on the airline , the class , the flight and if you browse further , you can find special meals , crew meals and almost every thing which can relate to an airline meal .
Worth browsing .
6 : Weather.com
The details about the weather of a particular region are not difficult to find on the internet and many websites offer that .
However weather .com goes one step ahead and shows weather forecast for a particular city for the very next day and up to 10 days and also provides further details about the climate .
So you may want to check this website before you leave in order to be prepared for that sudden change in weather of your travel destination .
7 : Google local search
No matter how many websites you browse through , there may be some questions in your mind about your vacation , which remain unanswered and unexplained .
Hence , last but not the least , mighty Google is always there to the rescue .
Just do a Google search for that particular city and browse through the results .
I am sure you ’ll find what you were looking for .
I hope the above websites help you in planning your trip in a better manner and let you have a great vacation .

The Cost of Being Overweight
Are you overweight ?
Then you could be paying more to be this way .
Lose weight to improve your health and your finances .
To find out if you ’re overweight , try out this BMI calculator .
While most of us understand that being overweight is bad for our health , the fact that it can also be bad for our wallets is not something that many people consider .
However , recent studies have shown that the overweight are at a definite economic disadvantage , and their employers are too .
With many countries ( like Japan ) moving to regulate the size of waistlines in an attempt to save money , it has suddenly become very important to lose weight .
Let ’s look at just a few of the ways that being overweight can affect your wallet , and what you could be doing with that money instead .
# 1 Life Insurance Premiums
People who are overweight typically have to pay life insurance premiums that are twice to four times as expensive as the average person .
Over time , this can add up to thousands of dollars .
Life insurance is already expensive enough , and if losing weight can help you save money on your premiums , now is the time to get fit .
The cost of insurance goes up every year , and if your waistline is also expanding , you could be in for some serious fees .
# 2 Health Insurance Premiums
According to Business
Week , employers pay more for their overweight employee ’s health insurance .
The average extra cost is around $ 2,400 every single year .
If you ’re paying your own insurance premiums , the cost can be even higher , especially if you do n’t have the benefit of a group plan .
The fact is , being overweight does lead to additional health problems and insurance companies need to charge more to cover that eventuality .
Even if you are relatively healthy , on paper , you are a big risk .
# 3 Higher Travel Costs
Most airlines are now charging overweight people for two seats , or even more .
This adds up , especially as rising jet fuel costs are forcing airlines to raise their ticket prices .
It ’s embarrassing enough to have to pay for more than one seat , but if you are doing a lot of travel , you are spending thousands more than you should be every single year .
# 4 Higher Costs for Everything
From clothes to food , overweight people usually end up spending more money for the every day necessities .
Over time , this can really add up , especially if you continue to pack on the pounds .
If for no other reason , this kind of hit to your pocketbook may be what it takes to convince you to lose weight .
When you add up all of these items , it has been found that overweight people spend at least $ 10,000 over the course of their lives than the average person .
What would you do with an additional $ 10,000 , and the longer life span to enjoy it ?
Now , let ’s say that you invested that money — imagine the kind of returns that you could get ?
That kind of cash could mean the difference when it comes to retirement planning or special purchases .
It may be a hard pill to swallow , but being overweight is costly , and for many , the costs are more than just poor health .
Besides , personally I am tired of being overweight …
Are n’t you ?

Introduction
Update : A few words on my programming background .
I 'm most proficient in C and Perl , with C++ coming closely behind .
Additionally , I 've programmed in Ruby , Lisp , Scheme , Matlab and Ada .
More on this here and here .
About 3 weeks ago , I 've decided to give Python a try .
During this time I have been intensively learning and using Python , so now I 'm ready to give a list of my initial impressions .
First , a word on my learning process .
Python is a mature and useful language , so from the start I decided not only to play around , but to take it quite seriously .
So , apart from reading the official Python tutorial and most of the free online book Dive into Python I spent a lot of time actually using Python , both for writing test scripts that display various features I might need and useful programs , both at work and home .
Here 's a rough list of the code I 've written to get familiar with Python , in no particular order :
Accessing Windows DLLs from Python code
GUIs with wxPython
Tools for working with files , paths and directories
Code involving threads and sockets
Various scripts to test how Python finds its modules and packages
Used py2exe to package scripts as self - contained .exe files
I 've also written a couple of non -toy applications that actually do something useful :
wxPyTris – a Tetris clone
A simple GUI that can work as a XML - RPC client or ( threaded ) server
that can work as a - RPC client or ( threaded ) server A netlist / pinlist comparison utility useful for my work .
I had it previously written in Perl , but now I 've written a more feature - complete version in Python with a wxPython GUI
In total , I think I 've written at least 3 K lines of Python code and read a lot of documentation , newsgroup posts and tutorials .
I 'm still far from being proficient in Python , but I can now use it quite effectively .
My Python impressions
The impressions are divided to positive and negative , and inside each section there 's no particular order .
What I like about Python
Significant indentation is actually a pretty good thing .
Since I always pedantically indent my code anyway , I do n't find it to be an impediment .
On the contrary – it has some very desirable features : much less punctuation to type ( braces , begin / end , etc. ) , and code written by others is usually easier to understand , because Python forces it to be structurally cleaner .
In a way , Python is openly supported by a large company that uses it extensively – Google .
This means that there are a few smart people who get paid to develop and improve Python .
For example Guido Von Rossum , the Python creator , works on Python in Google .
I heard that the " release manager " for Python 2.6 also works for Google .
This is important : while enthusiasts can create great tools in their free time , my experience tells me that to really perfect a tool , consistently , it is important for some people to earn their living from working on it .
The Python community does n't treat Windows as a Nth- priority platform .
All modules I 've seen so far come with easy installers for Windows that just work .
This is very important for me , as 95 % of my work is being done on Windows .
The documentation is very good
PyCrust is a very helpful tool
wxPython – very mature and easy to use .
The wxPython demo is amazing .
Everything works very quickly , with beautiful native GUIs .
wx
Python is so good that most open - source Python IDEs seem to be written in pure Python + wxPython
Convenient built - in named arguments
Docstrings
The in operator
operator List comprehensions
Chained comparisons in expressions : ( 1 < x < 4 ) instead of ( x > 1 and x < 4 ) .
Remember that this feature really shines when you replace x by self.server.count_connections ( ) :-)
instead of .
Remember that this feature really shines when you replace by :-)
Batteries included – the Python standard library has a lot in it , and this is a very good thing , especially when you want to quickly distribute your scripts to coworkers who have no idea about Python .
The way the print function works is quite convenient – it adds spaces between its arguments and a newline at the end , and thus saves boilerplate typing when debugging .
And let 's face it , print in Python is used mainly for debugging anyway ( files are written with the write ( ) method of file objects ) .

And let 's face it , in Python is used mainly for debugging anyway ( files are written with the method of file objects ) .
Python has native threads !!
Although some restrictions on multi-CPU concurrency are imposed by the GIL , I understand that this can be solved in most cases .
A nice feature of native threads is that waiting for a system call in one thread does n't block the other threads ( which happens with Ruby 's green threads ) .

Excellent support for loading C/C++ DLLs .
The standard ctypes module is very convenient and easy to use .
What I do n't like about Python
Python does n't have a large index of modules like Perl 's CPAN .
There 's PyPi , but it appears to be both less complete and less universally used than CPAN .

len( ) is a function and not a method of string .
In general , Python is less consistent in this respect than , say , Ruby .
Some operations are functions ( len , dir ) , some built - in statements ( del ) and some object methods ( reverse , append , etc . )

Some operations are functions ( , ) , some built - in statements ( ) and some object methods ( , , etc. ) string 's join method is OK , but why not also add a join method to a list .
It is more elegant to write [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . join ( ' , ') than to write ' , '.join [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]

It is more elegant to write than to write
The syntax for a single - item tuple is a parsing - imposed ugliness , akin to the need to separate the closing '>'s in C++ nested templates .
Lack of the ability to use ?
and ! in identifiers .
I came to like the Ruby way of naming predicates and destructive functions , and with Python I 'm back to the C++/ Perl dilemmas of is Empty vs. empty vs. emptyp , etc. instead of the elegant empty ?
vs. vs. , etc. instead of the elegant
The unless keyword is sorely missing
keyword is sorely missing " Batteries included " also has a downside – there are a lot of clutter and deprecated libraries .
While it 's good for keeping backwards compatibility , for new users this is a bit inconvenient , because you 're not always sure what to use .
I 'm not particularly fond of the way private methods are called in Python .
while I do n't have a particular problem with methods receiving self and having to use it explicitly ( it allows for some surprising flexibility , especially when passing around methods as callable objects ) , the syntax for private methods is too much on the fingers .
Suppose your class has a private method called Foo. In C++ , you 'd call Foo ( ) from another method in this class .
In Python , you have to bang self .
__ Foo ( ) .
A bit too much .
And while we 're at it , I do n't like those double underscor
Conclusion
All considered , I really like Python .
The cons are mainly nits that are easy to overcome , while the pros are significant .
I 'll continue practicing Python , and will write a more organized review later on .
At one point in The Return of the King , Gandalf tells Pippin :
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant .
The one who will lead Mordor ’s armies in war .
The one they say no living man can kill .
The Witch King of Angmar .
You ’ve met him before .
He stabbed Frodo at Weathertop .
He is the lord of the Nazgul , the greatest of the Nine .
And I thought to myself , “ Oh , you mean that dude they chased away with a torch ? ”
Everyone in these movies talks about the Nazgul like they ’re Jason , the Terminator , and Anton Chigurh rolled into one .
As far as I can tell , they are pretty much useless .
In fact , I think Sauron would have been better off sending a labradoodle , and I ’m going to prove it .
EXAMPLE 1
Frodo senses the Nazgul coming .
He and his friends hide by the side of a road as the black rider approaches .
It proceeds to sniff around right at the edge of the road , unaware that if it moved its head about six inches , it would see Frodo staring at him with his freakishly large eyes .
The hobbits get rid of it by tossing something in the opposite direction and noisily running away .
How a labradoodle would have handled it :
It would have bounded off the road to investigate the Ring - smell , and found Frodo instantly .
And if Sam threw something in the opposite direction , about five seconds later the dog would bring it back to him to throw again .
EXAMPLE 2
The Nazgul has found the Ring .
Frodo and his friends run to a dock and jump on a raft .
The Nazgul skids to a halt and gallops off in search of a bridge .
How a labradoodle would have handled it : Labradoodles love water .
It would have been on that raft before Sam could say , “ Mr. Frodo ! ”
EXAMPLE 3
A group of five Nazgul attack the hobbits on Weathertop .
By “ attack , ” I mean “ very very slowly approach , ” so that Aragorn has plenty of time to come save them .
And I feel like the Nazgul give up a little easily , even considering that Aragorn ranks pretty high on the badass scale .
They ’ve got him outnumbered – ca n’t they all just lunge in at the same time and try to take him out ?
And one of them is supposedly invincible .
Yes , we know it ’s just a cleverly - worded prophesy , but he ’s convinced he ca n’t be killed .
So that guy has no excuse for retreating .
So what if you ’re on fire ?
You ’re invincible !
Stop drop and roll , then grab the ring .
How a labradoodle would have handled it :
Admittedly , the labradoodle would have been at a disadvantage against a dude with a sword .
But at the very least , he ’d leave some toothmarks on Aragorn ’s boots , which is more than the Nazgul accomplish .
EXAMPLE 4
One of the Nazgul , now equipped with a flying mount , catches up with Frodo at Osgiliath .
Frodo stands on a bridge right in the open and actually holds the Ring up .
Ring - taking does not get any easier .
But the Nazgul hovers there for about 30 seconds for no reason .
It ’s finally moving in when the flying thing is hit with a single arrow .
The Nazgul gives up and goes home .
One . Arrow .
How a labradoodle would have handled it :
First of all , the labradoodle would have jumped on Frodo the moment he saw him .
Labradoodles do n’t know the meaning of “ dramatic pause . ”
And a labradoodle with proper training is n’t going to quit just because it gets injured .
Those things are tenacious little buggers .
You know what I think the problem is ?
The Nazgul have spent hundreds of years just sitting around Barad - dûr , nothing to do except play cards .
By the time the Ring is finally discovered , they ’ve gone soft .
They ’re slow , they ’re afraid of water , they ’re afraid of fire , and even their flying rides throw in the towel at the slightest splinter .
Personally , I ’m a lot more scared of Tom Bombadil .
That guy ’s crazy .
He continued : “ I ’m trying to make the best show I can , and on any given day there are 10,000 things I would do differently .
Nobody ever asked me that before . ”

Ms. Pope jumped in with a laugh , “ And we wo n’t let anybody ask that again . ”
But Mr. Kring ’s analysis now is much the same as it was :
The audience got used to the “ adrenalin pace ” from the end of Season 1 , and when Season 2 started with the introduction of still more new characters , the viewers “ lost a bit of patience for the build - up . ”
That has led him to conclude that “ when any new characters come in we need to connect them to the story line and characters they ’re already familiar with . ”
As to the Hiro trip back in time , Mr. Kring acknowledged that “ some people did n’t like that we had separated Hiro from the other characters . ”
And romance ?
“ I had sort of said romance would be a different thing for a show like ours because we have such adrenalin in the storytelling .
It has to be a battlefield romance .
These are things you learn along the way . ”
The long dry spell for original episodes will be less a problem , Mr. Kring said , because of a decision he made at the 11th hour in December .
The original idea for the second volume of last season was for a vial of some deadly plague to be released in the finale of “ Generations , ” setting up eight ( presumably adrenalin - filled ) episodes of the next volume , “ Outbreak . ”
Instead , sensing that a long strike was looming , Mr. Kring , who at 51 is a television veteran , writing for shows like “ Providence ” and creating the crime series “ Crossing Jordan , ” had an inspiration .
He decided to reshoot the ending of “ Generations , ” having the Peter Petrelli character ( played by Milo Ventimiglia ) catch the vial filled with deadly virus just before it was to hit the ground and explode , thus ending that story line and conveniently wiping out the entire next eight - episode story arc .
With that one move two new , fully written and partly shot episodes were scrapped .

2008年の3月にリリースされたgdb-6.8の目玉機能の一つに「C++サポートの強化」があります*1。この機能を使うと、STLやboostのようなテンプレートを使ったコードのデバッグがかなり楽になります。C++使いの方は、是非gdbを6.8にupgradeしましょう。
具体的に、以下のようなコードを使って、「C++サポートの強化」について説明します。
# include < iostream > using namespace std ; template < typename T > class A { public : void func ( ) { cout << sizeof ( T ) << endl ; } } ; int main ( ) {
A< int > integer ; A< double > real ; integer.func( ) ; real.func( ) ; return 0 ; }
このコードに対して、6.7以前のgdbで func( )
にブレークポイントを設定します。test.cppの9行目なので以下のようになります
( gdb ) break test.cpp : 9 Breakpoint 1 at 0x80486fc : file test.cpp , line 9 .
emacs上で gdb を使ってる場合 は
func ( ) の行にカーソルをおいた状態で、c-x SPACE を押す
func ( ) の行の左側をマウスでクリック
のような操作でブレークポイントが設定できます。
ところが従来のgdbではここで問題が生じます。恐ろしいことに、この状態では func ( ) でプログラムがブレークしない場合があるのです。ブレークポイントを設定したのにも関わらずです。
どういうことかというと、それは次のように info breakpoints でブレークポイントの一覧を見るとわかります 。
( gdb ) info breakpoints Num Type Disp Enb Address What 1 breakpoint keep y 0x080486 fc in A <int > :: func ( ) at test.cpp : 9
このように、func ( ) には実体が二つ、つま りA ::func ( ) と A ::func( ) とがあり、ブレークポイントは
A ::func() の方にだけ設定されていたのです。そのため、古いgdbでは
A ::func() ではブレークせずに通過してしまいます。このような恐ろしい罠が以前のgdbにはありました。
gdb-6.8の「C++サポートの強化」とは、この問題を解決するものです。具体的には gdb-6.8 では、同じようにブレークポイントを設定するだけで
( gdb ) b test.cpp : 9 Breakpoint 1 at 0x80486fc : file test.cpp , line 9 . ( 2 locations )
自動的に、実体のある関数すべてにブレークポイントを設定してくれます。
( gdb ) i b Num Type Disp Enb Address
What 1 breakpoint keep y < MULTIPLE > 0x080486fc 1 . 1 y 0x080486 fc in A<int >:: func( ) at test.cpp : 9 1 . 2 y 0x08048728 in A < double >:: func( ) at test.cpp : 9
この機能のおかげで、何も考えずとも毎回ちゃんとfunc()でブレークしてくれます。実に直感的な挙動です。
ついでに 、A ::func()側だけブレークポイントを無効にしたい場合は
( gdb ) disable 1 . 2
とします。詳細は本家のマニュアルをどうぞ。

Earlier in the day , the court ruled 5 - 4 that suspected terrorists held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detention in federal court .
When talking to reporters Thursday afternoon , Graham cautioned that it he was still digesting the decision but said he was “ looking at every way I can to modify this position , ” including fighting to change the statute .
“ The American people are going to wake up tomorrow and be shocked to hear that a member of Al Qaeda has the same constitutional rights as an American citizen , ” said Graham .
“ [ Even ] the Nazis never had that right . ”
Speaking to reporters in Italy , President Bush also said he disagreed with the court ’s ruling , but said he would respect it .
“ We 'll abide by the Court 's decision , ” said Bush .
“ That does n't mean I have to agree with it .
It 's a deeply divided Court , and I strongly agree with those who dissented , and their dissent was based upon their serious concerns about U.S. national security . ”
Bush said he would study the opinion and “ determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate ” in order to protect the American people .
Other prominent Republicans weighed in as well , with nearly all criticizing the decision .
Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) accused the court of " moving the goal posts on what the constitution requires " by changing the existing law regarding the rights of detainees .
" It is up to us now to try and come back and address the court 's concerns , " said Cornyn , who said the decision should prompt Congress to review the Military Commission Act and possibly the Detainee Treatment Act .
That might be a tall order for Senate Republicans , as Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said earlier in the day he sees no need to revisit the two laws in light of the court 's decision .
Other Republicans focused on what the decision might mean for troops on the battlefield .
“ This decision will come at a cost , ” said Rep. Duncan Hunter of California , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee .
“ The Supreme Court just moved us closer to the day when U.S. Marine rifle teams will have to have lawyers read Miranda rights to terrorists captured on the battlefield . ”
DETROIT — Toyota acknowledged Thursday that , like its rival automakers in Detroit , it misjudged the drastic swing in the American market away from larger vehicles .
With sales of pickups and big S.U.V. ’s tumbling , Toyota said it would shut down truck production at two United States plants for three months and consolidate its pickups into one factory next year .
The Japanese automaker also said it would begin making its Prius gas - electric hybrids in a new plant in Mississippi by late 2010 to meet demand for more fuel - efficient vehicles .
“ It shows that Toyota is just as fallible as anybody else , ” said Joseph Phillippi , a principal of AutoTrends Consulting .
“ They ’re human after all . ”

SOUND WAYS FOR PARENTS TO MEET THE BULLY HEAD -ON SOUND WAYS FOR PARENTS TO MEET THE BULLY HEAD -ON
If you 're a parent worried that your child could be cyberbullied , experts say you should follow the basic steps .
Most important , talk to your child .
Make sure he or she is observing online safety rules , such as never giving out personal information .
A child who 's being bullied may exhibit signs such as withdrawing , lethargy , depression , extreme change in behavior and frequent illnesses , says Jodee Blanco , a school consultant and author of two books on bullying .
If the problem is affecting a child in school , talk to the principal , says Nancy Willard , cyberbullying expert and author of Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats .
School administrators should deal with each instance on a case - by - case basis .
Not all experts agree on the perfect remedy .
Punishment is usually appropriate , but some say if not meted out carefully , it can result in the bully taking more revenge on the victim .
But experts do agree that the worst thing to do is to ignore it .
Cyberspace may seem like an abstract concept to older adults , but to kids who have grown up socially networking , it 's an integral and important part of their lives .
By the same token , experts also agree that banishing a victim from websites , computers and cellphones is like banishing them from their world .
Plus , it does n't work .
Corinne David - Ferdon , health scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , suggests teaming up , online and offline , with other parents who can offer help and suggestions .
And if cyberbullying persists , consult experts .

Ricky
Alatorre does n't know which classmate surreptitiously hoisted a cellphone camera and snapped his picture or exactly when it happened .
All Ricky , 16 , knows is the fuzzy yet distinguishable portrait of him in English class showed up on MySpace , on a page that claimed to be his .
And the fake profile , titled " The Rictionary , " not only identified his school but also said Ricky loved dictionaries — a swipe at his school smarts — and was gay ( he 's not ) , one of the most common schoolyard taunts .
Tall , big and bookish , Ricky , who lives on a farm in Lake County , Ind. , had been picked on since he was in kindergarten .
Insults flung in the heat of anger always inflict some pain .
But words — and pictures — posted on the Internet , where they can be seen by anyone , have taken bullying to a whole new level .
" I was completely devastated , " Ricky says .
As younger and more kids get their hands on cellphone and digital cameras and nearly ubiquitous high - speed Internet connections , cyberbullying is ramping up and taking new forms .
No longer are threats , taunts and insults relegated to the written word in chat rooms and instant messages .
Now teens , children and sometimes adults are adding pictures and videos to their bullying arsenal and posting them on sites such as MySpace , Facebook and YouTube , where anyone can see them .
And bullying has led to real consequences — from fights to teen suicides , or what some label " bullycides . "
States are beginning to take action with tough new laws targeting those who use electronic means to bully .
Kids do n't always report it Online harassment of American young people ages 10 to 17 increased 50 % ( from 6 % to 9 % ) from 2000 to 2005 , according to the latest research available , a watershed report by the University of New Hampshire 's Crimes Against Children Research Center .
And the number of young people who said they had " made rude or nasty comments to someone on the Internet " increased from 14 % to 28 % in the same period .
But there has n't been nearly enough research on the subject , says Corinne David - Ferdon , a health scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Compounding the frustration is that children often fail to report bullying .
They fear that tormentors will become angrier and bully them more or worry that if they report being bullied over the Internet or on a cellphone , their phone and Internet privileges will be revoked .
" This is an emerging public - health problem " that needs attention , David - Ferdon says .
The problem gained visibility with news about high school girls getting in trouble after posting school fights on YouTube .
Five girls from Lakeland , Fla. , face charges over an incident March 30 in which they are accused of participating in the beating of a 16 - year - old acquaintance in retaliation for her saying nasty things about them on MySpace .
They videotaped the beating and planned to post it on MySpace and YouTube , says Chip Thullbery , state attorney spokesman in Polk County .
The sheriff decided to release it to deal with news media interest , the Associated Press reported .
" Girlfight " videos have become so ubiquitous that the search term " girlfight " brings up thousands of videos on YouTube .
" You 're bullied twice , " says Nancy Willard , author of Cyber - Safe Kids , Cyber - Savvy Teens and Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats .
" You 're bullied in the real world with a physical attack , and then you 're bullied online with humiliation .
It 's very hurtful .
Very , very hurtful . "
The world sees what is said
In another publicized case , 13 - year - old Megan Meier killed herself in 2006 after receiving devastating messages from someone masquerading as a teen boy who had developed an online relationship with her .
Authorities prosecuted an adult , Lori Drew , 59 , of Dardenne Prairie , Mo. , on charges that she was behind the hoax .
Drew pleaded not guilty last month in Los Angeles federal court .
" Cyberbullying is getting much worse , and it's affecting a lot of kids , " says Bill Bond , a former principal who tours the country speaking to principals about school violence on behalf of the National Association of Secondary School Principals .
" Cyberbullying can be even more destructive " than face - to - face bullying " because you get a sense that the whole world is being exposed to what is being said to you . "
That 's just how Ricky feels .
" When they put it on the Internet , it 's like they took everything and multiplied it by an astronomical number , " he says .
" It 's one thing if it 's a mean thing that somebody put in my school paper because that 's contained within a small area .
Only a certain number of people will see that .
But when you put it on the Internet , you are opening it up to everyone in the world . "
Ricky called his mother the spring day he discovered the profile and had her pick him up from school .
He did n't have many friends to begin with .
But soon he found himself more alone than ever .
" I had thought about suicide , " he says .
" It looked very welcoming at certain times . "
But he says his family is helping him cope .
His mother , Peggy Alatorre , 44 , tells her son he just has to make it through two more years of high school .
But she 's worried .
" Does it hurt him forever ?
You bet .
Ricky has been crushed . "
In the past few months , Alatorre has done everything she could think of to remedy the situation .
She talked to school officials .
She contacted the police , the FBI , local politicians .
" I even e-mailed ( President ) Bush . "
MySpace eventually removed the profile — only after several weeks of pestering the site , she says .
Other than that , " everybody is passing the buck . "
Mike Chelap , assistant vice principal of Lowell High School , where Ricky attends , says he can't discuss personal matters about students , but the school began an anti-bullying program and will implement it in the fall .
Some are fighting back Barbara Paris , now principal of Canyon Vista Middle School in Austin , became an activist against cyberbullying after a girl at another school where she worked had become suicidal after she was the victim of racial and sexual taunts online .
" When … I had a child who was suicidal because of people like me not doing anything about it , I had a paradigm shift right there . "
Politicians are starting to take note .
Thirty - six states have anti-bullying laws , according to Paris ' watchdog group , Bully Police .
And several are specifically starting to address cyberbullying .
On June 30 , Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt signed an anti-Internet harassment law in the wake of Megan Meier 's death .
Also last month , Florida Gov. Charlie Crist signed the Jeffrey Johnston Stand Up for All Students Act .
The tough anti-cyberbullying law came after the 2005 suicide of 15 - year - old Jeffrey , who his mother says had endured three years of torturous harassment over the Internet .
To those who say bullying is just part of childhood , Jeffrey 's mother , Debbie Johnston of Cape Coral , Fla. , says that 's " like saying rape is part of marriage . "
Jodee Blanco , who grew up the victim of bullies , agrees with the sentiment .
An author of two books on her own bullying experience , she now is a consultant who travels the country to talk to schools — including Ricky's .
" It 's not that bullying is any worse today , " she says .
" The impulse for cruelty is the same impulse .
The only difference is that the tools to achieve that have become more sophisticated . "
But all the attention over cyberbullying is " a double - edged sword .
In one respect , America is finally waking up .
And yes , it 's due in large part to the Internet .
The flipside of that is it's also motivating a lot of kids to be meaner .
Because in their minds , it is such a cool tool to show off how mean they can be . "

Jurassic Park comes true :
How scientists are bringing dinosaurs back to life with the help of the humble chicken
Deep inside the dusty university store room , three scientists struggle to lift a huge fossilised bone .
It is from the leg of a dinosaur .
For many years , this chunky specimen has languished cryptically on a shelf .
Interesting but useless — a forgotten relic of a lost age .
Now , with hammer and chisel poised , the academics from Montana State University in America gather round .
They are about to shatter this rare vestige of the past .
Why would they do such a thing ?
Lost age : Scientists now believe it is possible to resurrect the dinosaur after the discovery of DNA relics in the wings and beaks of regular chickens
The answer is that they believe that this single fragment of a beast which stalked the earth untold millions of years ago could hold the key which will unlock the secrets of the dinosaurs .
Extraordinarily , they contend that it could lead to a real life Jurassic Park , where dinosaurs are once again unleashed on the world by scientists .
For just like in the hit Steven Spielberg movie , these men and women are intent on cracking the genetic code of the dinosaurs and opening the possibility of bringing them back to life .
Their remarkable quest will be revealed in a TV documentary , Dinosaurs : Return To Life , to be screened tomorrow .
Critter :
In the Jurassic Park story dinosaurs were recreated using genetic code from mosquitos trapped in amber
It poses the question : will scientists ever be able to resurrect the dinosaur ?
According to Jack Horner , professor of palaeontology at Montana State University , the answer is an unequivocal yes .
He says : ‘ Of course we can bring them back to life .
Their ancestral DNA is still present .
' The science is there .
I do n’t think there are any barriers , other than the philosophical . ’
So just how have these scientists arrived at the point where they believe they might unleash the mysteries of a prehistoric lost world ?
In order to understand their journey , we have to travel back a little less time — to 1992 .
This was when Raul Cano , professor of microbiology at California Polytechnic State University , made the first attempt to extract DNA from insects almost as old as the dinosaurs that had been embedded in amber , a sticky tree sap which hardens into transparent orange stone .
Speculation about this possibility inspired the Jurassic Park story , in which an amber - trapped mosquito which sucked dinosaur blood unleashes its victims ’ genetic code , allowing an obsessed billionaire to clone the species — with terrifying consequences .
In his real - life laboratory , Cano cracked the amber open with freezing cold liquid nitrogen , obtaining a sample of the insect inside .
Amazingly , he soon had a DNA sample from a 40 million - year - old bee .
Soon afterwards , academics at the American Museum of Natural History recovered DNA from an ancient termite .
It seemed that dinosaur DNA could soon be within reach of modern - day scientists .
But these early experiments ended in failure .
The scientists could not replicate their results , leading to the suspicion that the tiny recovered fragments were actually contaminants , perhaps from the researchers ’ hair or clothing .
Fossil find :
The discovery of the thigh bone of a Tyrannosaurus Rex in Montana , USA , revealed patterns only previously found in the bones of pregnant birds
The search for ancient DNA in amber was abandoned , and it seemed that the door to the past remained closed .
Since then however , researchers looking for prehistoric genetic fragments have managed to recover material from a 40,000 - year - old mammoth , and from 45,000 - year - old Neanderthal bones .
But still there were doubts that dinosaur DNA could have survived .
Then , in 2003 , hopes were revived once again .
Horner , who acted as an advisor on the Jurassic Park films , made a remarkable discovery while his team were excavating a 68 million - year - old Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton in Montana .
The site was so remote , the skeleton had to be removed by helicopter — the operation led to a huge thighbone splitting in two .
Horner gave a piece of the bone to one of his students , palaeontologist Mary Schweitzer .
Examining it , she noticed a strange structure inside the hard outer case .
It resembled a pattern found only in the bones of pregnant birds .
Experts say they have the ability to reach back to dinosaurs because their blueprints remains locked in modern - day birds
Puzzled , she asked her research assistant , Jennifer Wittmeyer , to dissolve the outer mineral layer .
Six hours later , there was a knock on the door .
‘ Jennifer ran into the room saying , “ You ’re not going to believe this , ” ’ recalls Schweitzer .
‘ When she picked up a small piece , it stretched and moved all over the place .
' So we knew we had something pretty unusual . ’
The magnitude of the discovery was immediately apparent to the Montana University team — the material appeared to be well preserved flesh from a Tyrannosaurus Rex .
Horner says : ‘ It ’s unimaginable to find soft tissue .
It was just assumed that everything had been fossilised . ’
More extraordinary yet , was the next find in neighbouring parts of the dinosaur bone .
‘ Out popped the blood vessels , ’ says Schweitzer .
‘ I said , “ I do n’t believe it , that ’s not possible ” .
It was one of those goose bump moments . ’
Horner and his team knew that blood vessels should not exist in fossilised bone .
Many scientists believed organic matter from a living thing could not survive more than 100,000 years — let alone 68 million years .
Next came the team ’s attempt to salvage DNA from other bones kept in the university storerooms .
They put the samples they collected under a powerful microscope .
Magnified 4,000 times , tiny structures unlikely to be mineralised fossil material were apparent .
They seemed to be the microscopic cells that built dinosaur bones — called osteocytes .
So far , so good .
But Horner came to believe that his team needed to turn their work on its head if they were to unleash the dinosaur .
Amazing as the discovery of ‘ living ’ dinosaur tissue was , he feared that constructing a complete DNA map from it would be a never ending task .
So he embarked on a new strategy : retro-engineering a bird .
It is generally accepted by palaeontologists that birds are descended from a class of theropod dinosaurs called raptors .
‘ If we want to see a dinosaur in our lifetime , we need to start with a bird and work backwards , ’ says Horner .
‘ As long as birds exist , we have the ability to reach back to dinosaurs . ’
In the 1990s , scientists discovered dinosaurs in China buried in a fine ash .
They were preserved in remarkable detail and bird - like features , including claws and feathers , were recognisable .
Horner believes that a modern bird ’s DNA contains a genetic memory that could be ‘ switched on ’ again , resurrecting long - dormant dinosaur traits .
To make such a creature , he would start with the genome ( the whole hereditary information encoded in the DNA ) of an emu .
‘ Emus have all the features we need in order to make a Velociraptor - sized dinosaur , ’ he says .
‘ If I were to make a dinosaur , that is where I ’d start . ’
Far - fetched as this sounds , his work is supported by other leading academics .
Sean Carroll , a geneticist at the University of Wisconsin , says : ‘ The inventory of genes in a bird would be very similar to the inventory of genes in a dinosaur .
‘ It is differences in the decision - making that takes during development that make the difference between a chicken and a tyrannosaurus . ’
Hans Larsson , a palaeontologist at McGill University in Canada , conducted an experiment in November 2007 into the evolution from dinosaurs ’ long tails into birds ’ short tails more than 150 million years ago .
Looking at a two - day - old chicken embryo , he made an unexpected discovery .
Expecting to see between four and eight vertebrae present in the developing spine , his microscope instead picked out 16 vertebrae — effectively a reptilian tail .
As the embryo developed , the ‘ tail ’ became shorter and shorter , until the young bird hatched with only five vertebrae .
Larsson says of the significance of the find : ‘ For about 150 million years , this kind of a tail has never existed in birds .
' But they have always carried it deep inside their embryology . ’
So , the blueprint for a dinosaur remained locked inside the modern - day bird .
Larsson decided to move from theory to reality .
He wanted to see if he could make a chicken grow a dinosaur ’s tail , turning the clock back millions of years .
Manipulating the genetic make - up , he was able to extend the tail by a further three vertebrae .
Larsson had pinpointed a method for turning on dormant dinosaur genes .
If birds retained a dormant tail imprint , did they still retain a memory of dinosaur teeth ?
In 2005 , Matt Harris and John Fallon , developmental biologists at the University of Wisconsin , noticed something strange while researching mutant chickens .
Harris says : ‘ Looking at an embryonic 14 - day - old head , I came across the beak and these structures that were not supposed to be there . ’
Could they really be teeth ?
Peeling away the beak in this tiny , mutant bird , the academics revealed sabreshaped formations almost identical to embryonic alligator teeth .
Next , Harris and Fallon attempted to trigger the formation of teeth in a normal chicken , by injecting the embryo with a virus designed to ‘ turn on ’ the relevant gene .
It was a long shot .
‘ Making a tooth is complex , ’ says Harris .
‘ So the idea of turning on one gene that might be able to do this in an animal that has n’t made teeth in over 70 million years , was somewhat of a stretch . ’
Examining the growing embryo two weeks later , he called colleagues to look at what had happened .
‘ You could see very clearly paired structures on the lower jaw .
' And so , a normal chicken can actually grow teeth . ’
This was unexpected .
Furthermore , the teeth had the same curved shape as dinosaur
fangs .
Following this , Harris and Fallon began to find other dinosaur traits in the DNA of birds , such as scales .
They looked at an ancient Chinese breed of chicken called a Silkie .
It has primitive plumage similar to that believed to grow on some dinosaurs .
By activating a dormant gene , Harris and Fallon attempted to ‘ trick ’ the chicken ’s leg into growing feathers instead of scales .
It worked — they had uncovered the genetic changes that had taken place as the dinosaur evolved into a bird .
Meanwhile , in Canada , Larsson had found that the three - fingered dinosaur claw structure remains hidden within a bird ’s wing to this day .
‘ The dinosaur fingers are adapted for grasping and snatching prey , ’ he explains .
‘ If we compare this to modern birds , we see the same structures in their wings but adapted for flight . ’
With further research , he believes scientists should be able to transform a bird ’s wing back into a dinosaur arm .
So , will it one day be possible to reverse evolution ?
Mark Westhusin is a world - renowned expert in creating life forms from DNA .
Together with his colleague , Dewey Kramer , at Texas A&M University , he has cloned more species than researchers at any other laboratory , including a White - tailed deer and a Black Angus bull .
Westhusin explains that soon , the relevant DNA to turn back the clock could be manufactured and implanted into an emu egg , for instance , to trigger dormant genes .
‘ We already have small artificial chromosomes that have been put into embryos and develop and divide and express their genes , ’ he explains .
‘ The technology is advancing so fast , in sequencing genes and in putting genes back together , and in manufacturing long stretches of DNA . ’
Larsson now believes that in a hundred years or so , geneticists could retro-engineer animals that appear identical to Mesozoic dinosaurs .
‘ Why ca n’t we take all the genetics , just change it around a little bit , and produce a Tyrannosaurus Rex , or something that looks like one ? ’ he asks .
‘ I think that kind of scenario is quite possible .
Maybe sooner than we think . ’
Fallon agrees , saying : ‘ As we learn more , we ’ll be able to do it .
' The genetic knowledge is in the bird . ’
For his part , Horner imagines creating the first example .
‘ I have to admit that I ’ve certainly imagined walking up on a stage to give a talk , and having a little dino chicken walk up behind me , ’ he says .
‘ That would be kind of cool .
‘ There is now nothing to stop us bringing back dinosaurs but ourselves .
' People who do n’t believe it do n’t know much about evolution . ’
Pausing for a second , he adds : ‘ Whether it is a good idea or not is another question ...’

According to the scientists at the University of Southampton 's School of Electronics and Computer Science ( ECS ) , they are working on creating the smallest high - performance and low - power sensor in the world .
The sensor is made in silicon and it will be used in the fields of biosensing ( the development of devices able to identify , record or transmit physiological information , especially information regarding the presence of chemical compounds ) and environmental monitoring .
Together with his colleagues , Pr. Hiroshi Mizuta is working on a 3 - year project , which will allow the production of world 's smallest sensors .
The project is funded by the European FP - 7 and it is entitled NEMSIC , which stands for nano electro mechanical system integrated circuits .
The Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development ( FP7 ) is the central tool of the European Union for funding research throughout the period between 2007 and 2013 .
FP7 supports RD activities that cover nearly all scientific fields .
Besides being the smallest in the world , the sensor will also feature high sensitivity and will consume very little power .
Such advantages are going to be achieved through co-integration ( on a universal silicon technology ) of transistors with a single electron and nano - electro - mechanical systems ( NEMS ) .
" Power consumption is a big issue at the moment as devices use current whether they are switched off and on .
The single - electron transistor combined with the NEM device technology reduces power consumption at both ON and OFF states of the sensor .
Stand - by power is reduced to zero by having a complete sleep with the NEM switch when it is off , " said Pr. Mizuta .
The professor and his team will create a single - electron transistor , which will include a unique suspended silicon nanobridge .
The work of the nanobridge will resemble the work of a very sensitive detector for organic and chemical molecules .
" This is the first time that anyone has combined these two nanotechnologies to develop a smart sensor .
The traditional CMOS ( Complementary metal - oxide - semiconductor ) approach has many limitations so we needed to find a new approach , " said Pr. Mizuta .
After the opening of the new ECS Mountbatten building , scientists will be able to get a new electron beam lithography machine .
The latter will help in making sensing devices to the nanoscale .
" This sensor will be the smallest and use less power than any other on the market .
The fact that it will be at the nanoscale means that it will be able to detect either single - charge transfer and / or change in masses caused by a small amount of chemical and biological molecules electrically . "

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates renewed his call Tuesday for more spending on U.S. diplomacy and international aid , saying the U.S. government risks “ creeping militarization ” of its foreign policy by focusing its resources on the Pentagon .
With Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in attendance , Gates said in a speech that the government ’s civilian institutions , especially those with the tasks of diplomacy and development , had been undermanned and underfunded since the end of the Cold War .
Gates has made the argument before , most notably in November in an address at Kansas State University .
But his speech Tuesday , before a group of business and nongovernmental groups in Washington , included some of his most pointed language yet , including a call for the U.S. to repair its standing in Muslim countries .
But he said efforts to buff America ’s image were unlikely to help .
“ The solution is not to be found in some slick PR campaign or by trying to out - propagandize Al Qaeda , but through the steady accumulation of actions and results that build trust and credibility over time , ” Gates said .

The remark seemed directed toward some of the Bush administration ’s public diplomacy efforts in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Attempts by former White House aide Karen Hughes and others to reinvigorate administration outreach efforts failed to reverse the U.S. image , especially among Muslim populations .
Gates said that because of the Pentagon ’s outsized budget , it frequently handled activities that traditionally had been the responsibility of civilian agencies .
The trend has led critics to charge that U.S. foreign policy is dominated by the military , a view Gates said was “ not an entirely unreasonable sentiment . ”
He said devoting more resources to civilian agencies and better coordination between civilian and military officials on the ground would help .

The collapse of world socialism , the rise of the high speed Internet , a bought - and - paid - for US government , and a million dollar cap on executive pay that is not performance related are permitting greedy and disloyal corporate executives , Wall Street , and large retailers to dismantle the ladders of upward mobility that made America an " opportunity society . "
In the 21st century the US economy has been able to create net new jobs only in nontradable domestic services , such as waitresses , bartenders , government workers , hospital orderlies , and retail clerks .
( Nontradable services are " hands on " services that cannot be sold as exports , such as haircuts , waiting a table , fixing a drink . )
Corporations can boost their bottom lines , shareholder returns , and executive performance bonuses by arbitraging labor across national boundaries .
High value - added jobs in manufacturing and in tradable services can be relocated from developed countries to developing countries where wages and salaries are much lower .
In the United States , the high value - added jobs that remain are increasingly filled by lower paid foreigners brought in on work visas .
When manufacturing jobs began leaving the US , no - think economists gave their assurances that this was a good thing .
Grimy jobs that required little education would be replaced with new high tech service jobs requiring university degrees .
The American work force would be elevated .
The US would do the innovating , design , engineering , financing and marketing , and poor countries such as China would manufacture the goods that Americans invented .
High - tech services were touted as the new source of value - added that would keep the American economy preeminent in the world .
The assurances that economists gave made no sense .
If it pays corporations to ship out high value - added manufacturing jobs , it pays them to ship out high value - added service jobs .
And that is exactly what US corporations have done .
Automobile magazine ( August 2008 ) reports that last March Chrysler closed its Pacifica Advance Product Design Center in Southern California .
Pacifica 's demise followed closings and downsizings of Southern California design studios by Italdesign , ASC , Porsche , Nissan , and Volvo .
Only three of GM 's eleven design studios remain in the US .
According to Eric Noble , president of The Car Lab , an automotive consultancy , " Advanced studios want to be where the new frontier is .
So in China , studios are popping up like rabbits . "
can remain the font of research , innovation , design , and engineering while the country ceases to make things .
Research and product development invariably follow manufacturing .
Now even business schools that were cheerleaders for offshoring of US jobs are beginning to wise up .
In a recent report , " Next Generation Offshoring : The Globalization of Innovation , " Duke University 's Fuqua School of Business finds that product development is moving to China to support the manufacturing operations that have located there .

The idea is nonsensical that the USremain the font of research , innovation , design , and engineering while the country ceases to make things .
Research and product development invariably follow manufacturing .
Now even business schools that were cheerleaders for offshoring of US jobs are beginning to wise up .
In a recent report , " Next Generation Offshoring : The Globalization of Innovation , " Duke University 's Fuqua School of Business finds that product development is moving to China to support the manufacturing operations that have located there .
[ https://offshoring.fuqua.duke.edu/orn_report.pdf
The study , reported in Manufacturing & Technology News , acknowledges that " labor arbitrage strategies continue to be key drivers of offshoring , " a conclusion that I reached a number of years ago .
Moreover , the study concludes , jobs offshoring is no longer mainly associated with locating IT services and call centers in low wage countries .
Jobs offshoring has reached maturity , " and now the growth is centered around product and process innovation . "
According to the Fuqua School of Business report , in just one year , from 2005 to 2006 , offshoring of product development jobs increased from an already significant base by 40 to 50 percent .
Over the next one and one - half to three years , " growth in offshoring of product development projects is forecast to increase by 65 percent for R&D and by more than 80 percent for engineering services and product design - projects . "
More than half of US companies are now engaged in jobs offshoring , and the practice is no longer confined to large corporations .
Small companies have discovered that " offshoring of innovation projects can significantly leverage limited investment dollars . "
It turns out that product development , which was to be America 's replacement for manufacturing jobs , is the second largest business function that is offshored .
According to the report , the offshoring of finance , accounting , and human resource jobs is increasing at a 35 percent annual rate .
The study observes that " the high growth rates for the offshoring of core functions of value creation is a remarkable development . "
In brief , the United States is losing its economy .
However , a business school cannot go so far as to admit that , because its financing is dependent on outside sources that engage in offshoring .
Instead , the study claims , absurdly , that the massive movement of jobs abroad that the study reports are causing no job loss in the US : " Contrary to various claims , fears about loss of high - skill jobs in engineering and science are unfounded . "
The study then contradicts this claim by reporting that as more scientists and engineers are hired abroad , " fewer jobs are being eliminated onshore . "
Since 2005 , the study reports , there has been a 48 percent drop in the onshore jobs losses caused by offshore projects .
One wonders at the competence of the Fuqua School of Business .
If a 40 - 50 percent increase in offshored product development jobs , a 65 percent increase in offshored R&D jobs , and a more than 80 percent increase in offshored engineering services and product design - projects jobs do not constitute US job loss , what does ?
Academia 's lack of independent financing means that its researchers can only tell the facts by denying them .
The study adds more cover for corporate America 's rear end by repeating the false assertion that US firms are moving jobs offshore because of a shortage of scientists and engineers in America .
A correct statement would be that the offshoring of science , engineering and professional service jobs is causing fewer American students to pursue these occupations , which formerly comprised broad ladders of upward mobility .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics ' nonfarm payroll jobs statistics show no sign of job growth in these careers .
The best that can be surmised is that there are replacement jobs as people retire .
The offshoring of the US economy is destroying the dollar 's role as reserve currency , a role that is the source of American power and influence .
The US trade deficit resulting from offshored US goods and services is too massive to be sustainable .
Already the once all - mighty dollar has lost enormous purchasing power against oil , gold , and other currencies .
In the 21st century , the American people have been placed on a path that can only end in a substantial reduction in US living standards for every American except the corporate elite , who earn tens of millions of dollars in bonuses by excluding Americans from the production of the goods and services that they consume .
What can be done ?
The US economy has been seriously undermined by offshoring .
The damage might not be reparable .
Possibly , the American market and living standards could be rescued by tariffs that offset the lower labor and compliance costs abroad .
Another alternative , suggested by Ralph Gomory , would be to tax US corporations on the basis of the percentage of their value added that occurs in the US .
The greater the value added to a company 's product in America , the lower the tax rate on the profits .
These sensible suggestions will be demonized by ideological " free market " economists and opposed by the offshoring corporations , whose swollen profits allow them to hire " free market " economists as shills and to elect representatives to serve their interests .
The current recession with its layoffs will mask the continuing deterioration in employment and career outlooks for American university graduates .
The highly skilled US work force is being gradually transformed into the domestic service workforce characteristic of third world economies
Way back in 2006 , when gasoline cost just $ 2.50 a gallon , President Bush called for home - grown biofuels to replace three - quarters of oil imports from the Persian Gulf – or about 72 billion gallons – by 2025 .
How to achieve that goal is still a question .
Corn - based ethanol production is expected to be 12 billion to 15 billion gallons in coming years .
But with gas now at $ 4 a gallon and critics hammering corn ethanol for helping to pump up global food prices , it is clear that the holy grail of biofuels – cellulosic ethanol – needs to make its entrance soon .
Driven by a growing political consensus to shift toward nonfood biofuels , the high price of oil , and gains in technology , a flood of public and private investment has poured into the development of cellulosic ethanol .
“ Actual marketplace production of cellulosic ethanol is zero – there ’s not a gallon being produced [ commercially ] right now , ” says Thomas Foust , biofuels research director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo .
“ But with all these plants coming on line ... by 2010 or 2011 we will start to see millions of gallons . ”
At least 30 cellulosic ethanol “ biorefineries ” with solid sources of funding – including 13 with federal funding – are now active in the development pipeline , according to the Biotechnology Industry Organization , a Washington trade organization .
Not all these facilities will ultimately be built .
But a high proportion will be , given investor confidence , according to Dr. Foust .
Cellulosic ethanol is on track – or perhaps even ahead of schedule – to produce up to 60 billion gallons by 2030 , he says .
There seem as many varieties of cellulosic technology as there are companies trying to produce it on a commercial scale .
Most , however , fall into two broad categories : Thermochemical processes use heat and pressure to extract sugars from plant material – sugar that is then turned into ethanol .
Biochemical proces­ses mostly use enzymes to do the same thing .
A big step forward came last week with the opening of the nation ’s first ­demonstration - scale cellulosic ethanol plant in Jennings , La .
The facility , built by Cambridge , Mass . - based Verenium Corp. , will use high - tech enzymes to make 1.4 million gallons per year of ethanol from the cellulose in sugar cane bagasse , a waste product .
That plant will be used to tweak the technology and validate cost and performance measures , putting the company on track for a 30 - million - gallon commercial plant by the middle of next year .
“ This is a first for the US , and as we take the next step toward commercialization , we are breaking new ground and setting new standards , ” said Carlos Riva , president of Verenium , in a statement .
Despite the financial shock wave from the housing credit crunch and the subsequent closing of wallets on Wall Street , investor interest in cellulosic continues to be strong .
Developments popping up rapid - fire include :
• DuPont and Genencor ’s deal last month to form a $ 140 million joint venture to make cellulosic ethanol from corn stover ( husks and leaves ) and bagasse .
• General Motors last month said it would make a major investment in Mascoma Corp. , a cellulosic ethanol company based in Boston that hopes to use more powerful enzymes to break down material in a single step .
• Range Fuels , a Broomfield , Colo. , company , announced that in April it raised more than $ 100 million to help finish construction of its Soperton , Ga. , cellulosic ethanol plant .
With completion slated for 2009 , that plant is designed to turn logging residue into 20 million gallons of ethanol a year using a thermochemical process .
• BlueFire Ethanol ’s announcement last month that it will break ground soon on its first commercial cellulosic - ethanol plant .
The company says it will use a different process using wood and garden waste from a landfill in Lancaster , Calif. , to begin producing 3.1 million gallons annually by 2009 .
Adding fuel to the cellulosic fire , the new farm bill passed by Congress last month includes $ 384 million in new tax credits to spur cellulosic development .
The US Department of Energy also is investing about $ 385 million in six commercial - scale projects to be built over the next four years .
The plants will have a combined capacity of 130 million gallons .
“ Just three years ago , people would tell me : ‘ Oh , professor , things are not that bad [ with the nation ’s fuel situation ] ; there ’s not a need for that kind of radical change , ” says Lee Lynd , a cellulosic pioneer who is a professor of engineering at Dartmouth College in Hanover , N.H. , and chief technology officer for Mascoma .
But now with food supply , climate change , and gas - price issues , “ all of a sudden we have this attitude emerging that the markets [ for cellulosic ] are very real , ” Dr. Lynd says .
Often seen as a technological “ silver bullet , ” cellulosic ethanol promises to require far less energy to refine than corn ethanol does .
It does not require land that might otherwise provide food , as its feedstock is nonfood agricultural waste .
On that basis , cellulosic ethanol could reduce greenhouse - gas emissions up to 87 percent if used broadly in the United States for transport fuel , the US Department of Energy reports .
The potential of cellulosic biofuels to meet world demand is suggested by the current impact of corn - based ethanol , biodiesel , and other biofuels .
Biofuels will account for 63 percent of oil supply growth from non-OPEC countries this year , taking global production of crop - based fuel to more than 1.5 million barrels a day , according to the International Energy Agency .
Output is projected to grow by 425,000 barrels a day this year , a 57 percent increase from a year ago , the agency reported .
“ We feel like things have accelerated much more quickly in the past six months than they have in the past five years , ” says Brent Erickson , vice president for industrial and environmental technology at the Biotechnology Industry Organization , a Washington trade group that includes a number of cellulosic - ethanol companies .
Still , some environmentalists are hesitant about endorsing cellulosic technology without qualification , since there could be “ good cellulosic and bad cellulosic , ” says Nathanael Greene , senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York .
Basing government funding and tax incentives on the environmental performance of a technology – supporting technologies that use the least water , land , and other resources while cutting more CO2 emissions – is the key , he says .
“ We ’ve got to pay attention to the performance of new biofuels , not give credentials out for who produces the most gallons , ” he says , “ but who produces the best in terms of water use , water quality , soil erosion , wildlife and habitat enhancement – and greenhouse - gas emissions . ”
We arrived in Uganda last night .
I ’m here to finish installing the Knowledge Management Portal ( Knowledge Tree + Joomla ) that I put together over the past few weeks and help train the local staff .
Following are my first impressions of Uganda .
Keep in mind that I arrived after sunset and am staying at a nice hotel so my first impressions are especially limited .
Still , using my time in Rwanda as a frame of reference , I do have a little insight .
During the drive from the airport in Entebbe to Kampala , I kept thinking of how I could describe what I ’ve seen so far here in Africa .
My first thought was that much of it is like many rural areas of the U.S. during the early 20th century .
But there are a lot more cars and more electricity .
Then I thought about the government in Africa .
The “ Wild West ” seems to work a little better , then .
The West with electricity and cars .
And paved roads .
Of course , I was n’t yet in Kampala when I was thinking about all this .
What I saw of Kampala last night , and from what I can see today , Kampala is fairly modern .
Short , modern office buildings , plenty of paved roads .
We ’ll see if my impression changes once I actually get a chance to drive around today .
Speaking of roads :
In Uganda , they drive on the left .
In Rwanda ( the other land - locked country just south of Uganda ) , they drive on the right .
I wonder what happens at a border crossing .
Oh , and they use yet - another - power - connection .
I had to pay 15,000 UG Shillings for a new adaptor today .
Highway Robbery , I tell you !
I suppose you can tell exactly which European country colonized which African nation by looking at their power plugs and on which side of the road they drive .
Uganda is clearly a former British colony — left side driving and British power plugs — wheras Rwanda , with its power plugs and right side driving is clearly a former Belgium colony .
One more thing before I start work .
International flights are about the most fun you can have ( if you do n’t sense sarcasm there , let me point it out for you here ) .
Take Amsterdam , for instance .
I hopped off my flight from Philadelphia , went through customs once to enter then country and then again to hop on a flight to Uganda .
Hurrah !
At least this was better than transiting the U.S. where they make you grab your luggage even if you ’re just catching the next flight out of the country .
Customs ( long lines , lots of waiting ) and switching flights ( long layovers , long lines , lots of waiting ) mean that I left Philly at 6:30 pm Tuesday and , after hours in airports and whatnot , arrived in my hotel in Uganda at 9:00 pm Wednesday .
Not much jet lag , though .
I seem to have a knack for sleeping on planes — even in the cramped economy class conditions .
These things I believe about software development and user - interface design .
1 . Why write code ?
Software is for humans , not for computers .
Software is only as good as the improvement it makes to a human being ’s life .
Are we making someone ’s job easier ?
Letting them have more fun ?
Helping them learn ?
Helping them keep in touch with friends and family ?
Are we making the world a better place ?
2 . What do people want ?
Most people do not want a computer .
They do n’t even want software .
For us software developers , this is a painful truth .
If people do n’t want a computer , why do they use one ?
Email — for writing to other people .
Instant messaging — for talking to other people .
The web browser — for reading what other people have written .
Word processing — for writing something you ’re going to print out and show to other people .
Graphics — for creating artwork .
To show to other people .
Presentation — for communicating your brilliant plan .
To other people .
Games — especially games that you can play online .
With other people .
Social networking websites — Enough said .
The computer is merely an intermediary .
A poor and frustrating one .
It is a necessary evil that people put up with in order to get what they want .
What they want is a better way to talk to each other .
3 . Why does software succeed or fail ?
We software developers , being not exactly social creatures by nature , must work extra hard to understand the social impact our software will have .
If the social effect is not what people want , the software goes unused .
We software developers , being not exactly average users , must work extra hard to understand how average users will relate to our software .
We see the trees , they see the forest .
We software developers have often been confused and frustrated when a clearly superior technology fails , while a clearly inferior technology spreads like wildfire and takes over the world .
We were surprised because we want each technology to be judged only by its cleverness , its raw power , the cleanliness of its architecture , the purity of its ideas .
We were blind to the user experience , to what each technology meant in the bigger picture of a person ’s life .
To the people buying and using the “ clearly inferior ” technology , exactly the opposite was true .
To the user , the interface is the product .
4 . Why is there not more Linux on the desktop ?
For open source software to take over the world , we ’re going to have to do a lot better at user interfaces than we have been doing .
How do I know ?
Open source has already taken over the invisible parts of the world : the servers , the infrastructure , the things users need not touch directly .
Mozilla , the most user - experience - focused of open - source companies , has the most adoption by end -users .
People say things to me like , “ Linux is only free if the value of my time is zero . ”
These are not coincidences .
At one time , the way of open - source software development was thought impossible .
But the techniques were invented .
The way became possible ; then it became successful .
Now the techniques are becoming widely known .
The way to make open - source UI design successful is still unclear .
We must invent the techniques .
5 . Are users dumb ?
User interface design is not about dumbing things down for the poor stupid user .
We software developers , understanding the software as we do , find it easy to look down upon those who lack our understanding .
This is wrong .
Users are n’t dumb .
They just have better things to do with their lives than memorizing the internal data model of our screwy software .
When software is hard to use , do n’t make excuses for it .
Improve it .
When a user makes a mistake , do n’t blame the user .
Ask how the software misled them .
Then fix it .
The user ’s time is more valuable than ours .
Respect it .
Good UI design is humble .
6 . Is UI design marketing ?
User interface design is not marketing .
Software developers loathe marketing , so if they think that UI design is marketing , then they will loathe UI design .
The qualities of software that make for a good advertisement or computer - store demo are not the same qualities that make software usable and pleasant to work with long - term , day - in day - out .
Often these qualities are opposites .
A shopper may choose the microwave with more buttons , because it seems “ more powerful ” .
However , the shopper will soon find out that it does the same thing as any other microwave , you just have to spend longer figuring out which button to push .
It is easy to fool people into buying something that is against their own best interest .
Do n’t do that .
7 . What is the task of the UI designer ?
Let us talk about that microwave some more .
The microwave with the most buttons may be most popular , but it is not the best microwave .
The best microwave has no buttons at all .
It does n’t need any buttons because it already knows how long you want your food cooked and how hot .
You never need to set the clock , either : it ’s just always right .
The no-button microwave may not be reachable , but like a guiding star it shows us the direction we should travel .
Users do not know what interface they want .
Users do not know what features they want .
Users know the tasks they want to do , and the problems they have .
We learn more by watching the user work than by asking the user .
The job of the UI designer is to provide what the users need , not what the users say they need .
It is to make tasks easier , not to provide features .
8 . Where is the science ?
User interface design can be approached scientifically .
But usually is n’t .
Until we observe people using our software for real , our design is guesswork and superstition .
These things can be measured and given numbers :
What program features are being used most frequently , and least .
The number of mouse / keyboard interactions required to perform a task .
The time it takes a user to figure out how to do a task .
Rates of error .
How quickly task - completion - time and error - frequency decrease as a user gains experience .
An interface ’s efficiency and learnability are empirically determinable quantities .
They are not matters of opinion .
Every user is different , but that ’s why we have statistical methods .
The science of design can tell us that interface foo is X % more efficient than interface bar , but bar is Y % more learnable than foo .
Choosing between foo and bar — that ’s where the science ends and the art begins .
9 . Is change good or bad ?
Change has a cost .
Change disrupts the user ’s habits .
Change forces the user to learn something new .
Sometimes the new UI is so much better than the old one that the change is worth the cost .
Sometimes it is n’t .
The trick is knowing when change is worth it .
10 .
What is the evil of the bad interface ?
It is a sin to waste the user ’s time , break the user ’s train of thought , or lose the user ’s work .
Bad user interfaces do all three .
Frequently .
Most interfaces are bad .
I do not use the word “ sin ” lightly .
Because of bad user interfaces , an action taken based on a reasonable assumption or out of habit often results in broken trains of thought , wasted time , and lost work .
This is called “ user error ” , but it is n’t .
It is programmer or designer error .
When we blame the user , we teach them that technology is perfect and that the errors are their own .
Because technology is hard to use , we are teaching a generation to be afraid of technology .
We are teaching a generation to believe in their own stupidity .
This is a sin , too .
It ’s not the user ’s fault .

The Civil Liberties Union reached the number by citing the 700,000 records on the list last September and adding 20,000 names each month , as forecast by the inspector - general of the Justice Department .
The result is that if a terrorist uses the alias Gary Smith , for example , all Gary Smiths could be subject to extra scrutiny , such as searches and questioning at airports and border crossings .
Jim Robinson , who was an assistant attorney - general during the Clinton presidency , said he could not print an electronic ticket at home because his name matched one on the list , even though he still had a top security clearance .
He said the Government 's terrorist watch list had probably caused thousands of innocent Americans to be questioned , searched or otherwise hassled .
" It 's a pain in the neck and significantly interferes with my travel arrangements , " he said .
He believes his name matches that of someone who was put on the list in early 2005 , and he is routinely delayed while flying - despite having his security clearances renewed last year .
" If I were convinced that America is a safer place because I get hassled at the airport , I might put up with it , " he said .
" But I doubt it . "
For some Americans whose names match those on the list , being delayed or detained for extra screening is not just a hassle - it is frightening .
A computer consultant from the Chicago area , Akif Rahman , said he had been detained at least seven times after travelling abroad .
He said that in May he was shackled to a chair and interrogated for more than five hours at the US - Canadian border while his wife and two children waited with no access to food or a telephone .
Mr Rahman is one of 10 people who have sued the Government , seeking to remedy policies that caused such detentions because they were misidentified .
The Government calls its watch list one of the most effective tools in its fight against terrorism .
It was created after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , to consolidate 12 existing lists and prevent terrorists going undetected if they were entering the country or otherwise stopped for questioning .
Last year congressional investigators found " general agreement that the watch list has helped to combat terrorism " .
Other audits of the list have concluded that it has mistakenly allowed innocent people to be stopped because their names are similar to those on it .
As of October 2006 more than 30,000 airline passengers had asked the Homeland Security Department to clear their names from the list .
Up to 20 suspected terrorists were left off the list as of last year due to a technology glitch .
The list is compiled by the FBI and given to airlines , the Transportation Security Administration and US Border Patrol .
Chad Kolton , a spokesman for the FBI 's terrorist screening centre , which administers the list , said it was not available to the public so there was no way of knowing if someone was on it .
The Civil Liberties Union called on the President , George Bush , to issue an executive order requiring the list be reviewed and limited to those for whom there was credible evidence of terrorist activity .
It also called for the right to see the list and challenge the data .

Broad City
Created by UCB alums Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer , Broad City is an odd - couple comedy about two best friends navigating life in New York City .
Abbi and Ilana are broke and flawed , and they do n’t shy away from the sticky situations NYC throws at them – they dive right into the muck .
No matter how bad it gets , these broads are always down to tackle whatever hits them .
The bailout of IndyMac ’s depositors will probably deplete 10 % of the FDIC ’s reserves .
Congress will back up the FDIC if the FDIC ever ( 1 ) runs out of T - bills to sell ( 2 ) to raise money ( 3 ) to pay off depositors of insolvent banks .
But where will Congress get this money ?
From the Federal Reserve System , if lenders will not fork over the money .
The Federal Reserve System backs up Congress .
This is the heart of the threat to the solvency of the dollar .
The $ 4 billion that the FDIC will pay to a handful of depositors at IndyMac is hush money .
It is paid to them to silence every other depositor in the country .
“ Do n’t spread rumors about any insolvent bank . ”
Why not ?
“ Because , in a fractionally reserved system , all of them are technically insolvent . ”
They are all borrowed short and lent long .
NO PANIC . . .
YET
The failure of IndyMac this month was unique .
We have not seen a bank failure this large since 1984 .
In one sense , this reminded the general public that individual banks can go bankrupt .
The most common reason for bankruptcy is that the bank has lent money to purchasers of real estate , which is a long - term debt , yet depositors have the right to withdraw money at any time .
The bank is lent long and borrowed short .
Yet this is true of every bank .
The ones that get caught , which is a rare event , have merely indulged in long - term lending more than the average bank .
The failure of an individual bank does not produce mass panic any longer .
It has been so long since Americans have seen a bank run that they pay no attention to a rare bank failure .
Because the FDIC presently does have sufficient reserves in Treasury debt to sell and compensate depositors , depositors around the country are not tempted to go to their bank and demand currency .
The fact that the FDIC could cover the deposits of no more than a dozen banks the size of IndyMac does not disturb them .
They know nothing about the FDIC , other than the crucial fact : the United States government stands behind it .
The government will re-capitalize the FDIC .
The experts who really do understand the nature of the bank deposit insurance program , as incarnated by the FDIC , know that the Federal Reserve System in turn stands behind the Federal government .
So , there is no question that individual depositors in individual banks will be bailed out by the FDIC directly , or by the United States government through the FDIC if the FDIC runs out of T - bills to sell .
What will happen when the Federal Reserve System runs out of Treasury debt to sell or swap ?
It has unloaded almost 40 % of its holdings since last December .
When that day comes , a lot of geese will get cooked .
TWO KINDS OF BANK FAILURES
There is an enormous difference — a literally life - and - death difference — between individual bank failures and a systemic banking failure .
I do not believe we are facing a systemic banking failure .
But we are facing more individual bank failures .
Americans have seen very few bank failures ever since the establishment of the FDIC in 1934 .
Depositors trust the FDIC to intervene and protect the money in their bank accounts .
They do not withdraw currency from their accounts in a banking crisis because they believe that the FDIC will intervene to protect them .
This confidence has kept almost all American banks from experiencing bank runs since 1934 .
This is the most important of all “ moral hazards . ”
A moral hazard is the expected subsidy from the government to protect investors from a major collapse that their own stupidity and greed has caused .
All the talk by Ben Bernanke or anyone else about trying to avoid moral hazard is propaganda for the rubes .
Moral hazard is at the bottom of the banking system , beginning with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
The entire banking system rests on this premise : the banking system must be saved from bad investment decisions of reckless bankers whose banks go bankrupt , thereby causing doubts about the solvency of an entire system that is borrowed short and lent long , a system built on a lie :
“ We will pay you interest by lending out your deposit , but everyone can get his money back at any time . ”
This lie is more widely believed than even this one : “ Of course I will still respect you in the morning . ”
The FDIC was set up to use government money , if required , to protect bankers against two groups : ( 1 ) depositors , ( 2 ) foolhardy rival bankers who go bust .
Bankers fear depositors ’ decisions to withdraw currency , thereby imploding the fractionally reserved banking system .
They fear busted banks because of the potential domino effect : “ all fall down . ”
WITHDRAWAL AND RE-DEPOSIT
When an individual withdraws currency from his bank account , he reverses the expansion process of fractional reserve banking .
For every paper dollar that an individual deposits , the banking system as a whole multiplies the quantity of money by nine to one .
It may multiply it even more if this deposit is not in an urban bank .
Similarly , when a person withdraws currency from his bank , and does not redeposit it , the banking system contracts the deposits by nine to one .
Who withdraws currency from a bank ?
You and I withdraw currency from ATMs , but we intend to spend this currency .
Whenever we spend it , it winds up in the cash drawer of a retail company .
The company at the end of the day deposits this currency into its bank .
So , the banking system as a whole does not experience contraction .
The money supply therefore does not contract .
The only contraction that is permanent is the contraction of currency withdrawn from a local bank and then sent to relatives outside the United States .
When this is done , there is a permanent contraction of digital money in the banking system .
But this rate of withdrawal is fairly constant , and so the banking system does not contract unexpectedly .
This process actually reduces the rate of monetary inflation and the rate of price inflation in the United States .
Immigrants send money to their relatives , and American consumers find that imported goods are paid for in effect by pieces of paper with Presidents ’ pictures on them .
Foreigners do not use the money to buy American goods , leaving prices lower in the United States than they otherwise would have been .
The banking system as a whole is not threatened by individual bank failures .
The money that a failed bank has lent out does not disappear when the lending bank fails .
It remains in circulation .
The money that depositors might otherwise have lost is returned to them by the FDIC .
So , individual bank failures do not alter the total money supply .
Those few individuals who deposited more than $ 100,000 in accounts at a local bank that fails will lose most of their money above $ 100,000 .
They have learned their lesson through IndyMac .
It is likely that wealthy depositors have already taken steps by now to defend themselves against further bank failures .
They have spread the money around .
If not , they are slow learners .
THE REAL THREAT
The problem with individual bank failures is not the threat of a collapsing banking system .
The problem is that bank failures send a message to depositors : the economy is being managed by people who do not have good economic judgment .
Depositors begin to distrust the economy as a whole .
It is not that they distrust the banking system as a whole .
There is nothing they can do individually to pull the plug on the banking system as a whole , other than withdrawing all of their money from the bank and sending it abroad to people they barely know .
This is not going to happen .
The threat to the banking system is that failed banks are a yellow flag to consumers .
It warns them that the economy as a whole is at risk .
Bank failures testify to the incompetence of supposed experts who manage the public ’s money .
When the average investor begins to lose confidence in the money managers , they may decide that discretion is the better part of valor .
At some point , he will call his pension fund or stock mutual fund and tell the person at the other end of the line to sell the stocks .
He will have to buy something , and what he will buy will be short - term money market instruments .
He may also buy U.S. Treasury bonds .
The problem with this is that long - term money , meaning long - term capital to be used in long - term projects , will become less available .
The government will spend any money that the public invests in Treasury debt .
Businesses will find that it is more difficult to gain access to long - term capital .
This will slow the rate of economic growth in the United States .
This will remove the engine of economic growth .
By moving their money out of the private sector , and especially out of equities , investors will contract the overall economy .
It is not that individual bank failures threaten the banking system as a whole .
The banking system as a whole is a gigantic cartel , and this cartel has as its protector the Federal Reserve System .
The Federal Reserve System is legally allowed to monetize anything it wants to monetize .
It can buy any asset , and it can create the money to buy this asset .
The Federal Reserve can intervene to save individual banks , or large financial institutions .
Not only can it do this , it is doing it on a constant basis .
At some point , it will not be able to do this without monetizing assets that it cannot offset by the sale of existing Treasury debt in its possession .
Beginning in December 2007 , the Federal Reserve System has sold Treasury debt whenever it has increased its purchase of questionable assets that it has bought from banks and large financial institutions .
It has unloaded about 40 % of its holdings of liquid Treasury debt .
This has kept it from inflating the money supply at a dramatic rate .
At some point , it will run out of Treasury debt to sell to the general public in order to offset the increase of its purchase of questionable assets held by the financial system .
At that point , the great inflation will begin .
This could be a year away .
This could be a month away .
All we know is this : when the Federal Reserve system runs out of Treasury debt to sell , its purchase of all assets will be inflationary .
The banking system as a whole is protected .
What is not protected is the purchasing power of the dollar .
In order to guarantee the survival of the banking system as a whole , the existing legal structure has created an enormous risk factor : the destruction of the dollar .
Legal solvency can be maintained by the banking system as a whole , but this legal solvency comes at a price : the threat of the insolvency of the dollar itself .
This has always been true .
The public has never thought this through .
It is beyond the voters ’ comprehension .
Congress , which has authorized the legislation that has led to this system ever since passing the Federal Reserve Act in late December , 1913 , has also not thought about the implications of this system of guaranteed legal solvency for the banking system .
But the insolvency of the dollar is the ultimate implication of the legal structure of today ’s fractionally reserved banking cartel .
The major threat to the banking system is from outside the banking system .
The major threat is the insolvency of a major company that has guaranteed the bonds of private corporations and agency bonds of the United States government , such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These supposed guarantees have made possible the system of bond portfolios that can be broken up into 125 levels of risk , with appropriate rates of return on each of the slices .
The system is so complex that no one understands it .
Hedge funds have invested in these assets , called collateralized mortgage obligations .
They have borrowed from banks to buy them .
The leverage of the hedge fund system is enormous .
It is probably a hundred to one .
The guarantees against loss that undergird the financial system are guarantees made by organizations that cannot possibly fulfill their contracts during an anomalous event , such as an attack on Iran by the Israeli air force .
When the promises cannot be fulfilled , interest rates will rise for all American bonds except those of the United States Treasury .
This will trigger additional demands placed on the guarantors of these contracts , which will threaten the solvency of the bond system .
At that point , bank capital will collapse as a result of the losses that the banks have sustained because they lent hedge funds money to invest in the bonds .
The collapse of the Carlyle Capital Corp. earlier this year took less than a week .
It was borrowed at least 32 to one by ten major banks of the United States .
Those banks lost 100 % of these their investment in one week .
When banks lose capital , they must either find new investors , or else they must reduce their loans .
When they reduce their loans , they refuse to roll over existing lines of credit to American corporations .
This is the major threat to the system .
It is not a threat of the bankruptcy of the banks ; it is the threat of the reduction of lines of credit to American corporations — corporations that are dependent on these lines of credit .
In a financial panic , American investors will move from corporate bonds and stocks and put their money in Treasury debt .
This threatens the solvency , not simply of individual banks , but of individual corporations that are dependent upon lines of credit issued by specific banks .
American corporations are not dependent on the banking system as a whole .
They are dependent on continuing lines of credit from specific banks .
They do not have time to renegotiate loans with other banks .
They have to meet their payrolls .
This will become increasingly difficult to do in the environment created by constant reports of individual failures of specific banks .
This is the famous and widely denied crowding - out effect .
The Federal government ’s debt certificates are trusted ; the private capital markets are less trusted .
In order for the private capital markets to continue to operate in such a hostile environment , they will have to offer greater economic returns than Treasury debt .
It will become more expensive for private companies to attract long - term investment , precisely because individual banks are failing .
Obviously , the companies would all fail if the banking system as a whole collapsed .
The entire society ’s existence would be at risk if the entire banking system collapsed .
There is no a safe hedge against such a scenario .
The division of labor would collapse .
Cities would not be resupplied with goods .
It would be like all the disaster movies combined .
It would take only a matter of weeks for the death rate to jump .
So , anyone who talks about the collapse of the banking system who has not retreated to a small farm located 100 miles from a major city does not take seriously his own scenario .
The problem is not the collapse of the banking system as a whole .
The problem is the crowding out by government , especially the Federal government , of capital that would otherwise have gone into the private sector .
The threat is the long - term erosion of confidence in the private capital markets .
This is not a minor threat .
This is a major threat .
It threatens the long - term growth of the American economy .
It threatens the long - term growth of an economy which is heavily indebted to foreign investors .
When foreign investors perceive that growth has stopped , they are going to cease lending money to Americans to sustain their present patterns of consumption .
The dollar will fall .
The price of imported goods will increase .
The public will have to readjust its household budgets .
When the public must readjust spending patterns , the result is recession .
In a major readjustment of their budgets , the result is a deep depression .
We have not seen this since the 1930s .
When we read of more bank failures , we will grow more nervous .
It is not that tens of millions of depositors will go down to their banks and take out currency .
A few million people may do this to a limited extent , but most people will not .
This is because they do not have sufficient reserves in their bank accounts to enable them to take out $ 1000 in currency and not use that money to spend on household bills .
So , they wo n’t do this .
( You probably should . )
The long - run effectiveness of withdrawing currency to protect yourself from a complete collapse is essentially useless .
You can not buy much in a complete collapse .
Most things are produced and delivered based on bank credit .
We are hooked .
The likelihood of the complete collapse of banks is extremely low .
It could happen , but it is highly unlikely .
What is likely in a scenario of failing banks is the increasing loss of public confidence in the private capital markets .
When that happens , the rush to buy Treasury debt , which means the rush to hand over our economic future is to the United States Congress , will lead to the de-capitalization of the private companies that increase our standard of living .
THE REAL PRICE OF BANK GUARANTEES
The public has encouraged the United States government to protect voters from unexpected bank failures .
Congress has complied .
The banking cartel has welcomed this cooperation .
The Federal Reserve System has inflated .
The dollar has depreciated by 95 % since 1914 .
This is a result of the creation of the Federal Reserve System , which was created in the name of stable money .
In other words , it is one more example of Ludwig von Mises ’ rule : whenever the government interferes with the market , the result will be the opposite of what the legislators said they intended to achieve .
The greater the threat to the individual banks ’ solvency , the louder the public will demand additional government intervention .
Congress will respond .
The result will be the creation of a set of conditions in which the Federal Reserve System will have to monetize the overleveraged hedge fund system which has grown up over the last decade .
It will find that it must monetize so much , so fast , on all sides , that it will not be able to offset the creation of new money by the sale of existing Treasury debt .
Bernanke has done his best to keep the helicopter full of fiat money from having to take off and do its work .
But he cannot resist the demands of Congress once it is clear the public that a series of bank bankruptcies is threatening the public ’s confidence in the economy as a whole .
The banks are protected .
The purchasing power of the United States dollar is not .
Eventually , Bernanke ’s hush money helicopter will fly .
So , we face a recession .
We also face bankruptcies of overleveraged small banks like IndyMac .
But the large banks are far more leveraged than the public understands .
They have lent huge chunks of their capital to hedge funds that are leveraged 100 to one .
A 1 % move opposite to what a hedge fund has expected can wipe out 100 % of a 100 - to - one fund ’s equity .
It can be insolvent faster than you can say Carlyle Capital Corporation .
Warren Buffett says that the stages of the investment cycle is managed by three successive groups : first , the innovators ; second , the imitators ; third , the idiots .
We are well into stage three .
CONCLUSION
In 1998 , a weekend intervention by the President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank got a dozen banks to pony up $ 3.6 billion of new loans to keep the insolvent Long Term Capital Management hedge fund .
The fund was leveraged 30 to one and would have to sell off $ 125 billion in assets at a loss .
Since much of the portfolio was in assets that had fallen to zero — defaulted Russian bonds — this would be painful .
Sales of the liquid assets would have tanked the international bond market .
The bailout gave the banks time to sell the still - marketable assets over the next two years .
Now the hedge funds are international .
The obligations are in the trillions .
Who can bail out a large busted fund now ?
The banks are in hock to all of them , and one of them can bring down the system .
Bernanke will need a lot of hush money .

Exclusive video of emergency official Barry Jennings discussing explosions inside WTC 7 before either of the twin towers had collapsed and having to step over dead bodies of victims as he attempted to vacate the building has been released for the first time .
The clip , which was originally intended to feature in Loose Change Final Cut but had to be withdrawn according to Jennings ’ wishes after he had received threats , has now been made public in anticipation of a BBC documentary about Building 7 which is expected to skew Jennings ’ account in an attempt to reinforce the official story .
In reality , what Jennings witnessed completely contradicts the official story of what happened to Building 7 .
On the morning of 9/11 in his capacity as Deputy Director , Emergency Services Department , New York City Housing Authority , Jennings and Michael Hess , who is a founding Partner and Senior Managing Director of Giuliani Partners LLC , visited the Office of Emergency Management inside Building 7 only to find it had been abandoned .
" Upon arriving into the OEM EOC , we noticed that everybody was gone , " said Jennings .
" I saw coffee that was on the desk , the smoke was still coming off the coffee , I saw half - eaten sandwiches , " he stated , adding that he and Hess were told to leave the building right away .
Jennings and Hess found a stairwell and descended the stairs .
" When we reached the 6th floor the landing that we were standing on gave way , there was an explosion and the landing gave way , I was left there hanging , I had to climb back up and walk back up to the 8th floor , " said Jennings .
" The explosion was beneath me …. so when the explosion happened it blew us back …. both buildings ( the twin towers ) were still standing , " he added .
" I was trapped in there for several hours , I was trapped in there when both buildings came down – all this time I ’m hearing all kinds of explosions , all this time I ’m hearing explosions , said Jennings , adding that when firefighters took them down to the lobby it was in " total ruins " .
Barry Jennings
" For me to see what I saw was unbelievable , " said Jennings .
The firefighters kept saying to Jennings " do not look down " because , according to Jennings , " we were stepping over people and you can tell when you ’re stepping over people . "
A police officer then told Jennings , " you will have to run because we have reports of more explosions . "
" I ’m just confused about one thing … . why World Trade Center 7 went down in the first place – I ’m very confused about that – I know what I heard I heard explosions , " said Jennings , adding that the explanation that the explosions were as a result of fuel oil tanks in the building did not add up .
" I ’m an old boiler guy , if it was a fuel oil tank it would have been one side of the building , " he stated .
Footage inside the Millennium Hilton building lobby , which was closer to the WTC twin towers than Building 7 , shows minimal damage after both towers had collapsed in comparison with devastating damage in the lobby of WTC 7 , as reported by Jennings , before either tower had even collapsed .
Jennings ’ eyewitness report of explosions inside WTC 7 before the towers had collapsed as well as dead bodies inside the building completely contradicts the official story , which maintains that there were no fatalities inside Building 7 .
If WTC 7 collapsed as a result of damage it sustained from the fall of the twin towers , as the official version claims , then why were explosions taking place inside the building before either tower had collapsed ?
The BBC hit piece documentary , which airs on July 6th , features an interview with Jennings but according to Loose Change ’s Jason Bermas , the program will distort Jennings ’ comments in an attempt to sideline the shocking nature of what he witnessed and the blatant manner in which his experiences contradict the official story .
According to Bermas , during their interview with members of Loose Change , the BBC denied that Jennings had stepped over dead bodies when he left the building , a claim disproved by Jennings ’ own statements in the video below .

Juneau County sheriff 's deputy arrested Tammy D. Lewis and Alan Bushey of Necedah , Wisconsin , for two felony counts of causing mental harm to a child .
See , the two left the body of a 90 - year - old woman decomposing on the bathroom toilet !
The sheriff 's office was asked on Wednesday to check on Middlesworth 's welfare by the woman 's sister , Bernice Metz , because Metz had not heard from her in " some time . "
When a deputy arrived at the home , Lewis initially claimed Middlesworth was on vacation , but after her body was discovered told the deputy that she had been dead for about two months .
Lewis said she had been helping Middlesworth put on an undergarment when she passed out in her arms and she had left her propped on the toilet after Bushey , whom she referred to as her " superior , " said to leave her on the toilet and pray .
Lewis told the deputy that " God told her Alvina would come back to life if she prayed hard enough . "
Bushey told the deputy that " Lewis was obedient and served the Lord just as she should . "
The 12 - year - old boy later told investigators that after Middlesworth died , Bushey told him her appearance " was the result of demons attempting to make it appear that Alvina would not come back to life . "
The boy also reportedly said that Bushey told him that if Middlesworth 's death was discovered , he and his sister would have to go to public school and get jobs because the woman , whom the boy referred to as his " grandmother , " was paying the bills .
SAN FRANCISCO 
An American military supercomputer , assembled from components originally designed for video game machines , has reached a long - sought - after computing milestone by processing more than 1.026 quadrillion calculations per second .
The new machine is more than twice as fast as the previous fastest supercomputer , the I.B.M. BlueGene / L , which is based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California .
The new $ 133 million supercomputer , called Roadrunner in a reference to the state bird of New Mexico , was devised and built by engineers and scientists at I.B.M. and Los Alamos National Laboratory , based in Los Alamos , N.M .
It will be used principally to solve classified military problems to ensure that the nation ’s stockpile of nuclear weapons will continue to work correctly as they age .
The Roadrunner will simulate the behavior of the weapons in the first fraction of a second during an explosion .
Before it is placed in a classified environment , it will also be used to explore scientific problems like climate change .
The greater speed of the Roadrunner will make it possible for scientists to test global climate models with higher accuracy .
SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition , used by musicians , artists , and researchers working with sound .
It is free and open source software available for Windows , macOS , and Linux .
SuperCollider features three major components :
scsynth , a real - time audio server , forms the core of the platform .
It features 400 + unit generators ( “ UGens ” ) for analysis , synthesis , and processing .
Its granularity allows the fluid combination of many known and unknown audio techniques , moving between additive and subtractive synthesis , FM , granular synthesis , FFT , and physical modeling .
You can write your own UGens in C++ , and users have already contributed several hundred more to the sc3 - plugins repository .
sclang , an interpreted programming language .
It is focused on sound , but not limited to any specific domain .
sclang controls scsynth via Open Sound Control .
You can use it for algorithmic composition and sequencing , finding new sound synthesis methods , connecting your app to external hardware including MIDI controllers , network music , writing GUIs and visual displays , or for your daily programming experiments .
It has a stock of user - contributed extensions called Quarks .
scide is an editor for sclang with an integrated help system .
SuperCollider was developed by James McCartney and originally released in 1996 .
In 2002 , he generously released it as free software under the GNU General Public License .
It is now maintained and developed by an active and enthusiastic community .

Introduction
This page covers topics from abstract research on games to applied technology for commercial video game production .
It aims to appeal to academic researchers and game developers , as well as those who fall somewhere in between .
Video game design and production is a fast paced , hit - driven , technology - based field .
Hardware used in game consoles and personal computers continues to improve , getting faster and cheaper at a dizzying pace .
Video game developers start each new project with increased computational resources , and a long list of cool features they would like to incorporate .
Since they normally work on very tight production schedules , they have little or no time to experiment with untested technology .
Results from recent research help to bridge that gap .
Researchers , working largely in academia and occasionally in industry , are motivated by exploring new technology .
To be published , research must be novel : either a completely new idea or a significant improvement on an old idea .
Commercial game development can provide a rich stream of " ... it would be nice if ... " ideas which can inspire new research projects .
This focus on novelty in the research world contrasts with the commercial world .
There , while novelty is good , what really matters is an enjoyable , engaging experience .
A sequel can be a hit while a strikingly original game may not .
These two communities have conflicting goals and very different cultures .
Yet a mutually beneficial symbiotic relation can exist between them .
With luck this page may lead to cross-fertilization and perhaps some beneficial collaborations .
Maintenance of this page is generously sponsored by the R&D group of Sony Computer Entertainment America .
What is n't here
Some aspects of game technology research are well covered elsewhere and will not be duplicated here .
For example , all research on computer graphics is ultimately relevant to video games .
Computer graphics is a huge field with its own excellent online resources , such as SIGGRAPH and its literature .
There are excellent online resources devoted to specific aspects of computer graphics , such as Real Time Rendering and animation .
Game design is covered elsewhere ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) and mentioned here only in terms of technology .
Other than those broad exceptions , almost anything available on the web about research or technology related to video games is fair game .
Feel free to suggest additions or corrections for this page .
