Calorie counting can work , but it ’s often based on pseudo - science .
I ’ve examined before how people can lose 20 + lbs. of bodyfat — or gain 34 lbs. of lean mass — within four weeks , replete with measurements and photographs , but there is still a chorus : “ That ’s impossible !
You ’d need to have a 4,000 - calorie daily deficit ” or “ That ’s impossible !
You ’d need to consume 20,000 calories per day ! ”
Nonsense .
Thermodynamics is n’t so simple , and you can accelerate your body optimization results by understanding the real science …
I ’ve invited Dr. Michael Eades , one of my favorite bariatric ( obesity treatment ) doctors in the US and the first to introduce insulin resistance to the mainstream , to explain the facts vs. disinformation .
He is author of one of the few research - driven weight - loss books I recommend , Protein Power .
Take it away , Dr. Eades …

Dr. Eades :
I ’ve taken some heat for my writing that weight loss or weight gain involves more than a simple accounting for calories .
The entirety of mainstream medicine and nutrition believe that calories are the only thing that counts and that a low - carb diet is nothing more than a clever way to get people to cut calories .
Weight loss on low - carb diets , so they say , occurs only because subjects following low - carb diets reduce their caloric intake .
A calorie is a calorie is a calorie they say .
But is it ?
I could argue that this idea is n’t necessarily true because of a number of recent studies that have shown that subjects following low - carb diets actually lose more weight than their counterparts on low - fat , high - carb diets despite the fact that the low - carbers consumed considerably more calories .
But instead of going through these modern day studies , let ’s go back and look at a couple of earlier famous studies to see what we can learn .
ANCEL KEYS STUDY
In 1944 Ancel Keys , Ph.D. , decided to undertake a long - term study of starvation .
It was apparent that WWII was going to be over soon and that much of Europe was starving .
Although word of the mass starvation in concentration camps was just starting to filter out into the world , it was well known the Europeans , especially Eastern European , were not getting enough food .
Keys wanted to do a study of starvation to see what really happened during the process so that at war ’s end the victors would have a better idea of how to deal with the starving masses they were sure to encounter .
Key ’s recruited 36 young male volunteers from the cadre of the conscientious objectors .
These were healthy , normal weight men , most of whom were working for the Civilian Public Service ( CPS ) , an entity created to provide jobs of national importance for conscientious objectors .
The men responded to brochures and bulletins distributed in the various CPS barracks showing a photo of three French toddlers staring at empty bowls over the question : WILL YOU STARVE SO THAT THEY WILL BE BETTER FED ?
The subjects came to the University of Minnesota where they were housed in the cavernous area underneath the football stadium for the course of the study .
They were basically kept under lock and key for the study so that Keys and his colleagues could ensure compliance .
At the start of the experiment the men were fed sumptuously for the first 12 weeks .
A full - time cook , two assistants and a dietitian monitored the food intake to the smallest fraction .
According to The Great Starvation Experiment ** , an excellent book about this famous study , during this lead - in phase the men ate well .
A typical days food would include
a typical lunch … [ that ] consisted of fricasseed lamb with gravy , peas , and a carrot and raisin salad .
For dinner … the men ate roast beef with gravy , whipped potatoes , tomato salad , and ice cream for dessert .
Although the three meals per day the men received added up to around 3,200 calories , which they were told approximated the normal American diet , the men said that they had never eaten better in their lives .
On day one of the starvation portion of the study , February 12 , 1945 , the rations were cut substantially .
The group shifted overnight from the three relatively generous meals of the control period to only two Spartan meals per day , a breakfast at 8:30 AM and supper at 5:00 PM .
The meals were designed to approximate the food available in European famine areas , with a heavy emphasis on potatoes , cabbage , and whole wheat bread .
Meat was provided in quantities so small that most men would swear in later years that none was included at all .
One of the three dinners included the following : SUPPER # 2 185 grams of bean - and pea soup ( made with 5 grams dried peas , 16 grams of dried beans , and 15 grams fresh ham ) 255 grams macaroni and cheese ( made with 130 grams wet macaroni , 12 grams lard , 108 grams skim milk , 2 grams flour , and 35 grams American cheese ) 40 grams rutabagas 100 grams steamed potatoes 100 grams lettuce salad ( 80 grams lettuce , 10 grams vinegar , 10 grams sugar )
The relatively bulky 255 grams of macaroni made that particular meal an anticipated favorite among the volunteers .
The wet macaroni served was roughly the amount required to fill a coffee mug about three - quarters full .
Over the twenty - four week starvation part of the study , the subjects not only lost a considerable percentage of their body weights , but suffered a number of problems as well .
As the time wore on the men thought ceaselessly about food , they became lethargic , they were cold all the time , they became depressed , they developed bleeding disorders , their ankles became edematous , and some developed more serious psychological disorders .
Below is a photo of one of the young men in this study ( the book shows multiple photographs – this one is typical of all the subjects ) .
The first photo was taken a couple of years prior to the start of the study , the second is with about a month shy of the end of the experiment .
This young man suffered such psychological turmoil from the semi-starvation that he chopped off several fingers of his left hand a month or so after the bottom picture was taken .
The men in this study consumed macronutrients in the following amounts daily : protein 100 gm , fat 30 gm , and carbohydrate 225 gm .
If you express these intakes as percentages , you come up with 25.5 % protein , 17.2 % fat and 57.3 % carbohydrate .
Average energy intake of the subjects in the experiment : 1570 calories per day .
Now let ’s look at another experiment conducted about 25 years later .
JOHN YUDKIN STUDY
In the late 1960s John Yudkin ’s group at the University of London performed a study that is most interesting in view of the Keys ’ semi-starvation study .
( Click here to get the complete pdf of this study )
For about 15 years Dr. Yudkin and his team had been running a weight loss clinic out of the university hospital using a low - carb dietary approach .
Despite the patients ’ doing well on the program , he and his staff had received the same criticisms all of us have who treat obese patients by restricting carbohydrates .
In addition , because of his academic standing and long list of scientific publications , Yudkin ’s peers had given him heat over the fact that his diet did n’t provide enough of all the vitamins and minerals required for health .
As a consequence , he decided to do a study to see if there was any substance to their fault - finding .
He recruited 11 subjects aged 21 - 51 years for his study .
He and his staff evaluated the regular diets of these 11 subjects over a two week period .
The volunteers were then instructed on the basics of low - carb dieting as it was done in the hospital clinic and followed for two weeks on this regimen .
The goal of the study was to determine the dietary intake of the essential nutrients in the low - carb diet to see if there were inadequacies .
Here were the low - carb instructions :
The instructions relating to the low carbohydrate diet were identical to those given to patients attending a hospital overweight clinic under our supervision .
Essentially , the subjects were asked to take between 10 and 20 oz milk daily ( about 300 - 600 ml ) , and as much meat , fish , eggs , cheese , butter , margarine , cream and leafy vegetables as they wished .
The amount of carbohydrate in other food was listed in “ units ” with each unit consisting of 5 g carbohydrate ; the subjects were told to limit these foods to not more than 10 units ( or 50 g ) carbohydrate daily .
As the low - carb portion of the study was progressing , Yudkin and his staff evaluated not only the intake of these subjects , but their mental status as well .
In conformity with our experience with this diet during the last 15 years , none of our subjects complained of hunger or any other ill effects ; on the other hand , several volunteered statements to the effect that they had increased feeling of well - being and decreased lassitude .
The average intake of calories and of protein , fat , and carbohydrate for the 11 subjects … were remarkably similar to those obtained for the six subjects of the previous study .
[ Yudkin had published a study in The Lancet in 1960 looking at the caloric and macronutrient intake of subjects on low - carb diets . ]
Here is the chart from Yudkin ’s paper showing the caloric and macronutrient changes when the subjects shifted from their regular diet to the low - carbohydrate diet .
The macronutrient consumption was 83 grams of protein , 105 grams of fat and 67 grams of carbohydrate .
Putting this into percentages of overall intake , we find that diet was 21.3 % protein , 60.6 % fat and 17.1 % carbohydrate .
The energy intake was 1560 calories per day , almost exactly the same as the Keys study described above .
And , remember , these people were given all the food they wanted to eat .
They were n’t forced to drop their calories to 1560 per day – they did it spontaneously because they had eaten until sated .
Here is the data in tabular form .
As you can see , the big difference is in the carbohydrate intake and fat intake .
They are just about the reverse of one another in the two studies .
Both studies provided between 1500 and 1600 kcal per day , but with huge differences in outcome .
In the Key ’s semi-starvation study ( high - carb , low - fat ) the subjects starved and obsessed on food constantly .
In the Yudkin study ( low - carb , high - fat ) , the subjects , who had no restriction on the amount of food they ate , volitionally consumed the same number of calories that the semi-starvation group did , yet reported that they had “ an increases feeling of well - being . ”
Instead of lethargy and depression reported by the Keys subjects on their low - fat , high - carb 1570 calories , those on the same number of low - carb , high - fat calories experienced “ decreased lassitude . ”
Both groups of subjects were consuming the same number of calories , but one group starved while the other did just fine .
One group had to be locked down to ensure they did n’t eat more than their alloted 1570 calories ; the other group voluntarily dropped their intake to 1560 calories and felt great .
What was the difference ?
Subjects in both groups ate the same number of calories .
Maybe , just maybe it ’s not the number of calories that makes the difference , but the composition of the calories instead .
I know that I ’m not truly comparing apples to apples with the Keys and the Yudkin studies .
But the Yudkin study does confirm Yudkin ’s 15 years of experience before he wrote his paper and they confirm my 20 plus years of experience taking care of patients on low - carb diets .
I ’ve had many , many patients who have stayed on low - carb diets for much , much longer than the men in Keys ’ experiment stayed on their diets of roughly the same number of calories .
Most of the papers in the medical literature on low - carb diets show a spontaneous drop in caloric intake that ’s about what Yudkin documented when people switch over to low - carb diets .
It stands to reason that if someone had replicated Keys ’ experiment using the same number of calories , but with much more fat and a lot less carbohydrate , that the outcome would have been much different .
Yet the calories would have been the same .
So , I ’ll say it again .
It ’s not simply a matter of calories , and anyone who says it is should perhaps give the issue a little more thought .
** Gary Taubes ’ book Good Calories , Bad Calories devotes a couple of pages to this semi-starvation study as well .

From Tuesday over - 60s in England get a free pass to travel on all local bus networks - leading some to consider how far they can go , gratis .
Senior citizen Richard Worrall , who has done it already , says do n't forget your timetables ... and your earmuffs .
After a thousand miles on 80 local buses in 11 days , Richard Worrall has put England 's bus services well and truly to the test .
And as he travelled from his home town of Walsall to Chester , then to the Lakes and Tyneside , down to Dover and Land 's End on the south coast , he did n't miss a single bus .
" The amazing thing was , the bus system worked so well , " says Mr Worrall , 63 .
" There were some lovely bus stations - of course , there were some awful ones as well !
" It 's much better than people make out .
You 're standing in the dark waiting for a bus , thinking ' is it going to turn up ? ' and then it does .
Richard Worrall ( left ) travelled round the UK , using 80 different local buses " There were delays , but then I anticipated that .
The problems I had were mainly in the morning , when I was travelling before 9.30 . "
Ahead of Tuesday 's move to provide free bus travel throughout the country to all those who are over 60 or are disabled , the former Walsall mayor decided the best way to highlight the potential benefits of bus travel was to get on a bus .
Again .
And again .
And again .
Doing it now under the new rules would save him about £ 180 .
And as well as impressed by the bus services , he was also reminded what a picturesque country he lives in .
" We should n't undersell how beautiful England is , and think we have to go somewhere else , " he says .
" Seeing it all at once is like putting together a jigsaw . "
ACROSS ENGLAND ON A BUS
This is how to get from Penzance to Berwick - on - Tweed in six days Unlike Mr Worrall 's journey , all these buses are after 0930 to qualify for free travel
Day - by - day timetable
And this form of travel for long - distance journeys could be just the ticket , he believes .
" It 's free and the benefits are universal .
It does n't matter if you 're rich or poor , it holds massive benefits for improving your quality of life .
" Because older people are so over - reliant on their cars , they do tend to worry about getting to the point when they can no longer drive " , says Mr Worrall , who has only driven a car a handful of times in the past 20 years .
" This shows that it 's not the end of your life when you can't drive a car . "
Travelling on local buses also provides a unique insight into England 's rural areas , Mr Worrall says .
" The nature of local bus services is that they wander off the main roads to villages , many of which are just gorgeous .
A lot of the buses were double - deckers , and sitting at the top I had a great grandstand view .
" The only problem was the British weather - when I was travelling from Tyneside to Dover , there was fog the whole way down .
I missed out on some fabulous views . "
Ear-muffs
His key tips for other adventurers include be prepared and take timetables with you , use the internet if possible and one other vital piece of advice .
This scheme will open up tremendous opportunities for travel around our country
Councillor Mark Dowd , Chair of Merseytravel
" I 've learnt that people who play loud music can crop up anywhere , so if I did it again I would take my earmuffs ! "
Over 60s in Scotland , Northern Ireland and Wales already enjoy free national bus travel and the National Pensioners ' Convention ( NPC ) would like the scheme to cross the borders within the UK .
The NPC says over - 60s should not be seen as " a drain on local government resources " and it is unhappy the benefit does not extend to attending medical appointments before 9.30 am or travel for carers of elderly or disabled people .
But these concerns will not stop the more enthusiastic over - 60s from taking advantage straight away .
Bus operators are preparing for the influx of older travellers , especially undertaking long - distance journeys .
" This is a great scheme which will benefit thousands of people , opening up tremendous opportunities for travel around our country " , said Councillor Mark Dowd , Chair of Merseytravel .
On Tuesday , to mark the first day , Mr Worrall is taking 25 friends on a bus trip from Bridgnorth to Ironbridge , tracing the route of the Severn Valley railway .
" We 're having a free day out , and we 'll all be flashing our passes !
In the summer , I 'm planning to get a group together to go and see the Eden Project , travelling down on local buses .
" It 'll be a wander to the South West and then a wander back , taking different routes through some lovely country .
If you find a couple of nice country pubs to stop at , what could be better than that ? "
Below is a selection of your comments .
These baby boomers really know how to look after themselves .
Their war veteran parents over the last 20 years had to pay .
Never heard them getting free national bus travel .
And their kids had to get out big loans to go to University while they got full grants .
The FREEBIE generation .
Jon , Northumberland Fantastic , I can't wait until I am 60 next year .
Richard Worrall has shown us what can be done !
Eileen from Norfolk will have to wait ¿ it is right , older people have contributed all their lives so this is one of their ' just ' rewards and about time too !!
Susan , Crawley UK
The NPC is " unhappy the benefit does not extend to attending medical appointments before 9.30 am " .
Why do pensioners need to be at appointments first thing in the morning ?
They have all day to visit the GP - I do n't .
Given all the recent discussion about doctor 's opening times , can't they leave the early morning appointments for the rest of us who then have to get to work afterwards ?!
Robert , Glasgow Misguided , that word " free " !
Yes , the pensioners will get a nice free ride but everyone else will be forced to subsidise it via higher bus prices .
Good PR for the government ; everyone else however will suffer further price increases .
The bus companies will not let us off the hook as they still have to pay for the services .
Gordon Brown cheers
Richard Kendrick , Leeds
That trip sounded fantastic .... sure wish it had been in place when we were last over home in ' 95 .
We did a bus tour that was wonderful but cost the earth .
This would have been terrific .
Congratulations on taking the senior into consideration and giving them something they can really make use of .
Even a one - day outing would be good for body , mind and soul .
Joan Clarke , Kingston , Ontario , Canada
I think it a fabulous idea to allow free bus travel and I hope it encourages more pensioners to get out and about , now they do n't have to worry about the cost .
But what about the rest of us ?
Those on benefits or low incomes , single parent families and full - time students ?
They are still discouraged from using public transport .
As much as they say it wo n't , I can't help be feel that this will also cause a price increase for the rest of us .
Sarah - Jane , Leicester I 've recently turned 60 but never bothered to apply for a bus pass because it 's easier to use the car for local trips and generally not worth the hassle .
Now the bus can be used nationally , my application is in the post !
I plan to visit relatives and get out and about as much as possible without the need to be the driver all the time .
Bill Hodges , Telford
As a disabled person , I will find the pass most useful when visiting unfamiliar towns and cities .
I can use my car to drive to the outskirts of London or Birmingham or Manchester and then use the buses .
No fares , no worries , no hassle , no stress .
Best of all , because the scheme is now national , I do n't have to worry about different areas having different passes .
Ray Penn , Eaglescliffe
Now all my Dad needs is a bus route which comes within walking distance of the house !
More minibus routes are needed on housing estate roads , and routes to key locations such as hospitals and clinics .
Jan , Brum
So old people get free bus passes , what about young people ?
Will we have to cope with those ever rising bus fares ?
It 's not fair for us , students have a lot to finance and travelling by bus is often a big cost for getting to college or other places .
Eileen , Norfolk
What a terrific idea .
Now that 's using your noodle , a really good incentive for the older generation to finally get to see their home .
Well done UK .

Here we go again .
YouTube have emailed to say the above clip infringes copyright of Philip Morris USA .
Now that 's a funny thing .
I got the video from the Internet Archive who list it as In the Public Domain and its gotta be at least 50 years old ( its listed as " 1948 " but I 'm not sure .
The car looks like a MG TC which were in production from 1945 - 50 ) .
YouRube say to fight this I must -

Well bugger that , you Nazis .
I 'll just host it with BlipTV - they have much better quality and much better attitude than you bunch of c**ts .
Oh yeah ... funny thing ... go to YouTube and search " Marlboro Man " and you 'll see there are hundreds of commercials posted - even some 80's versions .
But as I 've pointed out elsewhere , there is no way you can contact YouRube to discuss this other than the steps they mention above .
Land of the Free , Home of the Brave anyone ?
But while we should be asking what George Bush and his cabinet knew and failed to respond to before September 11 , we should also be exploring another , related , question : what do they know now and yet still refuse to act upon ?
Another way of asking the question is this : whatever happened to the anthrax investigation ?
After five letters containing anthrax spores had been posted , in the autumn , to addresses in the United States , the Federal Bureau of Investigation promised that it would examine " every bit of information [ and ] every bit of evidence " .
But now the investigation appears to have stalled .
Microbiologists in the US are beginning to wonder aloud whether the FBI 's problem is not that it knows too little , but that it knows too much .
Reducing the number of suspects would not , one might have imagined , have been too much to ask of the biggest domestic detective agency on earth .
While some of the anthrax the terrorist sent was spoiled during delivery , one sample appears to have come through intact .
The letter received by Senator Tom Daschle contained one trillion anthrax spores per gram : a concentration which only a very few US government scientists , using a secret and strictly controlled technique , know how to achieve .
It must , moreover , have been developed in a professional laboratory , containing rare and sophisticated " weaponisation " equipment .
There is only a tiny number of facilities - all of them in the US - in which it could have been produced .
The anthrax the terrorist sent belongs to the " Ames " strain of the bacterium , which was extracted from an infected cow in Texas in 1981 .
In December , the Washington Post reported that genetic tests showed that the variety used by the terrorist was a sub-strain cultivated by scientists at the US army 's medical research institute for infectious diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
That finding was publicly confirmed two weeks ago , when the test results were published in the journal Science .
New Scientist magazine notes that the anthrax the terrorist used appears to have emerged from Fort Detrick only recently , as the researchers found that samples which have been separated from each other for three years acquire " substantial genetic differences " .
The Ames strain was distributed by USAMRIID to around 20 other laboratories in the US .
Of these , according to research conducted by Barbara Hatch Rosenberg , who runs the Federation of American Scientists ' biological weapons monitoring programme , only four possess the equipment and expertise required for the weaponisation of the anthrax sent to Senator Daschle .
Three of them are US military laboratories , the fourth is a government contractor .
While security in all these places has been lax , the terrorist could not have stolen all the anthrax ( around 10 grams ) which found its way into the postal system .
He must have used the equipment to manufacture it .
Barbara Hatch Rosenberg has produced a profile of the likely perpetrator .
He is an American working within the US biodefense industry , with a doctoral degree in the relevant branch of microbiology .
He is skilled and experienced at handling the weapon without contaminating his surroundings .
He has full security clearance and access to classified information .
He is among the tiny number of Americans who had received anthrax vaccinations before September 2001 .
Only a handful of people fit this description .
Rosenberg has told the internet magazine Salon.com that three senior scientists have identified the same man - a former USAMRIID scientist - as the likely suspect .
She , and they , have told the FBI , but it seems that all the bureau has done in response is to denounce her .
Instead , it has launched the kind of " investigation " which might have been appropriate for the unwitnessed hit and run killing of a person with no known enemies .
Rather than homing in on the likely suspects , in other words , it appears to have cast a net full of holes over the entire population .
In January , three months after the first anthrax attack and at least a month after it knew that the sub - strain used by the attacker came from Fort Detrick , the FBI announced a reward of $ 2.5 m for information leading to his capture .
It circulated 500,000 fliers , and sent letters to all 40,000 members of the American Society for Microbiology , asking them whether they knew someone who might have done it .
Yet , while it trawled the empty waters , the bureau failed to cast its hook into the only ponds in which the perpetrator could have been lurking .
In February , the Wall Street Journal revealed that the FBI had yet to subpoena the personnel records of the labs which had been working with the Ames strain .
Four months after the investigation began , in other words , it had not bothered to find out who had been working in the places from which the anthrax must have come .
It was not until March , after Barbara Hatch Rosenberg had released her findings , that the bureau started asking laboratories for samples of their anthrax and the records relating to them .
To date , it appears to have analysed only those specimens which already happened to be in the hands of its researchers or which had been offered , without compulsion , by laboratories .
A fortnight ago , the New York Times reported that " government experts investigating the anthrax strikes are still at sea " .
The FBI claimed that the problem " is a lack of advisers skilled in the subtleties of germ weapons " .
Last week , I phoned the FBI .
Why , I asked , when the evidence was so abundant , did the trail appear to have gone cold ?
" The investigation is continuing , " the spokesman replied .
" Has it gone cold because it has led you to a government office ? " I asked .
He put down the phone .
Had he stayed on the line , I would have asked him about a few other offences the FBI might wish to consider .
The army 's development of weaponised anthrax , for example , directly contravenes both the biological weapons convention and domestic law .
So does its plan to test live microbes in " aerosol chambers " at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center , also in Maryland .
So does its development of a genetically modified fungus for attacking coca crops in Colombia , and GM bacteria for destroying materials belonging to enemy forces .
These , as the research group Project Sunshine has discovered , appear to be just a tiny sample of the illegal offensive biological research programmes which the US government has secretly funded .
Several prominent scientists have suggested that the FBI 's investigation is being pursued with less than the rigour we might have expected because the federal authorities have something to hide .
The FBI has dismissed them as conspiracy theorists .
But there is surely a point after which incompetence becomes an insufficient explanation for failure .

Regional tensions have risen in the lead - up to the summit
Ecuador 's Rafael Correa condemned Colombia's " aggression " in his opening speech in the Dominican Republic .
His Colombian counterpart , President Alvaro Uribe , responded with claims Mr Correa had links to Farc rebels and had not co-operated in fighting terrorism .
Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez had called for a cooling of tensions over the raid .
The operation left some 20 rebels dead , including a senior Farc commander , Raul Reyes , but has had massive political repercussions in Latin America .
Venezuela and Ecuador , which cut diplomatic ties and sent troops to their borders after the incursion , have demanded a strong apology from Colombia .
As arguments continued at the summit , the Colombian defence ministry said another senior Farc rebel , Ivan Rios , had been killed by his own men - this time in the western Colombia province of Caldas .
Rios was the youngest man on Farc 's seven - member secretariat .
Farc letter
Mr Uribe told Latin American leaders gathered at the Rio Group summit in Santo Domingo that if he had alerted Ecuador about the raid that killed Reyes , it would have failed .
We did n't inform him because we have not had co-operation from the government of President Correa in the fight against terrorism
Alvaro Uribe
Colombian President
He said Ecuador 's president had not co-operated in the fight against terrorism , adding that the operation was " against one of the most tenacious terrorists in the history of humanity " .
He quoted a letter allegedly seized in the raid as evidence Mr Correa had links to the Colombian rebels .
Mr Uribe said Reyes had written to Farc leader Manuel Marulanda saying : " We wait for the visit of the Ecuadoran security minister and he has greetings from President Correa to commander Marulanda . "
Ecuador has moved soldiers towards its border with Colombia
Mr Correa rejected the accusations , calling them lies .
" These hands are not tainted with blood , " he said .
Mr Correa admitted there had been communications with Farc , but because his government was trying to secure the release of hostages held by the rebels , including former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt .
He said Ecuador was paying a high price for Colombia 's civil conflict spilling over onto its territory .
He added that it was the fault of Colombia , not Ecuador that rebels had crossed the border .
' Chill nerves '
The summit's host , Dominican President Leonel Fernandez , had earlier said he hoped the summit would be a chance to " consolidate relations " .
He had been trying to find consensus on the wording of a declaration on the dispute .
Correspondents say key countries like Brazil and Chile will also be working to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
Before the start of the summit , Mr Chavez said he hoped the summit would be positive .
" People should go cool off a bit , chill out their nerves , " he told journalists at his hotel before leaving for the summit , AP news agency reports .
" I think the meeting today is going to be positive , because it is going to help the debate .
We have to debate , talk , and this is the first step toward finding the road . "
Mr Correa , who has been touring Latin American capitals to rally opposition to Colombia , said Colombia had to promise not to violate its neighbour 's territory and end its allegations that Ecuador supported the guerrillas .
" Of course we can put an end to ... the conflict in this meeting ...
It 's as easy as hearing unconditional apologies from President Alvaro Uribe , " Mr Correa said on arrival in the Dominican Republic .
For his part , Mr Chavez , a staunch opponent of the Bush administration , alleged that the US was involved in planning and directing the cross - border operation .
He repeatedly accuses the Colombian government , which receives billions of dollars in US aid to fight drug - trafficking , of being a lackey of Washington .
Arrests
Mr Uribe says he has already apologised to Ecuador and has also called on Colombia 's neighbours to do more to stop rebels taking refuge in their territory .
On the eve of the summit , Ecuador announced that it had captured five alleged Farc guerrillas .
Defence minister Gustavo Larrea said the suspected rebels were detained by the army during a search of farms and houses close to the Colombian border .
The Rio Group meeting was scheduled long before the crisis erupted .
If you 're vaguely remembering a mention of MLD , you 're not crazy .
Around this time last year , PureDepth announced that it was teaming up with Samsung to crank out a 46 - inch Multi - Layer Display LCD .
Fast forward to now , and we 're hearing that the first MLD wares should be hitting the streets relatively soon .
The technology itself consists of building displays that are in fact two or more layers of LCD panel that share a common back - light source , thus creating a depth effect when viewing material .
As it stands , the outfit has signed agreements with Samsung ( obviously ) for development of displays in mobile handsets and Sanyo for mobiles , gaming solutions and automotive electronics ( including in - car navigation ) .
Interestingly enough , Q1 2008 saw quite the surge in support for the 3D sector , making the launch of MLD that much more applicable to the apparent desires of content viewers .
Check out a few sample images and product prototypes in the gallery below .

Gee , why would queer youth want an escape ?
by Jeremy Hooper
" You 're a f*ggot ! " " Your feelings are sick and wrong ! "
" Gay people are fun to shop with and plan weddings and stuff , but you do n't want to become one ! "
" Unless you ' change , ' you 're going to Hell ! "
" Do n't look at me again or I 'll kick your ass ! "
" Why ca n't you just be ' normal ' like you 're brother and sister ? "
A new University of Pittsburgh study indicates that lesbian , gay , and bi youth are on average 190 % more likely to use and abuse substances than their heterosexual peers .
And while those who keep gay bias alive and ( un ) well under the mask of " pro-family " compassion would never cite the above phrases and mindsets as the key reasons why gay kids are often in desperate search of an escapist outlet , those of us who 've actually had the queer experience know the truth behind these findings :
The very easy solution to this ?
Well ...
" You 're part of the spectrum of the world 's normalcy ! "
You 're fine just the way you are . "
It 's absurd that you would ' choose ' this . "
" You 're as entitled to love and happiness as your brother and sister . "
" Homosexuality is and has always been part of the human condition . "
" You can take whoever you want to prom . "
" Homosexuality is not something with which you should ' struggle ' anymore than one struggles with heterosexuality -- biology should not be a mindfuck . "
...it's even more simplistic than the Reagan era " just say no " campaign .
Your thoughts
But if you do that , you 'll be recruiting kids into a destructive lifestyle !!!!

I 'm sure it does n't help that ' fag ' and ' gay ' have become synonymous with ' dumb ' and ' stupid ' in schools .
Now even people who are supposedly non-homophobic are saying ' Stop being such a fag . '
' That shirt 's so gay . '
Teachers do n't care at all , yet I doubt they 'd allow ' Stop being such a N - - - - r ' , ' Stop being such a Jew . '
I wo n't abuse substances , it 's not a good outlet for me .
I 'll just stick to internalizing it and feeling depressed .

I think you want to be a little careful about how you state their findings .
They say the * odds * are 190 percent higher
The way you have it stated , " on average 190 % more likely " , would mean that if I have 10 GLBT youth , 19 of them are going to use drugs and alcohol ?
The way they have it stated ( arbitrarily , I do n't know the exact numbers ) 1/10 hetero youth will use drugs and alcohol whereas 2.9/10 GLBT youth will use drugs and alcohol .
Its been a while since I had Prob & Stats , so please correct me if I 'm wrong .
But that 190 percent figure is terribly misleading IMHO

To be clear in my last post , I 'm not trying to diminish their findings .
And really , since you do say " more likely " and not 190 percent * of * GLBT ... you probably are correct in your statement .
I 'm just anal and quoting 190 percent , 300 percent , etc. makes me terribly uncomfortable .

If you encourage gay youth , you 're encouraging the destruction of civilization !
But honestly , I can see some truth to this in my own experiences .
When I look at everyone I know , most of the people who smoke cigarettes or pot , drink , and try other drugs are gay .
That 's not to say straight people do n't fall into the same thing .
Everyone has stresses and pressures in life , and substances can seem like an easy way out .
However , I think that pressures are different for minorities , especially GLBT people , because they do not have the same kind of legal protections as other groups .
I myself have been tempted , and if not for family history , I might have tried out these " escapes . "
Despite homophobia and other discrimination i've faced , I have been lucky enough to have family and friends who support me .
It 's very unfortunate that everyone does n't have the same support system , and I hope that someday , everyone does .

Watching the Prime Minister 's chief of staff under fire for allegedly exposing Democratic hopeful Barack Obama 's two - faced campaign against the free trade agreement , one thought kept going through my head .
What a moron .
No , no — not Ian Brodie , the brilliant sidekick of Prime Minister Stephen Harper who is now under all - party assault in the House of Commons as the suspected source of a leak with the potential to damage U.S. relations .
No , it was an echo from the last PMO aide who attracted the attention of American presidential politics , specifically the spokesman for former prime minister Jean Chrétien who , in 2002 , was overheard saying " what a moron " to describe President George W. Bush .
Francie Ducros may have been prescient , as it turns out , but that one casual phrase had Opposition leaders , including Stephen Harper , demanding her scalp as the price for triggering an international incident .
" We witnessed the insult that was heard around the world , " Mr. Harper yelped at the time .
The trouble is that , except for her dismissal , it 's eerily similar to the Ian Brodie scenario .
And you could argue Mr. Brodie 's alleged observation that Senator Obama 's opposition to elements of NAFTA was primary positioning and unlikely to become presidential policy , is actually much , much more dangerous than the Ducros backlash .
Just how seriously the Prime Minister is taking a leak credited ( or blamed ) for tilting Democrat opinion against Senator Obama in the Ohio primary this week was reflected in his abrupt change in tone Thursday .
His emphatic denial of Mr. Brodie 's culpability in the mess Wednesday was watered down yesterday to a stone - faced shrug and promise to follow all the recommendations of a leak - plugging investigation inside his bureaucracy .
So flailingly desperate was Mr. Harper for a decent response that he actually chided the Liberals for not raising a ruckus against his government on the NAFTA scandal earlier .
At least Liberal leader Stéphane Dion had enough spontaneous smarts to retort he would have gone on the attack earlier , but it was hard to pick among so many scandals .
Gosh .
Does Mr. Harper think it 's easy to make priorities ?
The media machinations of this are interesting , even if a tad inside baseball .
Mr. Brodie allegedly shared his insight with CTV journalists during a long and boring budget lockup , who dutifully reported the drift of the conversation while protecting their source .
But somehow Mr. Brodie 's identity was picked up by the ABC television network .
And after a CTV reporter confided that Mr. Brodie was the source of his leak to a journalism class , it was only a matter of time before his identify reached the ears of intrepid CBC reporter Susan Bonner for her newscast - topping story .
Thus we have the scenario of a CTV source being outed on an American and a rival Canadian network .
My head hurts .
It may just be a misread of his body and language , but Mr. Harper seemed severely vexed at the ugly possibility of having the original source of the leak working just a few steps from his office .

ONE great puzzle about the recent housing bubble is why even most experts did n’t recognize the bubble as it was forming .
Alan Greenspan , a very serious student of the markets , did n’t see it , and , moreover , he did n’t see the stock market bubble of the 1990s , either .
In his 2007 autobiography , “ The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World , ” he talks at some length about his suspicions in the 1990s that there was irrational exuberance in the stock market .
But in the end , he says , he just could n’t figure it out : “ I ’d come to realize that we ’d never be able to identify irrational exuberance with certainty , much less act on it , until after the fact . ”
With the housing bubble , Mr. Greenspan did n’t seem to have any doubt : “ I would tell audiences that we were facing not a bubble but a froth  lots of small local bubbles that never grew to a scale that could threaten the health of the overall economy . ”
The failure to recognize the housing bubble is the core reason for the collapsing house of cards we are seeing in financial markets in the United States and around the world .
If people do not see any risk , and see only the prospect of outsized investment returns , they will pursue those returns with disregard for the risks .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Private security companies operate without supervision or accountability in war zones , including Iraq and Afghanistan , and represent a new form of mercenary activity , a United Nations report said on Tuesday .

Private security companies operate without supervision or accountability in war zones , including Iraq and Afghanistan , and represent a new form of mercenary activity , a United Nations report said on Tuesday .
Private U.S. security firms have come under scrutiny since a shooting in September in which Blackwater guards working for the State Department were accused of killing 17 Iraqis in Baghdad .
REUTERS / Peter Andrews / Files
The United States ’ reliance on private contractors has fuelled a growing demand for former police and military personnel in developing countries to be recruited as “ security guards ” who in fact serve as private armed soldiers , it said .
These forces enjoy de facto impunity under national laws that grant immunity to private military and private security company personnel , according to the U.N. working group on the use of mercenaries .
Its report will be presented to the General Assembly on Wednesday .
“ The trend towards outsourcing and privatizing various military functions by a number of member states in the past 10 years has resulted in the mushrooming of private military and security companies , ” the report said .
Many companies have contracts with the Pentagon or U.S. State Department , it said , citing a “ tremendous increase in the number of private military and private security companies connected with the conflict situations in Afghanistan and Iraq ” .
Private security guards are considered by some governments to be neither civilians nor combatants , though they are heavily armed , the report said .
“ They are new modalities of mercenarism , ” it said , likening them to the notion of “ irregular combatants ” .
“ In many instances , these ‘ private security guards ’ have encountered contractual irregularities , poor working conditions , a failure to satisfy basic needs and problems in obtaining financial compensation for injuries received , ” it added .
Private U.S. security firms have come under scrutiny since a shooting in September in which Blackwater guards working for the State Department were accused of killing 17 Iraqis in Baghdad .
The North Carolina - based firm employs 1,000 people in Iraq who protect U.S. diplomats and other officials .
The incident led the Iraqi government to approve a draft law to scrap a decree issued by the U.S. - led Coalition Provisional Authority in 2004 , before it handed over control to Iraqis , which granted foreign contractors immunity from prosecution .
The five - member U.N. panel , set up two years ago , carried out investigations in countries including Chile , Fiji and Peru , where many contracted guards in Iraq and Afghanistan come from .
It encouraged countries whose nationals work as private security employees to avoid granting immunity to military contracting firms and their personnel .
In Chile , for example , “ although contracted as security guards , the recruits were allegedly provided with military training by private companies in the United States , Jordan or Iraq and eventually performed military functions , ” it said .
The panel called for more countries to sign up to the International Convention against the Recruitment , Use , Financing and Training of Mercenaries , which only 30 have ratified .
I think different social news sites have different overall objectives and cater to different audiences of the Internet .
You can probably learn anything you need to know about interacting with these networks in a neat social media manual and other experts have summed up social media in a nutshell , but I would like to share 5 things I think anyone can benefit from social networking .
Networking , social media has played a big role in meeting some of top names in the business and has given me the chance to share my views with them .
Branding , social media is branding since my avatar or handle is right there next to every post I submit .
Clearly that can work both ways towards your overall trust and creditability .
In the know , today I find it one of the biggest challenges to stay on top of what is hot and what is not .?
I just ca n’t search 20,000 blogs on a daily basis to stay up to date with what is going on in the world .
Intelligence , knowledge simply gained as I try to become an active participant in different networks .??
On a daily basis I find myself reading , researching , and exploring new things .
Attacks on him are really attacks on the black church , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. said in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington on Monday , in which he mounted a spirited defense of views and sermons that have become an issue in the presidential campaign because Senator Barack Obama attended his church for many years .
Mr. Wright told the press club audience that the black church in America grew out of the oppression of black people , and that his sermons reflected that struggle .
Snippets from his sermons have been used in Republican commercials seeking to depict Senator Obama as unpatriotic , and the Democratic presidential candidate has given a carefully calibrated speech seeking to distance himself from Mr. Wright ’s more inflammatory statements .
Speaking Monday , Mr. Wright said that political opponents of Senator Obama were exploiting the fact that the style of prayer and preaching in black churches was different from European church traditions 
“ Different , but not deficient , ” he said .
This past week at the Mozilla headquarters in Mountain View , we talked to user experience design expert Alex Faaborg about the Firefox 3 visual refresh .
He shared some insights about the interface design process and talked about some of Mozilla 's goals for refining the look and feel of the Firefox user experience .
An integrated experience
Platform integration has been a very high priority for the Firefox 3 development cycle .
Visual consistency with the underlying operating system is important , says Faaborg , because it creates a more seamless user experience and makes it easier for the user to focus on web content rather than on the web browser .
This is a significant reversal from the strategy behind the Firefox 2 theme , which was designed to have a similar appearance across all platforms .
For Firefox 3 , separate icons and themes have been implemented for Windows XP , Windows Vista , Mac OS X , and Linux .
Firefox 3 theme for Vista
The Firefox 3 theme for Windows XP
The Firefox 3 theme for Linux
The Firefox 3 theme for Mac OS X
Although platform consistency is strongly emphasized in the individual Firefox 3 themes , Faaborg also labored to ensure that the layout of the user interface is similar enough on each platform so that users can transition between operating systems and continue using Firefox without having to retrain their muscle memory or adapt to new user interface paradigms .
Another one of his goals was to create several specific user interface characteristics — such as the keyhole shape for the back and forward buttons — that could be employed consistently across all of the platforms to establish a universally recognizable visual identity for the browser .
Creating the Windows Vista theme posed some unique challenges because the developers had a bit of trouble figuring out where to use certain Vista - specific aesthetic flourishes like black dialog toolbars .
Another weakness in the Firefox 3 Vista theme is the lack of support for transparency .
Faaborg says that full compositing - based transparency support is n't planned for Firefox 3 but will eventually arrive in a future version .
This will mostly likely be implemented as a special CSS property so that individual Firefox themes on Vista will be able to use it too .
For now , he says , there are already some third - party themes that use various hacks to add transparency support .
Community coders ... and artists
I asked Faaborg about the extent of community involvement in Firefox artwork development .
Members of the open - source community have contributed many icons and have helped in a number of other ways .
Some of the custom Linux icons , for instance , were created by the Tango designers .
Few artists were interested in doing the Windows work , however , so Mozilla ended up hiring The Iconfactory to do complete sets for Windows Vista and Windows XP .
Faaborg has watched user feedback closely throughout the entire design process and made some changes in response to valid criticisms .
One example of this is the Home button , which was controversially placed on the bookmarks toolbar by default in a previous beta build and has now been moved back to the navigation bar because of complaints from users who did n't have their bookmarks bar enabled and consequently could n't find the Home button .
Google beats bookmarks
Although the visual style and theme of the application are the most highly visible aspect of his work , Faaborg notes that interaction design goes much deeper than the browser 's surface .
Many subtle usability enhancements that are included in Firefox 3 improve the overall user experience and make complex features more easily accessible .
One example that he cites is the new single - click bookmark system .
Usability testing revealed that many users eschew bookmarks entirely and simply use Google because it often requires less effort .
The single - click bookmark system removes a lot of unnecessary complexity and makes bookmarks a valuable feature for a broader segment of the user population without crippling some of the more advanced bookmarking capabilities — like support for nested hierarchical structures — that are appreciated by power users .
The Firefox 3 bookmark popup
The work done by Faaborg and many others to improve theming and usability in Firefox 3 is very apparent in the recent beta and nightly builds .
The browser finally fits in with the rest of the operating system and shines with a level of polish that we have never seen before in previous versions of Firefox .
Air marshal whistleblowers claim agency hides behind national security David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The head of the Transportation Security Administration appeared at a Congressional hearing this week to rebut charges recently made by CNN that the air marshal program , which was greatly expanded after 9/11 to prevent further hijackings , is now protecting less than 1 % of US flights .
" That number is absolutely wrong by an order of magnitude , and it was a guess by the folks there [ at CNN ] , " Kip Hawley told the committee .
The actual percentage of flights with marshals is considered a national security secret , but whistleblowers have informed CNN that TSA tells its own agents at least 5 % of flights are covered , a figure the whistleblowers do not find credible .
They suggest that the agency is hiding behind a cloak of national security to avoid revealing the true numbers .
One former air marshal , who quit the service in 2006 because of what he saw as declining standards , said that many marshals are leaving and not being replaced .
He told CNN that the Los Angeles office even began assigning offices to short , no -risk flights -- like the hop from Los Angeles to Las Vegas -- just to inflate their numbers .
Pilots and regular fliers confirmed that you can go for months without ever seeing a marshal on board .
Rep. Sheila Jackson - Lee ( D - TX ) began holding closed door meetings with the air marshal service this month to determine whether TSA has been lying to Congressional oversight committees .
" The air marshals have suggested that not only to you , " Jackson - Lee told CNN , " but they 've suggested that to members of Congress , and we are concerned .
We too are not interested in having funny numbers . "
CNN further reports that recruiting and training standards have been lowered because of the lack of applicants .
Mandatory psychological testing has been dropped , and a former weapons instructor indicated that the tough federal tactical pistol course was replaced with a test that recruits could more easily pass .
TSA acknowledges the changes but denies that they have compromised safety .
Whistleblowers even told CNN that airport screeners with no military or law enforcement background are being hired to fill the gaps .
" To me it 's more of an embarrassment to be a member of that agency that would allow that particular individual to make it through the training program , " stated one anonymous whistleblower .
" I know I do n't want them on my flight . "
The Air Marshall Service has been having retention problems at least since 2004 , when the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on the matter .
US News & World Report suggested then that " [ Director Thomas ]
Quinn will be able to train and deploy at least 200 more marshals with the $ 50 million raise Congress is giving the service next year , but it wo n't be enough to make up for the marshals expected to leave their jobs .
About 10 percent of the new marshals resigned between 9/11 and July 2003 , according to the Government Accountability Office .
Quinn says the current annual attrition rate is about 6.3 percent . "
CNN has more on the story here .
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast April 16 , 2008 .

House Democrats and the White House have reached an agreement on an economic stimulus plan .
Unfortunately , the plan  which essentially consists of nothing but tax cuts and gives most of those tax cuts to people in fairly good financial shape  looks like a lemon .
Specifically , the Democrats appear to have buckled in the face of the Bush administration ’s ideological rigidity , dropping demands for provisions that would have helped those most in need .
And those happen to be the same provisions that might actually have made the stimulus plan effective .
Those are harsh words , so let me explain what ’s going on .
Aside from business tax breaks  which are an unhappy story for another column  the plan gives each worker making less than $ 75,000 a $ 300 check , plus additional amounts to people who make enough to pay substantial sums in income tax .
This ensures that the bulk of the money would go to people who are doing O.K. financially  which misses the whole point .
The goal of a stimulus plan should be to support overall spending , so as to avert or limit the depth of a recession .
If the money the government lays out does n’t get spent  if it just gets added to people ’s bank accounts or used to pay off debts  the plan will have failed .
Bush recently told Israeli reporters : “ I 'll be dead before the true history of the Bush administration is written . ”
Over his dead body ?
Perhaps he meant that his " good works " would be told later , but as long as we let him keep his iron grip on presidential records , it could be several generations of Bushes before we know much of anything .
In 2001 , Bush signed Executive Order 13233 to allow current and previous presidents to withhold documents and records without explanation INDEFINITELY .
What ’s more , the order extends the presidents ’ authority to control the records under to presidential family members , and vice presidents .
This unprecedented expansion of executive power flouts FOIA , precedent , and the principles of the Constitution .
The order , drafted by former Attorney General and close Bush friend Alberto Gonzales , eviscerates the post - Watergate Presidential Records
Act , which made presidential records the property of the government , and then the public .
Our right to know should not be subject to the whims of the executive .
Legislation to repeal the order passed the House , but has been repeatedly blocked in the Senate .
First Senator Bunning was named as the holder .
After feeling some pressure , Sen .
Bunning removed his hold , and then friends of ours in the Senate attempted again to bring the bill up for a vote just before the holiday break .
It did n’t happen because , we are told , there is another objection from another unknown senator – no doubt carrying more water for the President .
Sound familiar ?
Meanwhile , the nation is consumed by one of the more thrilling primary elections in memory .
But where do the presidential candidates stand on the Presidential Records Act and presidential secrecy ?
Senator Clinton recently was accused , perhaps unfairly , of preventing public access to Clinton Administration records .
Still , Senator Clinton is conspicuously not a cosponsor of the bill that would revoke the Bush Executive Order , the Presidential Records Act Amendments .
Why not ?
It ’s been nearly two months since Philipe Reines , a spokesman for Clinton 's Senate office , told the Tribune that " Senator Clinton believes that President Bush 's 2001 Executive Order was wholly unnecessary and is inconsistent with the spirit of the Presidential Records Act , and therefore supports legislative efforts to reverse that order . "
We ’re still waiting for Clinton , and most of the other presidential candidates , to demonstrate that they believe the records belong to the people , not the President .
So far , only Senator Obama has put his name on the bill .
So while the world is enthralled with the presidential horse race , presidential records are hidden away and transparency transgressed again and again .
We ca n’t forget that much of our government remains in the hands of a few , until we take it back – again and again .
If Consumers Will Pay $ 50 To Remove It , What 's It Doing There In The First Place ?
from the penny - wise - pound - foolish dept
That did n't take long .
On Friday morning , PC World reported that that it would offer a " Fresh Start " option on certain of its laptops : for an extra $ 50 , Sony would remove all the annoying " trial software " that apparently infests a lot of PC laptops these days ( as a smug Mac user , I ca n't say I 've experienced this firsthand ) .
Not surprisingly , the announcement generated a firestorm of controversy , and within hours , Sony 's PR reps rushed out to reassure people that it was all a big misunderstanding .
Sony wo n't charge for " Fresh Start " after all , and will instead offer it as a free option .
But only on certain laptops and only for customers who upgrade to the business version of Vista .
The fact that it thought of offering such a service at all -- for a fee or otherwise -- suggests that Sony has a rather short - sighted attitude toward its business .
PC manufacturers reportedly get as much as $ 60 per PC in kickbacks from software vendors to put trial software on their customers ' computers .
Apparently , in the low - margin PC business , that 's too much cash to pass up .
But putting bloatware on PCs is a bad strategy for precisely the same reason that filling your website with intrusive ads is a bad strategy .
It might make more money in the short run , but it ruins your brand and reduces the chances you 'll get repeat customers .
The reason that customers choose a name - brand PC over a dirt - cheap white - label one is that they want to minimize hassles .
A good name - brand manufacturer carefully chooses components that will ensure a hassle - free experience .
It would be stupid to pick a flaky graphics card because it 's five bucks cheaper : the angry customers would cost a lot more than five bucks in the long run .
By the same token , forcing customers to take software they do n't want is going to cost a lot more in customer satisfaction than it 's going to gain in revenue .
Manufacturers should only bundle third - party software that enhances ( or at least does n't diminish ) the value of the product to the end user .
( Dell 's contract with Google is a good example of how to do this right . )
In the long run , firms that zealously protect the quality of their user experience will do better than those that allow the customer experience to be undermined in order to make a quick buck .

WASHINGTON — Quite a “ defining moment ” in Iraq , was n’t it ?
At this rate , John McCain is going to be proved right :
The war will last a century .
That is indeed what McCain said , by the way , no matter how his apologists try to spin it .
Those who claim that by “ a hundred years ” McCain was talking about a long - term peacetime deployment like the U.S. military presence in South Korea are being disingenuous or obtuse .
In and around Seoul , citizens are n’t shooting at American soldiers or trying to blow them up with roadside bombs — and U.S. combat forces are n’t taking sides in bloody internecine battles over power and wealth .
It was George W. Bush who called last week ’s fighting in Basra and other Iraqi cities a defining moment for the fledgling government .
By that standard , Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has been defined as an impulsive leader and an inept general — and his government as a work barely in progress .
Maliki ’s decision to send troops into Basra and root out the “ criminal gangs ” that controlled the city was praised by the White House as a bold move to assert the Iraqi government ’s sovereignty .
In reality , though , it looked more like an attempt to boost Maliki ’s political standing by dealing a blow to the Mahdi Army — the biggest and most powerful Shiite militia — and its leader , the cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Iraqi forces launched their offensive and were immediately met by what Maliki ’s defense minister called unexpectedly strong resistance .
In other words , they ran into a buzz saw .
Maliki went to Basra to personally oversee military operations .
History will not confuse him with Napoleon .
The government might have suffered a humiliating defeat if not for the face - saving intervention of U.S. and British air power , and a bit of British artillery as well .
At least the United States did n’t have to go it alone .
It was the British military , after all , that had declared its job done in Basra and withdrawn , knowing full well that the city was controlled by gangs and militias , not the central government in Baghdad .
Meanwhile , Maliki ’s putsch had inflamed Shiite communities throughout the country , including the vast Sadr City neighborhood in Baghdad .
The tranquillity brought about by Bush ’s ballyhooed “ surge ” turned out to be as evanescent as a rainbow .
Maliki was forced to sue for peace , Sadr magnanimously accepted , and the fighting ebbed .
The Mahdi Army remains entrenched , in Basra and other cities , and armed to the teeth .
Maliki ’s regime looks less like a government than just another faction — albeit one with a couple of big brothers who will come in to finish any rashly started schoolyard fights .
All of which illustrates the insanity of the open- ended Iraq war policy that Bush has followed and that McCain vows to perpetuate .
What , exactly , did the United States use its military might to accomplish last week ?
We intervened in a struggle among various Shiite power centers for control of a city where much of Iraq ’s oil industry — and thus much of its potential wealth — is based .
We supported a political figure who was trying to weaken another political figure in advance of upcoming elections .
We boosted the morale and fervor of the most implacable opponents of continued American occupation .
Does any of this have anything to do with our nation ’s vital interests ?
I suppose you could argue that Basra is important because of the oil , but the city is no more under Baghdad ’s control today than it was two weeks ago .
Please note that throughout this episode , you have n’t heard the name al - Qaida .
According to Bush and McCain , is n’t Iraq supposed to be the central front in the war on terrorism ?
Would n’t the only plausible reason for continuing the occupation of Iraq be to fight terrorists — rather than help one Shiite leader against another ?
And what ’s the strategic reason for backing Maliki , who recently gave Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a red-carpet welcome to Baghdad , over Sadr , who is believed to be living in Iran , enjoying Ahmadinejad ’s hospitality ?
Bush ’s troop surge , remember , was supposed to buy time for two things to happen : Iraq ’s political leaders were to achieve reconciliation , and Iraq ’s armed forces were to improve to the point where they could conduct operations on their own .

WASHINGTON  For all the headaches of flying in the United States , the domestic airlines were until recently considered a logistical marvel , moving two million people a day with remarkably few accidents .
Now they are in chaos , with airlines grounding more than 500 planes and thousands of flights so far because they may not meet safety requirements .
Travelers have seen this before but only rarely , when all planes were grounded after the Sept. 11 attacks and when the government grounded all DC - 10s after an engine fell off one of them in 1979 , killing 273 people .
But there is a big difference this time : there has been no crash .
What happened ?
One answer is that some whistle - blower inspectors for the Federal Aviation Administration disclosed that they had been discouraged from cracking down on Southwest Airlines for maintenance problems , and they found a sympathetic audience with some Washington lawmakers .
That prodded the F.A.A. to order a national audit to check whether airlines were in compliance  and to propose a record penalty of $ 10.2 million against Southwest .

World ’s Fastest Bird Continues to Rebound Monitoring shows a healthy and growing peregrine population across North America
When the American peregrine falcon soared off the list of endangered species in 1999 , the bird ’s recovery from near extinction in North America was hailed as a tremendous conservation success story .
Today , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released monitoring results showing that the bird ’s recovery continues at an impressive pace .
The results from the first nationwide monitoring effort to measure the peregrine falcon ’s recovery put the number of nesting pairs in North America at about 3,000 – nearly 10 times the number estimated in 1970 when the bird was first protected as an endangered species and considerably more than the roughly 1,800 breeding pairs estimated in 1999 , when the peregrine was declared recovered and was de-listed .
" This incredible bird continues to thrive , " said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne .
" We ’ve been amazed at the peregrine ’s ability to adapt , especially to urban situations where they nest on buildings , bridges and even smokestacks . "
In the Northeast and Mid-west , two - thirds of peregrine falcons nest on man-made structures .
In other areas , more than 90 percent of peregrine pairs nest on natural formations such as cliffs .
Fish and Wildlife Service Director H. Dale
Hall credited the recovery of the peregrine to the ban on the use of the pesticide DDT , protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act , and the extraordinary partnership efforts of the Service and state wildlife agencies , universities , private organizations and falcon enthusiasts .
These partnerships greatly accelerated the pace of recovery through captive breeding programs , reintroduction efforts and the protection of nest sites during the breeding season .
Simultaneous efforts also took place in Canada .
Like the recovery effort , the successful monitoring program is also the result of partnerships .
In 2003 , the first year of post - delisting monitoring , more than 300 observers - many representatives from the same partners who supported the recovery effort - monitored 438 peregrine falcon territories across six regions .
Surveyed areas included the Northeast / Great Lakes , Southeast , Southwest , Rocky Mountains , Pacific and Alaska .
" This monitoring effort was unprecedented and would not have been possible without the help of partners across the nation who provided invaluable time and expertise , " Director Hall said .
" I thank them all . "
Peregrine falcons are found in 41 of the 50 U.S. states .
They do not breed in Alabama , Arkansas , Florida , Hawaii , Louisiana , Mississippi , Oklahoma , South Dakota or West Virginia .
A second round of post - delisting monitoring was done this year , and preliminary results indicate that the peregrine population continues to grow .
Final results and analyses from 2006 will be published in a report in the summer of 2007 .
Monitoring will continue in 2009 , 2012 and 2015 , and monitoring of contaminant levels in eggs and feathers will be reported in the future as well .
The Endangered Species
Act requires five years of monitoring for species removed from the list of endangered and threatened species to ensure that populations remain strong .
The Service decided to monitor the peregrine falcon five times over a span of 13 years in order to provide data reflecting the status of peregrines over three or four generations .
Peregrines begin breeding at about age 3 .
A medium - size raptor , the peregrine falcon nests on tall cliffs and urban skyscrapers and hunts other birds for food , reaching speeds of 200 miles an hour as they dive after prey .
The bird ’s remarkable speed and agility , however , could not prevent its sharp decline after World War II , when widespread use of the pesticide DDT and other organochlorine pesticides decimated populations .
The pesticide DDT caused peregrines to lay thin - shelled eggs that broke during incubation .
By the late 1960s , the American peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus anatum ) had disappeared completely from the eastern United States and the Midwest , and its numbers had dropped by almost 90 percent in the western United States , Canada , and Mexico .
One of the first species to be listed by the U.S. government for protection , the peregrine historically ranged throughout much of North America from the sub-arctic boreal forests of Alaska and Canada south to Mexico .
During the recovery effort , more than 6,000 peregrine falcons were released into the wild by government and private raptor specialists .
Some of the reintroductions took place in urban areas after researchers discovered that the falcons can successfully adapt to nesting on skyscrapers and other urban structures where they hunt abundant pigeons and starlings .

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the principal Federal agency responsible for conserving , protecting and enhancing fish , wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people .
The Service manages the 95 - million - acre National Wildlife Refuge System , which encompasses 545 national wildlife refuges , thousands of small wetlands and other special management areas .
It also operates 69 national fish hatcheries , 64 fishery resources offices and 81 ecological services field stations .
The agency enforces federal wildlife laws , administers the Endangered Species Act , manages migratory bird populations , restores nationally significant fisheries , conserves and restores wildlife habitat such as wetlands , and helps foreign and Native American tribal governments with their conservation efforts .
It also oversees the Federal Assistance program , which distributes hundreds of millions of dollars in excise taxes on fishing and hunting equipment to state fish and wildlife agencies .
Questions and Answers about the Post - delisting Monitoring Results for the American Peregrine Falcon ( Falco peregrinus anatum )
What is a peregrine falcon ?
The peregrine falcon is a charismatic raptor , the world ’s fastest flying bird , whose population dropped to precipitously low levels because of pesticide contamination ( from pesticides now banned throughout much of the western hemisphere ) .
Concern about their long - term survival led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the species as Endangered in 1971 .
Due to population recovery it was removed from the list in 1999 .
What subspecies of peregrine falcon are native to North America ?
Peregrine falcons have a nearly worldwide distribution .
There are three subspecies nesting in North America : $ The Arctic peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus tundrius ) nests on the north slope of Alaska east across northern Canada to Greenland and winters in Latin America .
$ The Peale ’s peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus pealei ) is a year - round resident on the coasts of Washington , British Columbia and Alaska north to the Aleutian Islands .
$ The American peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus anatum ) nests in southern Alaska , Canada , United States and northern Mexico .
Peregrine falcons that nest in subarctic areas generally winter in South America , while those that nest at lower latitudes exhibit variable migratory behavior .
Some are non-migratory .
Why are we monitoring the American peregrine falcon ?
The Endangered Species
Act requires that species removed from the list because of recovery need to be monitored for 5 years in order to assure the long - term survival of those species .
How was the monitoring effort carried out ?
Across the nation , 438 peregrine falcon territories were monitored : 36 in the Southwestern Region ; 21 in the Southeastern Region ; 100 in the Alaska Region ; 96 in the Pacific Region ; 95 in the Midwestern / Northeastern Region ; and 90 in the Rocky Mountain / Great Plains Region .
( More information on the monitoring effort is available at http://www.fws.gov/endangered/i/B22_051506.html
How many of these territories were occupied ?
The percentage of the monitored territories that were occupied by a pair of birds varied from 78 percent to 95 percent across regions and averaged 87 percent for the nation .
What was the nesting success rate ?
The percentage of occupied territories that managed to successfully raise at least one young ranged from 64 percent to 78 percent across regions and averaged 71 percent for the nation .
How many of the nests successfully produced fledglings ?
The number of young actually produced ( productivity ) varied from 1.45 to 2.09 across regions and averaged 1.64 for the nation .
What do these numbers mean for peregrine falcon recovery ?
These estimates of territory occupancy , nest success and productivity are at or above the levels we expect of healthy peregrine falcon populations , and are above the targets we set in the peregrine falcon monitoring plan .
How many peregrine falcons are there in North America ?
Additional data collected by this effort documented that the total number of nesting pairs for this subspecies in North America is estimated at 3,005 .
This includes estimates of 400 pairs in Canada , 170 pairs in Mexico , approximately 1,000 pairs in Alaska , and the rest distributed among 40 of the lower 48 States .
Who participated in the monitoring ?
More than 300 observers ( volunteers and paid personnel ) from state and federal agencies , Native American tribes , universities , conservation organizations and private individuals participated in the effort .
How did they gather information ?
Observers ventured into the selected territories in 2003 at least two times and sometimes many more times over a three - to - four month period to observe peregrine falcons .
Territory accessibility ranged from roadside to remote , at times requiring hiking , rafting or access by air .
Observers visited each territory to determine occupancy , nest success and productivity .
Were cities included in the territories monitored ?
The monitoring effort showed that peregrine falcons are thriving in many urban areas , where they nest successfully on smokestacks , tall buildings and bridges .
This is particularly true in the Northeastern and Midwestern areas of the nation .
In the rest of the nation , peregrines nest most of the time on cliffs .
When will the next year of monitoring occur ?
A second year of monitoring was done in 2006 , and three more years are planned , in 2009 , 2012 and 2015 .
Final results of the 2006 monitoring will be available in summer 2007 .
Are observers collecting other information besides occupancy , nesting success and productivity ?
Individuals with the proper permits who are already visiting nests to band young peregrines are also collecting feather samples and addled ( unhatched ) eggs .
These will be analyzed for contaminants .
Results of this effort will be included in future monitoring reports .
What do peregrine falcons look like ?
The peregrine falcon belongs to the genus " Falco , " which is characterized by long pointed wings .
In fact the word Falco is derived from " falx , " the Latin word for sickle , in reference to the distinct sickle - shaped silhouette of the peregrine falcon ’s extended wings in flight .
Also unique to this species is the notched beak that is used to kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck .
The peregrine falcon is a crow - sized bird , weighing just over two pounds with a wing span of approximately 3 feet .
An adult peregrine has a dark grey back and crown , dark bars or streaks on a pale chest and abdomen , and heavy malar ( cheek ) stripes on the side of the face .
Immature peregrines are buff colored in front and have dark brown backs ; adults are white or buff in front and bluish - gray on their backs .
Females and males are identical in appearance , however , the female can be a third larger than the male .
Where is the peregrine falcon found ?
The peregrine falcon has the most extensive natural distribution of any bird in the world , limited only by high elevations , extreme heat and extreme cold .
It is found on all continents except Antarctica .
In most parts of the world , it is absent only in the high mountains , in large tracts of desert or jungle , and on isolated islands in the oceans .
The American peregrine falcon breeds in Mexico , the United States , and Canada .
How did the peregrine falcon get its name ?
Peregrine in Latin is " Peregrinus , " which means traveler .
peregrine falcons are well known for their long fall and spring migratory flights to and from their nesting and wintering habitats .
The Arctic peregrine falcon lives up to its name , breeding on the north slope of Alaska east across northern Canada to Greenland in summer and migrating as far south as the tip of South America to winter .
The sport of falconry involves training falcons to hunt game , and people who practice the sport are called falconers .
Early falconers referred to peregrine falcons as such because - unlike most birds use for the sport of falconry - they were always trapped during migration and not taken from the nest .
How fast can a peregrine falcon fly ?
In level flight , the normal speed for peregrines is about 40 to 55 miles per hour .
In a stoop ( dive ) peregrine falcons can attain speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour as they attack their prey .
How do they capture their prey ?
Peregrine falcons are aerial predators , feeding on live birds and an occasional bat , which they capture in mid-air .
Peregrine falcons often hunt in tandem , alternately diving on their prey until it is caught .
Do peregrine falcons have natural predators ?
Peregrine falcons are fast , aggressive and fearless predators located at the top of their food - chain ; they rarely suffer from predation by other animals .
Great - horned owls and golden eagles are known to occasionally kill fledgling peregrines , and less often , adults .
Peregrine eggs sometimes fall victim to raccoons and red - tailed hawks .
The nestlings of ground - nesting Arctic peregrine falcons may be preyed upon by grizzly bears and foxes .
Do peregrine falcons mate for life ?
Yes , peregrine falcons are monogamous .
They also breed in the same territory or area for their entire lives .
There are exceptions , such as when one mate dies or is replaced by a stronger individual .
Sexual maturity occurs during the second year of life , followed by approximately one month of courtship .
In the spring , 3 or 4 eggs are laid .
Incubation takes approximately 33 days and although both parents share incubating duties , the female performs the greater share .
Two or three chicks usually hatch and fledge in approximately 42 days .
After fledging , young peregrine falcons are still dependent on their parents for food until they learn to hunt , which takes about a month and a half .
Do peregrine falcons build nests ?
Most birds build nests made of sticks and soft natural fiber material in which their eggs are incubated .
Peregrine falcons lay their eggs in " scrapes , " which are shallow indentations they scratch out with their talons in the soft earth on the floor of their nests .
Peregrine falcons typically nest on ledges and in small shallow caves located high on cliff walls .
They have been known to use the abandoned nests of other birds , and on the north slope of Alaska , commonly nest on the ground .
When do American peregrine falcons breed ?
American peregrine falcons begin breeding activities in the south earlier than in northern States .
In Arizona and coastal California , peregrines begin nesting in late February and early March .
In Alaska , nesting begins in May .
What was the historical size of the American peregrine falcon population ?
The historical status of the American peregrine falcon is not known , but the species was probably never common , even when compared to other birds of prey .
The limited historical data suggest a best estimate of 3,875 nesting pairs .
The decline of the American peregrine falcon population began in the 1940s , was most pronounced during the 1950s and continued through the 1960s into the early 1970s throughout most of its range .
By the time biologists realized the magnitude of the American peregrine falcon decline , the population was only about 12 percent of what it had been prior to the introduction of modern pesticides .
What caused the near extinction of the peregrine falcon in North America ?
The use of DDT as a pesticide during the 1940s , 1950s and 1960s resulted in a precipitous decline of peregrine falcons in North America .
During this period of DDT use , eggshell thinning and nesting failures were widespread in peregrine falcons , and in some areas , successful reproduction virtually ceased .
As a result , there was a slow but drastic decline in the number of peregrine falcons in most areas of its range in North America .
DDE , a metabolite of DDT , prevents normal calcium deposition during eggshell formation , resulting in thin - shelled eggs that are susceptible to breakage during incubation .
Peregrine falcons feed near the top of the food chain and suffered from the accumulation of DDE due to eating contaminated prey .
How many American peregrine falcons were there when the bird was first placed on the endangered species list ?
The eastern population of the American peregrine falcon was gone and the populations in the west had declined by as much as 90 percent below historical levels .
By 1975 , there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons .
What 's the status of the peregrine falcon now ?
Thanks to the increase in peregrine falcon population , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was able to remove the species from the Federal list of threatened and endangered species effective August 25 , 1999 .
The peregrine falcon will be monitored at least through 2015 to ensure that it no longer needs the protection of the Endangered Species Act .
If necessary , the species can be added back to the list in the future .

1. Why Do People Tie Cans to the Back of the Married Couple 's Car ?
This tradition actually started during the Tudor period in England .
As the bride and groom left in their carriage , wedding guests would throw their shoes at them because it was considered good luck if you hit the vehicle .
Today that would be considered a lawsuit , so we tie them to the car instead .
And since walking home from a wedding with only one shoe is no fun , Americans started using aluminum cans instead .
2. Why Is It Bad Luck for the Groom to See His Bride on Their Wedding Day ?
This common American tradition seems sweet , but its origins are n't exactly tender .
For hundreds of years , fathers arranged their daughter 's marriages by offering money to young men .
However , if Daddy 's Little Girl was n't exactly fit for the cover of Maxim , Daddy might decide to search for prospective grooms in nearby towns , for obvious reasons .
When these men showed up on the wedding day — not having seen their future brides before — it was common for some of them to flee the scene .
So the tradition that it 's " bad luck "  for a man to see his bride before the ceremony really started out as insurance for her dad .
3. How Did We Get a " Ring Finger " ?
What Americans call the ring finger is not the same for everyone .
In some parts of India , wedding bands are worn on the thumb .
In 3rd- century Greece , the ring finger was the index finger .
But later , the Greeks believed that the third finger on a person's hand was connected directly to the heart by a route called " the vein of love . " 
Today 's Western tradition stems from that .
An open source evangelist 's opinionated take on the world
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary .
This was not illegal ( nothing was illegal , since there were no longer any laws ) , but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death , or at least by twenty - five years in a forced - labour camp .
Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off .
The pen was an archaic instrument , seldom used even for signatures , and he had procured one , furtively and with some difficulty , simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil .
Actually he was not used to writing by hand .
Apart from very short notes , it was usual to dictate everything into the speak - write which was of course impossible for his present purpose .
He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second .
A tremor had gone through his bowels .
To mark the paper was the decisive act .
In small clumsy letters he wrote :
April 4th , 1984 .
He sat back .
A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him .
To begin with , he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984 .
It must be round about that date , since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty - nine , and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945 ; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two .
DIGG THIS
We can all agree that food is critical to our economy .
Episodes like Katrina demonstrate the need for flexibility in our food supply .
Inherently , the private sector cannot provide this flexibility .
When the Invisible Hand fails , it is time for the Visible Foot of government to jam the steel tip of its boot into our doorways .
Look at the terrible waste in the private food sector .
Warehouses and elevators full of food , none of which is loaned out to more than one person at a time .
Now , if the methods of modern government finance were applied , all that grain and fruit could be giving liquidity to ten times the number of grocery stores !
Now you object : " But what if everyone wants their food at the same time ? "
Under the old system , when a grocery store or grain elevator had insufficient reserves , it became unable to provide more food for withdrawal in a crisis .
This is obviously unacceptable .
That is why I am proud to announce the creation of the Federal Food Reserve System .
All food - related matters will be centralized in Federally chartered Food Banks .
These food banks will issue " Federal Reserve Noodles , " similar to Ramen noodles except that they will have no physical existence as such .
These " FRNs " will be legally good for all metabolic debts , public and private .
All actual flour , rice , kiwi fruit etc. will be stored in Fort Knox , but never audited .
This will make ample real food available for worthy charitable activities overseas .
Some of the food will be given to the International Mung - bean Fund ( IMF ) , to give credibility to its Special Dining Rights ( SDRs ) and other projects .
More will be given to the World Food Bank to support its programs of rain forest removal in Brazil and Borneo ( remember , " Only We Can Prevent Forest " ) .
Perhaps the rest will be lent out to European gourmet speculators , perhaps not ; in any case US citizens need no longer concern themselves about it .
The Chef of the Federal Food Reserve will be appointed by the President .
He will oversee the Food Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , which will use Federal Reserve Noodles to purchase real food items on the market .
The FOMC will also have the power to " foodetize " past - sell - date food issued by foreign dictators , subprime mortgage food from the back of the freezer , or any other indigestible object , possibly including Twinkies ( when the needed technology is developed ) .
The Federal Food Reserve will also regulate the Food Banks .
Food Banks will be allowed to issue ten or more times as many Federal Reserve Noodles as they actually have in their reserve refrigerators .
If it turns out that the " reserve " food has spoiled ( become " subprime " ) , the Food Reserve will simply issue more FRNs to the bank in exchange for the former reserves ( the subprime tranches , I mean cuts , will simply be " eaten " by the taxpayers ) .
This will make Federal Reserve Noodles more and more plentiful as time goes on .
In fact , in times of crisis the Congress will be able to send out as many freshly cooked Federal Reserve Noodles as it takes to buy your vote , directly to your mailbox ( is 300 enough ?
Here , take 600 ; heck , take all you want , they ’re free ! )
If things get bad enough , the Chef of the Federal Reserve will deliver your FRNs himself by helicopter .
Soon everyone will have enough Federal Reserve Noodles to fill all their wheelbarrows .
Now , with all this purchasing and hoarding and absconding with food and food - like securities , you might wonder , " where is my next meal coming from ? "
But not to worry .
Trust in the Chef of the Federal Food Reserve , and wait for noodles from the sky .

Here is one lesson , involving Venezuela and Curacao , via William Griffiths .
The " card thing " is an intricate scheme involving local merchants , Socialist bureaucrats , Venezuelan travelers and middlemen .
Trying to slow capital flight , Venezuela limits its citizens to
$ 5,000 in annual credit card purchases abroad .
That is 10,750 bolivars ,
at the official exchange rate of 2.15 to the dollar .
But at the
prevailing black - market rate of 4.5 to the dollar , the amount more than
doubles to 22,500 bolivars .
Seizing on that gap , some Venezuelans began coming to Curaçao’s
casinos last year and using their credit cards to buy chips .
They then
played a few hands and cashed in the chips for dollars , which circulate
here along with guilders .
Dummy receipts are available too .
So , I am puzzled by the generality of Dani Rodrik ’s defense of capital controls .
Internet commerce alone should mean that most capital controls are n’t easily enforced .
True , not everyone has access to large - scale transactions on the internet , or some companies may be too big and respectable to try to sneak money out of the country this way .
But if the enforceability of capital controls is relying on such imperfections in individual optimization , I would suggest that the idea , if it ever made sense in the first place , does n’t have much of a future .
March 14 , 2008  -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey suggested Friday that he believes the alleged 9/11 plotters held at Guantanamo Bay should not be executed if convicted .
" I kind of hope they do n't get it , " Mukasey said after a speech at the London School of Economics .
" Because many of them want to be martyrs , and it's kind of like the conversation … between the sadist and the masochist . "
" The masochist says hit me and the sadist says no , so I am kind of hoping they do n't get it , " he said .
In February , the Pentagon charged six of the 9/11 conspirators , including the alleged mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed .
The others : Walid Bin Attash , Ramzi Binalshibh , Ali Abdul Aziz Ali , Mustafa al Hawsawi -- who the government claims is a key financier for the attacks -- and Mohammed al Kahtani , who is alleged to have been the 20th hijacker on United flight 93 but was denied entry into the United States at the Orlando International Airport .
Mukasey told the London audience that he would not speak to the legality of the death penalty , saying , " We have rather a different society , we have rather different traditions " in the United States .
The European Union , of which the United Kingdom is a member , is opposed to the use of capital punishment in all cases .
Of those charged in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks , " one of them at least is proud enough of it to have written to his wife that he thinks he is innocent because it was only 3,000 , " Mukasey said .
" If those are not poster children for the death penalty , I do n't know who is . "
Mukasey made clear the statements are his personal opinion , and heavily qualified them .
" In a way , I kind of hope , from a personal standpoint , and I can say this because the military commissions will be run by the Department of Defense not by the Justice Department -- although we are participating with them , and helping them in the prosecution , but it will be run by the Department of Defense , " he said .
Still , the statement seems at odds with Bush administration policy that broadly supports the death penalty .
The record suggests the administration believes capital punishment is the most appropriate penalty for terrorists convicted of killing Americans .
The administration spent years on a failed attempt to put low - level al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui to death for what critics call his murky , overstated role in the 9/11 conspiracy .
The decision on whether to pursue the death penalty against the Guantanamo Bay prisoners will ultimately be the military 's , so Mukasey 's comments will likely have little practical impact .
Susan J. Crawford , a Military Appeals Court judge , is the convening authority for military commissions and will decide whether alleged terrorists should face a capital case and be eligible for the death penalty .
But given that the White House likes to speak with one voice , the low - key Mukasey might prefer that his comments not draw much attention .
This is not the first time Mukasey has expressed his opinion on Guantanamo Bay .
During his confirmation hearings in October , he told the Senate Judiciary Committee , " I think there are substantial problems with Guantanamo , both problems of reality and problems of perception . "
" As to reality , it 's my understanding that although people are humanely treated at Guantanamo , it 's more than a matter of humane treatment .
It 's a matter of the fact that we 're detaining people apparently without end and that it 's given us a black eye . "
I am a member of Anonymous and a long - time reader of this blog .
There are a couple of additional points I 'd like to add to John 's article .
Secondly , the initial campaign of DDOS and internet insurgency can be seen as an example of the internet as an enabling force - most members of anonymous are not hackers or computer security experts , but the information available on how to conduct operations such as DDOS attacks etc is readily available on the internet , and can be spread concisely and practically throughout the group itself through other networking tools ( IRC , message boards , forums , p2 p ) .
However , the interesting thing in particular about the methodology of anonymous is that it is intensely adaptable - when the opinions of Mark Bunker that the illegal aspects of anonymous actions ( DDOS etc ) were tactically efficient but strategically detrimental entered the viral consciousness , the methodology drastically changed - to real life protests organised over a number of countries , and to information dissemination tactics aimed at the public .
They employ systems disruption of scientology operations both online through DDOS and information dissemination , and in real life through information dissemination and protests aimed at disrupting their activites through altering their legal and public situations .
Psychological isolation is brought about by isolation of COS views from the mainstream in highlighting cult practices and achieving widespread dissemination of such views , and by engaging in a war of opinion on the internet - colouring public perception , and preventing COS propaganda from being effectively broadcast .
Minimal collateral damage : aside from one misguided retributive attack in the early stages , the whole operation has been marked by an astounding level of focus .
With protests in over a dozen countries occuring on two occasions with over 8000 people participating , there has been only two arrests ( for noise violation ) and no negative actions .
These are the protest equivalent of surgical strikes .
The next round of Anonymous protests will be held on the 12th of April .

Things will get very ugly over the next few months for the RIAA , if one disgruntled file sharing lawsuit victim gets her way .
Tanya Andersen , the single mother who filed a countersuit against the RIAA after the organization mistakenly sued her for sharing music online , attempted to hold it responsible for all sorts of heavy infractions ( " RICO violations , fraud , invasion of privacy , abuse of process ,
electronic trespass , violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ,
negligent misrepresentation , the tort of ' outrage , ' and deceptivebusiness practices " ) .
According to Mike Ratoza , a copyright lawyer with Bullivant , Houser and Bailey who teaches at the University of Oregon , Andersen is close to forcing the RIAA into the discovery phase of her countersuit , after having her original complaint dismissed on Feb. 19 .
Andersen 's amended complaint , due March 14 , will not be a layup , and there are no guarantees in litigation .
But assuming her lawyer is able to craft the pleading to the judge 's specifications , Andersen will have another chance to tilt at the RIAA windmill , with the case proceeding into the discovery phase .
If that happens , the RIAA could be forced to releasepotentially incriminating details about its techniques forinvestigating alleged file sharers .
This information would likely be held under a confidential seal , but if lawsuits over mold , tobacco , and asbestos are any indication , the RIAA 's secrets will likely leak out into the legal community at large , potentially culminating in a class - action lawsuit .
Once Tanya Andersen files her amended Complaint , which the RIAA is barred from contestingthis time around , the organization could have to explain the followingdetails by producing documents and allowingmajor - label anti-piracy executives to be deposed :
- How much the RIAA 's lawyers make
- Why the average file sharing settlement fee is $ 4 - 5 K
- How it decides which file sharers to sue , and which ones not to sue
- Where the settlement money goes ( i.e. whether any of it makes it to the artists )
If it turns out that the RIAA is paying its investigators ( such as MediaSentry ) apercentage of the settlements that result from their investigations , itis in even more trouble .
That 's illegal in many states , according to Ratoza , including New York .
Things could get even worse for the RIAA .
Andersen is n't likely to be granted class action certification for her suit , becausefederal courts ( where copyright - related proceedings take place ) are notfriendly to class - action suits .
But another RIAA
lawsuit victim could use the information divulged in Andersen 's case tocountersue the RIAA for specific allegations ( fraud and RICO violations ) in astate court , where class action certification is more likely .
Even without a class action lawsuit , the RIAA nutshell is likely to split wide open after Andersen 's case hits the discovery phase , causing problems in subsequent cases .
Ratoza expects the discovery phase in Andersen 's case to start in about 90 days , and said it will last 4 - 6
months .
The judge is n't likely to rule until early next year , but the RIAA 's secrets could leak out a lot sooner .

On the day that dozens of US cruise missiles rained down on Serbia in an attempt to punish Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic for the country 's onslaught against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo , first lady Hillary Clinton was far from the White House war room : instead she was touring ancient Egyptian ruins , including King Tut 's tomb and the temple of Hatshepsut .
And on the day before the signing of the Good Friday agreement in Belfast she was at an event called " Hats on for Bella " in Washington .
In her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination , Hillary Clinton has touted her experience in the Clinton White House as preparation to lead the nation in a time of crisis .
" Ready on day one " has been her slogan .
But an initial reading of some of the more than 11,000 pages of Clinton 's schedules from her days as first lady , released today by the National Archives and the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library , shows that she was often far from the site of decision - making during some of the most pivotal events of Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Clinton , who was an accomplished attorney and first lady of Arkansas before moving to the White House , frequently claims more than 30 years experience in public life , contrasting herself with Barack Obama 's slimmer resume - he served several years in the Illinois legislature and was elected to the US Senate in 2004 .
The Clinton campaign claimed on Wednesday that the release of the papers would show Clinton to have been an influential advocate at home and around the world on behalf of the US .
But the documents from her office in the White House threaten to undermine her claim to have played a major role in Clinton 's foreign policy decisions .
For instance , Clinton has said she helped negotiate the April 1998 Good Friday agreement between warring factions in Northern Ireland .
But while Catholic and Protestant figures hashed out last - minute details of a power - sharing agreement in Belfast , Clinton was at the National Press Club in Washington at a party honouring Bella Abzug , a congresswoman from New York City who had died recently .
While President Clinton phoned major participants in the peace talks , she met with Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel and joined a farewell party for Democratic operative Karen Finney .
On the day the agreement was actually signed , she met with Philippine first lady Amelita Ramos .
When Nato launched air strikes against Serbia in an attempt to punish Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic for the country 's onslaught against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo , Clinton toured ancient Egyptian ruins , including King Tut 's tomb and the temple of Hatshepsut .
She dined at the Temple of Luxor , and stayed overnight at the Sofitel Winter Palace Hotel there .
On August 20 , 1998 , Bill Clinton ordered US missile strikes on suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan .
The president and Hillary Clinton were on holiday on Martha 's Vineyard , a posh island vacation spot off the coast of Massachusetts .
After announcing the attack , Clinton cut short his break and returned to Washington to confer with his national security team ; Hillary Clinton remained on the Vineyard until August 30 , her records show .
There are other key foreign policy dates when the record is not so clear : on the day the presidents of three Balkan states signed a peace agreement in Dayton , Ohio , in November 1995 , ending years of ethnic violence in the former Yugoslavia , Clinton 's file lists no public schedule for that day , but indicates she was in Washington .
The documents ' release on Wednesday came in response to a conservative organisation 's freedom of information request and subsequent lawsuit .
The records include schedules from nearly 3,000 days Clinton was in the White House , and detail meetings , trips , speaking engagements and social activities .
Bruce Lindsey , a Little Rock attorney and long time Clinton confidant , vetted the pages prior their release .
He and national archives staff checked the documents for information sensitive to national security and law enforcement matters .
Nearly a third of the pages have redactions , most of which the archives said were made to protect the privacy of Clinton 's associates .
The redacted material includes home addresses , telephone numbers and social security numbers , the archives said .
Christopher Farrell , director of investigations and research with Judicial Watch , the organisation behind the two - year - long legal effort to win the documents ' release , said he does n't anticipate finding any " smoking gun " within the reams of pages .
He said Lindsey " has enormous discretion " to redact information potentially damaging to Clinton 's White House bid .
" My expectations are quite low . "
Hillary Clinton was present in the White House , however , for at least one significant event of the Clinton presidency .
On November 15 1995 , when President Clinton is said to have begun his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky , she was in the White House , according to her schedule .
The release of Clinton 's White House papers have made it possible to work out her whereabouts during the key moments in the Lewinsky scandal by comparing her schedule to the detailed account of Clinton 's affair detailed in the Starr Report .
On at least one other occasion , the Clintons met on official White House duties shortly after Bill Clinton and Lewinsky had been engaged in sexual activity , the papers suggest .
The revelation does not undermine her claim to having had an important policy role in the Clinton White House , but could prove embarrassing to her presidential campaign as it highlights again one of the most damaging episodes of the Clinton years .

| Evolved Rationalist
On Friday , I decided to kill off a few of my brain cells to watch Expelled so my readers did n't have to .
After reading my friend 's review of the movie from a film making perspective , I am sure you must be curious as to what the great Evolved Rationalist this evolution geek thinks about the blatant anti-science lies promoted in the movie .
Oh , there were four other people watching the movie with us .
* snicker *
Before watching the movie , I expected to be so angry by the end of it that some people were afraid that I would end up going on a rampage and killing every creationist in sight .
I expected to intersperse my bouts of hot rage at the IDiots with some laughs at the utter stupidity of Ben Stein ( BS ) et al .
I expected to be saddened by how fundamentalist religious beliefs had warped creationist minds .
I expected to be disgusted at the credulous creationists who would flock to the movie just to feed their pathetic delusions .
With all those expectations , it was a good idea for me to watch the movie with an atheist friend .
However , I simply did not expect the movie to be so goddamn boring .
Not even Stein 's nasal drone could have prepared me for the utter failure of the movie to make me either get really angry or start laughing hysterically .
The movie starts with Stein in his idiotic sneakers rambling about freedom and portraying himself as a great crusader for the cause of freedom in the face of persecution .
He apparently failed to get the memo that lecturing to a crowd of extras about how the establishment is suppressing ID is not the way science works at all .
He also failed to get the memo that ID is not about religion , droning on and on about how ' Darwinists ' are persecuting ID and putting " science in a little box where it can't possibly touch god " .
Oops , Stein - you scored an own goal there for us ' evil Darwinists ' .
You have proven that your side is all about religion , and you have nicely exposed the lies that your side has been peddling all along .
Thank you for that little favor there , Stein .
To maximize the sensationalist nature of the crocumentary , scenes of Nazi death camps , gas chambers and tortured / dead Jews were badly inserted in the middle of ramblings about Darwinist persecution .
Ben , how dare you disrespect millions of Jews that were murdered in the Holocaust by using their suffering to promote your theocratic , fundamentalist , quasi-political , lying , right - wing , theistarded agenda ?
How dare you compare the killing of millions of people with some ID hacks being criticized by the scientific community for not providing evidence for their assertions ?
How dare you claim that ID being flunked is tantamount to a new Holocaust ?
How dare you even think of using the Holocaust as a tool to prop up your lying agenda ?
How could you , Stein ?
Do n't you have any measure of shame ?
Next , he interviews people who were supposedly expelled or persecuted for supporting ID .
He touts the case of Michael Egnor as an example of this great ' Darwinist ' persecution that rivals what Hitler did to the Jews .
Now , get ready for this - all that happened to Egnor was that some people criticized him on the internet .
Yes , let me repeat myself if this does not shock you enough : Egnor was criticized on the internet .
This is one of the examples of ' Darwinist ' persecution of ID that threatens the very idea of freedom and is comparable to the Holocaust .
Egnor was the very same medical doctor (! ) who remarked that one of the reasons evolution is false is because ' brain tumors do n't evolve to make better brains ' .
Come on now , Egnor , how could you make such ignorant statements and then get all whiny about being ' persecuted ' when you are called out on your fallacy ?
If you can't take the heat , get the fuck out of the scientific ring .
If you can't handle criticism , shut the fuck up .
Since some creationists have criticized me on the internet ; according to Stein , I am the victim of creationist persecution .
A sword cuts both ways , IDiots .
Stein also lies about how Richard Sternberg 's life was nearly destroyed after he was fired from the Smithsonian for supporting ID .
However , the truth is a lot less sensational than what the IDiots claim .
Sternberg was never employed by the Smithsonian .
He was an unpaid research associate and he still has full access to research facilities at the museum .
As I do n't want to continue beating a dead horse , the real stories about the so - called ' academics ' who were expelled for supporting ID can be found here .
Stein continues his nonsense with interviews from the usual kooks - Dembski , Johnson , Berlinski , Marks , etc .
They trotted out the usual nonsense " The cell is complex , so there is a designer !
Design is a scientific theory !!
It can be proven !!
We just want to be heard !!
This is a war of worldviews !!
We are being persecuted !
Waaaaaaah !! "
All this is incredibly boring as we have been hearing those goons say the same thing for years without a shred of evidence to back up their claims .
Those IDiots were given the chance of their lifetimes in a courtroom in Dover , their leading light William " BillDumb " Dembksi was too cowardly to testify , Michael Behe claimed that ID is as scientific as astrology , they bombed in court and their case was shown to be one of " breathtaking inanity " .
They had their chance and they failed .
Can we move on now , IDiots ?
Some of us like our brains nice and functioning , thank you very much .
The best part was when the IDiots he interviewed stressed that ID was not about religion , while Stein simply ranted in the next scene about how god was being kicked out of science by ' Darwinist ' persecutors .
Those IDiots can't even get their stories straight , and yet we are supposed to believe that they are doing doing real science ?
In my opinion , I really do n't think that insulting the intelligence of one 's audience is a good idea , but then again , it is the ID lying crowd we are talking about here .
Stein goes on to demonstrate his ignorance by delightfully blabbering about how ' Darwinists ' still cling to ' Darwinism ' despite the fact that nobody knows how life actually arose .
Apart from the simple fact that the theory of evolution does not deal with the origin of life and that abiogenesis is a separate field of study , Stein invokes the tired old god - of - the - gaps argument to claim that since we do n't know everything about a particular scientific issue , GODDIDIT !
Apparently , the ' science ' that the IDiots so badly want recognition for is their inane tendency to yell GODDIDIT instead of doing some actual scientific research .
The part where I wanted to slam my head against the wall was when Stein made fun of panspermia and asked " Is this really more plausible than God ? " , killing any pretensions of ID being non-religious and again demonstrating his utter ignorance of the issue he claims to be so passionate about .
Unless those ' aliens ' or whatever was seeding life on earth evolved through evolutionary processes , panspermia is actually ID .
The fact that nobody seemed to realize that the idea of an intelligence seeding life on earth belongs on the ID side is apparently because everyone in their camp only sees ID in terms of special creation by the Christian god .
I was curious about the ID creationists ' excitement over Richard Dawkins supposedly admitting that ID is possible .
What actually happened in the movie was nothing at all like what the kooks over at Uncommonly Dense want you to believe .
Stein asked Dawkins to imagine a scenario in which ID could be possible , and Dawkins replied by saying that an intelligence could have started life on earth .
Now , for you deluded dumbfucks who think that this is some sort of staggering admission , Dawkins mentioned this possibility because Stein asked him to !
He was merely answering Stein 's question , not advocating ID .
Furthermore , Dawkins goes on to say that the intelligence itself must have evolved elsewhere through evolutionary processes .
However , Stein deliberately ignores this , choosing instead to spew his lie about how Dawkins accepts ID as long as the Designer is not god .
Fuck you , Stein , for being a shameless liar .
I would really like to tell Stein where he should shove his head , but I do n't think it would make a difference at this point .
The part of the whole truckload of epic fail that was Expelled which truly made me angry was when Stein walked around concentration camps trying to look upset while blaming and trying not to blame ' Darwinism ' for the Holocaust at the same time .
He utters inanities about how he is not claiming that ' Darwinism ' lead to Nazism , but Darwinism was the root cause of Nazi ideas .
Stein ignores the widely - known historical fact that anti-Semitic ideas were around long before Darwin and that there were ideas about the extermination of Jews even before Hitler .
( Check out Martin Luther 's rantings against the Jews , for one ) .
Stein then stupidly claimed that ' Darwinism ' led to eugenics without realizing that artificial selection has been around since the dawn of agriculture .
Oh noes !!
Agriculture caused Nazism and the Holocaust !
Ban agriculture !!
Stein then threw in more right - wing propaganda with stupid remarks about how Planned Parenthood , abortion and stem - cell research are modern - day eugenic practices .
Pandering to the fundie base probably never looked so good .
Stein also completely misses the point that even if evolution led to Nazism or that Hitler admired Darwin , the scientific validity of the theory of evolution has nothing to do with the consequences of accepting the theory .
Epic fail , Stein .
The movie ends with scenes of people tearing down the Berlin Wall and Stein basically comparing himself to great defenders of freedom and claiming that Big Science has erected a wall to keep god out , just like the Berlin Wall tried to keep ideas out , and that the fight to bring god into science is like bringing down the Berlin Wall , and that Stein cannot do it on his own , so he needs sheep to follow and bray after him , yada , yada , yada ...
Thick on the propaganda , vacuous on the science - just like the whole big tent of Intelligent Design .
As expected , Expelled fails to tell us exactly why ID qualifies as science .
All Stein talks about is how ID is being persecuted , but we never see any of the so - called evidence that the ' Darwinists ' are suppressing .
If Stein is so passionate about freedom of ideas and the defence of truth , why not put the evidence on the table ?
Could it be simply because there is no scientific validity to ID and that the only thing keeping them afloat is their spin machine ?
Could it be that we ' evil Darwinists ' were right all along ?
Scary thought , is n't it , Stein ?

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia has advised its citizens in Lebanon , especially families living there , to leave the country immediately due to the security situation , several Saudi nationals said on Saturday .
The United States had said on Thursday it deployed the USS Cole off the Lebanese coast because it was concerned about the political deadlock in Lebanon , provoking criticism from Hezbollah and Syria .
There was no immediate comment from the Saudi embassy in Lebanon .
Onions are cool weather vegetables commonly found in the home garden , but they can also be grown indoors year - round by determined gardeners .
They require a container deep enough for bulbs to form , exposure to bright light and soil with excellent drainage .
Positioning the chosen container in an area with plentiful sunlight works well during the regular growing season , but artificial lighting is necessary during fall and winter months .
Choose an onion variety that produces small heads , as vegetables in containers have limited room to grow .
Welcome home , shuttle Endeavour !

STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION

Falling back to Earth , the shuttle Endeavour streaked across Central America and high above Cuba today before gliding up the length of the Florida peninsula to a sunny landing at the Kennedy Space Center to close out a dramatic two - week space station assembly mission .
The ship 's gouged heat shield appeared to come through re-entry in good shape with only slightly more damage than it started with , vindicating an earlier decision to forego a spacewalk repair job .
" Houston , Endeavour , wheels stopped , " commander Scott Kelly radioed as the shuttle rolled to a halt on the centerline of runway 15 .
" Roger wheels stopped , Endeavour , " astronaut Chris Ferguson replied from mission control in Houston .
" Congratulations , welcome home .
You 've given a new meaning to ' higher ' education . "
He was referring to teacher - turned - astronaut Barbara Morgan , strapped into a seat on the flight deck just behind the two pilots .
Christa McAuliffe 's backup in the original Teacher - in - Space program , Morgan waited 21 years to fulfill the legacy of the fallen Challenger astronauts .
While she did not teach any lessons from space as McAuliffe once planned , she chatted with school kids during two modest educational events and plans a busy schedule of post - flight appearances to promote science and math education .
Touchdown at 12:32:16 p.m. wrapped up a 5.2 - million - mile voyage spanning 12 days 17 hours 55 minutes and 34 second over 201 complete orbits since blastoff Aug. 8 from nearby launch complex 39A .
Endeavour 's flight now sets the stage for a complex sequence of missions to attach a new docking module to the station in October , followed by the European Space Agency 's Columbus laboratory module in December and two flights early next year to attach Japanese modules .
Endeavour made its fiery return to Earth with a small - but - deep gouge in two heat shield tiles on the belly of the ship behind its right main landing gear door .
The gouge was caused by a half - ounce piece of foam insulation that fell off an external tank propellant feedline bracket 58 seconds after launch .
NASA managers spent more than half of Endeavour 's mission studying the gouge to determine whether it posed any re-entry threat to the shuttle or its crew .
Late last week , based on super - computer analysis and tests of a mockup in a furnace that can simulate re-entry heating , NASA 's Mission Management Team concluded the damage would have little or no impact and cleared the shuttle for return to Earth as is .
" We agree absolutely 100 percent with the decision to not repair the damage , " Kelly said during an in - flight news conference .
" We 've had shuttles land with worse damage than this .
We gave this a very thorough look and I am very , very comfortable and there will be no extra concern in my mind ( during re-entry ) due to this damage . "
Based on close - up video from the runway , the heat of re-entry did no apparent damage to surrounding tiles .
The extent of the damage appeared roughly the same , although a gash at the deepest part of the pit looked a bit larger .
But there were no other obvious signs of damage and it clearly had no impact on landing .
" There 's maybe slightly a little bit more erosion on the , kind of the forward edge , but not too dramatic , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , associate administrator for space flight at NASA headquarters .
" It did n't get extremely hot and ( the underlying material ) did n't char .
But again , I caution you with this quick analysis we 're doing here , the teams will pop these tiles off , we 'll take a look to make sure there 's no damage , there 's nothing going on . "
Kelly , pilot Charles Hobaugh , flight engineer Rick Mastracchio , Tracy Caldwell , Al Drew and Canadian astronaut Dave Williams doffed their heavy pressure suits and gathered on the runway for a brief inspection of the shuttle an hour or so after landing .
Morgan , feeling a bit woozy as she readjusted to gravity , did not join her crewmates , staying inside NASA 's astronaut transporter for post - landing medical checks .
All seven astronauts plan to spend the night in Florida before flying back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Wednesday .
" The flight was absolutely wonderful , " Morgan , 55 , told reporters five hours after landing .
" I 'm really proud of our whole team and the team on the ground .
... it all worked out really , really well I thought .
How did I do ?
It took me a little while at first to get used to microgravity , it took a couple of days , and the first day - and I think this was the biggest surprise of all - I felt I was upside down the entire first day .
It was n't a bad feeling , it was just an unusual feeling . "
Asked how she felt after landing , Morgan said : " The room still spins a little bit , but that 's OK . "
" What I really want to do is take what this experience was and figure out how we can do a better job to help serve our students and our teachers in a way they want that will be more helpful to them , " Morgan said .
" And I would love to figure out how we can make more and more of these opportunities available for more and more of our teachers . "

With Endeavour back on the ground , NASA managers and engineers will carry out a detailed inspection to precisely determine the extent of damage related to the foam strike while debating a half - dozen potential near - term fixes to prevent insulation from falling off the liquid oxygen feedline brackets during upcoming launches .
A bracket redesign already was in work , scheduled to debut on a tank four missions from now .
The question facing NASA is what to do about the next three flights , currently scheduled for launchings Oct. 23 , Dec. 6 and Feb. 14 . Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale said Monday it 's too soon to say what impact work to recover from Endeavour 's unexpected foam debris incident might have on the upcoming schedule .
But Gerstenmaier said today that at this point , major delays do not appear to be in the cards .
" We 're still pointed toward Oct. 23 , " Gerstenmaier said .
" We have a meeting today going on to have a look at the tank to see if there 's anything we want to do in terms of modifying the tank ... or we leave it the way it is and head for Oct. 23 .
But I think we 're still clearly focused on the next mission and we 're ready to move forward . "
From the local processing perspective , " it really and truly depends on how long we need to do the analysis for the repair if it turns out to be necessary or not , " said Launch Director Mike Leinbach .
" We were going to mate the external tank ( and boosters ) yesterday for the next mission , so we 're in kind of a holding pattern here .
We 've got several days to work with , so we 're in no immediate danger of delaying the next mission at all , that 's certainly not in the cards .
We have some time in the schedule to make up as we go along .
So it 's going to depend on the results of the study , whether we need to do a fix or not , how long we take to do that fix and then what that would translate into for ( processing ) . "
Hale said engineers are working on " five different options to improve the situation on the next tank .
We will expect there will be some readjustment to our schedule as we work through those options .
However , I believe that based on the discussions we 've had , that our impacts to the next flight in terms of the actual launch date of Oct. 23 will be small , we think we have plenty of time to evaluate some changes and in fact implement them if we feel that they are well justified . "
At NASA 's traditional post - landing news conference , NASA Administrator Mike Griffin showed off spectacular post - undocking pictures of the international space station , calling the unfinished lab complex " one of the great accomplishments of mankind . "
" We 're building a space station here , one flight at a time , and while I appreciated the media 's attention on the ding in the tile , actually the orbiter overall was really pretty clean , " he said .
" We had one kind of ugly ding and we paid appropriate attention to it .
I would have liked to have seen some media attention on what a magnificent accomplishment we 're undertaking here .
I think we 're doing pretty well with it . "
Endeavour docked with the space station Aug. 10 and the next day , the astronauts installed a short spacer segment on the right end of the station 's main solar power truss .
Two days later , Mastracchio and Williams replaced a faulty stabilizing gyroscope on the station amid work to transfer 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies to and from the lab complex .
The astronauts used robot arms on the shuttle and space station to attach a 7,000 - pound equipment storage platform to the solar array truss and staged a third spacewalk Aug. 15 to complete a variety of station assembly get - ahead tasks .
Endeavour is the first shuttle equipped with a new station - to - shuttle power transfer system that enabled the orbiter to plug into the space station 's solar power grid .
As a result , NASA managers extended the flight three days and added a fourth spacewalk .
Originally scheduled for last Friday , the excursion was delayed one day while NASA managers debated whether to turn the excursion into a tile repair spacewalk .
In the end , a repair was deemed unnecessary and Williams and space station flight engineer Clay Anderson were cleared to carry out the originally planned EVA on Saturday .
But the threat of Hurricane Dean raised the possibility flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center might have to evacuate .
As a result , NASA managers shortened Saturday 's spacewalk and moved undocking from Monday to Sunday to get Endeavour back on the ground today .
As it turned out , Dean never threatened the Texas coast but by that point NASA was committed and the crew returned to Earth today .
Flying backward over the Indian Ocean at a velocity of 5 miles per second , Kelly and Hobaugh fired Endeavour 's twin braking rockets at 11:25 a.m. for three minutes and 33 seconds , slowing the ship by 246 mph and lowering the far side of its orbit into the atmosphere .
A half - hour later , the shuttle fell into the discernible atmosphere at an altitude of 76 miles .
At that point , Endeavour was 5,020 miles from touchdown .
The shuttle 's ground track carried it high above Central America just west of the Panama Canal on a course carrying it across central Cuba and up the Florida peninsula to the Kennedy Space Center .

Hubble has revealed that mysterious " blue blobs " in a structure called Arp's Loop between M81 and M82 are blue clusters of stars less than 200 million years old with many stars as young as , and even younger than , 10 million years .
Finding blue blobs in space sounds like an encounter with an alien out of a science fiction movie .
But the powerful NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope has resolved strange objects nicknamed " blobs " and found them to be brilliant blue clusters of stars born in the swirls and eddies of a galactic pile - up 200 million years ago .
The findings are reported by Duilia de Mello of the Catholic University of America , Washington , D.C. and NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. and her colleagues at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas , USA .
Such " blue blobs " - each weighing tens of thousands of solar masses - have never been seen in detail before in such sparse locations , say researchers .
They are more massive than most open clusters found inside galaxies , but a fraction of the mass of globular star clusters that orbit a galaxy .
Because the orphan stars do n't belong to any particular galaxy , the heavier elements produced in their fusion furnaces may easily be expelled back into intergalactic space .
This may offer clues as to how the early universe was " polluted " with heavier elements early in its history , say researchers .
The mystery is that the " blue blobs " are found along a wispy bridge of gas strung among three colliding galaxies , M81 , M82 , and NGC 3077 , residing approximately 12 million light - years from Earth .
This is not the place astronomers expect to find star clusters : in the " abyssal plain " of intergalactic space .
" We could not believe it , the stars were in the middle of nowhere " , says de Mello .
The " blue blobs " are clumped together in a structure called Arp's Loop , along the tenuous gas bridge .
The gas filaments were considered too thin to accumulate enough material to actually build this many stars , says de Mello .
But Hubble reveals the " blue blobs " contain the equivalent of five Orion Nebulae .
After finding that these " blobs " resolved into stars , the team used the Hubble image to measure an age for the clusters of less than 200 million years old with many stars as young as , and even younger than , 10 million years .
Not coincidentally , 200 million years is the estimated age of the galactic collision that created the tidal gas streamers , pulled between the galaxies like candy floss .
De Mello and her team propose that the star clusters in this diffuse structure might have formed from gas collisions and the subsequent turbulence , which enhanced the density of the gas streams locally .
Galaxy collisions were much more frequent in the early Universe , so " blue blobs " should have been common .
After the stars burned out or exploded , the heavier elements forged in their nuclear furnaces would have been ejected to enrich intergalactic space .
Radio observations with the Very Large Array of radio telescopes in Socorro , New Mexico , USA , gave a detailed map of the intergalactic bridge that revealed knots of denser gas .
Studies with the 3.5 m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona , USA , mapped the optical light glow of hydrogen along the bridge .
Observations with NASA 's Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) ultraviolet space telescope revealed an ultraviolet glow at the knots , and that earned them the nickname " blue blobs " .
But GALEX did not have the resolution to see individual stars or clusters .
Only Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys at last revealed the point sources of the ultraviolet radiation .

A week after Facebook executives introduced new security features to great fanfare , a glitch on the popular social networking site has exposed private pictures of Paris Hilton to anyone with an internet connection .
The Associated Press , which broke the story , was able to use the same , er , hole to view Italian vacations , office gatherings and holiday parties , all which had been designated as private by the people who had posted them .
The AP even browsed through a personal photo album Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted in November 2005 .
We assume the album displayed shots of Zuckerberg being aloof with his family and co-workers .
It was only last week that Facebook rolled out new settings meant to give users tighter control over who can access the content they put on profile pages .
Facebook execs specifically touted the increased ability to restrict photo albums and contacts to all but a select number of people designated as friends .
But according to blog posts , this feature was easily circumvented by guessing the ID of a photo .
Facebook , according to the posts , did n't bother to check for user permissions , and it even gave hints about what the ID of recent photos might be .
While the loophole had been circulating for weeks , Byron Ng , a computer technician from Vancouver , was credited with bringing it to light .
This is n't the first time a social networking site has leaked information it promised to keep private .
In June , it was disclosed that Facebook was divulging users ' political views , religious background and other sensitive details to the world at large even when that information was supposed to be given only to a user 's designated friends .
MySpace has made similar gaffes .
All of which serves as a reminder that we'd do well to bring a healthy dose of skepticism to any online purveyor 's promise to keep digital information private .
Once the information is out , it 's out forever and could potentially be available to prospective employers , police and future spouses .
If the snapshots , contacts or other data are sensitive enough to be designated private , it might be better to keep them off a free social networking site altogether .
Facebook appears to have closed the loophole several hours after the story broke .
We 're still searching for the Paris Hilton pics and will be grateful to anyone who can direct us toward one . ®
The vendace has been introduced successfully at Loch Skene
The vendace has only ever been known at four sites - Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwent Water in the Lake District and the Castle and Mill Lochs in Lochmaben .
However , it is thought to have died out in all but one of those locations .
The fish was introduced to Loch Skene in Dumfries and Galloway in the 1990s , and it now has more vendace per hectare than its only remaining native UK site .
The scheme - on the National Trust for Scotland - run loch - was started due to concerns about habitat deterioration at Bassenthwaite .
My hope is that one day we will be able to use the vendace population of Loch Skene as a source for fish to be reintroduced to a restored Bassenthwaite Lake
Ian Winfield
Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
No vendace have been recorded there since 2001 .
The fish also died out at its two Scottish sites in Lochmaben many years ago .
Grey Mare 's
Tail property manager Dan Watson said the recovery at Loch Skene was a major success .
" It is good to know that this rare fish is doing so well here , " he said .
" This fish has been badly hit by pollution and predation from inappropriate fish introductions in other lakes in the country and can only be found in a couple of locations these days .
" The trust is pleased to manage one of its last strongholds in Britain and to be working in partnership on this important conservation project . "
' Complete loss '
A recent study into the fish numbers was carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ( CEH ) on behalf of Scottish Natural Heritage .
It found almost 10 times as many vendace per hectare in the loch compared to Derwent Water in Cumbria - their only remaining native UK site .
" Although our overall aim is the conservation of rare fish species such as the vendace in their native habitats , the use of refuge sites such as Loch Skene is an invaluable approach to avoid the complete loss of a population and its genetic diversity , " said Ian Winfield of CEH .
" My hope is that one day we will be able to use the vendace population of Loch Skene as a source for fish to be reintroduced to a restored Bassenthwaite Lake . "
The vendace is a herring - like fish which can be traced back to the Ice Age .
Historically , vendace were recorded at four UK locations - Bassenthwaite , Derwent Water , Castle Loch and Mill Loch in Dumfries and Galloway .
The Castle Loch population disappeared at the beginning of the 20th Century and Mill Loch shortly before the end .
Behave like a doctor whose hospital administrator has just told him that hand - washing is too expensive , and he should stop doing it .
I do n’t think I have the right to refuse to slap together quick and dirty code when my employer or client insists .
However , if I am asked to develop software that is insecure and places private user data at risk , I will make the personal choice of saying no .
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is one of the most important books I have ever read .
Each of the seven habits has helped me find and travel the path that brings meaning to my life .
When I feel lost , I return to my well - thumbed copy and it reconnects me to my values .
Very highly recommended .
In short , their Code of Ethics .
Try this : Employ an Engineer .
Ask her to slap together a bridge .
The answer will be .
You cannot badger her with talk of how since You Hold The Gold , You Make The Rules .
You cannot cajole her with talk of how the department needs to make its numbers , and that means getting construction done by the end of the quarter .
Engineers have a certain line that they will not , cannot cross .
Doctors work the same way .
I do n’t agree with everything in this particular post , but one paragraph resonated with me :
Now , I do n’t agree that you should refuse to slap together quick and dirty code that will be hell to maintain when told to do so .
Whether that is a good idea or not is a judgment call .
I choose to write software as cleanly as I know how within the constraints of my relationship with my client or employer .
I choose to evangelize my judgment on the matter strongly .
But I do n’t think I have the right to out - and - out refuse to do so when my employer or client insists .
They suffer the consequences of software that is difficult to maintain , so they and they alone have the last word on the subject .
Where I think the advice fits is where third parties — like users — are the ones who suffer the consequences .
Doctors wash their hands because their patients ’ health is at risk if they do n’t .
If a hospital administrator asks for a cover page on the TPS reports , a doctor cannot argue that she will not do it because it is inefficient .
If it wo n’t kill a patient , the doctor must accommodate the administrator ’s decision .
In the case of software development , if I am asked to develop software that is insecure and places private user data at risk , I will make the personal choice of saying no .
Of course , I do not have the protection of the law .
If I am fired for doing so , I have no recourse .
I ca n’t even collect unemployment benefits , I will be deemed to have been dismissed for cause .
Programmers work at will , which means that you must value your ethics very highly if you are to place your livelihood on the line for it .
To emphasize , I have strong opinions about subjects like iterative development and empowering teams .
I think that some models of software project management are fundamentally flawed .
But those things are matters of judgment .
I can be swayed into going against my instincts if the person who bears the consequences of the decision insists on following their judgment instead .
My ethics are a different matter .
And in the matter of ethics , I admire professionals who take a stand .
Update : I also admire midwives
BAGHDAD  Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice made an unannounced visit to Iraq on Tuesday , visiting the oil - rich city of Kirkuk and then Baghdad , as tensions mounted along the country ’s mountainous border with Turkey .
Shortly before the visit , Turkish troops staged a brief cross - border attack into northern Iraq to strike at a group of Kurdish militants there .
The Turkish military , in a statement on its Web site , said its troops had inflicted heavy losses on the fighters after spotting them trying to cross into Turkey on Monday night .
American military officers in Washington and overseas said that the Turkish ground force sent across the border numbered only in the hundreds and that it moved fewer than two miles into Iraqi territory .
Turkey said only that it was a “ small - scale operation , ” and indicated that the troops quickly returned to Turkey .
“ Nothing the Turks have done to date should be considered a surprise , ” said an American military officer , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing actions of a sovereign ally .
“ We ’ve shared information as we said we would do .
The decision to pursue military options is theirs . ”
American officials said the Turkish operation appeared to be over .
… Exeter Police Chief Richard Kane , among others , is adamantly opposed .
" If we reduce the penalty for small amounts of marijuana , it will eventually lead to legalization and I think that 's heading in the wrong direction , " he said last week .
Nashua Police Chief Donald Conley also said it would be a mistake to take the sting out of the law .
[ Boston Globe ]
But Conley said it is rare for first - time offenders to get jail time for possession of small amounts of marijuana .
" As far as someone getting arrested and their lives being ruined , I do n't think that 's the case , " he said .
" Employers are more forgiving in this day and age , and police prosecutors frequently reduce marijuana cases down to violations … "
Location :
This article on a marijuana decriminalization effort in New Hampshire provides a useful case study in the utter confusion and desperation of the anti-pot peanut gallery :
So the Police Chief begins by arguing that we must go around stinging people for possessing pot .
But when reform advocates argue that too many young lives are being derailed by harsh punishments for petty offenses , Conley completely changes his tune :
Wait , so should we be stinging people or not ?
He begins by defending aggressive sanctions and ends by claiming the sanctions are n't aggressive .
The contradiction is transparent and embarrassing .
It is , in fact , not at all uncommon to hear defenders of harsh marijuana laws speak approvingly of the fact that most offenders avoid jail time .
Thus , it is not necessarily the practice of ruining lives for marijuana which they crave , but rather the discretion to do so should the urge happen to arise .
Meanwhile , millions of otherwise law - abiding Americans are branded as criminals so that people like Chief Conley can live out their authoritarian fantasies .
New Team Fortress 2 Content Scheduled for Mid-April ; Includes Goldrush , New Weapons , Meet The Scout
Outside of that general timeframe , a specific release date for the new content was not provided .
Goldrush will mark the first map in a new game mode called " Payload , " which will task the Blue team with herding a mine cart full of explosives toward the Red base .
The more players near the cart , the faster it will move , the Red team winning if it prevents Blue from reaching its goal .
The map will also be the first to utilize the cinematic physics technology from Half - Life 2 : Episode Two .
Though unlockable weapons will eventually spread to all classes , the Medic class will be the first to receive new armament .
According to a recent IGN interview , a total of three new items will be available , unlocked by earning a set number of the new class - specific achievements .
While Valve had discussed an Overhealer gun that would double a target 's health , the studio is currently testing a Medic gun that , once charged , will guarantee targets ten seconds of continuous critical hits .
Valve previously explained that the unlockable items would be equipped via a new loadout menu , suggesting that gamers will not be able to easily swap between the new tools in the midst of battle .
The " Jules Verne " is Europe 's first Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) to fly to the International Space Station .
Read on to find out more about its crucial mission .
PRE - LAUNCH ATV - THE FIRSTS
The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS The ATV is the largest and most powerful space tug going to the ISS over its mission life
It provides the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the space station
It is the only vehicle on the current timeline able to de-orbit the ISS when it is retired Built for the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , the ATV is an unmanned , automated spacecraft designed to deliver up to 7.6 tonnes of cargo - air , water , fuel , scientific equipment , food , clothing and even personal items - to the platform .
The ATV is part of the barter arrangement Europe has with its international partners on the ISS project .
Instead of handing over cash to cover station running costs , Europe will take on the major responsibility of resupplying the platform .
With the US space shuttle soon to retire and a replacement some years away , this role will be vital when the crew complement rises to six individuals in 2009 .
The station will continue to receive deliveries from Russian Progress craft and a future Japanese vehicle called the HTV - but neither have the capacity of the ATV .
The ATV will also be used to boost the platform to a higher altitude .
This is necessary to overcome the effect of atmospheric drag which gradually pulls the ISS back to Earth .
One day , the thrust from an ATV's four main engines may be called on to de-orbit the ISS itself when it has reached the end of its mission .
Return LAUNCH
An ATV has to be launched on a specially prepared Ariane 5 rocket from the European spaceport at Kourou in French Guiana .
The ATV mission profile is completely new for the Ariane 5
Enlarge Image
Arianes are more accustomed to launching communications satellites with a mass not exceeding 10 tonnes .
These spacecraft are usually placed in Geostationary Transfer Orbits ( GTOs ) that take them out to 36,000 km above the Earth .
An ATV at launch is about 20 tonnes and has to be put in a Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) at just 260 km above the Earth .
The Ariane 5 - ES uses a re-ignitable upper - stage to circularise this low orbit and put the ATV on the right path to catch and dock with the ISS .
The upper - stage completes two re-ignitions ; the second - after releasing the ATV - puts itself into a controlled dive over the ocean .
Return PHASING
The ATV is designed to be launched independently of other spacecraft .
This enables mission controllers to work other missions around the ATV , as it can be put into orbit and parked temporarily .
While the ATV waits , other vehicles , such as the space shuttle , Soyuz " taxis " or the Progress cargo ships , are able to dock with the ISS .
When docking , the ATV will approach the ISS from behind and below .
It will then simply wait to be instructed to join with the space station at an opportune moment .
Return RENDEZ -VOUS
Ground staff and astronauts will monitor the final approach
More details
The ATV uses a sophisticated navigation system to find its own way to the space station .
GPS ( Global Positioning System ) technology is employed to get to within 300 m of the platform .
Optical sensors are then used for the final approach .
These involve flashing laser light off reflectors already positioned around the docking port on the ISS 's Zvezda module .
The ATV moves in stages towards the station .
At each hold point , ground staff in Toulouse will approve the next phase of the automated approach .
An astronaut on the ISS also sits in front of a monitor and panel to oversee the docking .
Two important buttons - one yellow , one red - allow the astronaut either to stop the ATV in its tracks or , in an emergency , send it away from the station to a safe parking location .
Return ATTACHED TO ISS ATV CAPACITIES Maximum total load is 7,667kg 1,500 - 5,500kg - dry cargo 0- 100 kg - air ( oxygen / nitrogen ) 0 - 840kg - drinking water 0 - 860kg - refuelling propellant
An ATV will stay at the ISS for about six months .
Once docked , the crew of the ISS can walk about the ATV without the need for spacesuits .
Inside the ATV , the crew will find , water , oxygen and nitrogen , letters from home and other supplies essential for their mission .
Dry cargo is packed in white bags and is carried out .
Fuels are piped across to the ISS .
Fresh air is simply vented into the platform by turning a valve .
As these stores are depleted the ATV will be used to store station waste - up to 6.5 tonnes .
Return DEPARTURES AND RE-ENTRY
The ATV and the ISS rubbish will be buried at sea
When the ATV undocks from the platform , it will take this waste into a controlled re-entry over the Pacific Ocean .
The ATV will break up into small fragments .
It is currently more cost - effective to use the ATV once , rather than design a spacecraft that can be used several times .
Design concepts exist for ATVs that allow for part of the vehicle to survive the fiery re-entry , for heat - resistant capsules to be released on the descent .
These could be useful if scientists wanted experimental items from the ISS returned intact .
However , at the moment , these concepts are not being taken forward .
Return WHAT'S IN A NAME ?
The French author Jules Verne wrote about fantastic voyages - into space , to the bottom of the sea , and around the world .
The ATV could also herald extraordinary voyages for Europe .
Although the ATV is not designed to carry astronauts , the fact that people can move around safely inside it demonstrates Europe has many of the necessary skills to implement a manned space transportation system should it decide to .
Autonomous navigation and docking will be an essential technology for any mission which attempts to return rock samples from Mars - a stated goal of both Europe and the US .
Specimens lifted off the surface of the Red Planet would meet up in orbit with a transfer vehicle that had the necessary power to get them back to Earth .
Return Cost : Total bill was 1.3bn euros ( at least 4 more ATVs will be built )
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission will fly lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters

'' The intent of the amendment is to restore congressional oversight over the Kosovo mission , '' said Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , the provision 's chief Democratic sponsor .
'' Of course , the administration does n't like it .
They want a free hand to participate in military adventurism whenever and wherever they please .
They do n't want to hear a peep out of Congress . ''
But critics said imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal would send a dangerous signal of uncertain American resolve to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia , and undermine the unity and morale of NATO 's peacekeeping operation , which involves forces from Britain , France , Germany , Italy and other nations , in and out of Europe .
They are trying to calm Kosovo in the aftermath of NATO 's bombing of Yugoslavia early last year , when NATO acted to protect Albanians in the province .
A deadline '' would precipitate a year of dangerous uncertainty and wavering commitment to our allies , '' said Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , a leading foe of the provision and sponsor of the amendment to kill it .
The 15 Republicans joined 38 Democrats in supporting Mr. Levin 's decisive amendment , while 40 Republicans and 7 Democrats opposed it .
Mr. Levin's measure also eliminated a second provision to withhold 25 percent of the military 's funds in Kosovo this year , unless Mr. Clinton certified by July 15 that the European allies were meeting their commitments for reconstruction aid , police officers and food and medicines .
Without that certification , the measure required that money could be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly withdrawal of American forces .
The defeated provision 's chief Republican author , Senator John W. Warner of Virginia , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , remained undaunted .
He vowed to offer the provision on the European share of aid as an amendment to the Pentagon 's budget bill for fiscal year 2001 when that reaches the Senate floor .
On Wednesday , the House approved , by a vote of 264 to 153 , an amendment on the European aid share similar to the Senate's .
But the House version gives the next president until April 1 , 2001 , nearly nine months longer than the Senate , to certify that the European allies are meeting their commitments .
TOKYO  An American marine accused of raping a 14 - year - old girl on Okinawa was released by the Japanese police on Friday after the girl dropped her accusation , the police said .
It was unclear if the marine ’s release could help defuse the furor in Japan over the case , which had led to wide questioning of the military alliance with the United States and the presence of more than 40,000 American troops here .
Fallout from the accusation prompted Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to express deep regret to the Japanese prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda , on Wednesday .
Earlier , Mr. Fukuda had called the episode “ unforgivable ” and demanded that the United States take action to prevent crimes by its service members .
The marine ’s arrest on Feb. 11 incited protests on Okinawa , where there are raw memories of a 1995 rape of a 12 - year - old girl by three American servicemen .
An ex-Muslim cartoonist is authoring the first R-rated cartoon film showing Mohammed and his 9 year old bride according to the Gateway Pundit .
The Sugiero blog writes : " Ehsan Jami decided to reject Islam after the 9/11 terror attacks .
Since then he has defended the right of religious freedom , with the usual consequences ... "
Jami is in hiding in the Netherlands .
Sugiero remarks that Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende , who " has written a letter to Indonesia 's largest Muslim organisation , Nahdlatul Ulama ( NU ) in which he says that the views presented in the anti-Qur 'an film of populist leader Geert Wilders do not represent those of the Dutch government " will be writing a lot more letters .
Yesterday for Wilders , tomorrow for Jami , and the day after for who knows who ?
In an earlier post I predicted that European leaders , " Human Rights " committees and all the assorted enforcers of politically correct speech would eventually be trapped in a whack - a- mole mode .
They 'll be busy fighting a cultural counter - insurgency .
If al - Qaeda is smart it will do the unexpected and refrain from issuing any more fatwas ; to quit presuming a veto power over Western cultural and political institutions .
If Islamic radicals back off , most people will lose interest in these Mohammed parody cartoons , which frankly have a limited market on their own merits and whose attraction is principally that of symbols of resistance .
But if groups like al - Qaeda continue with a campaign of intimidation and terror , they will be met with a campaign of blasphemy the likes of which they never imagined possible .
And who knows where it goes from there ?
But al - Qaeda , though clever , is fundamentally stupid .
They are like those brainless thugs who yell their way through a crowd and , finding someone who refuses to give way , believe that by yelling louder they 'll gain passage .
A smart thug would know that he 's come upon the Black Swan ; that he 's run into trouble and should move around .
But fanatics , armed with a presumed divine foreordination , do n't believe in the existence of surprises ; they think they know the future from their doctrine and bull on .
But they do n't know the real mind of God ; they only think they do .
Nothing surprises the fanatic more than the belated discovery that he does n't know everything .
And so , the Islamic radicals will likely go on assuming that the asymmetrical warfare rules which paralyze governments necessarily paralyze whole populations .
They might commit their tame media outlets , hired academics , cowed liberal intellectuals and all their instruments of information control to a campaign aimed at suppressing dissent inside the West .
And my guess is that the instruments of political correctness will shatter under the effort of waging a sustained cultural counter - insurgency .
They will use up their own jihadi cultural fifth column in futile attacks against never ending targets .
Political correctness works when applied in small , gradual steps .
What the Mohammed cartoons have done is force political correctness to overreach .
One of the enduring lessons of history is that the worm , tormented long enough , always turns .
The Belmont Club is supported largely by donations from its readers .
ONE of the most common talking points heard yesterday was that Bear Stearns had been sold for a mere $ 240 million while the company 's headquarters alone has an estimated worth of $ 1.2 billion .
In other words , it sure seems like whatever Bear has on its books is worth less than nothing , such that the company had to give JP Morgan a billion dollars just to get a sale .
Is that right , though ?
Felix Salmon , and some other financial writers , suggests a different justification for the negative valuation , namely , that there were no other buyers out there .
Bear , essentially , was a price taker , and JP Morgan gave the bank only what it needed to .
From Wall Street 's perspective the one - bidder alternative is the better one , by far .
If Bear were only worth $ 2 per share because its assets were garbage , then odds are that other banks out there should be trading a lot lower , as well .
If JP Morgan were just getting a steal , then maybe the other banks , Lehman for instance , are n't lying when they say they 're in decent shape .
A piece of evidence in favour of the one - bidder hypothesis comes from Alea .
While markets as whole are down today , including the financial sector , JP Morgan is trading up .
Substantially .
About 9 percent at the moment .
And Alea 's jck points out that that comes out to roughly $ 11 billion , or a bit more than Bear 's professed book value .
Perhaps some of those Bear assets actually were worth more than the paper they 're printed on .
Just goes to show that the best thing to be during a crash is a buyer .

It ’s not often you can feel genuine sympathy for rock stars that made truckloads of cash polluting the world with their catchy , but crappy songs .
But given the above performance by Mike Huckabee ’s cover band Capitol Offense , it ’s easy to understand Boston founder and songwriter Tom Scholz ’s deep , unending shame for the artistic transgressions of his youth , lucrative though they were .
Huckabee ’s recreation of the band ’s 1976 oh - my - god - please - make - Clear - Channel - stop - playing - that hit “ More Than a Feeling ” at an Iowa campaign stop — which featured a guest appearance by one - time Boston lead guitarist Barry Goudreau , a Huckabee supporter — invites , no , begs for all the mockery one can muster .
Turns out , though , that Schulz ’s problem with the performance ( aside from that it sucked ) was Huckabee ’s use of the song to promote his presidential candidacy .
Scholz , who alleges that the Huckabee campaign has continued to use the song since the ill - considered performance in Iowa , wrote a letter to the presidential contender yesterday , explaining his troubled mind :
Boston has never endorsed a political candidate , and with all due respect , would not start by endorsing a candidate who is the polar opposite of most everything Boston stands for .
Um , what , you ask , does Boston stand for ?
Personally , I thought it was slick studio over - production and a period of my life , around the 6th grade , when I had yet to kiss a girl or shave my peach fuzz , and my musical tastes were still recovering from Stryper and Ratt .
But I digress …
Scholz ’s letter continued :
By using my song , and my band ’s name Boston , you have taken something of mine and used it to promote ideas to which I am opposed .
In other words , I think I ’ve been ripped off , dude !
Yes , he wrote the word “ dude . ”
For their part , Huckabee ’s people could n’t care less what Scholz thinks .
His New Hampshire campaign manager responded to the letter :
Governor Huckabee plays “ Sweet Home Alabama . ”
Does that mean that Lynyrd Skynyrd is endorsing him ?
He plays “ Louie Louie . ”
Does that mean that the Kingsmen are endorsing him ?
To me , it ’s ridiculous .
Never once has he said , “ The band Boston endorses me . ”
Of course , rock ‘ n ’ roll has an illustrious history when it comes to political campaigns .
Bill Clinton rocked out to Fleetwood Mac. Obama jams to U2 , and Hillary has a thing for Celine Dion ( one can only imagine why she thinks that might help her chances at winning the White House ) .
And until last week , McCain had a soft spot for the populist , Red-American icon John Mellencamp .
But when the Indiana rocker complained about the misappropriation of hit songs “ Pink Houses ” and “ Our Country ” by the Republican candidate , McCain agreed to remove the songs from rotation .

The Debian project is known for its public brawls , but the truth of the matter is that the Debian developers have not lived up to that reputation in recent years .
The recent outburst over the attempted " semi- hijacking " of the dpkg maintainership shows that Debian still knows how to run a flame war , though .
It also raises some interesting issues on how packages should be maintained , how derivative distributions work with their upstream versions , and what moral rights , if any , a program 's initial author retains years later .
Dpkg , of course , is the low - level package management tool used by Debian - based distributions ; it is the direct counterpart to the RPM tool used by many other systems .
Like RPM , it is a crucial component in that it determines how systems will be managed - and how much hair administrators will lose in the process .
And , like RPM , it apparently causes a certain sort of instability in those who work with it for too long .
Ian Jackson wrote dpkg back in 1993 , but , by the time a few years had passed , Ian had moved on to other projects .
In recent times , though , he has come back to working on dpkg - but for Ubuntu , not for the Debian project directly .
One of his largest projects has been the triggers feature , which enables one package to respond to events involving other packages in the system .
This feature , which is similar to the RPM capability by the same name , can help the system as a whole maintain consistency as the package mix changes ; it can also speed up package installations .
Triggers have been merged into Ubuntu 's dpkg and are currently being used by that distribution .
The upstream version of dpkg shipped by Debian does not have trigger support , though , and one might wonder why .
If one listens to Ian 's side of the story , the merging of triggers has been pointlessly ( perhaps even maliciously ) blocked for several months by Guillem Jover , the current Debian dpkg maintainer .
So Ian concluded that the only way to get triggers into Debian in time for the next release ( " lenny " ) was to carry out a " semi- hijack " of the dpkg package .
By semi-hijack , Ian meant that he intended to displace Guillem while leaving in place the other developers working on dpkg , who were encouraged to " please carry on with your existing working practices . "
Ian also proceeded to upload a version of dpkg with trigger support , and without a number of other recently - added changes .
It is worth noting that all of this work went into a separate repository branch , pending a final resolution of the matter .
So when the upload was rejected ( as it was ) and Ian was deprived of his commit privileges ( as he was ) , there was no real mess to clean up .
Those wanting a detailed history of this conflict can find it in this posting from Anthony Towns .
It is a long story , and your editor will only be able to look at parts of it .
One of the relevant issues here is that Guillem Jover appears to be a busy developer who has not had as much time to maintain dpkg as is really needed .
Since the beginning of the year , he has orphaned a number of other packages ( directfb and bmv , for example ) in order to spend more time on dpkg .
But , as a result of time constraints , a number of dpkg patches have languished for too long .
While this was happening , Guillem put a fair amount of the time he did have into reformatting the dpkg code and making a number of other low - level changes , such as replacing zero constants with NULL .
Ian disagrees strongly with the reformatting and such - unsurprisingly , the original code was in his preferred style .
And this is where a lot of the conflict comes in , at two different levels .
Ian disagrees with the coding style changes in general , saying :
Everyone who works on free software knows that reformatting it is a no - no .
You work with the coding style that 's already there .
Many developers will disagree on the value of code reformatting ; some projects ( the kernel , for example ) see quite a bit of it .
Judicious cleaning - up of code can help with its long - term maintainability .
All will agree , though , that reformatting can make it harder to merge large changes which were made against the code before the reformatting was done .
This appears to be a big part of Ian 's complaint : unnecessary ( to him ) churn in the dpkg code base makes it hard for him to maintain his trigger patches in a condition where they can be merged .
Code churn is a part of the problem , but Ian 's merge difficulties are also a result of doing the trigger work in the Ubuntu tree rather than in Debian directly .
Ian did try to unify things back in August , but that was after committing Ubuntu to the modified code .
Ubuntu 's dpkg is currently significantly different from Debian 's version , and , while one assumes that , sooner or later , Debian will acquire the trigger functionality , there is no real assurance that things will go that way .
Dpkg has been forked , for now , and the prospects for a subsequent join are uncertain .
Ian also asserts that , as the creator of dpkg , he is entitled to special consideration when it comes to the future of that package .
His semi-hijack announcement makes that point twice .
But one of the key features of free software is this : when you release code under a free license , you give up some control .
It seems pretty clear that Ian has long since lost control over dpkg in Debian .
So who does control this package , and how will this issue be resolved ?
Certainly Ian 's hijack attempt found little sympathy , even among those who think that dpkg has not been well maintained recently .
There are some who say that the disagreement should be taken to the Debian technical committee , which is empowered to resolve technical disputes between developers .
But faith in this committee appears to be at a low point , as can be seen in this recent proposal to change how it is selected :
It 's been pretty dysfunctional since forever , there 's not much that can be done internally to improve things , and since it 's almost entirely self - appointed and has no oversight whatsoever the only way to change things externally is constitutional change .
Meanwhile , the discussion has gone quiet , suggesting that , perhaps , it has been moved to a private venue .
The dpkg commit log , as of this writing , shows that changes are being merged , but triggers are not among them .
It is hard to imagine that the project will fail to find a way to get the triggers feature merged and the maintenance issues resolved , but that does not appear to have happened yet .
Measures how a society ranks on a spectrum stretching from democracy to despotism .
Explains how societies and nations can be measured by the degree that power is concentrated and respect for the individual is restricted .
Where does your community , state and nation stand on these scales ?
The companion Encyclopedia Britannica Film " Democracy " can be found here .
Illustrates the thesis that all communities can be ranged on a scale running from democracy to despotism .
The two chief characteristics of despotism -- restricted respect and concentrated power -- are defined and illustrated .
Two of the conditions which have historically promoted the growth of despotism are explained and exemplified .
These are a slanted economic distribution and a strict control of the agencies of communication .
The end of World War II gave impetus to the " one - worlder movement . "
Sparked by the sense that nationalism engendered conflict , this movement for world government viewed nationhood as a relic made obsolete in an age of economic interdependence and rapid air transportation .
The movement was marked by the release of films calling for world government , such as Man : One Family ; We , the Peoples ; Brotherhood of Man ; and Our Shrinking World , and exposing the nature of fascist and authoritarian rule .
Despotism treats the idea of nationhood differently than most other educational films .
It sees nations not as static entities but dynamically , moving towards democracy or despotism as conditions change .
This outlook does n't mesh well with old clichZ < caron >s about patriotism and democracy , because it does n't necessarily see the American system as democracy 's highest achievement .
Despotism offers a number of indicators by which the degree of democracy or despotism in a society can be measured , using a sliding , thermometer - like animated scale .
According to an article in The New York Times ( March 16 , 1946 ) , an advisory board of educators debated for eighteen months ( at seventy - five conferences ) over the definition of the terms " democracy " and " despotism , " the titles of the two films released at the same time .
Finally , a compromise was reached , resulting in the " respect scale " and the " power scale " that we see in Despotism .
So how does our own system measure up ?
The film becomes a little frightening as we consider where we stand with regard to indicators like economic distribution , concentration of land ownership , regressive taxation and centralized control of information .

You can roughly locate any community in the world somewhere along a scale running all the way from democracy to despotism .
One at the democracy end , another somewhere in the middle , and a third ( inaudible ) .
[ rotating globes rulers animation graphs charts measurement quantification scales measures points pointers ]
Let 's find out about despotism .
This man makes it his job to study these things .
" Well for one thing , avoid the comfortable idea that the mere form of government can of itself safeguard a nation against despotism .
[ maps charts wallcharts professors academics commentators authorities ]
Germany under President Hindenburg was a republic .
And yet in this republic an aggressive despotism took root and flourished under Adolf Hitler .
[ maps flags art cards swastikas animation James Brill narrators ]
When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community , he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases . " " . . . for which it stands , one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all . " [ saluting flag pledge of allegiance flags hands over hearts lynchings hangings gallows capital punishment condemnation death murder ropes nooses ]
" Many observers have found that two workable yardsticks help in discovering how near a community is to despotism .
The respect scale and the power scale .
[ goal variables charts graphs posters pointing fingers ]
A careful observer can use a respect scale to find how many citizens get an even break .
As a community moves towards despotism , respect is restricted to fewer people .
[ shared fairness equality ]
A community is low on a respect scale if common courtesy is withheld from large groups of people on account of their political attitudes ; if people are rude to others because they think their wealth and position gives them that right , or because they do n't like a man 's race or his religion .

Equal opportunity for all citizens to develop useful skills is one basis for rating a community on a respect scale .
The opportunity to develop useful skills is important but not enough .
[ schools colleges universities lawns trees graduates steps stairs mothers cap and gown mortarboards parental pride pictures snapshots photography parents diplomas ]
The equally important opportunity to put skills to use is a further test on a respect scale .
[ newspapers jobs applications employment offices unemployment work lines employment agencies ]
A power scale is another important yardstick of despotism .
It gauges the citizen 's share in making the community 's decisions .
Communities which concentrate decision making in a few hands rate low on a power scale and are moving towards despotism .
Like France under the Bourbon kings , one of whom said , " The state - I am the state . " [ shared concentrated political power democracy equestrian statues horses statuary public art ]
Today democracy can ebb away in communities whose citizens allow power to become concentrated in the hands of bosses .
" What I say goes .
See , I 'm the law around here .
Ha ha ha . " [ government buildings smoke fires political power Tammany Hall machines laughs laughing newspaper reporters press ]
The test of despotic power is that it can disregard the will of the people .
It rules without the consent of the governed .
[ Declaration of Independence July 4 , 1776 booklets opening inserts printed pieces
In Congress , the unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . ]
Look beyond the legal formalities of an election in measuring a community on the power scale to see if the ballot is really free .
[ fascists Nazis elections voting booths rigged storm troopers soldiers terrorism voters crosses hats uniforms Sam Browne belts hats control ]
If the citizens can vote only the way they are told , a community approaches despotism .
When legislatures become ceremonial assemblies only , and have no real control over lawmaking , their community rates low on a power scale .
" Sieg Heil . Sieg Heil . "
[ Germany Third Reich Nazis Adolf Hitler swastikas ceremonies applause clapping newsreels salutes fascists fascism ]
In a downright despotism , opposition is dangerous whether the despotism is official or whether it is unofficial .
[ signs fences concentration camps Camp 33 for Political Offenders political prisoners prisons prison camps hoods hanging nooses ropes executions deaths capital punishment condemned people murder flames fires burning crosses Ku Klux Klan terrorism hoods racism ]
" The spread of respect and power in a community is influenced by certain conditions which many observers measure by means of the economic distribution and information scales . " [ instrumental variables ]
If a community 's economic distribution becomes slanted , its middle income groups grow smaller and despotism stands a better chance to gain a foothold .
[ balanced distribution of wealth money affluence poverty ]
Where land is privately owned , one sign of a poorly balanced economy is the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a very small number of people .
When farmers lose their farms they lose their independence .
This one can stay on , but not as his own boss any more .
To the extent that this condition exists throughout a nation , the likelihood of despotism is increased .
[ couples men women John J. Shea v. Walter Leeds .
Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale. mortgages fingers pointing United States maps animation ]
In communities which depend almost entirely on a single industry , such as a factory or mine , maintaining economic balance is a challenging problem .
[ company towns monopolies smokestacks factories animation ]
If this condition exists over the nation as a whole , so that the control of jobs and business opportunities is in a few hands , despotism stands a good chance .
Another sign of a poorly balanced economy is a taxation system that presses heaviest on those least able to pay .
[ animation money graphs wealth national revenue large incomes small incomes regressive taxation ]
A larger part of a small income is spent on necessities such as food .
Sales taxes on such necessities hit the small income harder .
[ pie charts pie graphs large income small income ]
In the days of the salt tax , feudal despotisms were partly sustained by this and other ( inaudible ) .
[ historical recreations Colonial North America taxation without representation ]
A community rates low on an information scale when the press , radio , and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people and when citizens have to accept what they are told .
In communities of this kind , despotism stands a good chance .
[ uncontrolled media monopolies monopolization oligopolies Time Warner Disney ABC Capital Cities Westinghouse CBS NBC General Electric Fox News Corporation Turner CNN critical evaluation automatic acceptance ]
See how a community trains its teachers .
" Bear this in mind .
Young people cannot be trusted to form their own opinions .
This business about open - mindedness is nonsense .
It 's a waste of time trying to teach students to think for themselves .
It 's our job to tell ' em . " [ lecturers mental discipline drill classrooms agreement nodding heads manufacturing consent consensus ]
And when teachers put such training into practice , despotism stands a good chance .
These children are being taught to accept uncritically whatever they are told .
Questions are not encouraged .
[ students conformity conditioning brainwashing writing learning education ]
" How can you ask such a question ?
Have you got a textbook ? "
" Yes Ma'am . "
" Does it say here that our law courts are always just ? "
" Yes Ma'am . "
" Then how dare you question the fact ?
Sit down . "
And so we are n't surprised when - " But it must be true .
I saw it in this book right here . "
And if books and newspapers and the radio are efficiently controlled , the people will read and accept exactly what the few in control want them to .
Government censorship is one form of control .
[ Ministry of Propaganda plaques signs doors windows Internal Censorship censors rubber stamps passed by censor deletions blue pencils manuscripts ]
A newspaper which breaks a government censorship rule can be suspended .
It is also possible for newspapers and other forms of communication to be controlled by private interests .
[ The Daily Citizen press control proclamations This Newspaper is Suspended editors journalists newspaper offices Advertising Manager Mgr. ]
" I thought I told you to kill that story .
It 'll cost us a lot of advertising . "
" If that story goes out , I quit . "
" All right . " [ firings ]
What sort of community do you live in ?
Where would you place it on a democracy / despotism scale ?
To find out , you can rate it on a respect scale and a power scale .
And to find out what way it is likely to go in the future , you can rate it on economic distribution and information scales .
[ cities wipes ]
The lower your community rates on economic distribution and information scales , the lower it is likely to rate on respect and power scales and thus to approach despotism .
What happens in a single community is the problem of its own citizens , but it is also the problem of us all because as communities go , so goes the nation .

All americans need to watch this update : @NewHampshireBoy .
Point well taken .
You are correct .
it does not matter if we have a personal orientation to the left , liberal , moderate , conservative , right wing , we the common people of the USA ( the 99 % if you like , or whatever ) are losing our rights faster than ever .
This film is so prescient of what is wrong with American government and its destructive effect on its citizens and the world today .
Since end or ww2 we have been regressing towards a totalitarian police state .
i think it is legitimate to point out it does exist in full today .
And our government is an imperialist empire , just more subtle than that of Stalin , Hitler and Mao.
Estimates are that the US corporations / military ( yes i know Ike said military / industrial complex .
but to me its misleading because it is all corporate influence not just arms manufacturers who run our government ) empire are directly or indirectly responsible for 8 million deaths since ww2.
google ( or use your favorie search engine ) William Blum , The National Security Archives at George Washington University , et al .
Many will be surprised of the outrageous covert and overt deadly operations the US " deep state " has perpetrated .
The one that changed the middle east for the worse was the overthrow of a Secular democracy in Iran by cia / mi6 in 1953 .
REASON : what else is not news :oil .
Even the genius , beloved eccentric , president Mohammad Mossadegh won his case at The Hague for the Nationalization of Iran 's oil .
Of course the US and its lapdogs view national or international law " as just a piece of paper " .
And the overthrow of peaceful social democrat Salvador Allende in 1973 is just one of many examples .
Kissinger and Pinochet rot in hell , among other " leaders " ( lieing despots ) of USA in the past decade or so .

Subject : Fantastic Film
This film , made in 1946 , was made right after WWII ended in 1945 .
The war united classes and different social groups .
It stregthened ties and social capital was probably never greater for the allies .
After all , when you all have a big boogeyman to depose ( Hitler ) , it gives everone a common enemy to unite against .
That 's possibly the only explanation I have why this film was made .
But sadly today , a film like this would never be made for the masses , especially made for " classroom " consumption .
It simply demystifies too much what governments are doing behind closed doors .
Governments are trying to act more and more like corporations -- top - down autoritarian dictatorships .
You do n't vote or elect who your boss or manager is .
Interesting how " free democratic " countries allow these private corporations to exist in their democracies .
Their organizational models are completely contradictory to one another .
People must thank " Encyclopaedia Britannica Films " for having made this .
It simplifies very complex concepts into something anyone can understand .
Something so clever , and to the point .
I do wonder why there has n't been any film to update it ?

This film does an excellent job of identifying characteristics of despotism .
So when is the government going to stop mandating that all new housing be placed under the despotic control of an HOA corporation ?
Why should developers be permitted to impose involuntary membership HOA corporations ?
Apparently the existing governments prefer despotism to be the model for the future .

Subject : Interesting though somewhat outdated A very interesting film that has one major flaw .
Distraction rather than control is the key to the Despotism of Huxley 's " Brave New World " .
The information scale is pushed through the roof to the point of trivialization which paradoxly results in the * quality * of the information going through the floor .
Critical thinking is crippled not so much by control but by overload .

The film presents four scales for judging whether or not a certain society is despotic .
I do n't know whether or not these are still considered current in political science .
While some may see slights , overall the film does n't degenerate into Commie - bashing like some others in the archive and also explicitly states that " It CAN happen here " .
Scenes are shown of home grown despotisms , such as the political boss who has city government in his pocket .

Subject : Proof of the first law of Communication First off .
This film is not leftist nor is it conservative , or independent .
It is a statement of social measurements .
Based on our experiance as a nation seeking freedom from the topic .
One we had escaped ourselves to create this nation .
.
Many of the people who are alive today to read this comment on this forum are alive because we as a people became involved .
While I wont go into the sickening overly egotistical idea that we were some sort of selfless heroes of the world .
It is still a fact that we did fight .
We gave all and we destroyed a threat so powerful that its own people had become blinded to what they had become .
It would not have happened like that at all if not for the arrogance of those hard marching conquerors .
The idiocy of poking the one sleeping beast left in play by destroying our ocean trade vessels .
Even back then we waited until they attacked the money before we got up and did something about it .
This film and those like them .
Do as fine a job of reporting facts as can be done without losing the importance of the concepts involved .
Made for the very purpose of warning themselves to watch out for the dangers of becoming something you cannot perceive easily as evil .
I do not now , nor have I ever thought the Germans were evil .
They became evil and suddenly to them good and bad became reversed and only total crushing defeat allowed them to be free of destruction 's paths .
We fought its wrath and confusions and overcame it by virtue of our own core values , hard work , sacrifice and blood .
If your really think this film is a depiction of " Radical propaganda ! " or " Sowing seeds of perversion .
A typical eat - the - rich liberal film by socialists from 1946 . " and a
melodramatic training film for despots . "
You have in fact proved the first law of Communication " All information is ultimately under the the control of the receiver .
The sender can clarify and simplify all they want .
The data and its meaning is always controlled by the receiver "
I am very sorry .
I dont know how or when your minds became so clouded as to not understand the definition of the words you wave around so easily .
You are using them incorrectly , please read a dictionary .
You rant and rave calling people marxist and a whole host of angry things .
But if you were to read and understand the definition of the words your using , you would understand why those you oppose get mad and call you ignorant .
I am not angry at you .
I am very upset that you have been misled so terribly .
Liberal does not mean , BIG GOVERNMENT , socialism , communism or tyranny .
It means exactly what it says , freedom .
Freedom to be yourself within a society of equal respect .
The tools to remove tyranny through mutual understanding and collaboration towards our future .
Conservative means to manage without waste your resources .
It has nothing at all to do with actively hating people you dont know because of personal differences .
Nor does it involve destroying your environment to enhance the wealth of people who care nothing for the world they live on or the people living on it .
Not even themselves .
This is just two major concepts of social interaction and governing .
How can you attack one of them with a completely twisted and incorrect definition as your basis for contention ?
You actually are proving the point of this film .
The only tools at your disposal , misdirection , distraction , reversal of blame , and of course , complete lack of any facts to base any of it upon .
In turn when asked to expand your statements you will do anything but stay on the topic of discussion .
Anything but admit you may be wrong .
Its ok to be wrong .
Its how we learn what is right .
If people refuse to be wrong to the point of murdering strangers as a means of justifcation for thier deception , what then would you call them ?
You are exacerbating the situation .
Deceiving yourself , and the blood of those people is on yours , and my hands .
I will return with a new short film to post on this subject .
I have little faith anyone will become aware because of it .
But I can not stand by and watch my own people become the evil they fought so hard to remove from this world .
So I will with a open heart , open mind and willpower that was our trademark as American's .

This film comes from the snobby , Ivy League Yale University , the home of " Skull & Bones " .
It 's politics of the day after WWII is a map which , incrementally , has been followed to date .
The Bush's , Clinton's , along with a string of other scoundrels in Congress have followed this map well .
Unfortunately , this Northeast part of America and its liberal educators have produced some of the most power - hungry despots in history .
The film is a training film for despots .

Subject : Chilling reminder in the Age of Obama Prescient film , especially with regard to power concentration and propaganda in the schools .
Obama managed to get Congress to rubber stamp the greatest spending bill in the history of the United States , giving them only a few hours to read thousands of pages .
He peformed a similar feat in getting the House of Representatives to pass his " Cap and Trade " bill ( effectively the greatest tax increase in American history ) , again giving them insufficient time to actually read it .
He 's trying to do it again with his massive health care bill , which the Congressional Budget Office has stated will increase costs in contradiction to Obama 's stated objective .
Whether you agree with him or not , there does seem to be a troubling concentration of power in one guy .
Meanwhile , in our universities , you can express politically incorrect opinions in class only at the cost of your grade .

I found this film to be excellent , and quite accurate .
Some of the comments though , are downright bizarre .
They show just how indoctrinated a lot of Americans are against anything even remotely left wing .
It amazes me to see how many people honestly believe that any kind of government intervention in anything is one step away from soviet style communism .
One commenter seems to believe that because the film points out that uneven distribution of wealth can be a partial indicator for despotism , the film is suggesting government enforced redistribution of wealth ( ?! ) .
What kind of mentality does it take to believe that stating pretty well established facts , completely in context , could amount to propaganda ?

Whether you think this film is propaganda or not , or whether you are a Bush supporter or not , this film should be watched and discussed .
It should not be used as an example of " typical left - wing marxist academic etc " , nor should it needlessly scare everyone to death in thinking Bush is the next Hitler .
Use this film as a reality check , as a jumping off point for discussions .
If people are engaged in political discourse there is a lot less chance of us becoming despots .
Watch this film , and tell your media agencies to start asking tough questions and stop pandering to advertising .

Yes , this film is eerily relevent , no it should not be seen as propaganda .
This film does far too much to encourage discourse to be classified as propaganda .
There is little here that does not simply examine how the concept of despotism might be applied to different scales in order to give the viewer a starting point for their own evaluation of their community .
This is an educational film made for children in order to explain concepts of basic polical philosophy .
Amazingly apathy has so eroded contemporary understandings of politics that we are all less informed than the schoolchildren of the 40's .
Arguements that this film would classify all modern industrialized society as despotic suggest that half a loaf is the same as no bread .
The film clearly states that communities that rank poorly are prone to despotism , not inherently despotic .
However , any country who 's government practises torture has clearly already succumbed to despotism .

Subject : Think Critically
Though it has a fairly transparent pro-marxist ideological agenda ( not exactly rare among intellectuals of the time period ) , this remains a cogent and well - illustrated analysis of the factors involved in the distribution and redistribution of power .
All of the things that this film states about economic disparity apply equally well to governments and private individuals ; and the things it states about informational control apply just as well to corporate media as to state propaganda .
Either one , or the two in concert , can exert pressure to tip the scales away from democracy when the individual 's freedom and voice are not respected .
I 'm sure any mature viewer is capable of taking the ideas presented here with a grain of salt , but there 's no need to throw the baby out with the bath water .
The problems illustrated here are just as real now as they were in the 1950s and 60s .

Subject : Corny , quaint , and evil A transparent eat - the - rich propaganda film from 1946 .
" Despotism " has pretty much one criterion for measuring a country 's " despotism level . "
Is land , money , power concentrated ?
Do rich people exist in YOUR community ?
And are they rude to you ?
( seriously ! )
Aha , then , you suffer from despotism !
The silly film makes no distinction between public and private power ( most of the reviews here missed it , too ) .
Even though it refers to the U.S. , a constitutional republic , it says that democracy is the opposite of despotism .
( A serious flaw , since the opposite of despotism is FREEDOM , while pure democracy is itself a form of tyranny . )
So what 's the cure for our despotism ?
The film lets you figure out the solution on your own , ( since there is only one ) : government - forced redistribution !
Watch this obvious , anti-capitalist film , then compare to the stealthier broadcasts of the BBC , NPR , PBS , MSNBC , etc. of today .

A majority opposed the current Iraq war on moral and economic grounds yet have been exised from the process of participation in our government .
Because your so - called " liberal " media shut down the debate we must conclude that the spector of despotism darkens our own skies .
Corporate domination and government stifling debate are two more examples of despotism given in the film .

Just about a month ago , Brad Warbiany pretty much decimated the logic of the idea that Ron Paul ’s supporters could infiltrate the GOP delegate selection process and steal the nomination for their candidate .
The race went on and yesterday , John McCain secured enough pledged delegates to win the Republican nomination .
Heck , when Ron Paul claimed victory in his Congressional race yesterday , he even talked about representing the good people of TX - 14 for years to come .
That , it would seem , was that .
But then I ran across this February 22nd post from the Paul campaign ’s own blog :
The nominee is decided at the National Convention , by the delegates chosen from state conventions , from those chosen from district and county conventions .
It is tempting to assume the race a “ lost cause ” and abandon it for simpler pursuits , but there are two very important reasons not to : because the assumption is false , and because the assumption debilitates our movement .
Given poll results , media coverage , and the like , it may be hard to believe that Dr. Paul can still win the nomination .
But you must understand that the nomination process is not a fixed procedure governed by the Law of the Primary ; the Republican Party is a private organization , free to change its rules at any time .
It may not be customary , but it certainly cane be done .
If we turn out for the county conventions as we turned out in the streets , we will decide who goes to the state convention .
Likewise , a strong turnout at a state convention gives us the ability not only to elect national delegates but to change the state party rules — to unbind the national delegates , for example .
It might be a long shot , but this is no different from two months ago .
A great number of disgusted patriots in the Republican Party will not suffer a nominee who refuses to defend the right to bear arms and to acknowledge the need for a strong border .
And deep down , they know that every empire is a setting sun .
If we do n’t show up at the conventions , we ’ll be forgotten .
But if we turn out , if we prove where the future of the party lies , other Republicans will first accept and soon believe in us .
And the most ardent of Paul ’s supporters seem to think that this is a viable strategy even today .
See here , here , here , and here , while some people engage in the wonderful pastime of speculating about someone ’s death .
So what ’s going on here ?
Does the campaign really believe the wacko theory about stealing the nomination or are they just stringing people along for donations ?
Update : According to this Texas newspaper , Paul is still holding on to the delusion that the race for the nomination is still going on :
WASHINGTON — President Bush welcomed John McCain to the White House today and hailed him as “ the nominee of the Republican Party . ”
But while that Rose Garden victory celebration was going on , Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul — who issued a statement Tuesday night saying he will return to the U.S.
House next year — continued a presidential race he now seems to be conceding he cannot win .
“ There were 11 .
Now there are two , ” says a posting on Paul ’s Web site that shows the crossed - out faces of nine Republican contenders who have dropped out of the presidential race .
In the Tuesday night statement after he won renomination for his U.S. House seat , Paul said , “ I have no Democrat opponent in November and will serve another term in Congress where I will continue my battle on behalf of taxpayers . ”
“ I look forward to representing all of the good people of the 14th district of Texas in Congress in the years to come , ” he said .
Despite the comments , Paul spokesman Jesse Benton said Paul “ remains in the ( presidential ) race and will do so as long as his supporters wish it . ”
And , apparently , the “ supporters ” wish it :
“ There is a very good chance that John McCain could drop out of the race when enough negative information hits the masses , ” a Paul backer said in a Wednesday e-mail .
“ Ron Paul and his supporters are counting on this .
Whether this is realistic or not , only time will tell . ”
“ McNut did n’t win nothing , ” said another Paul supporter in complaining about reports indicating that Paul , in his comment about remaining in the U.S. House , was conceding defeat in the presidential race .
Ugh .
Guys , John McCain has been in politics for 28 years .
Everybody already knows the negative stuff about him and they ’ve made up their mind accordingly .
Stop engaging in fantasies and do something that actually helps the fight for freedom .
When we started building GeneXproTools ( then APS ) back in 2000 we had the choice of building the user interface either with Visual Basic 6.0 or with MFC .
We agonized over this issue for a while because our backend is all in C++ making MFC the better choice for interoperability .
On the other hand we had very limited resources so we ended up choosing VB to save time .
With the event of .NET VB development was stopped but with the help of third party components it has survived and improved quite a lot .
Fast forward to 2008 and GeneXproTools is a large application with many components written in VB and C ++.
So basically nothing changed and but we are starting to feel the drag of a language , Visual Basic , that has n’t evolved at all .
So , we started mulling over what to do .
Move to MFC ?
Seems like a good idea , especially because Microsoft moved quite a bit in this area with the release of a new toolkit that finally brings MFC into this century .
On the other hand it is still C++ and programming UIs in C++ and MFC is still harder and resource intensive .
Or should we go with .
NET ?
This seems very sensible .
There are lots of very nice third party controls , there ’s a tone of code and documentation out there and it is comparable to writing code in VB Classic as far as resources are concerned .
But the question is what version ?
Just like with VB 6 Microsoft dropped the development of Winforms and is concentrating on WPF which is a very exciting technology .
But the problem is download size .
WPF ships with Vista but has to be manually installed in XP .
The download can be as large as 60 Mb if you go with the latest release of the framework and , what is more important for us ; many companies restrict the installation of frameworks on their desktops .
It is a hard call to make because we want to improve many functional areas in the product , not just the base application .
The ideal case would be a language and library that can interoperate with COM components and C libraries , has good tool support , it is more productive than VB Classic , has all the trimming of a modern language , has a good community and documentation and it is redistributable as a single library or group of libraries .
C# , VB.NET and Java fit all the above criteria except for the last and MFC fails in the productivity arena .
In comes Python
I have been a long time fan of Python with its indenting significance and down to earth syntax .
But it was always an idle kind of interest with lots of reading involved but no action .
So , last week , when I had to make a decision on the direction to take for the next version of GeneXproTools I decided to give it a chance and started developing one of the new sub systems in Python .
Setting up the development environment was pretty painless .
I installed Activestate ’s distribution of Python 2.5 , downloaded and installed Eclipse and PyDev and started playing with Python ’s COM support .
This part is critical for us because GeneXproTools is in divided into three blocks : the base which is the executable , the plugins , which are the several screens and the backend processing units .
All communication between these blocks is done through custom COM interfaces and any new features within each block must be able to implement several interfaces too .
Python has support for COM although I only found one book about it ( Python Programming On Win32 ) which it is out of print .
You can find second hand copies at a premium rate or you can have O’Reilly reprint it for you .
But , best of all , there is a full chapter on Python and COM available at the publisher ’s website which is enough to get you started .
There is also a very active and helpful mailing list ( python - win32 ) manned by no less than the python win32 development team .
Having said this , it is not a seamless experience , especially if you are expecting the same level of hand holding as in VB Classic .
Working with Python and COM resembles to working with C and COM .
But it works and I could find workarounds and solutions to all the issues with help from the documentation , the mailing list and the Win32 Extensions website .
After a week of hard work I was able to implement a large proportion of a new screen for the upcoming GeneXproTools 5.0 where 90 % of the code is Python .
And I am surprised that it was so easy .
All my programming experience is in languages like C# , VB and C++ and Python felt very natural and all the small syntactical differences were a pleasure to discover and use .
Granted that I am not writing Python like a true Pythonista , but these early results are very encouraging and were enough to make me adopt python for the foreseeable future .
Of all the dynamic languages we looked into – and GeneXproTools generates code in 16 languages , many of which are dynamic – Python seems to be the most accessible of all and one of the few that is windows enabled from the start .

Until two decades ago , the farm grew wheat and barley , watered only by rain .
As rainfall dropped , Carlo Almarcha , 51 , switched to growing almonds .
About 10 years ago , he quit almonds and changed to organic peaches and pears , ' since they need less water , ' he explained .
Recently he took up olives and figs , ' which resist drought and are less sensitive to weather . '
6 .
The whole country is suffering from its worst drought in 40 years and the shipments from Tarragona prompted an outcry from regions who insist they need it more .
" While southern Spain has always been dry and plagued by cyclical droughts , the average surface temperature in Spain has risen 2.7 degrees compared with about 1.4 degrees globally since 1880 , records show .
Rainfall here is predicted to fall 20 percent from this year to 2020 , and 40 percent by 2070 , according to United Nations projections .
The changes on the Almarcha family farm in Albanilla over the past three decades are a testament to that hotter , drier climate here .
Mr. Almarcha participates in a government water trading system , started last year , in which farmers pay three times the normal price — 33 cents instead of 12 per cubic meter — to get extra water .
The black market rate is even higher .
Still , his outlook is bleak .
' You used to know that this week in spring there will be rain , ' he said , standing in his work boots on parched soil of an olive grove that was once a wheat field .
' Now you never know when or if it will come .
Also , there ’s no winter any more and plants need cold to rest .
So there ’s less growth .
Sometimes none .
Even plants all seem confused . ' " " A tanker from Marseilles with 36 million litres of drinking water unloaded its first cargo this week , one of a mini- fleet contracted to bring water from the Rhone every few days for at least the next three months .
So humbled was Barcelona when prolonged drought forced it to ship in domestic water from Tarragona , 50 miles south along the Catalan coast , 12 days ago , that city hall almost delayed shipment and considered an upbeat publicity campaign to lift morale and international prestige .
For now the clashes are being soothed by intervention from Madrid , and plans to ship water from desalination plants in parched Almeria in Andalusia are shelved until October .
But there is little indication of a strategy to deal not just with an immediate emergency but an ongoing crisis .
Buying water on an epic scale from France has given the controversy an international aspect as French environmentalists question whether such a scarce natural resource should be sold as a commodity to another country . "
Is Spain 's Drought a Glimpse of Our Future ?
5 . " Tourists heading to the tropics were warned yesterday that their suntan lotion can kill off one of the main attractions of their holiday - the colourful corals that thrive in warmer waters .
Residues from sunscreens that wash off in the sea were shown by researchers to cause coral bleaching , a condition that leads to the death of the organism and the collapse of delicate ocean eco-systems .
Chemical compounds that make up the ultra-violet ( UV ) filters in sunscreens , which are essential to protect the skin against burning , were shown to be harmful to coral reefs , even in small quantities .
The researchers called for regulations to limit human contact with reefs where the coral was already suffering from other environmental threats such as rising sea temperatures . "

Then huge numbers of them swarmed on the city , ten times more than normal .
The number of stings grew so bad that outdoor school events were cancelled , 178 patients were treated in hospital for stings and two people died .
A study now reveals that wasp stings across northern Alaska have increased sevenfold over the past few years .

It passes through a mountain range older than the Himalayas and is blanketed in broadleaf forests rivalled only by the Amazon basin in its biodiversity .
But the canopy of trees which lines the parkway as it rises from the bluegrass horse country to the mountains is a trompe l'oeil .
The lush forest gives way to scraggly trees along the ridge - line , and behind those trees is evidence of unspeakable ecological violence .
In a process known as mountaintop removal an upland moonscape is being created , which is incapable of regenerating trees .
As far as the eye can see , the land is grey and pockmarked with huge black lakes , filled with toxic coal slurry . "
2 . " Climate change has become firmly established as an accelerant to many of the factors which have put one in eight of the world 's birds at risk of extinction , today ’s publication of the 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species of birds has found .
Long - term drought and sudden extreme weather are putting additional stress on the pockets of habitat that many threatened species depend on .
This coupled with extensive and expanding habitat destruction has lead to an increase in the rate of extinction on continents and away from islands , where most historical extinction has occurred .
The 2008 Red List makes grim reading with 1,226 species of bird now threatened , and eight species newly uplisted to Critically Endangered , the highest threat category .
Of the 26 species that changed category owing to changes in their population size , rate of decline or range size , 24 were uplisted to a higher level of threat .
These include widespread continental species like Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata and Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata , both previously of Least Concern , and now regarded as Near Threatened in a global context . "
1. " The Living Planet Index ( LPI ) follows trends in nearly 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species and is said to reflect the impact humans have on the planet .
It is based on a wide range of population datasets , such as commercial data on fish stocks and projects such as the Pan - European Common Bird Monitoring scheme .
New figures show that between 1970 and 2005 , the global LPI has fallen by 27 % .
This suggests that the world will fail to meet the target of reducing the rate of biodiversity loss set by the 2002 Convention on Biological Diversity . "
In a move to halt declining sales Starbucks May Push Loyalty Cards .
Starbucks ( SBUX ) Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz may introduce a plan for a loyalty program to stanch declining U.S. sales at a shareholders meeting tomorrow .
Schultz will probably offer free coffees or discounts to customers using prepaid Starbucks Cards to entice the chain 's most frequent customers to visit more and avoid competitors led by McDonald 's Corp. , said Joseph Buckley , an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co. who recommends holding the stock .
The company may also say it will lower prices on food and drink combinations to win back customers hurt by the slowing economy .
Starbucks has already begun using the prepaid card to offer deals to customers , saying last month that it will give out two hours of free AT&T Inc. wireless Internet access a day to Starbucks Card holders .

This article mentions the Wikimedia Foundation , one of its projects , or people related to it .
Wikinews is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation .
Wikinews has learned that a United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) IP Address has been blocked on Wikipedia after making edits to an article which were considered " vandalism " .
In two separate instances , the IP address from the DOJ removed information from the Wikipedia article about the organization Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) , regarding an attempt by the organization to secretly gain influence on the site .
The IP address has been confirmed by Wikinews to be registered and used by the DOJ located in Washington , D.C .
On April 21 , Electronic Intifada published a report based on leaked emails written between CAMERA and Wikipedia contributors who are allegedly planning to gain influence on the online encyclopedia .
Information about CAMERA 's campaign to influence Wikipedia was first added to the site 's article about the organization on April 21 by user ' Bangpound ' , who cited the Electronic Intifada article .
According to the edit history on the Wikipedia article CAMERA , the entire subsection relating to this controversy was removed by the IP address 149.101.1.130 , which is hosted by ' wdcsun30.usdoj.gov ' and is used by the DOJ .
The IP address removed information regarding CAMERA 's plan to " cooperate with prominent Wikipedia editors to promote a Zionist viewpoint and oppose pro-Arab viewpoints on Wikipedia " at least two separate times , on April 24 and April 25 .
The IP address belonging to the DOJ also made edits identified as vandalism to the Wikipedia articles Tracy Jordan , Roger Ebert , and James E. Akins .
After several warnings on the IP address 's " talk page " , the IP address was blocked for four days for " repeated vandalism . "
Several hours prior to the DOJ edits , an IP address also from Washington D.C. , 71.178.102.65 , removed the same information .
Wikinews can confirm the IP address is located in Washington D.C. and belongs to Verizon .
The Justice employee is attempting to scrub any mention of CAMERA 's activities to influence Wikipedia .
— Wikipedia editor Lawrence Cohen
Wikipedia administrators were kept apprised in an ongoing discussion about the incident at Wikipedia 's Administrators ' noticeboard .
" The Justice employee is attempting to scrub any mention of CAMERA 's activities to influence Wikipedia ( now double - sourced ) as seen here in this edit , " said Wikipedia editor Lawrence Cohen , in an initial post to the Administrators ' noticeboard .
Founded in 1982 , CAMERA is a pro-Israel media - monitoring and research non-profit organization based in Boston , Massachusetts .
On April 21 the Electronic Intifada , a not - for - profit online publication which covers the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict from a Palestinian perspective , published an article describing efforts by CAMERA to secretly influence Wikipedia articles .
According to the article , Electronic Intifada obtained a series of emails between CAMERA and members of Wikipedia , attempting to game the encyclopedia and influence articles on the site related to Israel .
There is no need to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions .
— Gilead Ini , Senior Research Analyst , CAMERA
Electronic Intifada quoted a March 13 email from Gilead Ini , a Senior Research Analyst at CAMERA , who enlisted volunteers to make sure articles about Israel on Wikipedia were " free of bias and error , and include necessary facts and context " .
In a follow - up email from March 17 , Ini emphasized secrecy , telling the email list members not to " forward it to members of the news media " , and wrote that " There is no need to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions . "
The media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticized the CAMERA emails , calling them " particularly insidious " because " stealth and misrepresentation are presented as the keys to success . "
Later discussions in the series of emails obtained by Electronic Intifada included advice on how to get members of CAMERA elected as Wikipedia administrators , in order to gain influence .
Wikipedia user ' Zeq ' posted to the list : " One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [ sic ] articles for one month until they [ sic ] interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia [ sic ] editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator . "
After the IP address belonging to the DOJ was blocked , Wikipedia editors informed the Wikimedia Foundation 's Communications committee about the incident .
Both Wikinews and Wikipedia are projects of the Wikimedia Foundation .
In addition to the DOJ IP address , several Wikipedia users determined to be cooperating with the CAMERA campaign to influence Wikipedia had also previously been blocked by Wikipedia administrators .
Wikinews requested a statement from the Department of Justice on the edits to Wikipedia , but as of this article 's publication had not received a response .

MSNBC host says Mukasey needs to investigate Rove meddling in Siegelman case David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday February 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This A 60 Minutes investigation into the prosecution of Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman has focused new attention on the case .
Whistleblowers say the Democratic governor is in jail because of a Republican - led witch - hunt that was at least partially motivated by White House adviser Karl Rove .
Siegelman has called for a Special Prosecutor to investigate , and the Alabama attorney who 's alleged Rove 's involvement says Congress should investigate .
Rove denies reports of his involvement .
Speaking to an audience in Los Angeles after the CBS report aired , he attempted to downplay the myth of his political influence and said the allegations against him were lies .
" I want him to swear in front of the United States Congress , and swear what he is saying is true , " Dana Jill Simpson told MSNBC 's Dan Abrams .
Simpson has previously told news outlets , including RAW STORY , Harpers and 60 Minutes that Rove asked her to gather dirt on Siegelman .
Abrams said Attorney General Michael Mukasey should investigate the case .
" This is about politicizing our justice system and it just cannot go unchecked , " he said .
Karl Rove , through his attorney , declared that Simpsons allegations are false and the story " foolish . "  60 Minutes owes Mr. Rove an apology for circulating this false and foolish story , " Rove attorney 's Robert Luskin said .
RAW STORY 's earlier reports on the Siegleman case are available here : Part I , Part II , Part III .
The excerpted video is from MSNBC's MSNBC Live with Dan Abrams , broadcast February 25 , 2008 .
MSNBC 's full video appears below .
Transcript via closed captions :: former alabama governor don siegelman , a democrat , remains in a federal penitentiary serving time for bribes and conspiracy .
it seems he was singled out and prosecuted because he was a democrat , possibly at the request of former presidential adviser karl rove .
a key witness described corruption involving the former governor and two alabama republicans .
one currently a federal judge the other a u.s. senator .
only siegelman the democrat , was investigated and prosecuted .
" 60 minutes " reporting that last night that prosecutors met with the witness 70 times to get his testimony straight that not provided to the defense .
now more information from a republican lawyer dana jill simpson said she heard discussions at how rove led the effort to bring siegelman down and rove asked her to spy on siegelman and try to catch him cheating on his wife .
52 former state attorneys general , democrats and republicans now crying foul , including grant woods , former ag in arizona who is backing john mccain for president . :: i have n't seen the case with this many red flags on it that pointed towards a real injustice being done . :: the group of 52 former ags wrote to thehouse judiciary committee urging them to investigate .
when " 60 minutes " followed up on our story they either had the worst stroke of bad luck in television history or something far more insidious .
this story was mysteriously blacked out in a part of alabama , but only in alabama and only this story .
joining us now dana jill simpson and doug jones .
thanks very much to both of you .
mr. jones , let me start with you .
when you were defending him in 2004 , so you were clearly under the impression this case was going away . :: don was under indictment in another district .
we met with the prosecutors and talked about it .
they had written off a number of the things and clearly gave the impression this case was going south .
not until after the case in birmingham was dismissed they got another one . :: november 2002 , siegelman nar lowly loses for governor .
he is indicted on krups charges .
on october 2004 the charges are dropped .
in 2005 he launches another run for governor .
october 2005 he is indicted on 32 counts , bribery and conspiracy .
he loses the democratic primary and sentenced to seven years in prison . :: that 's right . :: it 's awfully suspicious , is n't it ? :: it is very suspicious if we were correct .
i'm telling you this case seemed to be going away .
only after that case in birmingham was dismissed we were told there was a meeting in washington .
they started over with the case .
ramped it up in 2005 that ultimately led to the indictment . :: all right .
and in washington karl rove may have been involved .
ms . simpson , you met with karl rove , what did he say to you about mr. siegelman ? :: that he wanted me to find mr. siegelman .
he suspected he was cheating on his wife and he asked me if i would follow him . :: you did n't turn out , you did n't find anything , et cetera , as you did that , but you also overheard phone calls did you not where you heard top republicans in alabama -- :: yes , i did . :: something about having his girls working on it , not rove but another top alabama official ? :: well , what happened was we had bill canary in alabama basically who was involved in a phone call with me that i had gotten some photos of another matter and bill said he was going to get his girls to take care of don siegelman .
he was married to laura canary .
the two girls he was talking about was laura canary and alice martin , both united states attorney generals . :: here is a sound piece from karl rove denying this happened or he met with you . :: i did not ask her or anyone to dig up dirty photographs on the governor .
i've never worked with her .
i never met her .
i never asked her to do a darn thing .
what is your response to that ? :: well , this is what i'd say .
since karl rove has said that and he feels so good about saying that i want him to swear in front of the unite congress and swear what he is saying is true . :: as yo know the , alabama republican party is coming after you saying we can't find one instance of dana jill simple sop volunteering or working on behalf of the alabama republican party nor can we find anyone within the republican party leadership that has ever heard of dana jill simpson . :: that is absolutely a lie .
it has been said by mike hubbard bard the chairman of the republican party .
mr. hubbard is going to have a real problem .
he has to explain how i was talking on the telephone to the party headquarters in 2006 and also talking to the campaign in 2002 and further he is going to have to also explain how i have records showing i was talking to him in washington and also in virginia .
about the campaign .
back in 2002 . :: the notion that karl rove even may have been involved in pulling the strings here is an outrage . :: it is .
it needs to be looked at .
obviously , you have a new attorney general .
somebody needs to look at this because what is following this , dan , i think is important is the fact that nick bailey , the interview with bailey -- :: the key witness . :: which he is saying is coached .
there is an affidavit in a completely different case where the wife of a jefferson county commissioner said agents tried to get her husband to make false statements . :: i'm going to call for the attorney general michael mukasey , at times i have been critical of , times i have supported , to take a look at this case .
somebody needs to take a look at this .
attorney general mukasey , we are going to follow up with you .
this is serious business .
this is about politicizing our justice system and it just cannot go unchecked .
doug jones and dana jill simpson , thank you very much .
Charter schools , like public schools , receive government money and must therefore stay out of the religion debate .
That is to say there should be no proselytizing in the classroom one way or the other .
The schools must remain secular .
Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy ( TIZA ) is a K - 8 charter school in Inver Grove Heights , Minnesota .
There ’s not a single mention of Islam on the school ’s website , not even on the description page .
Yet , the school is completely tearing down the wall of separation of state and mosque .
Katherine Kersten of the Star Tribune says that “ TIZA is an Islamic school , funded by Minnesota taxpayers . ”
What does she mean by that ?
TIZA has many characteristics that suggest a religious school .
It shares the headquarters building of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota , whose mission is “ establishing Islam in Minnesota . ”
The building also houses a mosque .
TIZA ’s executive director , Asad Zaman , is a Muslim imam , or religious leader , and its sponsor is an organization called Islamic Relief .
Students pray daily , the cafeteria serves halal food – permissible under Islamic law — and “ Islamic Studies ” is offered at the end of the school day .
Some of that seems benign …
Islamic students have a right to pray ( if they choose ) and the school can offer programs for a heavily Islamic student population .
But Kersten has a smoking gun : Amanda Getz was a substitute teacher at the school one day last month .
Getz has plenty of evidence that suggests TIZA is completely overstepping its bounds .
She gives us insight into how TIZA is a taxpayer - funded Islamic school .
Arriving on a Friday , the Muslim holy day , she says she was told that the day ’s schedule included a “ school assembly ” in the gym after lunch .
Before the assembly , she says she was told , her duties would include taking her fifth - grade students to the bathroom , four at a time , to perform “ their ritual washing . ”
Afterward , Getz said , “ teachers led the kids into the gym , where a man dressed in white with a white cap , who had been at the school all day , ” was preparing to lead prayer .
Beside him , another man “ was prostrating himself in prayer on a carpet as the students entered . ”
“ The prayer I saw was not voluntary , ” Getz said .
“ The kids were corralled by adults and required to go to the assembly where prayer occurred . ” Islamic Studies was also incorporated into the school day .
“ When I arrived , I was told ‘ after school we have Islamic Studies , ’ and I might have to stay for hall duty , ” Getz said .
“ The teachers had written assignments on the blackboard for classes like math and social studies .
Islamic Studies was the last one — the board said the kids were studying the Qu’ran .
The students were told to copy it into their planner , along with everything else .
That gave me the impression that Islamic Studies was a subject like any other . ”
After school , Getz ’s fifth - graders stayed in their classroom and the man in white who had led prayer in the gym came in to teach Islamic Studies .
TIZA has in effect extended the school day — buses leave only after Islamic Studies is over .
Getz did not see evidence of other extra-curricular activity , except for a group of small children playing outside .
Significantly , 77 percent of TIZA parents say that their “ main reason for choosing TIZA … was because of after - school programs conducted by various non-profit organizations at the end of the school period in the school building , ” according to a TIZA report .
TIZA may be the only school in Minnesota with this distinction .
How does something like this happen ?
While Zaman says the school has been inspected “ numerous times ” by the Minnesota Department of Education , the MDoE only documents three visits to the school in five years , none of which focused on the school ’s religious practices .
Zaman says the prayers are student - led and voluntary .
Getz certainly did n’t think that was the case .
Kersten writes :
… prayer at TIZA does not appear to be spontaneously initiated by students , but rather scheduled , organized and promoted by school authorities .
How long will it be until the state puts a stop to this ?
Some reviews are already underway .
The ACLU of Minnesota has launched an investigation of TIZA , and the Minnesota Department of Education has also begun a review .
Kersten gives us a final bit of analysis :
TIZA ’s operation as a public , taxpayer - funded school is troubling on several fronts .
TIZA is skirting the law by operating what is essentially an Islamic school at taxpayer expense .
The Department of Education has failed to provide the oversight necessary to catch these illegalities , and appears to lack the tools to do so .
In addition , there ’s a double standard at work here — if TIZA were a Christian school , it would likely be gone in a heartbeat .
TIZA is now being held up as a national model for a new kind of charter school .
If it passes legal muster , Minnesota taxpayers may soon find themselves footing the bill for a separate system of education for Muslims .
This story needs to be spread — hell , it ’s a topic on which atheists and Christians should all be able to agree .
It ’d be nice if Muslim Congressmen Keith Ellison and Andre Carson spoke out against public funding of this school as well .

DRIVERS who can position their car in the middle of a parking space at a supermarket are sliding closer to extinction , conservationists have warned .
Research teams have recorded a sharp decline in numbers over the last decade , despite strenuous efforts to educate the public about how easy it is to just put your fucking car in the middle of a parking space .
Dr Tom Logan , head of species protection at the WWF , said : “ There is a series of white lines separated by spaces roughly the same width as a car , plus a little bit more .
Let ’s think of that as the first Great Big Fucking Clue shall we ?
“ As we approach , we then have to ask ourselves : ‘ do I park on the white line , do I straddle the white line or do I get my huge , chocolate - covered face out of my fat , greedy , unwashed arse and just put the fucking car in the middle of the fucking space ? ' ”
Conservationists have blamed the crisis on a combination of poaching , loss of habitat and an unbelievable fucking selfishness by a bunch of total and complete bastards .
WWF warned that drivers who can park in the middle of a space will soon share the fate of people who knew not to park four feet from the fucking kerb , extinct since 1993 .
Dr Logan added : “ A fucking mountain gorilla could do this with its fucking eyes shut , but for some reason the average British motorist seems to think every car park in the world was made just for them .
“ Or maybe they ’ve heard that if they park on the white line Graham - fucking - Norton is going to jump out from behind a bottle - bank and send them on holiday to Orlando .
“ Anyway , the point is we need more money . ”
He compared money managers who promise double - digit returns to the queen in “ Alice in Wonderland , ” who proclaimed , “ Why , sometimes I ’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . ”
Mr. Buffett added , “ Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while he fills his pockets with fees . ”
Mr. Buffett pointed out that some companies with pension plans in both Europe and the United States assume better returns on the American plans than the European ones .
“ This discrepancy is puzzling , ” he said .
“ Why should these companies not put their U.S. managers in charge of the non-U.S. pension assets and let them work their magic on these assets as well ?
I ’ve never seen this puzzle explained .
But the auditors and actuaries who are charged with vetting the return assumptions seem to have no problem with it . ”
“ What is no puzzle , however , is why C.E.O.s opt for a high investment assumption :
It lets them report higher earnings .
And if they are wrong , as I believe they are , the chickens wo n’t come home to roost until long after they retire . ”
Mr. Buffett also had harsh words for state and local governments .
“ Public pension promises are huge and , in many cases , funding is woefully inadequate .
Because the fuse on this time bomb is long , politicians flinch from inflicting tax pain , given that problems will only become apparent long after these officials have departed .
Promises involving very early retirement  sometimes to those in their low 40s  and generous cost - of - living adjustments are easy for these officials to make .
In a world where people are living longer and inflation is certain , those promises will be anything but easy to keep . ”
He did not discuss why he wanted to insure municipal bonds issued by governments making such promises .
Mr. Buffett also warned of lower profits ahead for the insurance industry , which has benefited from two years without major disasters .

Cheney lawyer claims Congress lacks power to conduct oversight over vice president
John Byrne
‘ I trust you will not turn your back ’ on respecting Congress , Democrat says
In what appears yet another effort to strengthen his position in the executive branch , the attorney for Vice President Dick Cheney said in a letter released by Congress Thursday that the Congress “ lacks the constitutional power ” to conduct oversight over his job .
The letter came in response to requests that Cheney ’s chief of staff David Addington testify about the his role in approving harsh interrogation tactics — which some see as torture — at Guantanamo Bay .
Cheney has long battled Congress over oversight .
In particular , Congress has sought , and failed , to acquire information from his office regarding his meetings with oil company executives to discuss energy policy in 2001 .
Cheney was also the subject of a Washington Post series which detailed his attempts to strengthen the position of the vice presidency as a bulwark against inquiry .
“ As the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in Barenblatt V. United States , 460 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , the power of Congress under the Constitution to inquire ( which Members of Congress and congressional employees often refer to by the term “ oversight ” ) is coextensive with its power to legislate , ” Cheney lawyer Kathryn Wheelbarger wrote .
“ The power of Congress to legislate is not limitless and therefore is neither the power to inquire .
“ Congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by a law what a Vice President communicates in the performance of the Vice President ’s official duties , or what a Vice President recommends that a President communicate in the President ’s performance of official duties , and therefore those matters are not within the Committee ’s power of inquiry , ” Wheelbarger added .
Wheelbarger cites Barenblatt V. United States , 460 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , as her justification .
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers fired back in a letter Thursday questioning Wheelbarger ’s rationale .
He quotes a Supreme Court justice ’s opinion in the case :
“ The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history , over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate , ” wrote Supreme Court Justice John Harlan in his opinion .
“ … The scope of the power of inquiry , in short , is as penetrating and far - reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution . ”
Conyers notes later in his reply that numerous White House officials have testified to committees of Congress , including White House counsels and chiefs of staff and the Chief of Staff to the Vice President .
“ On October 17 , 1974 , I was present when President Ford himself testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee on issues relating to the Nixon pardon , ” the Detroit Democrat writes .
“ The invitation to appear is thus based on a long tradition of comity between the branches …
These principles have served our nation well , and I trust you will not turn your back on them now . ”
Wheelbarger , however , has more legal weapons in her arsenal .
She says that Cheney ’s chief of staff is n’t the most appropriate to ask questions of if Congress is looking to get answers regarding the President ’s opinions .
She suggests that Congress seek to ask questions of the Attorney General instead .
“ With respect to Presidential power in wartime and related issues under U.S. and international law , the Attorney General or his designee would be the appropriate witness , ” she writes .
Further , she indicates that even if Cheney ’s chief of staff were to testify , little of his testimony would be of any use because he would be limited by executive and attorney client privilege .
Prior to being appointed Cheney ’s chief of staff , Addington was Cheney ’s personal attorney .
Wheelbarger ’s letter is transcribed below .
It is available in PDF format here .
The letter of April 11 , 2008 from the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives ( “ Committee request ” ) informed the Office of the Vice President that the Committee plans to hold a hearing on May 6 to explore : ( 1 ) “ issues regarding the nature and scope of Presidential power in a time of war , ” ( 2 ) “ the Administration ’s approach to these questions under US and international law ; ” and ( 3 ) “ United States policies regarding interrogation of persons in the custody of the nation ’s intelligence services and armed forces . ”
The letter invited the Chief of Staff to the Vice President to appear at the hearing .
The Committee request seeks authoritative representation on the three subjects identified in the Committee request .
The Chief of Staff to the Vice President is an employee of the Vice President , and not the President , and therefore is not in a position to speak on behalf of the President .
With respect to Presidential power in wartime and related issues under U.S. and international law , the Attorney General or his designee would be the appropriate witness .
Regarding interrogation of persons by US intelligence agencies or the armed forces , the Director of National Intelligence or his designee and Secretary of Defense or his designee , respectively , would be the appropriate witness .
You may wish to invite the appropriate subordinates of the President in lieu of your invitation to the Chief of Staff to the Vice President .
As the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in Barenblatt V. United States , 460 U.S. 109 ( 1959 ) , the power of Congress under the Constitution to inquire ( which Members of Congress and congressional employees often refer to by the term “ oversight ” ) is coextensive with its power to legislate .
The power of Congress to legislate is not limitless and therefore is neither the power to inquire .
For example , Congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by a law what a Vice President communicates in the performance of the Vice President ’s official duties , or what a Vice President recommends that a President communicate in the President ’s performance of official duties , and therefore those matters are not within the Committee ’s power of inquiry .
In addition to a constitutional basis for a House inquiry , a particularly committee of the House also needs jurisdiction assigned by the House for the inquiry .
It would be helpful to know from the Committee the scope of the Committee ’s inquiry and the legal basis for it .
Finally , even if , separate from any question of immunity from testimony , a case were to arise in which a voluntary appearance might be appropriate under the law , questions of privilege may arise with respect to information sought by questions , such as respect to privileges protecting state secrets , attorney - client communications , deliberations , and communications among Presidents , Vice Presidents , and their advisers .
For example , the amount of useful information a Committee of Congress would be likely to receive from a person who served as Counsel to the Vice President and then Chief of Staff to the Vice President concerning official duties is quite limited , given that a principal function of such a person is engaging in privileged communications , such as the giving of privileged advice .
Also , inquiry by a House Committee concerning the Senate function of the Vice President would not , in any event , be appropriate .
The Committee may wish to hold the Committee request in abeyance while it exhausts other sources for the kinds of information the Committee seeks , or the Committee may wish to forgo the Committee request altogether .
If , however , the Committee wishes to pursue the Committee request , please advise of the time for which you have invited the Chief of Staff to the Vice President , and of the legal basis for the request under the Constitution and the House Rules .
We look forward to receiving such information from the Committee to enable us to further evaluate the request and communicate with you …
This letter is provided as a matter of comity , with respect for the constitutional role of the House of Representatives , and reserving all legal authorities and privileges that may apply .
Sincerely ,
Kathryn L. Wheelbarger Counsel to the Vice President

Singular ' do you want to revert this change ? '
Applied .
And I just have to say : Eric , you are awsome .
However , from a computational linguist ( even if you * did* get your PhD in France ) , I expect more from you than this .
For instance , there is some present participle code in Unrecord that could be refactored .
And really , NounLike is a bit confusing , surely there must be a term for " pluralizable " ?
After all , I 'd like to be able to safely ( with static guarantees of grammatical correctness ) define functions such as makeDefinite :: NounLike n => n -> ???
makeDefinite n = ???
makeIndefinite :: NounLike n => n -> ??? -- show ( singular $ makeIndefinite $ Noun " apple " ) == " an apple " -- show ( singular $ makeIndefinite $ Noun " plum " ) == " a plum " -- show ( plural $ makeIndefinite $ Noun " plum " ) == " some apples "
What 's the good of having a haskell - programming computational linguist on board if we can't get static compile - time guarantees of grammatical correctness ?

Embattled Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg came under fire from the Tories today as they pledged to fight on in their battle to force a referendum on the EU Lisbon Treaty .
As Mr Clegg battles to shore up his leadership , the Opposition are now planning to reintroduce their amendment calling for a public ballot when the treaty goes before the House of Lords .
They believe the parliamentary make - up there , where the Government has no overall majority , could work in their favour even if the Liberal Democrats abstained as they did in last night 's poll .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " The Liberal Democrats ' position will once again be pivotal .
We will see if they follow their three - line whip in the Commons to abstain . "
Almost a quarter of LibDem MPs crossed the floor last night to vote for a referendum in defiance of a three - line whip imposed by Mr Clegg demanding that they abstain .
Frontbenchers Alistair Carmichael , Tim Farron and David Heath all stepped down so that they could vote with the Tories in favour of a referendum on what is the biggest shift of power to Brussels for at least a decade .
Some 29 Labour rebels also voted for the Tory amendment but the overall poll went in the Government 's favour by 311 votes to 248 , a majority of 63 .

A Tory amendment calling for a referendum was defeated by 311 votes to 248 - a Government majority of 63
In the Commons today , the fledgling LibDem leader , who is just three months in the job , was mocked by the Tories for plunging his party into crisis .
Shadow leader of the house Theresa May said : " Yesterday in this House the Liberal Democrat leader flunked his first big test .
" He sat on the fence as a point of principle , he divided his party after only a few weeks and he 's created two classes of frontbenchers - those who have to resign for rebelling and those who do n't .
" Weak , divided and vacillating .
Can we have a debate on the qualities of political leadership ? "
Mr Clegg was not in the chamber but his party 's spokesman Simon Hughes struggled to make himself heard as Tory and Labour MPs laughed and groaned .
Sir Patrick Cormark then got in on the act by likening the Liberal Democrats to the Mugwumps - an American political movement from the 19th century .
Amidst cheers and laughter from MPs , he called for a debate on the naming of political parties .
He said : " ( Ms Harman ) will be aware that in 19th century America there was a party known as the Mugwumps .
" They were so called because they sat with their mugs on one side of the fence and their wumps on the other ... would that not be a better description for this lot ( the Liberal Democrats ) down here . "

Under pressure : LibDem leader Nick Clegg was attacked for not giving his party a free vote
Mr Clegg has denied that he made a massive miscalculation in ordering his party to abstain , claiming that he has the support of the " overwhelming majority " .
But he is now under intense pressure to reassert his authority when he delivers his first big setpiece speech as party leader at the Lib Dems ' spring conference this weekend .
The party has long been regarded as the most unified over the thorny issue of Europe but somehow came out of last night 's poll the most bitterly divided .
Like the Government , Mr Clegg had argued that a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty was not needed because it was not the same as the failed EU constitution .
But his MPs reacted with fury , many having consistently pledged - along with both Labour and the Tories - that there would be a referendum .
None of the three MPs who resigned have been replaced , with their duties simply reassigned to other members of the frontbench team .
Mr Clegg is planning to talk to eight other rebels , including yet more frontbenchers , but the walk - out has left him with little room for manoeuvre .

Yesterday 's Commons defeat means a vote in the House of Lords - where the Government could be defeated by Tories and crossbenchers - will be the last chance for campaigners .
That vote is due later this year .
A public ballot has huge backing , with 88 per cent of voters in mini-polls last weekend demanding a chance to have their say .
The Lisbon Treaty will see the creation of a permanent EU president , foreign minister and diplomatic service and surrenders nearly 50 national vetoes to Brussels .
All three main parties made manifesto pledges in 2005 to hold a referendum on the EU constitution - now the revamped Lisbon Treaty .
Yesterday David Cameron taunted the Prime Minister that he was afraid of holding a national vote on the treaty because he knew it would be lost .
The Tory leader told Mr Brown at Prime Minister 's Questions : " All of us in this House promised a referendum .
We have the courage of our convictions - you have lost your courage and that lot ( the Liberal Democrats ) have lost their convictions . "
Shadow Foreign Secretary William
Hague said : " The unavoidable implication is that politicians are not trustworthy , that Parliament does not see itself as accountable and votes do not necessarily matter .
" All attempts to wriggle out of that commitment will only be seen , and will only be , the weasel words with which a solemn promise is deliberately and calculatingly broken . "
Even pro-European former Chancellor Ken Clarke questioned the Government 's position .
" Will you stop all this nonsense about it being different from the constitution , because it is plainly the same in substance , and explain why it is better not to have a referendum but have it decided in parliament , " he said .
Mr Brown accused the Conservatives of heading towards " the margins " of Europe by failing to support the Lisbon Treaty .
He insisted that the change would not create a " United States of Europe " .
Mr Clegg had argued for an " in or out of Europe " referendum , which failed to even get a vote , leading to questions over his judgment .
Insiders claimed Mr Clegg 's hands were tied because the decision to abstain had been inherited from his predecessor , Sir Menzies Campbell .
But another source said the leader had failed to realise that LibDem MPs were not as sold on the European ideal as the party 's peers and MEPs .
LibDem rebel Mike Hancock , a backbencher who represents Portsmouth South , described the party 's position as " a mess " .
He said that while Mr Clegg retained his support , the leader had blundered by not offering his MPs a free vote .
A senior LibDem MP criticised Mr Clegg for handling the issue " badly at best , incompetently at worst " .
But he insisted it would not jeopardise Mr Clegg 's job , saying it simply reflected his " inexperience " .
However he warned : " Lessons need to be learned , and quickly . "
Today , Liberal Democrat MEP
Chris Davies also insisted that Mr Clegg 's leadership was not under threat .
" Nick Clegg 's leadership , after three months , is utterly unchallenged , " he told the BBC .
" The man is so obviously intelligent , so disarmingly good - humoured and self - deprecating even in situations like this and so absolutely determined to fight the liberal corner even when his views may not be popular , that he is at one with the very heart and soul of this party and you will see that at the weekend 's conference .
" Nick Clegg is going to be leader of the Liberal Democrats for a very long time . "
He added : " He has had a very difficult set of cards to play but an abstention is not a cop-out .
It is just a third choice when the other two are not acceptable . "
Air America 's Randi Rhodes said suspended for calling Clinton , Ferraro ' whores '
Air America has allegedly suspended talk radio host Randi Rhodes after she made scathing statements off - air about Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and former Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro .
" What a whore Geraldine Ferraro is !
She 's such a fucking whore ! "
Rhodes remarked .
" Hillary is a big fucking whore , too " to a mixed audience reaction .
" You know why she 's a big fucking whore ?
Because her deal is always , ' Read the fine print , asshole ! ' "
A video of Rhodes ' remarks appears below .
" Air America has suspended on - air host Randi Rhodes for making inappropriate statements about prominent figures , including Senator Hillary Clinton , at a recent public appearance on behalf of Air America in San Francisco which was sponsored by an Air America affiliate station , " according to a statement by Air America released to the Huffington Post .
" Air America encourages strong opinions about public affairs but does not condone such abusive , ad hominem language by our Hosts , " company chair Charlie Kireker said in a statement .
Sales of factory - farmed chickens have slumped since a high - profile campaign raised awareness of the cruelty at the heart of the poultry industry and implored consumers to pay more to improve the animals ' welfare .
In a victory for campaigners who have fought to expose the short and brutal lives of broiler birds , shoppers have bought millions more free - range and organic birds while leaving mass - produced chickens on the shelves .
Sales of free - range poultry shot up by 35 per cent last month compared with January 2007 , while sales of standard indoor birds fell by 7 per cent , according to a survey of 25,000 shoppers by the market research company TNS .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Supermarkets have been stripped of free - range birds , prompting complaints from frustrated shoppers keen to embrace the movement away from intensive farming .
The rise in sales would have been even higher if poultry producers had been able to keep up with demand .
Many suppliers in the £ 2 bn - a - year poultry industry are now expected to convert cramped chicken sheds into more spacious accommodation .
Tesco , the country 's biggest retailer , has doubled its order for higher - welfare chickens while Sainsbury 's has been flabbergasted by the " unprecedented " spurt in demand and forced to import free - range birds from France .
In the weeks after the chefs Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver launched a high - profile campaign on Channel 4 , supermarkets had stated that sales of " standard " chickens had held up , and even increased .
But the new national sales data suggests that shoppers ' priorities have shifted dramatically .
If the TNS data was extrapolated to the rest of the UK , it suggests sales of factory - farmed chickens dipped by 10 million , while shoppers bought 4.4 million more free - range chickens .
Overall , chicken sales were down by 4.8 per cent , perhaps because many people , when faced with an absence of free - range chicken , simply bought no chicken .
The campaign against mass - produced poultry , of which a quarter have difficulty walking as a result of wading around in their own waste , is to be intensified .
Fearnley - Whittingstall intends to produce a new television show on chickens later this year , updating viewers on the campaign and urging more people to join what he hopes will turn into a free - range revolution .
" We are going to keep the pressure up and we are going to do everything we can to make sure that this is not a flash in the pan , " he said .
During his Hugh's Chicken Run shows , residents of the Devon town of Axminster were invited to see free - range and intensive systems running alongside each other in a shed ; many left in tears .
According to separate polling by ACNielsen , half of the four million viewers who saw the shows said they would buy better chicken .
The cruelty inflicted on broiler birds was also exposed in secret footage from a farm , reported last month in The Independent .
Earlier this month – to the disgust of the National Farmers ' Union and animal welfare groups – Tesco announced a week - long offer of a £ 1.99 chicken .
The move is believed by welfare campaigners to have been an attempt to shift unsold standard birds .
" If the growing consumer demand for free - range , organic and higher - welfare chicken continues , availability in store could certainly become an important barrier to consumer choice , at least in the short term , " said Maria Carrol , ACNielsen 's consumer insight manager .
Compassion in World Farming , a campaign group which shot undercover footage inside a chicken shed in Herefordshire , was jubilant .
" It seems to me that there is a swath of people who have been moved by the programmes and it seems to be a lasting move , a definite move away from standard to free - range , " said its food policy officer Rowen West - Henzell .
" That 's great .
But what we need to do is to work with the people who still buy standard and we are 100 per cent committed to giving consumers the facts about poultry production and letting them make their own minds up .
With the programme they were exposed to that reality . "
About 800 million chickens are bred in the UK every year .
About 92 per cent of them are still of the " standard " variety , despite the increase this year .
" I am thrilled but I am still a little bit cautious , " said Fearnley - Whittingstall .
" I am delighted we have helped create this change and I am delighted that , two months after the show , there appears to be no letting up .
" I just hope the British retailers and the industry are talking to each other , making sure that new free - range farms are built and new RSPCA Freedom Food farms are built to cater for a growing demand for high welfare chicken . "

Debbie Aylett says she has mixed feelings about going to Afghanistan
Debbie Aylett , 48 , from Southsea , goes to the front line in Afghanistan in the new year where her son , Tom , 22 , is already serving .
As an army major she is senior in rank to Tom who is a marine in 40 commando .
" I 've already told him to call me ma'am and not mum , " she said , adding that it was " a bit bizarre " .
She added : " I never thought I would be in the same theatre of war as Tom but it will be good .
Realistic about danger
" I have mixed feelings about going but I do want to do what I have been training for although I am slightly apprehensive as I have n't done a tour of duty before , " the mother - of - two said .
Mrs Aylett , who works as a ward sister in the cardiac department of the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth , volunteered to serve for three months in the war - torn country .
She will fly out on 11 January to help run 243 Field hospital at Camp Bastion in Helmand province .
" I have to be realistic about the risk of Tom getting hurt .
I cannot guarantee it will not happen because that is the sort of chance he takes in his job .
" But I would rather be out there if anything happens to him .
At least me and my colleagues can use all our medical skills to help him . "
Mrs Aylett joined the TA eight years ago while Tom , her elder son , who joined the Royal Marines four years ago , is on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan .
Here 's our vision of the next Nintendo DS , compiled from rumors , logic and ( wet ) dreams .
It 's got a slimmer profile and a seamless shell thanks to a MacBook - style hinge .
Inside : more power , larger screens — the top one being a 3.5 - inch widescreen to play downloaded movies — a flash card slot for media and continuation of that amazing sleeker look .
Hit the jump for our high - definition mock - up with full specs .

First of all , while this may not be the actual next - gen DS , it can't be very far from the truth .
We do n't want anything crazy : in fact , most of the things we ask for here are already being contemplated by Nintendo , according to the latest rumors .
Bring on the Power - Ups
Internally , we would like a slightly faster processor and better graphics .
Given the prevalence of integrated chipsets that combine 3D graphics , multimedia and communications into a single low - voltage die , it would be very easy for Nintendo to upgrade the engine of its flagship .
Advertisement
At the core , the latest generation of processors will guarantee the very low power consumption crucial to a portable .
Thanks to phones and PMPs , the price of these components has come down to the point where it 's economically feasible for the big N to eat a few mushrooms and make the Nintendo DS a portable console closer in performance to the GameCube than to the Nintendo64 .
It could be capable of driving denser , more complex 3D graphics , offering proper speech recognition ( unlike Brain Training now ) and displaying built - in video decompression and scaling .
We also would n't mind Nintendo dropping compatibility with old Game Boy games , provided it added 1 ) an emulation engine connected to the Nintendo Wii arcade store ( with Game Boy titles ) and 2 ) an SD card slot , to store those games as well as movies .
The icing on the cake would be an accelerometer inside .
These could open new possibilities to games .
One of my favorite games in the iPhone is Labyrinth , which allows you to guide a ball through a maze using the accelerometer , just like you use the Wiimote .
Nintendo actually pioneered this back in the Game Boy Color days with Kirby Tilt n' Tumble so we 're really just asking to bring it back .
Finally , a built - in light sensor could be used for two things : first , to save energy by dynamically regulating the backlighting of the screens according to the ambient light and second , for games like Boktai .

Shiny !
So nice !
Outside , the Nintendo DS will be an evolution of the current design .
The new DS would close perfectly , like a slim , silver white clamshell with sightly - rounded edges .
Thanks to the MacBook - style hinge , the surface will not have any breaks , looking like silver ingot in your hands except for the matte DS logo on top , plus the necessary slots on the sides and the requisite lettering and battery compartment seam on the bottom .
Advertisement
Inside , the color should be black , getting back to the old - style Nintendo GameWatch two - color scheme but updated to 2008 .
On the top part , the new 3.5 - inch widescreen — capable to display both games and movies played from the SD flash card — will maintain the quality of the current version but with a slightly higher resolution .
We 're not asking for much , just 480 x 272 pixels .
It would be placed on top of a black anodized aluminum surface , micro-perforated so you can listen to the speakers and use the microphone .
The light sensor would also be hidden here .
On the bottom , the black polycarbonate and a new bigger touchscreen will be covered by a single pane of mineral glass to avoid scratching , make it easier to clean and , especially , increase the display visibility .

That 's it , our dreamed - up , drool - worthy , perfectly doable , next - generation Nintendo DS .

CAIRO - Former President Carter told a university audience here yesterday that the treatment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli military was " a crime , " while adding that there are " officials in Israel quite willing to meet with Hamas " and that might happen " in the near future . "
Carter spoke to students and faculty at the American University in Cairo after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a separate three - hour meeting with Hamas officials .
The Bush administration and Israel have set rules not to talk to the militant Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip , but Carter said , " I consider myself immune " from such restrictions .
He added that he was n't acting as a negotiator or mediator but hoped that he " might set an example to be emulated " by others .
The former president 's meetings with Hamas in recent days have outraged Israelis , but Carter was undeterred , even suggesting that his recent book , " Palestine : Peace not Apartheid , " was aptly named because apartheid " is the exact description of what 's happening in Palestine now . "
He played to a mostly appreciative audience , except for one American student who suggested that Carter was giving legitimacy to terrorists by meeting with Hamas .
Carter said he told Hamas officials that " the worst thing " they 're doing to their cause is firing rockets into Israel , which he called " abominable and an act of terrorism . "
Carter did his own mathematics of bloodshed .
He said that for every Israeli killed in the conflict , 30 to 40 Palestinians die because of Israel 's superior military and " pinpoint accuracy . "
Carter then slipped back into diplomatic mode : " I 'm not blaming one [ side ] or the other .
. . .
Any side that kills innocent people is guilty of terrorism . "
Carter said that Hamas officials told him that they would allow a referendum on the fate of Palestinians if Mahmoud Abbas , the leader of the rival Palestinian Authority , and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached an agreement .
Carter added that Israelis must be assured that Hamas would stop rocket attacks and suicide bombers .
It was almost 30 years ago that Carter , Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin made peace at Camp David .
Carter drew applause when , with a jab to the Bush administration , he mentioned that he did not wait until his final days in office to try to find a way to peace .

Faith - based science : a detail worth noting
by Jeremy Hooper
Longtime ' mo foe Robert Knight is lashing out against ABC News for a recent report that they ran on the " nature vs. nurture " gay debate .
His major point of contention ?
Well , he feels that the Alphabet net gave more credence to the side of science , while making sure to indicate when someone on the " nurture " side of things was operating with a faith - based mindset .
Knight says the following :
The report is framed around a boy named Zack , who , along with his parents , believes he was " born gay . "
The lone dissenter , Dr. Stanton Jones , is introduced as " a clinical psychologist and evangelical Christian . "
No one else 's religious beliefs are mentioned .
The message : Pay no attention to this man .
His views are religious , not scientific .
But here 's the thing : Stanton Jones is provost and professor of psychology at Wheaton College , a Christian school .
He has also written or co-written such books as Homosexuality : The Use of Scientific Research in the Church 's Moral Debate and the faith - based book The Gay Debate , as well as served as the editor of publications like Psychology and Christianity : Four Views .
So it 's not like he is a researcher who just so happens to be a Christian .
He is someone whose religious views clearly influence his positions on matters of science .
We 're not judging Mr. Jones for whatever hierarchy informs his analytical views .
He has every right to form his own opinions , and every right to take to the airwaves to disseminate the same .
But it 's completely disingenuous for someone like Robert Knight to paint ABC News as being unethical because they felt a responsibility to inform viewers of Mr. Jones ' faith connection .
Because if we 're being really honest here , we 'll all admit that it 's almost impossible to find an atheist who believes that gays " choose " and can " change " their lifestyles .
The staunch supporters of the " nurture " mindset are virtually all also of the Lord 's Prayer - reciting mindset .
And so anyone who reports on this subject has a journalistic duty to be honest about the theological underpinnings at play .
You believe God did n't make any gay people ?
Fair enough .
But you and your team need to also be fair enough to acknowledge that when you refer to the man upstairs who has guided your views , you 're not talking about the aged biology professor who works on the ninth floor !
ABC Follows ‘ Born Gay ’ Script to a T [ CMI ]
Your thoughts
That is what I love about the Christian homophobes .
Peer reviewed science means nothing to them .
But their faith which is not peer reviewed stands above all .

These people ALWAYS want an " ex - gay " presence when something positive is said about gay people on TV or whatever , but do you think a church or one of these " ex - gay " organizations would allow a stable ( one thing no known " ex - gay " IS ) openly gay person to counter the ridiculous " testimony " of an " ex- gay " ?
Posted by : Scott | Apr 1 , 2008 4:37:14 PM
I would have liked to ask Mr. Knight if he thought Dr. Jones should have tried to hide his Christianity .
if Dr. Jones is proud of his religion , he should have delighted in it being mentioned .
If his research is good , it would only serve to impress those watching the show .
If his research is misinformed and leans to propaganda , he may have reason to want to hide his faith .

Show me an " ex - gay " who changed without the influence of a faith that says homosexuality is sin - then I might be able to get fully behind the notion .
Posted by : Alonzo | Apr 1 , 2008 5:59:02 PM
" Pay no attention to this man .
His views are religious , not scientific . "
Sounds about right to me .

“ Robert Knight : " And of course , " continued Sawyer , " what about the people who still believe that homosexuality is a choice ? ”
Wink , wink .
These are the same folks who still believe in a flat earth . ”
--
Well are n’t they ?
Oh wait a minute , I was thinking about the folks who still believe that dinosaurs and humans coexisted some few thousand years ago .
My mistake .

Robert Knight : “ Dr. Stanton Jones , is introduced as “ a clinical psychologist and evangelical Christian . ”
No one else ’s religious beliefs are mentioned .
The message : Pay no attention to this man .

Oh Knighty Knight Knight , besides the “ here ’s a strand of DNA and I do n’t see a gay gene therefore gays choose it ” scientific legitimacy that you seek , it ’s really MUCH worse than that .
Homosexuality : The Use of Scientific Research in the Church ’s Moral Debate , Stanton L. Jones & Mark A. Yarhouse , Page 181 : “ Even if the homosexual condition of desiring intimacy and sexual union with a person of the same gender is cause in its entirety by causal factors outside of the personal control of the person , that does not constitute moral affirmation of acting on those desires .
If it did , the pedophile who desires sex with children , the alcoholic who desires the pursuit of drunkenness , and the person with Antisocial Personality Disorder who desires the thrill of victimization and pain infliction would all have an equal case for moral approval of their exploits . ”
--
Thus , Jones , * with * Yarhouse , are on record as defining the homosexual desire for intimacy ( SSA ) , as being the moral equivalent of the desire to victimize and inflict pain .
No. Difference .
What .
So. Ever .
If the worst Knight and his anti-gay ilk are associated with is the belief in a flat earth , then they should overwhelmed with gratitude .

Stanton Jones is , along with Mark Yarhouse , the author of Ex - Gay ?
A Longitudinal Study of Religiously Mediated Change in Sexual Orientation .
The Jones and Yarhouse study ( as it 's known ) purported to track 98 ex-gays over a number of years and reported : 33 people reported change in the desired manner .
Except that if you read the book rather than just the advance spin , you find that " reported change " simply meant that they stopped calling themself gay and started calling themself " well I 'm not gay ... just maybe bisexual , yeah bisexual " .
When the same group were asked if their orientation was homosexual there was ZERO net " change in the desired manner " .
These study participants agreed to call themself something else but were honest enough to tell Jones and Yarhouse that their sexual attractions had not changed .
Pitty Jones did n't tell that in the spin sent out to the Christian press .
Then Jones and Yarhouse comingled the results of a prospective sample ( measure at the beginning and go forward ) with a retropective sample ( ask people what they recall from three years ago ) .
They claimed that there was statistical proof of change .
But when you untangled the two , you find that the prospective sample showed that ex-gay efforts resulted in no statistically measurable change in sexual attraction over the three year time period .
And then J&Y reported that 15 % of their sample obtained heterosexuality .
Unfortunately that heterosexuality included same - sex erotic dreams , wandering eyes , and constant effort to stay straight .
And one of their few " heterosexuals " wrote them to tell them that he had just been telling them what they wanted to hear .
After all of that , it takes some real faith to convince yourself that ex-gay ministries work .
If Jones has that kind of faith , it is relevant to the story .

The article says : " He is someone whose religious views clearly influence his positions on matters of science . "
Because people 's views clearly influence their positions in matters of science , we should generally disregard the positions other people take on matters of science and simply regard the science itself .
We are all free to take on board the pure unadulterated science , and then come to our own positions regarding it , and that is really our duty as free thinkers , rather than taking on someone else 's position which has only been influenced by that person 's views .
Posted by : Glenn Shrom | May 25 , 2008 7:00:46 PM
Timothy Kincaid posted , " These study participants agreed to call themself something else but were honest enough to tell Jones and Yarhouse that their sexual attractions had not changed . "
There were six different measures of homosexuality in the study .
If there was no change on the attraction scale , and the persons no longer considered themselves gay , then that is because they saw changes on some of the other scales .

I could n't help but notice the title here : " Good As You . "
Of course that is the same thing as saying " Bad As You . "
The book God 's Grace and the Homosexual Next Door does a good job of pointing out the Christian position that no sin is worse or better than any other in God 's eyes , and measured on our goodness alone , we are all destined for hell - every gay and every straight .
I really recommend the book if you want support for the " Good As You " slogan coming from Christian authors .

Glenn :
Most folks on this website have more than a passing knowledge of Alan Chambers and the " ex - gay " movement in general .
We get what 's going on with that whole endeavor .
Your comments are more of the same from that side .
It 's fine if you embrace their teachings ; but do n't expect that your words are going to sway too many .

“ When Sharon called me , she was crying , ” Suzie told me .
Her daughter said the court wanted testimony from an Orthodox rabbi who had known Suzie all her life .
“ Even if there was such a thing , he would be dead by now , ” Suzie said .
Lacking an official document labeling her a Jew and without a childhood connection to Orthodoxy , Suzie was again a typical American Jew .
Nonetheless , she got on the phone .
Her cousin in Florida told her to phone a colleague from Israel ’s small movement for Conservative Judaism .
He , in turn , said Seth Farber would help her .
He was right .
Image Credit ... Elisabeth Moch
Since genealogy is basic to this story , I will point out that Seth Farber ’s great - great - great - grandfather was the pre-eminent Central European rabbi Moshe Schreiber , father of ultra-Orthodoxy .
My guess is that Rabbi Schreiber would be confused by Farber ’s approach to religion .
Better known as the Hatam Sofer , or Seal of the Scribe , the name of his work of religious scholarship , he bitterly opposed fitting Judaism to modernity and was known for his principle , “ Anything new is forbidden by the Torah . ”
An iconic portrait shows him with a long gray beard and a fur hat .
Farber , 41 , has a round , clean - shaven face and frameless glasses that make him look like an earnest grad student .
He grew up in Riverdale , N.Y. , attending the kind of Orthodox parochial school that , he told me , “ celebrated Americanism , ” that turned the American bicentennial into the focus of an entire school year .
In college , he maintained that balance of Orthodoxy and integration by cycling the length of Manhattan twice daily : mornings studying Talmud at Yeshiva University on 185th Street , afternoons at New York University for philosophy .
He could have done his secular studies as well at the Orthodox university , he said , but he wanted “ to understand the broad world , to meet non-Jews , to be exposed to broad ideas ”  in short , to span the moat between traditional Judaism and modernity that his ancestor devoted his life to digging .
Farber was ordained as a rabbi at Yeshiva University , and in the mid-90s he moved to Israel .
He completed a doctorate at Hebrew University in American Jewish history and started his own synagogue .
It was the kind of place that ran a Passover charity drive , collecting the leavened food that religious Jews would normally throw away before the holiday and donating it to a welfare society in the Palestinian town of Bethlehem .
He also got permission from the state rabbinate to perform weddings .
His organization , Itim , was born of a hike that he and his wife , Michelle , took in a barren gorge through the Judean desert .
When they arrived at the gorge , they found they would need ropes to descend the cliffs into the freezing pools along the bottom , and another couple offered to share equipment .
Along the way , their hiking companions said they were n’t married because “ they could n’t find a rabbi they could relate to . ”
Most secular Israelis imagine a rabbi looking more like the Hatam Sofer than the hiker in soaked shorts who offered to perform the ceremony .
At the wedding , as nearly the only Orthodox Jew among 600 people , Farber said he began to understand how “ disenfranchised ” many Jews in Israel feel when dealing with state - run religion .
He decided to “ create a place where the representatives of Judaism ” are n’t government clerks .
Itim distributes booklets that explain to Israelis how to arrange a circumcision , marriage or funeral .
It helps secular couples find rabbis sensitive to their desires for their ceremonies .
For the last five years , it has run a hot line for Israelis who face trouble in the rabbinic bureaucracy .
Early on , Farber began receiving calls from people unable to prove they were Jews .
Many were immigrants from the former Soviet Union , but some were Americans .
Even a letter from an Orthodox rabbi did n’t always help .
The state rabbinate no longer trusts all Orthodox rabbis .
Trust  or lack of it  is the crux .
Zvi Zohar of Bar - Ilan University explained to me that historically , if someone said he was a Jew , “ if he lived among us , was a partner in our society and said he was one of us , we assumed he was right . ”
Trust was the default position .
One reason was that Jews were a persecuted people ; no one would claim to belong unless she really did .
The leading ultra-Orthodox rabbi in Israel in the years before and after the state was established , Avraham Yeshayahu Karlitz ( known as the Hazon Ish , the name of his magnum opus on religious law ) , held the classical position .
If someone arrived from another country claiming to be Jewish , he should be allowed to marry another Jew , “ even if nothing is known of his family , ” Karlitz wrote .
On 9/18/01 , the anthrax attacks started .
The lethal anthrax spores -- which were sent along with notes purportedly written by Islamic terrorists -- used a weaponized anthrax strain from the top U.S. bioweapons facility , the Fort Detrick military base .
Indeed , top bioweapons experts have stated that the anthrax attack may have been a CIA test " gone wrong " ; and see this article by a former NSA and naval intelligence officer
" Coincidentally " , White House staff began taking the anti-anthrax medicine before the Anthrax attacks occurred .
Moreover , the only congress people mailed anthrax - containing letters were key Democrats , and the attacks occurred one week before passage of the freedom - curtailing Patriot Act , which seems to have scared them and the rest of congress into passing that act without even reading it ( this is not a partisan issue , since this author believes that party affiliation is not a reliable indicator of loyalty to the Constitution ; rather , the senators targeted just happened to pose a threat in 2001 to passage of the Patriot Act ) .
While 9/11 was mainly aimed at the American people , the anthrax attacks were apparently aimed at Congress .
Specifically , the bioterror scare appears to have been launched in order to instill sufficient fear and disruption among the few remaining legislators who still honor the Constitution that they would be willing to let the Patriot Act be passed without real analysis or debate .
Think this is all far - fetched to be true ?
Well , the bioweapons expert who actually drafted the current bioweapons law ( the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 ) has said that he is convinced the October 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people were perpetrated and covered up by criminal elements of the U.S. government .
The motive : to foment a police state by killing off and intimidating opposition to post - 9/11 legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the later Military Commissions Act
Indeed , " The FBI has completely shut Congress out of its now five - year investigation into anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill and around the nation " .
In other words , Congress -- which legally has every right to know what really happened , and which was the main victim of the attack -- is being kept in the dark .
( While many in Congress may be complicit in alot of dastardly deeds , you do n't want the victims of a false flag attack to know who really attacked them ) .
And the authorities have mysteriously failed to investigate the main suspect in the anthrax attacks , yet another indication that the attacks were a false flag misdirection .
Without 9/11 , the American public would not have given in to the Bush administration 's imperial agenda .
Without the anthrax attack , Congress would not have let the Constitution be demolished so quickly .
A few legislators would probably have successfully stood against the Patriot Act , or at least demanded that that law be read and analyzed before it was adopted .
While not nearly as many people were killed by the Anthrax attack as by 9/11 , the anthrax attack was also an important false flag operation - one aimed directly at Congress .
As expected , Google is making some layoffs as it fully assimilates its recently acquired DoubleClick into its organization , according to The New York Times .
With a global staff of 1,500 ( 1,200 of which reside in the US ) , DoubleClick had a sizable employee base to begin with .
Finding places for all of these people to go is a difficult undertaking for Google , especially as its own employee numbers have grown rapidly in the past year .
Given the cooling down of its stock prices and apparent fear of shareholders , bloating a company 's staff is something that Google will have to avoid at all costs .
After mergers , especially one of this size , it 's typical to see layoffs .
but the loss of 300 or so employees from a total of 1,500 is the largest cut Google has ever had to make .
And just to sprinkle a bit more drama onto the layoff situation , Google has also begun its plans to sell off DoubleClick subsidiary Performics .
Something had to be done .
The search engine marketing layer of DoubleClick is a direct conflict of interest for Google 's search and advertising services .
So who knows what will happen to the employees of Performics , too ?
There have been no buyers named for the Performics sale just yet , but it 's clear that Google is anxious to get things squared away with DoubleClick and all that it entails , as soon as possible .
If I 'd been fighting all this time for an acquisition while rivals snatch up all other alternatives in the meantime , I 'd be anxious to get things squared away , too .
BIRD -WATCHING is high on the list of Hank Paulson 's leisure pursuits .
This week America 's Treasury Secretary made it quite clear which avian creature his country 's system of financial regulation most resembled : the albatross .
His “ blueprint ” for change , presented on March 31st , is the boldest attempt to overhaul the rulebook since the Depression , when much of it was written .
Most of the proposals are long - term , and will thus be pulled around by the next administration and Congress .
But the plan marks an important first step in a much - needed facelift for an outdated regime .
“ He 's teed it up in a way that can't be ignored , ” says James Lockhart , director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , which regulates America 's quasi- official mortgage giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Though the proposals are entwined with the credit crisis , they predate it : the original impetus , a year ago , was fear over America 's waning capital - markets competitiveness .
The finished product is thus an odd mix of streamlining and tougher regulation , such as a new oversight body for mortgage markets .
The timing struck some as odd too , but the Treasury says it wants to provoke debate , not distract from market woes .
The report may also have been timed to head off what one official calls “ very silly ” new banking rules threatening to emanate from Congress .
Political pressure had been growing to revamp regulation , after bank supervisors were deemed to have been asleep at the switch as the credit bubble inflated .
Mr Paulson 's motivation was broader : he has long argued , correctly , that the present set - up is Balkanised and inefficient .
None of the half - dozen federal regulators , which sit atop hundreds of state rulemakers , sees the whole map .
Supervision has not always been divided up for the best reasons : the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , for instance , won oversight of big investment banks four years ago , not because it was best placed to do so , but as part of a compromise following legal changes in Europe .
The Treasury plan envisages several phases of reform .
Short - term goals include the expansion of the President 's Working Group ( PWG ) , now a club for only select large regulators , and the creation of a federal Mortgage Origination Commission .
This would consolidate oversight of a process that has wreaked havoc on balance sheets .
It is also seen as a partial solution to the problem of dodgy securitisation , as the commission would grade the underwriting of loans going into pools .
Critics point out , however , that it would create another layer of bureaucracy , since regulation of mortgage brokers and many lenders would stay with the states .
In the long run , say between two to eight years , Mr Paulson hopes to see a new regulatory architecture , with today 's hotch - potch folded into three “ objectives - based ” agencies that some see as similar to the Australian system .
That means a remodelled Federal Reserve with an eye on overall market stability ; a prudential regulator for banks and thrifts , which would mean the demise of the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) ; and a business - conduct agency , taking in much of the SEC 's oversight of disclosure and the like .
The eagle - eyed Fed ( and its blind spot )
The first of these is the most important — and most controversial .
Though the Fed would lose long - cherished supervisory authority over big banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase , its overall power would be greatly expanded .
The role , which the Fed rehearsed with its rescue of Bear Stearns , would allow it to hunt anywhere for systemic risk , including among the entangled roots of hedge funds and investment banks .
Some at the Fed worry this may be a poisoned chalice .
Spotting crises in advance is not easy — witness the central bank 's own failure to ring alarm bells as house prices soared .
One pundit , inspired by scandals in New York politics , likens its proposed role to “ putting Eliot Spitzer in charge of a morals division ” .
Now that the Fed has extended emergency funding to investment banks , they can expect tougher regulation .
But the Treasury plan stops short of proposing that this arrangement be made permanent .
As for the new regulation , it calls for further consideration by the PWG , which is taking a lead in a host of other areas , including reform of credit ratings and the derivatives - trading infrastructure .
Nor does the plan deal with regulation of Fannie and Freddie , where vast portfolios of mortgage - backed securities have soured , leaving them short of capital .
However , Mr Paulson can reasonably argue that this crucial issue is already close to resolution .
A bill to strengthen oversight of the two unwieldy enterprises has passed through the House and should soon be heard in the Senate .
You may think a plan this sweeping would be welcomed at a time when the old order had been found so wanting .
But , this being an election year , and regulation being as emotive as it is arcane in America , it is being attacked from all sides .
No wonder Mr Paulson talks of an “ almighty battle ” ahead .
Some on the right think it is not radical enough .
The Treasury resisted the temptation to propose a single super - regulator along the lines of Britain 's Financial Services Authority , leaving itself open to criticism that turf wars will persist .
Admirers of the FSA 's broad , principles - based approach to regulation contrast it with the lawyer - stuffed SEC , which values strongly enforced rules over guidelines .
But the Northern Rock fiasco has tarnished the British agency 's image .
Moreover , regulatory competition is not always bad , says Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University .
The Fed has been coaxed forward by more proactive agencies many times over the years , for instance .
Those on the left , meanwhile , attack the plan on two fronts .
They complain that it does little to alleviate the crisis — even though that was not the intention — or to tighten the rules .
Christopher Dodd , head of the Senate 's banking committee , dismissed the reforms as “ a wild pitch ... not even close to the strike zone . ”
Others gripe that it is too kind to Wall Street : Mr Paulson , a former head of Goldman Sachs , included its biggest firms in the crafting of the plan .
Not so , say the investment banks , which could well face higher capital requirements to redress their follies .
Super - regulated out of existence
Then there are the regulators and constituencies who fear losing out .
The plan to merge the OTS out of existence prompted its head , John Reich , to write to employees declaring his opposition — though Christopher Cox , head of the SEC , which faces the same fate , has reacted more equivocally .
State insurance regulators , which would be scrapped in favour of a federal regulator within the Treasury , are hopping mad .
Small financial firms , such as credit unions and community banks , are none too pleased either , fearing that their voices will be drowned out under the new prudential regulator .
Associations such as the Independent Community Bankers of America pack plenty of lobbying clout and could cause mischief .
One form of attack will be to point out that we have been here before : a number of the reforms , including both the federal - insurance charter and the dissolution of the OTS , have been discussed and rejected over the years .
Reducing the power of the states could also prove incendiary .
During the last boom , state regulators alerted the Fed to shenanigans in the subprime - mortgage market but were rebuffed .
Pro-regulation critics say Mr Paulson is cheekily trying to push through a largely deregulating package in disguise .
He rejects such “ simplistic bumper stickers ” .
The problem is not too much or too little regulation , he says , but the clumsiness of the system 's design , which means rules are not applied effectively .
With industry regulators obsessed with patrolling their own turf , for instance , important bits of the market have been missed at the edges .
Think of mortgage brokers .
Still , the political mood increasingly favours more regulation , and many expect the reforms to be tugged in that direction .
Hal Scott of Harvard Law School , director of an independent commission on capital - markets regulation , fears a repeat of Sarbanes - Oxley , the corporate - governance act rushed through in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom collapses , amid a similar “ something must be done ” atmosphere .
Parts of that law put an intolerable burden on auditors and managers .
They have since been pared back .
Frank Partnoy of the University of San Diego notes that Washington has a tendency to produce rules in fits and starts , especially after crises , and that these “ often grow into monsters ” .
This is not a purely American thing , to be sure .
The governments of Britain , Germany and others hard hit by the credit crisis are pushing for an urgent overhaul of banking regulations .
However , the Financial Stability Forum , a group of global regulators which is due to issue a report to the G7 finance ministers on April 11th , is mindful that regulating too zealously does more harm than good .
Indeed , no regulatory regime is perfect .
However sensible the rules , the market is always a step ahead of those who police it .
As Mr Paulson concedes , better regulation is no guarantee against blow - ups “ every five or ten years ” .
At which point , there will be a new clamour for change .
VATICAN CITY ( AP ) --
Italy 's most prominent Muslim , an iconoclastic writer who condemned Islamic extremism and defended Israel , converted to Catholicism Saturday in a baptism by the pope at a Vatican Easter service .
An Egyptian - born , non-practicing Muslim who is married to a Catholic , Magdi Allam infuriated some Muslims with his books and columns in the newspaper Corriere della Sera newspaper , where he is a deputy editor .
He titled one book " Long Live Israel . "
As a choir sang , Pope Benedict XVI poured holy water over Allam 's head and said a brief prayer in Latin .
" We no longer stand alongside or in opposition to one another , " Benedict said in a homily reflecting on the meaning of baptism .
" Thus faith is a force for peace and reconciliation in the world : distances between people are overcome , in the Lord we have become close . "
Mr Blair warned against being ' forced into retreat '
Mr Blair told a charity event in New York that Iran was prepared to destabilise peaceful countries .
In his first major speech since leaving office , Mr Blair again defended the decision to go to war in Iraq .
He urged continued vigilance by the United States , Britain and their allies in combating the threat of extremism .
Mr Blair - now an envoy for the Middle East Quartet - warned against being " forced into retreat " as the world faced a situation similar to " rising fascism in the 1920s " .
Shared values
The former PM is still regarded as a staunch ally of the US .
He was greeted with a standing ovation even before he spoke .
The audience , New York 's political and Catholic elite , laughed when he joked that Americans were slowly mastering the English language .
But on a more serious note he spoke of what he called an extremist Islamic ideology .
" This ideology now has a state - Iran - that is prepared to back and finance terror in the pursuit of destabilising countries whose people wish to live in peace . "
" There is a tendency even now , even in some of our own circles , to believe that they are as they are because we have provoked them and if we left them alone they would leave us alone .
" I fear this is mistaken .
They have no intention of leaving us alone . "
Mr Blair stressed the shared values that he believes unite Britain and the US .
" America and Europe should not be divided , we should stand up together .
" The values we share are as vital and true and , above all , needed today as they have been at any time in the last 100 years . "
The charity dinner was held in honour of Al Smith , the former governor of New York who was the first Catholic to be nominated by a major political party to run for US president .
The annual event has gained a reputation as a major social gathering in election years , when organisers traditionally invite the presidential candidates to speak .
However New York 's two presidential candidates , Senator Hillary Clinton and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , did not attend .
SAN FRANCISCO / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc would consider a business alliance with Google Inc as one way to rebuff a $ 44.6 billion takeover proposal by Microsoft , a source familiar with Yahoo ’s strategy said on Sunday .
A Google search page is seen through the spectacles of a computer user in Leicester , central England July 20 , 2007 .
Google Inc fired back on Sunday at Microsoft Corp 's $ 44.6 billion bid to acquire Yahoo Inc , accusing Microsoft of seeking to extend its computer software monopoly deeper into the Internet realm .
REUTERS / Darren Staples
Yahoo management is considering revisiting talks it held with Google several months ago on an alliance as an alternative to Microsoft ’s bid , that source said .
At $ 31 a share , Yahoo believes the bid undervalues the company , two sources said .
A second source close to Yahoo said it had received a procession of preliminary contacts by media , technology , telephone and financial companies .
But the source said they were unaware whether any alternative bid was in the offing .
In a memo to Yahoo employees on Friday , which was obtained by Reuters on Sunday , Yahoo leaders wrote : “ We want to emphasize that absolutely no decisions have been made -- and , despite what some people have tried to suggest , there ’s certainly no integration process underway . ”
Few natural bidders exist besides
Google that could engage in a bidding war , and Google would be unlikely to win approval from antitrust regulators , some Wall Street analysts said on Friday .
The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday that Google ’s chief executive Eric Schmidt called Yahoo ’s chief executive Jerry Yang to offer his company ’s help in any effort to thwart Microsoft ’s bid .
Spokesmen for Yahoo and Google declined comment .
Google was not immediately available for comment on the WSJ story .
Yahoo ’s efforts to find an alternative bidder could simply be a measure to pressure Microsoft to boost its bid , which valued Yahoo at $ 44.6 billion when first announced on Friday .
Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a research note that “ the Microsoft bid of $ 31 is very astute ” because it puts pressure on Yahoo management to take actions that could unlock the underlying value of Yahoo assets , which he estimates are worth upward of $ 39 - $ 45 a share .
The bid gave a boost to markets in Asia when they opened on Monday .
Shares in Softbank Corp soared as much as 16 percent and Yahoo Japan was untraded due to a flood of buy orders on Monday , on hopes a potential deal between Microsoft and Yahoo would boost the Japanese firms ’ competitiveness .
Softbank holds a 3.9 percent stake in Yahoo Inc in terms of voting rights .
The benchmark Nikkei average ended the morning up 2.4 percent while indexes in Shanghai , Hong Kong , South Korea , Taiwan and Singapore also gained .
COMPETITION CONCERNS
Separately , Google fired back on Sunday at Microsoft Corp ’s bid to acquire Yahoo , accusing Microsoft of seeking to extend its computer software monopoly deeper into the Internet realm .
David Drummond , a Google chief legal officer , said in a blog post that the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo could undermine competition on the Web and called on policy makers to challenge the combination .
Microsoft responded to Google ’s arguments by saying that a merger with Yahoo would create a “ compelling number two competitor for Internet search and online advertising ” to market leader Google .
“ The alternative scenarios only lead to less competition on the Internet , ” Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement .
Drummond argued that Microsoft ’s power stems from decades - old monopolies in Windows -- the software operating system used to control most personal computers -- and Internet Explorer , which is the dominant browser consumers used to view the Web .
Microsoft ’s proposed merger with Yahoo would combine the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers of Web - based e-mail , instant messaging ( IM ) and portals , which act as starting points for hundreds of millions of users seeking information on the Web .
" Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors ' email , IM , and Web - based services ? "
Drummond said in a blog at googleblog.blogspot.com /.
In making its case for the deal during a conference call on Friday , Microsoft executives said Google -- not Microsoft -- was the one company antitrust regulators were likely to bar from buying Yahoo , based on Google ’s dominance in Web search .
Microsoft executives cited industry data showing Google has a 75 percent share of worldwide Web search revenue .
Collectively , Yahoo and Microsoft attract around 20 percent of Web searches , Internet measurement firms show .
“ Today , Google is the dominant search engine and advertising company on the Web , ” Smith said in replying to Google on Sunday .
“ Google has amassed about 75 percent of paid search revenues worldwide and its share continues to grow . ”
A person familiar with Google ’s thinking said the company believes Microsoft is using the same playbook it did in the 1990s to switch Windows users away from Web browser pioneer Netscape Communications to its own Internet Explorer .
“ It is the same old story , ” the source said .
The way Hillary Clinton pictures herself on the campaign trail , expect a schedule loaded with meetings with the leaders of this world , while being fired upon by snipers .
35 years of experience crammed into 96 months in the White House , make for a very busy , tiring schedule !
I expect this : 3 a.m .
Phone conference with Ian Paisley , re : Nothern Ireland Peace 1 p.m. Lunch with CEO ’s of Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb on lowering prices .
6 p.m. Departure for Kosovo .
Bring bullet proof vests – sniper fire expected I get this , or like John Broder says :
[ The documents ] “ offer no support for her claims that she helped negotiate the Irish peace accords or facilitated the flow of refugees in the Balkans .
There is no evidence to back up her claim that she helped pass the Family and Medical Leave Act , the first legislation Mr. Clinton signed as president in February 1993 .
The legislation , sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , sailed through Congress and landed on Mr. Clinton ’s desk 10 days after he was inaugurated .
Phone logs and tax papers next , please !
UPDATE : Newsweek says :
The schedule is considerably less revealing when it comes to more awkward episodes of the Clinton presidency .
Consider the afternoon of March 9 , 1995 , when Johnny Chung , a businessman and soon - to - be- notorious Democratic Party fund - raiser , made a fateful trip to the White House carrying a campaign check for $ 50,000 .
For many critics , Chung later became a symbol of the campaign - finance abuses of the Clinton presidency , a mysterious Chinese businessman who managed to be cleared into the White House on 49 occasions .
( He also later pleaded guilty to campaign - finance violations and testified that a sizeable chunk of his illegal campaign cash came from a Chinese military - intelligence operative . )
Hillary Clinton made a special trip to the Map Room that day so she could have her picture taken with Chung [ … ]
But Hillary Clinton ’s newly released calendar for that day shows no reference to Johnny Chung
The Clinton ’s are doing a fine job , cheneying up their records , it seems .
9/11 : Bill Maher Debates Willie Nelson .
Hosted by Mr. Larry King .
The debate was intense last night ; Bill Maher and Willie Nelson met yesterday evening at a neutral site here in Chicago .
The debate was held on the 47th floor of the Sears Tower that was purchased by Mr. Larry Silverstein ’s group ( which had leased the WTC complex just prior to 9/11 ) .
The following is the transcript from the debate :
The topic of tonight ’s debate is , “ What did indeed cause the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings in New York City on September the Eleventh , 2001 ; better known as simply , 9/11 .
immediately
did n’t
Anyway , it looked like a runaway volcano the way the clouds of dust were running between those buildings .
I ai n’t seen anything like it !
At least since I saw those collapses in Las Vegas .
And a little later that other Tower came down in what I would swear was EXACTLY the same way .
Amazing when you think that the one was n’t even hit in the center .
Then later on , I saw that third building , WTC7 , come down in the most symmetrically picturesque fashion .
Again , it looked liked like those buildings in Las Vegas they brought down on purpose .
And Larry , it came down perfectly straight .
I mean PERFECTLY straight down .
I ’ve never seen anything so perfect .
Larry , it was like the steel was crying “ uncle . ”
It was like the steel completly forgot what it was supposed to do .
And it came down faster than a buzzard can blink an eye .
So I knew that they planned those three collapses .
There ’s no other logical explanation .
LK : Bill , your response .
BM : See , I told you Larry :
There really was no reason to have this debate .
Larry , with all due respect to Willie , they did n’t call ‘em “ Twin Towers ” for nothin ’
There were only TWO buildings , Larry !
They were n’t called the “ Triple Towers ! ” I do n’t know what Willie was ...... well ...... it was probably a just a Marlboro
LK : Well Bill , maybe you should have studied up a bit more ; there really were three buildings , Bill .
And all three collapsed .
BM : Really ?
I do n’t remember seeing a third airplane .
LK : Bill , that ’s because there were n’t three airplanes .

When a smaller nation takes its turn on the UN security council it's a chance to strut its stuff on the world stage , to be where the action is .
Ambassadors from developing countries will be courted and flattered by the big boys from Washington , Paris , Moscow , London and Beijing , their opinions sought , their every need the subject of sudden sympathetic interest .
But in times of heightened global tension , this courtship can segue into bribery , and flattery can swiftly turn into something more loaded .
" What 's the going rate for a vote on the security council these days ? "
Trevor McDonald goaded Tony Blair in an interview five years ago in the Map Room of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office before an audience of women opposed to war , prompting a furious call from Alastair Campbell to the producer threatening to pull his man out unless the producer got his man under control .
Blair , whose diplomatic priority was then to wrest from a reluctant security council a resolution authorising the use of force in Iraq , gave McDonald the weary , pained look of the unfairly accused .
Had the prime minister only cast his mind back to 1990 he might have been able to come up with a figure .
Then it was Yemen 's turn on the security council and it was Yemen 's bad luck that the US and Britain were at that very moment looking for UN backing for the first Gulf war .
When it failed to support the necessary resolution punishment was swift : £ 12 m in annual aid was withdrawn .
US diplomats told Yemen 's ambassador he'd just cast the most expensive vote of his career .
We may be talking about an organisation with high and noble ideals , but UN diplomacy can be pretty rough stuff .
It was to get a lot rougher in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and the consequences were to be far - reaching and dramatic .
Five years ago this month , with American and British troops massing on Iraq 's borders , it was the turn of , among others , Mexico , Chile , Cameroon , Pakistan , Angola and Guinea to sit on the security council .
They were coming under intense pressure from the US and Britain to vote for a second resolution .
There were economic complications : the Chileans were waiting for a free - trade agreement with the US to be ratified ; Angola was hoping for an aid package to be approved .
As one ambassador said , " No one was explicitly saying the aid was linked to our support , but everything was happening at the same time . "
Over the past months I have worked with a team of BBC researchers to find out what really happened in those difficult days .
We scrutinised documents and interviewed those involved , and I wrote about what we found out in eight short films about the run-up to the invasion , to be shown next week .
Our film set in the UN describes the efforts to persuade those states unwilling to vote for the second resolution .
Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's ambassador to the UN , arranged for his Mexican counterpart , Adolfo Aguilar Zínser , to be briefed by MI6 on the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
Aguilar , who died in a car crash in 2005 , was an acutely intelligent , ambitious , articulate and sophisticated diplomat , and he was determined not to be steamrollered or bamboozled .
The briefing , he recalled with some bemusement , took place in a sealed room , amid conditions of elaborate security , all very James Bond .
Here British intelligence officers spread out maps of alleged WMD sites on the table .
The brains of politicians and diplomats - journalists too - have a tendency to turn to mush during briefings with secret agents .
Not Aguilar .
The former lawyer 's questioning was forensic and insistent : he asked the MI6 officers directly if they had " full proof " of evidence of WMD on these sites .
According to his account , the officers said , " No , we do n't .
We can't tell you this is a weapon here .
But we have reasons to believe there are weapons because we can document the way Saddam hides them . "
Aguilar then asked where the Iraqi leader was hiding the weapons .
The agents had suspicions but were n't able to say for certain .
As Aguilar noted , the rather more qualified private answers of the MI6 officers contrasted with Blair 's categorical public statements that there were WMD in Iraq .
The Mexican diplomat asked an obvious but pertinent question : what was the correlation between how well a weapon was hidden and the ease with which it could be used ?
The answer was that it was " a negative correlation " ; that is , the better a weapon was hidden , the more time it would take to prepare for use .
It was the British case that Hans Blix and the UN weapons inspectors could not find WMD because they were so well concealed .
But it was also the British case that the weapons could be prepared for use in 45 minutes .
The two positions , Aguilar was pointing out , could not be reconciled .
When Aguilar went into the sealed room , he did not know if Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
When he came out , he was even less sure .
He was not alone .
He cooperated closely with his friend from Chile , Ambassador Juan Gabriel Valdés , in trying to forge a counterweight to Britain and the US over the second resolution .
They took a legalistic position : in order for conditions to be met under UN charter , the threat must be evident before force can be authorised .
They argued there was a mechanism in place - the weapons inspectors - to determine the extent and reality of the threat .
Along with Cameroon , Angola , Pakistan and Guinea , Mexico and Chile became known as the " six undecideds " .
Aguilar maintained this was a misnomer : they were not undecided but very much opposed to war .
They argued that Blix and co be given the time they needed to finish their job .
Blix would either find the weapons and destroy them or confirm WMD did not exist , in which case there would be no evident threat and no legal basis for war .
It was not a position that suited the British and Americans , whose diplomacy was being driven by the military timetable , for as we now know Blair had signed up to war regardless of whether he got a second resolution .
Aware that they were facing an organised attempt to counter their influence on the security council , the Americans spoke to Aguilar 's foreign minister .
In the view of the US , Aguilar was " unhelpful " ; " an unguided missile " .
Early in March 2003 , Aguilar was recalled to Mexico for urgent talks with his president , Vicente Fox .
Somehow the ambassador managed to persuade
Fox to keep him in place , at least for now , and Aguilar returned to New York as the British made their final diplomatic push to get the resolution .
By then Aguilar and his colleagues from the undecideds were the target of an extensive bugging operation , which was exposed by Observer journalists who got hold of a memo advising senior NSA officials that the agency was " mounting a surge " aimed at gleaning information not only on how delegations on the security council would vote on any second resolution on Iraq , but also " policies " , " negotiating positions " , " alliances " and " dependencies " - the " whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises " .
It was an aggressive surveillance operation , involving interception of the home and office telephones and the emails of UN delegates in New York .
After one private meeting , almost certainly bugged , at which a tentative strategy based on giving Blix more time was mooted , ambassadors were told by the US that this was to go no further .
Greenstock was soon to have even graver cause for anxiety .
As the push for the second resolution reached its climax , he began to suspect there might actually be an attempt to table a counter resolution .
The impact would be devastating .
Blair had based his entire PR campaign on the importance of upholding the will of the international community .
It was bad enough that he could n't persuade that community to support war ; it would be calamitous if he were to face a counter resolution , even if it were eventually voted down or vetoed , forbidding Britain and America from using force .
A war , which was legally dubious , would then be explicitly illegitimate .
During his grilling in the Foreign Office 's Map Room on March 10 , the prime minister insisted time and again he was " working flat out " for a second resolution , and officials let it be known they were still confident of success .
He had every reason to work flat out .
Around 2 million people had marched through London the previous month to protest against invasion .
As Blair conceded , many people were uneasy about the legality of the war precisely because it did not yet have UN backing .
Within the Labour party there was also growing unease .
Backbenchers on the left like John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn would never be brought round to the case for war .
But signs of disaffection in normally loyal quarters were spreading .
Robin Cook , then leader of the House , was the most high profile opponent of the war ( he was to resign on March 17 ) , but there were others .
Anne Campbell , MP for Cambridge . was then parliamentary private secretary to her longtime friend Patricia Hewitt , secretary of state for trade and industry .
A Blairite loyalist , Campbell had never once voted against the government .
It was a harrowing time .
She believed in Blair , she believed in the project , she believed in the government - but she did not believe in the war , at least not without a second resolution .
As the day of the Commons vote on war neared , March 18 , she found herself in the desperate position of having to contemplate resignation .
Another loyalist tormented by the prospect of war was Paul Stinchcombe , MP for Wellingborough .
Stinchcombe had wanted to be an Labour MP all his life and had joined the party out of a belief in social justice and respect for human rights .
A committed Christian , he was now being asked to vote for a war in which there would be civilian casualties .
It revolted him .
Government whips arranged meetings with Blair and also with Cherie , in whose chambers Stinchcombe , a human rights barrister , had worked .
When we went to see him , Stinchcombe recalled long ethical and legal discussions with colleagues in parliament , and also the more emotionally fraught confrontations he had with his teenage daughter Yasmin , a convinced opponent of the war .
He eventually voted for , but the decision traumatised him .
In the 2005 general election both he and Campbell lost their seats .
A stone 's throw from the palace of Westminster , Elizabeth Wilmshurst was deputy legal adviser in the FCO , with almost 30 years ' service .
By March 10 , she was digesting the secret legal advice to the government from Lord Goldsmith .
The attorney general 's memo concluded that war would be legal without a second resolution , although he included the important caveat that he could not guarantee " that if the matter ever came before a court I would be confident that the court would agree with this view " ( on March 17 Goldsmith finessed his advice , removing this and other qualifications ) .
Wilmshurst did not agree with his conclusion .
In international law there are three justifications for the use of force .
First , self - defence .
In his advice , Goldsmith accepted the self - defence argument was not applicable .
Second , to avert an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe .
Again , he said that would not be an appropriate basis for action in Iraq .
Third , you can use force if the security council says you can use force .
And , of course , as of March 10 , the security council had still not said that the British and Americans could use force .
In New York four days later , on March 14 , Greenstock threw in the towel and declared there would be no vote on the second resolution .
Wilmshurst had to make a decision .
She is not the kind of person to make a fuss and she certainly did not want media attention .
After she made known her difficulty to her superiors she agreed to retire quietly .
The public did not find out about her decision to go until some weeks later .
In spite of all the pressure , the bugging , the inducements and the warnings , Aguilar and the undecideds stood firm .
There was no second resolution .
Britain and America invaded Iraq without UN support .
Aguilar did not last long in New York .
In November , the US called again on Fox to remove him .
This time the Mexican president capitulated .
In the British version , there was every chance of getting a second resolution had it not been for the perfidious French .
But as Aguilar said , it was convenient for the British to pretend the second resolution failed because of President Jacques Chirac and the threatened French veto .
It would have been far less palatable to acknowledge the truth : that Britain had four votes on the security council out of 15 ( the UK , US , Spain and Bulgaria ) .
There never was going to be a second resolution .

Melting Methane A Storehouse of Greenhouse Gases Is Opening in Siberia
Researchers have found alarming evidence that the frozen Arctic floor has started to thaw and release long - stored methane gas .
The results could be a catastrophic warming of the earth , since methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
But can the methane also be used as fuel ?

It was the best job opportunity Kirk had ever seen .
WANTED .
Smart programmers who enjoy working on WELL - FUNDED projects using STATE -OF - THE -ART technology to fill a HIGH - GROWTH position at an INDUSTRY LEADING travel company .
TOP - NOTCH PAY and comprehensive benefits including AIRLINE PERKS .
Sure , Kirk was skeptical .
But it was 1994 and technology was booming .
Personal Computers were becoming ubiquitous and the whole “ World Wide Web ” thing showed a lot of promise .
Who knows , maybe one day consumers might book travel from their very own computer .
He could help drive that !
Kirk promptly sent in his résumé and eagerly awaited a reply .
A few weeks later , Kirk was sitting in front of Haylee ’s desk , interviewing for the position .
After running through all of the standard questions and formalities , Haylee described what their company was planning on doing .
“ So have you heard of the ‘ World Wide Web ’ ? ” she asked rhetorically , air - quoting that last phrase , “ we ’re planning on establishing a ‘ presence ’ there and have a lot of ideas on how to revolutionize the industry . ”
Kirk quickly perked up .
Nothing was more high - tech than the World Wide Web .
“ And not only that , ” Haylee continued , “ but we ’ve got big budgets .
Biiiig budgets .
We ’re talking ‘ tens - of - millions of dollars ’ big . ”
In those pre-dot - com days , a multi-million dollar investment in such an infant technology was unheard of .
Before Kirk could even respond , Haylee added “ it may sound crazy , but we think the travel industry is about to be turned on its head , all thanks to technology .
And we ’ll be there when it happens . ”
Kirk offered an approving nod and tried his best to stifle his growing excitement at the opportunity .
“ We ’ve been around for years , ” Haylee said , “ and have real tight ties with the biggest industry players across the globe .
Trust me , we ’re going places ! ”
Kirk had heard enough .
He was convinced that this was , without a doubt , the best job opportunity he had ever seen .
And the fact that they offered stock options , an aggressive promotion track , and a progressive work environment with private offices for programmers made it seem almost too good to be true .
A couple months later , after accepting the job offer and getting his feet wet , Kirk realized that it was all true .
Well , sort of .
It was n’t quite what he had pictured .
The company did have large , international projects .
They did use cutting - edge technologies .
There was top - notch pay and they did even offer airline perks .
However , no one in Kirk ’s division had any of that .
Kirk did , however , work in a private , 10x10 ’ office ; he just had to share it with three other programmers .
As for a workstation , Kirk was given a 1970 ’s - era IBM - 3270 terminal ; it had a few fun quirks , namely that the keyboard would lock up solid whenever the terminal was waiting for a reply .
The day - to - day work primarily involved fixing bugs in their assembly - based mainframe programs ; but to be fair , they did do some pretty “ innovative ” things in assembly language .
Although Kirk was a bit disappointed , he realized that his expectations were simply too high .
Certainly they would n’t put the new guy in an important role in their large , international project .
He knew he ’d have to do a little grunt work first before he could play on the dream team .
At six months in , Kirk was content .
And then management made an important announcement .
Because of certain troubles with the “ biggest industry players ” that they had “ real tight ties with , ” management instituted a temporary Hiring Freeze .
Of course , that did n’t affect Kirk or anyone else he knew , as everyone seemed to have a pretty balanced workload .
He mostly ignored the announcement and got back to his grunt work .
A few months later , management made another important announcement .
Because of continuing troubles with the “ biggest industry players , ” management extended the temporary Hiring Freeze .
They also instituted a temporary Wage Freeze .
Of course , that did affect Kirk , as his one - year anniversary was right around the corner .
But since it was only temporary , he mostly ignored it and got back to his grunt work .
Several more months passed .
Management announced that , due to continuing troubles , they ’d need to extend the temporary freezes .
As more months passed , more temporary freeze extensions were needed .
And each time , it was the “ last extension . ”
Before Kirk even realized it , four long years had passed .
The travel industry did change and websites like Travelocity and Expedia were blossoming .
His company , not so much .
In fact , his position on the ladder had remained the same .
The next - most junior programmer had twelve years with the company and , after that , over twenty years .
Some still referred to him as “ the new guy . ”
He finally decided to look for another job .
Out went the résumé and in came the job offers .
It was the middle of the dot - com boom , and Kirk had no trouble finding jobs paying more than double what he ’d been making .
However , when he put in his two - weeks notice with his boss and then Haylee in HR , they were livid .
How could anyone desert the company at such a time ?
They were in dire straits and needed him !
They were in a Hiring Freeze , for crying out loud !
Despite their incessant pleading and their generous counter - offer of a 2 % raise , Kirk left for greener pastures and vowed to never look back .
As Kirk moved from job to job , and contract to contract , he watched the dot - com bubble grow , and grow , and burst .
He followed the blogging revolution , enjoyed the widespread adaptation of Wi-Fi , and witnessed the explosion of social networking .
And he was always eager to find new opportunities to learn more .
This past year , while seeking out such opportunities , a certain job ad caught his eye .
WANTED .
Smart programmers who enjoy working on WELL - FUNDED projects using STATE -OF - THE -ART technology to fill a HIGH - GROWTH position at an INDUSTRY LEADING travel company .
TOP - NOTCH PAY and comprehensive benefits including AIRLINE PERKS .
No , it could n’t be !
Could it ?
Kirk reluctantly sent in his résumé and wondered if he ’d ever get a reply .
A few weeks later , Kirk found himself sitting in front of the very same desk , interviewing with Haylee , the very same human resources person .
After skipping most of the standard questions and formalities , Haylee described what their company was now doing .
“ So have you heard of ‘ Web 2.0 ’ ? ” she asked rhetorically , air - quoting that the last phrase , “ we ’re planning on establishing a ‘ presence ’ there and have a lot of ideas on how to revolutionize the industry . ”
Kirk was intrigued .
He did , after all , have some solid experience in AJAX and other web tech .
“ And not only that , ” Haylee continued , “ but we ’ve got big budgets .
Biiiig budgets .
We ’re talking ‘ tens - of - millions of dollars ’ big . ”
A strange sense of déjà vu engulfed Kirk .
Before he could even respond , Haylee added “ it may sound crazy , but we think the travel industry is about to be turned on its head , all thanks to Web 2.0 .
And we ’ll be there when it happens . ”
Kirk glanced down at his watch to make sure it was n’t 1994 again .
“ We ’ve been around for years , ” Haylee said , “ and have real tight ties with the biggest industry players across the globe .
Trust me , we ’re going places ! ”
Kirk had heard enough .
A few minutes later , he stumbled out of the interview in a state of shock .
He half - expected some on to jump out and yell , “ you ’re on candid camera ! ”
On his way out , he ran in to a former coworker .
“ I hear you ’re thinking of coming back , ” the programmer with now twenty - years at the company said , “ you really should !
They lifted the Wage and Hiring Freeze , and we ’re all on PCs now !
Oh , and I heard that we might be using this ‘ Java ’ and ‘ SQL ’ stuff soon .
It ’s pretty cool ! ”
Kirk was now certain that , any second now , someone would jump out and yell “ surprise , we got ya ! ”
It never happened .
He told his former coworker that he ’d think about it and swore to himself that he ’d never , ever look back again .

[ Haskell - cafe ] Haskell vs Scheme
Douglas , Excellent questions you posed to Simon P - J -- who then forwarded them to the Haskell Cafe list .
By way of answering i should say i was a Schemer from the get - go ; it was really the first programming language i studied as an undergraduate majoring in maths at Oberlin in the early 80's .
Eventually , i went on to design and build my own language ( at MCC with Christine Tomlinson , the principal investigator ) called Rosette .
While Scheme was Sussman and Abelson 's way of making sense of Hewitt 's ideas in a sequential setting Rosette was our way of doing the full banana -- including the actor - based form of concurrency as well as both structural and 3 - Lisp - style procedural reflection and a whole host of other advanced features .
So , i was naturally profoundly frustrated when the world at large turned to languages like C , C++ and even Java .
i have been waiting more than 20 years for the industry to catch up to the joys of advanced language design .
Now that the industry has taken a shine to functional languages again i have been spending more time with the various modern flavors and have to say that while each of the major contenders ( ML , OCaml , Erlang , Scala , Haskell ) have something to be said for them , Haskell stands out among them .
Haskell enjoys a particular form of mental hygiene that few other languages enjoy .
Its syntax , by comparison with Scheme , is remarkably concise -- and , the importance of syntax is almost impossible to gauge because at the end of the day it is code one is staring at ;-) .
The chief semantic differences that make a difference to my mind may be classified as follows .
- types - monads - meta- programming
In order , then : at its outset Haskell made a strong commitment to a potent ( static ) typing scheme .
Even if types can be layered on Scheme , the two language design vectors are remarkably different and give programming a different feel .
As a result of my academic and professional training i have come to rely heavily on types as a development discipline .
In fact , if i cannot devise a sensible type " algebra " for a given ( application ) domain then i feel i do n't really have a good understanding of the domain .
One way of seeing this from the Schemer point if view is that the deep sensibility embodied in the Sussman and Abelson book of designing a DSL to solve a problem is further refined by types .
Types express an essential part of the grammar of that language .
In Haskell the close connection between typing and features like pattern - matching are also part of getting a certain kind of coherence between data and control .
Again , this can be seen as taking the coherence between data and control -- already much more evident in Scheme than say C or C++ or even Java -- up a notch .
Haskell 's language - level and library support for monads are really what set this language apart .
i feel pretty confident when i voice my opinion that the most important contribution to computing ( and science ) that functional programming has made in the last 15 years has been to work out practical presentations of the efficacy of the notion of monad .
As a Schemer i'm sure you understand the critical importance of composition and compositional design .
The monad provides an important next step in our understanding of composition effectively by making the notion parametric along certain dimensions .
This allows a programmer to capture very general container patterns and control patterns ( as well as other phenomena ) with a very concise abstraction .
Again , this could be layered onto Scheme , but Haskell embraced monad as a central abstraction at the language design level and this leads to very different approaches to programming .
Now , the place where Haskell and the other statically typed functional languages have some catching up to do is meta- programming .
Scheme , Lisp and other languages deriving from the McCarthy branch of the investigation of lambda - calculus - based programming languages enjoy a much longer and deeper investigation of meta- programming constructs .
While MetaOCaml stands out as a notable exception i think it safe to say that 3 - Lisp and Brown are pretty strong evidence of the long history and much richer investigation of meta- programming notions along the McCarthy branch than along the Milner branch .
The industry as a whole , i think , has embraced the value of meta- programming -- witness ( structural ) reflection in such mainstream languages as Java and C# .
And the Milner branch family of languages are moving rapidly to catch up -- see the efforts on generic programming like S P - J's SYB or TemplateHaskell -- but the deep coherence evident in the simplicity of the monadic abstraction has not met up with the deep coherence of 3 - Lisp , yet .
Anyway , that 's my two cents ... but i note that US currency is not worth what it used to be .

Simon -----Original Message ----- From : D. Gregor [ mailto: kerrangster at gmail.com ]
Sent : 30 March 2008 07:58 To : Simon Peyton - Jones Subject : Haskell Hello ,
In your most humble opinion , what 's the difference between Haskell and Scheme ?
What does Haskell achieve that Scheme does not ?
Is the choice less to do with the language , and more to do with the compiler ?
Haskell is a pure functional programming language ; whereas Scheme is a functional language , does the word " pure " set Haskell that much apart from Scheme ?
I enjoy Haskell .
I enjoy reading your papers on parallelism using Haskell .
How can one answer the question -- why choose Haskell over Scheme ?

Oh my .
Um , yeah , we 'll let Flickr 's artolog explain the above .
I 've lived here for over 30 years , but it was n't until a few weeks ago that I was initiated into one of the secret wonders of San Francisco , the so - called " two o' clock titty " of St. Mary 's Cathedral , which appears at 2 pm , and is a staple of academic life for Catholic schoolboys .
Hee .
Ahem .
Any of you kids born and raised here in San Francisco care to chime in : is this iconic schoolboy ( or schoolgirl ) sex fodder ?
Did it make you horny ?
Were you sent to confession for looking at the shadow ?
A Federal Communications Commission employee called me on Friday and said that this Tuesday , the third anniversary of Kevin Martin 's tenure as Chair of the FCC , at least some staff will arrive at work dressed in black .
A " silent but expressive protest " is what they 're calling the move .
What for ?
I asked .
" Because this place is hell , " came the reply .
Some background : Last week Ars Technica published my story about how John Dingell 's House Energy and Commerce Committee has demanded detailed FCC records related to over a dozen super - sensitive FCC issues and policies .
We 're talking e-mails , personnel records , letters of inquiry , meeting minutes , the works .
Shortly after the piece appeared that I got this e-mail : " In regard to Dingell 's latest investigatory letter sent to the FCC March 12 , " it began , " just heard from some old colleagues at the FCC that they are all happily working on meeting the requests in this letter .
And that the FCC staff are all going to be wearing black on Tuesday , March 18 , as a sign of protest on the third anniversary of Martin being Chairman . "
I was skeptical , and wrote back asking if this e-mailer could provide me with the name of at least one of these staffers .
Soon I got a name and some contact info .
I did some background work and requested an interview .
The individual in question called two hours later .
I asked some pretty detailed questions of this person , who requested anonymity .
After our conversation , I came away convinced that this is on the level .
A super - politicized environment
It appears that a critical mass of FCC grunts are sick of what they experience as a super - politicized work life in which just about anything that they want to do has to get the go - ahead from the top , that being Kevin Martin .
" Nothing happens in the Commission without the approval of the Chairman 's office , " my source told me .
" It is incredible .
We have become so political . "
Do you have any sense of the logic of these directives from the Chair ?
I asked .
" Nope , " came the reply .
" It seems as random as he got up this morning and ate his breakfast and just decided to do it . "
Why are FCC employees upset about this ?
Not because they disagree with Kevin Martin 's perspective on this or that FCC issue , but because , according to my source , he and his top subordinates demand that staff skip proper procedures and leapfrog various rules , even Congressional mandated rules , on a day - to - day level .
" In the past I may or may not have agreed with the outcome , but at least the proper procedures were followed .
Now they tell us ' what are the media reform groups going to do : file a class action lawsuit ?
Just do it . '
But ethically I have to sleep at night .
It 's not the decision , it 's how the decision is reached .
The situation has become arbitrary and capricious . "
We talked about some specific examples .
My source does n't want them published for fear that agency top brass will trace this interview to them .
But I 've run into possible Kevin Martin - style micro-management in the past .
Last summer I attended an FCC Consumer Advisory Council meeting on the DTV transition .
Shortly afterwards I got a tip that the FCC had told members of the council not to talk to the press , but to route the query directly to the FCC .
It came from a very credible person , so I called the Commission .
Someone called me back and said my source had got it all wrong .
The directive was about helping the public with the logistics of filing comments with the FCC .
" It was n't in the context of having no discussions with the press , " I was told .
' Yeah , right , ' I thought at the time .
The most formidable whistle blower I 've encountered is former FCC attorney and now law professor Adam Candeub .
Two years ago Candeub straight out told the press that a report arguing that locally owned TV stations broadcast more local news " was stopped in its tracks because it was not the way the agency wanted to go . "
The study 's conclusions obviously implied that retaining some of the FCC 's media ownership caps might help those local TV stations survive .
When the FCC's Inspector General released a report exonerating the agency of meddling with the report , I interviewed Candeub , who called the audit " skewed . "
" Chairman Martin should be engaged in creating safeguards and processes to allow objective media research to flourish at the FCC , " Candeub told me .
" I worry that he 's just too much of a partisan figure to be serious about such an endeavor . "
Now Congress wants the Commission to hand over all documents related to that audit in less than two weeks .
It 's funny .
Call me innocent and naive , but whenever I listen or watch Kevin Martin talk , he seems like a really nice guy .
Soft - spoken , a little geeky and nervous , sometimes he speaks his words so quietly and fast that he stumbles over them .
Compared to his sometimes swaggering predecessor Michael Powell , Martin comes off as self - effacing and modest .
But that 's not how my dressed - in - black source sees him .
" I am not a disgruntled employee , " I was told .
" I love my job .
But this situation has become unbearable .
We will not play this game .
I have to sleep at night . "
After taking control of Shareaza.com , imposters trying to pass themselves off as an open - source dev team have stepped up their action to destroy the GNU GPL licensed project .
In an audacious move , lawyers representing Discordia Ltd have filed to register the " Shareaza " trademark at the US Patent Office .
In a December 2007 hostile takeover , a company took control of Shareaza.com , the domain name used previously for the real , open - source Shareaza P2P client .
The real Shareaza client is 6th in the Sourceforge all - time Top 10 downloads and is completely free ( GNU General Public License ) , but this company is passing off its own closed - source software as the real thing .
Essentially , they are stealing the Shareaza brand name and goodwill from right under the operators noses in an effort to crush the project .
Last week , the corporate battle against this almost defenseless collective of people working on the Shareaza project took a somewhat miserable twist when the operators of the fake Shareaza site ( Discordia Ltd ) threatened legal action against the real Shareaza , all because of a comment made by a user on their forums .
If you ’re starting to get a little annoyed that this company is pushing its luck , you may be interested to know that their lawyers – Meister Seelig & Fein in New York – have links to the new owners of iMesh and Bearshare , both initially free , both now converted to pay services after legal action .
So if it does n’t unsettle you that some music - industry backed company has come in and stamped all over a GNU GPL project , took their domain name , passed their own software off as the real thing and threatened legal action , then maybe this will :
On January 10th 2008 , lawyers representing ‘ Discordia Ltd ’ filed for registration of the ‘ Shareaza ’ trademark at the United States Patent Office .
As yet , the trademark has not been granted to them but according to staff at the real Shareaza project , it must be urgently contested .
Discordia claim that the first commercial use of the Shareaza trademark was December 17 2007 but other documentation suggests Discordia claim copyright since 1999 .
The real Shareaza project has been running since 2004 .
If Discordia are successful in their application , it will put the original real Shareaza in a position where they infringe on the imposter ’s trademark and will doubtless be subjected to legal action .
According to a source at the real Shareaza : “ Discordia Ltd. under which the trademark was sought is a Cyprus shell company designed to shield MusicLab , iMesh , parent companies and business partners from the exceedingly high risk of liability in this case .
Private information will not be disclosed , however there is significant circumstantial evidence regarding the source of their unethical and illegal behaviors that ought to be brought to light for the greater internet community . ”
The real Shareaza guys are calling out for support , you can read exactly what they need here , but they are also calling on all of the budding internet investigators out there to research Discordia , iMesh , MusicLab and lawfirm Meister Seelig & Fein to dig up any information that could be of use to them in fighting these imposters .
To defend against the trademark application , the Shareaza team really need support as the financial burden is quite high , they explain :
No Shareaza developer or enthusiast has ever recieved money as a result .
However , several volunteers now out - of - pocket for hundreds of dollars are facing the prospect of thousands .
Shareaza has always been and will always remain free , non-commercialized software – regardless of the high value of its use that must be protected .
Donations will now begin to be accepted for the sole purpose of partially compensating these unfortunate expenses .
( Including a possible $ 900 at very short notice . )
A ChipIn account has been established for PayPal ( account / credit card ) payments large or small .
Please consider sending at least the loose change in your account to show your appreciation for enthusiasts who could scarcely afford these costs themselves .
Feel free to offer in other ways as well .
Personally I think this is a very worthy and symoblic cause .
No - one likes being bullied , particularly by the music industry so when they choose to pick on people with few resources , the only way they can be beaten is if people stick together and act together .
Shareaza is n’t my favorite client – even with its support for BitTorrent – but it ’s free in every possible way with its GNU GPL license and these people from Discordia are determined to tear it all apart .
It ’s unthinkable that they can be allowed to get away with it .
Discordia should consider this statement about the legal standing of trademarks :
“ Immoral , deceptive or scandalous matter or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons , institutions , beliefs , or national symbols or bring them into contempt or disrepute is not trademarkable . ”

In Venezuela , that is , where Hugo Chavez is taking the necessary first steps toward becoming dictator for life :
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has confirmed that he will try to change the law to allow him to remain in power indefinitely .
Under the current constitution , Mr Chavez will have to leave office at the end of his term in 2012 .
But he says he wants to remain in power for as long as Venezuelans continue to support him .
The constitution is under review and Mr Chavez is expected to make changes to cement in law his socialist revolution . ]
The details have so far been kept under wraps , but Mr Chavez has confirmed what many people expected – that he will be seeking to remain in power continuously .
(…)
He said this is something that happens in many European and Asian countries and that it should not be seen as a threat .
STEM cells have a controversial reputation , but in truth they are what makes human life possible .
Each tissue in the body grows from a particular sort of stem cell .
When it divides , one of its daughters remains a stem cell while the other eventually turns into whatever tissue its mother was designed to produce — be it blood , muscle , nerve or whatever .
That is how healthy tissues are renewed , and it is now looking likely that it is how unhealthy tissues are renewed , too .
Indeed , many researchers think that the underlying cause of cancer is the brakes coming off the regulatory system that stops normal stem cells from reproducing too much .
For one of the most important medical discoveries made in recent years is that cancers , too , have stem cells and that these appear to be the source of the rest of the tumour .
This helps to explain why cancers are so hard to deal with .
Treatments that kill the bulk of a tumour , but leave the stem cells alive , are only buying time .
On the other hand , if all of a tumour 's stem cells could be killed then it would torpedo the old wisdom that no patient is ever cured of cancer , but merely goes into remission .
True cures for cancer would be possible .
The cancer - stem - cell theory , though plausible , was based on animal experiments and its relevance to humans was untested .
But a series of studies reported this week at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research , in San Diego , has changed that .
They suggest both that cancer stem cells are very relevant indeed to survival , and that going after them is an excellent idea .
The relevance of cancer stem cells to survival was shown by William Matsui of the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Centre in Baltimore .
He looked at samples from 268 people with pancreatic cancer and found that the pattern of stem cells in their tumours predicted how long they would live .
Those whose tumours had stem cells at their edges ( the “ invasive margin ” in the militaristic jargon of the cancer - warriors ) lived on for an average of 14 months .
Those who did not lived an average of 18 months .
Not a huge difference , but confirmation that cancer stem cells have an impact on the outcome of disease .
Bombs away
Such stem cells , then , are as bad as theory suggests they should be .
The question is , can they be eradicated ?
Animal tests suggest this is hard .
For reasons as yet unknown , stem cells are resistant to standard cancer chemotherapies .
With this in mind , Jeffrey Rosen and his colleagues at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas , compared samples from breast - cancer patients taken before and after 12 weeks of chemotherapy .
They reasoned that if stem cells were resistant in people as well as mice , then the proportion of stem cells within a tumour would increase as more vulnerable cells were killed off in disproportionate numbers .
And that is exactly what happened .
Among women treated with old - fashioned chemotherapy , the share of stem cells within their tumours rose from 5 % before treatment to 14 % afterwards .
Dr Rosen , however , went further .
In a parallel experiment he looked at a group of women being treated with a new drug called lapatinib .
In these people , the proportion of cancer stem cells decreased from 10 % before therapy to 7.5 % after they were treated .
Lapatinib is a product of the growing field of molecular medicine — the design of drugs to attack specific protein molecules associated with particular diseases .
In this case the protein attacked is HER2 , a molecule often found on the surface of breast - tumour cells .
Ironically , however , it was not lapatinib's effect on HER2 that made it potent against stem cells .
Lapatinib , it turns out , also inhibits the activity of a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor , which has been found to be important for stem - cell proliferation .
When its activity is blocked , a stem cell 's daughters both lack stem - cell qualities and the chain of “ stem - cellness ” that the system depends on is broken .
Hence the proportion of stem cells in the tumour falls .
It is too early to tell if Dr Rosen 's discovery is a life - prolonging one .
But Dr Matsui and his colleague , Carol Ann Huff , are thinking along similar lines .
Alongside Dr Matsui 's pancreatic - cancer work , they have been looking at treating multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer , with a combination of heavy artillery and guided missiles : high - dose cytotoxic chemotherapy to kill the bulk of the cancer cells and antibodies called rituximab .
These bind to a protein called CD20 that sits on the surface of cancer stem cells .
It was expected to kill them .
Not every experiment works , and this one did not .
As expected , patients left with the fewest cancer stem cells after the therapy lived longest .
But this was the luck of the draw , for the rituximab failed to kill the cancer stem cells .
Indeed , Dr Huff and Dr Matsui could see stem cells coated with the antibodies alive and well in their samples .
The next step , Dr Huff and Dr Matsui agree , is to bring in even more powerful missiles .
Another proprietary antibody that binds to CD20 , called tositumomab , is radioactively labelled .
If this coats the myeloma stem cells in the way that rituximab does , the radiation should kill them .
Researchers at the University of Michigan , where tositumomab was developed , have already begun such an experiment .
Andrzej Jakubowiak , who is leading the trial , says four patients have been on the treatment long enough to be evaluated , and three of them have already been taken off other drugs and appear clinically stable — which for advanced myeloma is an unusually good success rate .
The laboratory data also look promising .
The radiological bombs seem to be destroying the cancerous stem cells in exactly the predicted manner — although Dr Jakubowiak rightly cautions that too few patients have been treated to allow firm conclusions .
The upshot of all this is that the stem - cell hypothesis of cancer growth looks a good one .
It explains a lot of things , and allows biologists to look at tumours in a new way — almost akin to developing organs , albeit ones with no function and growth that is out of control .
That insight , and a better understanding of stem - cell biology , may be the chink in cancer 's armour that people have long been searching for .
And that is a truly optimistic thought .
Venezuelan and Ecuadorean troops deployed on Colombia 's frontier last night as South America 's military and diplomatic crisis escalated into a dangerous showdown between President Hugo Chávez and Colombia 's US - backed government .
Venezuela started shutting crossing points on the 1,400 - mile border to try to isolate its neighbour after Bogotá made a series of extraordinary allegations about the Venezuelan leader funding Marxist guerrillas intent on building a uranium - enriched " dirty " bomb .
" Colombia proposes to denounce Hugo Chávez , president of Venezuela , in the international criminal court for sponsoring and financing genocide , " said President Alvaro Uribe .
The Organisation of American States , a pan-regional body , held an emergency meeting in Washington to seek a diplomatic solution after President George Bush sided with Colombia , his administration 's key ally in Latin America .
The US president accused Venezuela of " provocative manoeuvres " and said he stood by Bogotá and its fight against terrorism .
He also urged Congress to approve a free - trade agreement with Colombia .
Pictures of Venezuelan trucks and tanks rolling west , the vanguard of 10 battalions which were ordered to mobilise , and of Ecuadorean troops moving to the Colombian frontier from the other side of the Andes , underlined the risk of South America enduring its first war in over a decade .
Quito and Caracas have severed diplomatic ties with their neighbour .
" A serious cross - border military conflict is unlikely [ but ] the chain of actions and reactions often has a life of its own .
There is no telling where it could lead , " said Michael Shifter , of the Inter - American Dialogue thinktank .
Colombia triggered the crisis last Saturday by bombing a rebel camp one mile inside Ecuador , killing at least 21 members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) , including a senior commander , Raul Reyes .
The Marxist group , which has been waging an insurgency against the Colombian state for decades , said yesterday the raid gravely damaged chances of further releases of some of the 700 hostages it holds in jungle camps , including Ingrid Betancourt , the ailing Franco - Colombian politician who has become the public face of the captives ' plight .
The rebels said in a communique that Reyes died completing a mission to arrange Betancourt 's release through Chávez and the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , who has made it a personal cause .
Sarkozy said last week that Betancourt could be near death , and that her " martyrdom is the martyrdom of France " .
Bogotá said it would not match its neighbours ' border deployments but it ratcheted up tension by making explosive claims based on information allegedly culled from Reyes ' laptops , an intelligence treasure trove which some called the " brain " of the insurgency .
The Colombian government said Chávez received money from the drug - funded guerrillas in 1992 when he was an impoverished coup - monger with political ambitions and that recently , now a self - styled socialist revolutionary at the helm of an oil power , he gave the rebels $ 300m .
The Venezuelan 's leftwing affinity with the Farc is no secret but if the allegation is substantiated he could in theory be prosecuted since internationally the Farc are categorised as terrorists .
Bogotá would probably first have to go through Colombian courts so there is little immediate chance of The Hague summoning Chávez .
A Venezuelan government minister said the allegation was a smear .
Colombia 's vice president , Francisco Santos , dropped another bombshell at a UN disarmament meeting in Geneva when he said the laptops also revealed the guerrillas were negotiating to obtain radioactive material .
" This shows that these terrorist groups , supported by the economic power provided by drug trafficking , constitute a grave threat not just to our country but to the entire Andean region and Latin America . "
He provided no corroboration , prompting some scepticism that Bogotá may be making extravagant claims to deflect the chorus of criticism from Latin America and Europe over its raid into Ecuador , a territorial violation for which it has apologised to Quito .
Ecuador 's justice minister , Gustavo Jalkh , also in Geneva for a UN meeting , said Colombia had violated human rights obligations .
" The international community will know that it must close ranks . "
Efforts to cast Colombia as a military bully and the Israel of South America seemed to resonate with Brazil and Chile , among others , issuing sharp rebukes to Bogotá for its incursion .
The invocation of dirty bombs and state - sponsored terrorism fuelled a febrile atmosphere which at times verged on comic opera .
An unrelated taxi strike on a motorway reportedly bogged down Venezuelan military convoys and some vocal government supporters in red T - shirts vowed to mobilise neighbourhood militias , a chavista version of neighbourhood watch .
Otherwise there was little sign of martial mood .
Daily life largely continued as normal across Ecuador , Colombia and Venezuela .
Caracas 's skittish middle class , which habitually stocks up on tinned food and toilet paper at the first sign of political turmoil , had yet to make a run on the supermarkets .
In Bogotá the mood went from celebratory to sombre in just a few short days .
Saturday 's strike against the Farc was popular but by yesterday the focus was on the border tensions .
" Before , it [ a war ] seemed like something far off and impossible .
Now it looks like it 's something that 's possible and very , very close , " said one Bogotá resident , Javier Cardenas , 30 .
Despite a recent arms build - up Venezuela 's army is puny compared to the US - equipped , war - seasoned Colombian armed forces .
Another deterrent to hostilities breaking out is cross - border trade worth $ 6bn annually , much of it Colombian food imports on which Venezuela depends .
" The good news is that the three countries are so intertwined that a military conflagration would be tremendously costly for all , " said Shifter .
Welcome to the first article in a new Gamasutra series called Games Demystified .
In this series I 'll be deconstructing games with unique or distinguishing mechanics that may have left some folks scratching their heads , including reproducing effects with code samples , examining -- just how did they accomplish that ?
The first game we 'll be covering is Super Mario Galaxy for the Nintendo Wii .
Upon release , Super Mario Galaxy enchanted the gaming community because it allowed gamers to walk upside down and inside out -- all while feeling completely intuitive .
Especially geeky message boards and blogs have lit up with people attempting to apply real - world physics equations for gravity to each of the game 's tiny planetoids .
Obviously , real world physics have a place in today 's games .
However , they take a backseat to psychology when it comes to making real world gameplay .
In reality , mass distorts the fabric of time and space causing gravity , the force that keeps us stuck to Earth .
People such as Isaac Newton have studied and derived a great deal about gravity , but no one actually knows the true mechanics behind the force .
The important thing for the game is that we expect to get pulled toward planets -- and in fact , Mario does get pulled to each and every strangely shaped planetoid in the game .
Normally , gravity is calculated as a force between two objects that is directly proportional to the product of their respective masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the objects ' centers .
Force of Gravity = Gravitational Constant * ( ( mass1 * mass2 ) / distance2 )
To simplify , gravity follows the inverse square law .
Intensity of Gravity = 1 / Distance2
This means that as an object moves closer to a planet , the gravity between them
increases dramatically due to the exponential effect applied by distance .
Conversely , as an object moves away from a planet the gravity between them weakens very quickly .
Traditionally , the force of gravity is applied using the radius of the more massive body .
For instance , if we were to calculate the gravity holding a person to Earth we 'd plug the Earth 's radius into the above equation .
Additionally , if the mass is great enough to hold a person down , the celestial body will be round .
This is where reality and Super Mario Galaxy differ .
In Galaxy , players are pulled toward each and every arbitrarily shaped planetoid they encounter .
At this point all real world physics equations break down and tell us nothing about the gravity in the game , which as in most cases is a trick .
Much like the magicians in The Prestige , game developers are always attempting to one up each other with new tricks .
As we all know , Nintendo stole the show with its latest .
To accomplish this " trick " , the developers use the surface normals of whatever planetoid Mario inhabits to keep him running and jumping happily along .
This is how gravity is distributed through completely irregular bodies .
A surface normal is a ray or unit vector that runs perpendicular to a plane .
In the illustration above we can see an arrow pointing up from a plane , the arrow represents the surface normal of a plane that points straight up .
If we 're using a Y - up right handed coordinate system , that normal would be a ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) which means it 's not pointing along the x or z axes at all and that the full length of the vector is all in the up direction .
A unit vector always has a length of 1 , which is then distributed amongst the x , y , and z directions .
The longer one direction is the shorter the others must become .
True to form , Takashi Murakami finished working on his latest exhibit just six hours before its debut to the press Wednesday .
The 46 - year - old Japanese pop artist , known for his anime - and manga - inspired paintings and sculptures – along with his modded Louis Vuitton accessories – will be honored in a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum that opens to the public Saturday .
© Murakami features 90 - plus works from the artist 's 16 - year career .
The show is the second Murakami retrospective in the United States ( the first was held at the Los Angeles MoCA last fall ) .
Like the MoCA exhibit , the Brooklyn Museum will get a functioning Louis Vuitton store selling Murakami 's wallets and bags made for the luxe label , as well as monogrammed canvases ( a collaboration between Murakami and Vuitton designer Marc Jacobs ) .
The new monogrammed canvases feature a camouflage design , fitting as the LV store will donate a portion of proceeds generated during the museum 's gala event Thursday night to the Federal Enforcement Homeland Security Foundation .
While the FEHSF may sound frightening , it 's actually a small charity that offers financial assistance to the families of those in law enforcement .
After the jump , a sneak peek at what 's on display at the exhibit .

" Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
-- George Santayana
Many say that you can't use history to predict the future .
But Santayana 's quote rings true when it comes to market bubbles .
Greed wipes away the memory of past consequences , and no one is willing to stray from the crowd when things begin to spiral out of control .
And so , here we are again , in the midst of economic turmoil caused by the same mistake that investors have made time after time .
Wealth gone in the blink of an eye
With the most recent dot - com crash just six years behind us , investors do appear to have quite a short - term memory .
When the equity - market collapse between 2000 and 2002 instilled a sense of fear , investors simply migrated to a new market in hopes of recouping capital in the real estate industry , which seemed resilient to becoming overvalued .
But the lovefest in housing proliferated prices , and the " guaranteed profit " seemed irresistible .
Investors came armed with debt instruments , mortgage borrowers lacked credit scores , and builders such as Toll Brothers ( NYSE : TOL ) and Pulte Homes ( NYSE : PHM ) could n't build quickly enough for the average American swiping up loads of real estate on interest - only loans from profit - hungry lenders such as Countrywide ( NYSE : CFC ) .
Mortgages were bundled , repackaged , and bought with borrowed money .
Ultimately , the wealth effect played with minds , as homeowners believed they could refinance and take out second mortgages on their rapidly appreciating houses .
Everyone was feeling rich from unrealized gains on borrowed money .
Fast - forward to the present , where the feeling of prosperity has evaporated as those unrealized gains transformed into losses .
Arguably , this mess , like any other bubble , will eventually work itself out .
All economic downturns ultimately bottom out , right ?
But contrasted with previous recessionary periods , we 've dug ourselves into a much bigger hole than before .
As many economists and analysts are caught up trying to pinpoint whether current conditions meet an exact definition of a recession , nearly every characteristic of our economy strongly suggests that a prolonged period of slowness may persist for some time .
The power of debt
Beyond the fact that homeowners face mortgages worth substantially more than the market value of their property , our nation carries an astronomical debt load .
And that 's true if you do n't even take the housing mess into consideration .
Before the 1990s , consumer debt levels grew pretty much in tandem with gross domestic product .
But spending habits have since spiraled out of control , and since 1997 , consumer debt has risen an average of 7.5 % annually .
To put that in context , if Americans had stayed on track with previous borrowing trends , we would have $ 3 trillion less in debt right now .
It is n't just our materialistically centered population that has sunk itself into debt .
Back in 2000 , the Clinton administration had racked up a record budget surplus that it used to comfortably stimulate the nation .
Today , however , our government is in no shape to repair the damage we 've done , as we 've dug ourselves into a deep national deficit .
Life is n't cheap
Economist Robert Gordon said earlier this year that " energy is not as important a part of the consumer budget as it was in the ' 70s -- nor is food . "
But even if that 's true , the cost of living is still skyrocketing .
Compared with 2000 , when there was virtually no inflation , we experienced a 4.1 % inflation surge just seven years later .
That 's the highest rate we 've seen in 17 years and twice the 2.6 % rise in 2006 .
It 's evident in the margins at nearly every food retailer , including Starbucks ( NYSE : SBUX ) , and it has pinched margins even further at consumer - goods companies such as Kraft ( NYSE : KFT ) .
This situation puts our leaders in a bind , because the effects of stimulating the economy will push prices higher .
No quick fix
Just like the investors who never learned from previous bubbles , it seems as if our leaders have n't , either .
The consistent lowering of rates is putting us right back to what got us in trouble in first place .
" Free " money that encourages more spending and cheap borrowing is urging Americans to simply tack on more debt .
Lower interest rates also discourage foreign investment , which has already sent the dollar on a downward plunge , so that foreign goods have become more expensive than in the past .
It 's a troubled market , and it seems that every " answer " leads to more questions .
What does this mean for investors ?
Given the degree of leverage our economy has employed , the lack of creditworthiness of our debt , and the decisions our leaders are implementing , today 's bursting bubble threatens to be much more destructive than what we 've seen in recent history .
Yet contrast our current situation with the disintegration of equity values we 've experienced in the past , and you 'll realize that the market is unlikely to collapse nearly as much , since stocks ( largely , as a whole ) were n't the assets that became absurdly overvalued .
Still , I think investors awaiting the bull - market rally that typically follows a downturn are going to be waiting quite a bit longer this time around , because of the degree of financial trouble we have encountered .
The market will continue to be weak , but keep in mind that the declines in stock values reflect not value corrections , but a slowdown in growth expectations in the near term , while we make our way through this economic turmoil .
Our economy is plagued with troubles , and the current intervention is only creating more damage .
Painful as it might be , however , we can only hope that this economic disaster will finally teach investors a powerful lesson to prevent history from repeating itself in the future .
But until we learn , I 'd keep my eyes open for any discounts the market may throw our way .
For related Foolishness :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street banks are facing a " systemic margin call " that may deplete banks of $ 325 billion of capital due to deteriorating subprime U.S. mortgages , JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , said in a report late on Friday .
JPMorgan , which sent a default notice to Thornburg Mortgage Inc. TMA.N after the lender missed a $ 28 million margin call , said more default notices and margin calls were likely .
The Carlyle Group 's mortgage fund also failed to meet $ 37 million in margin calls this week .
“ A systemic credit crunch is underway , driven primarily by bank writedowns for subprime mortgages , ” according to the report co-authored by analyst Christopher Flanagan .
“ We would characterize this situation as a systemic margin call . ”
The credit crisis that began about a year ago will likely intensify after Friday ’s weak February U.S. employment report “ that most definitely signals recession , ” JPMorgan said .
Indeed , corporate bond spreads widened to a new record on Friday , surpassing levels seen in October 2002 during a boom in bankruptcies following the dot - com crash .
U.S. employers cut payrolls in February for a second consecutive month , slashing 63,000 jobs , the biggest monthly job decline in nearly five years , the U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday .
“ The weak February employment report points to an economy in recession , ” JPMorgan said .
The JPMorgan report included a revised bleaker forecast for subprime - related home prices .
The bank now sees prices falling 30 percent , from its prior 25 percent forecast .
Those prices have declined 14 percent since mid-2006 , JPMorgan said .
The U.S. jobs results also came after the Federal Reserve expanded the amount of its short - term auctions to $ 100 billion in total in the central bank ’s latest effort to ease credit concerns .
Ongoing concerns about bond insurers , known as monolines , and their effort to save their top ratings also are weighing on market sentiment .
FEC heads toward shutdown
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) just announced that the Senate will not clear four new appointees for the Federal Election Commission , meaning the panel that acts as a watchdog on political campaigns cannot function during the critical election - year period .
Reid is blaming the White House for refusing to withdraw to allow a majority vote on the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky for a seat on the commission .
Republicans want von Spakovsky approved as part of a slate of four FEC nominees or they will refuse to consider any of the nominees .
Von Spakovsky was recess appointed by President Bush to the FEC , but his term expires at the end of the year .
Democrats have refused to allow his nomination to move forward , arguing that his actions while at the Justice Department disqualified him for the post .
Bush , though has not backed down , and the matter has been at an impasse for the last four months .
Sens. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) and Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) placed holds on von Spakovsky 's nomination , meaning Republicans needed 60 votes to approve his nomination over Democratic objections .
Now , with the Senate moving toward adjournment until mid-January , Reid signalled that Democrats will not move any FEC nominations if they include von Spakovsky , meaning the commission will only have two of its required six members .
Reid said he offered the GOP a straight majority vote on all the FEC nominees , including von Spakovsky , but the White House refused to accept that offer .
Reid said he will not relent on von Spakovsky , who has come under heavy criticism from civil - rights groups , and he blamed the White House and Republicans for the stalemate .
" If they do not , the responsibility for a defunct FEC willl rest solely on their shoulders , " Reid said .
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) told reporters today that Democrats are unfairly trying to block a GOP nominee to the FEC , which is overseen by a panel of three Democrats and three Republicans .
" The Democrats have picked their nominees and we 've picked ours , " McConnell said .
" What we have here — once again it happened with one of our nominees toward the end of the Clinton administration — the Democrats trying to veto one of our nominees .
That is n't going to happen .
They 're all four going to go together or none of them will be approved . "

When Change Is Not Enough : The Seven Steps To Revolution
By Sara Robinson
“ Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable . ”
— John F. Kennedy
There ’s one thing for sure : 2008 is n’t anything like politics as usual .
The corporate media ( with their unerring eye for the obvious point ) is fixated on the narrative that , for the first time ever , Americans will likely end this year with either a woman or a black man headed for the White House .
Bloggers are telling stories from the front lines of primaries and caucuses that look like something from the early 60s — people lining up before dawn to vote in Manoa , Hawaii yesterday ; a thousand black college students in Prairie View , Texas marching 10 miles to cast their early votes in the face of a county that tried to disenfranchise them .
In recent months , we ’ve also been gobstopped by the sheer passion of the insurgent campaigns of both Barack Obama and Ron Paul , both of whom brought millions of new voters into the conversation — and with them , a sharp critique of the status quo and a new energy that ’s agitating toward deep structural change .
There ’s something implacable , earnest , and righteously angry in the air .
And it raises all kinds of questions for burned - out Boomers and jaded Gen Xers who ’ve been ground down to the stump by the mostly losing battles of the past 30 years .
Can it be — at long last — that Americans have , simply , had enough ?
Are we , finally , stepping out to take back our government — and with it , control of our own future ?
Is this simply a shifting political season — the kind we get every 20 to 30 years — or is there something deeper going on here ?
Do we dare to raise our hopes that this time , we ’re going to finally win a few ?
Just how ready is this country for big , serious , forward - looking change ?
Recently , I came across a pocket of sociological research that suggested a tantalizing answer to these questions — and also that America may be far more ready for far more change than anyone really believes is possible at this moment .
In fact , according to some sociologists , we ’ve already lined up all the preconditions that have historically set the stage for full - fledged violent revolution .
It turns out that the energy of this moment is not about Hillary or Ron or Barack .
It ’s about who we are , and where we are , and what happens to people ’s minds when they ’re left hanging just a little too far past the moment when they ’re ready for transformative change .
Way back in 1962 , Caltech sociologist James C. Davies published an article in the American Sociological Review that summarized the conditions that determine how and when modern political revolutions occur .
Intriguingly , Davies cited another scholar , Crane Brinton , who laid out seven “ tentative uniformities ” that he argued were the common precursors that set the stage for the Puritan , American , French , and Russian revolutions .
As I read Davies ’ argument , it struck me that the same seven stars Brinton named are now precisely lined up at midheaven over America in 2008 .
Taken together , it ’s a convergence that creates the perfect social , economic , and political conditions for the biggest revolution since the shot heard ’ round the world .
And even more interestingly : in every case , we got here as a direct result of either intended or unintended consequences of the conservatives ’ war against liberal government , and their attempt to take over our democracy and replace it with a one - party plutocracy .
It turns out that , historically , liberal nations make very poor grounds for revolution — but deeply conservative ones very reliably create the conditions that eventually make violent overthrow necessary .
And our own Republicans , it turns out , have done a hell of a job .
Here are the seven criteria , along with the reasons why we ’re fulfilling each of them now , and how conservative policies conspired to put us on the road to possible revolution .
1. Soaring , Then Crashing
Davies notes that revolutions do n’t happen in traditional societies that are stable and static — where people have their place , things are as they ’ve always been , and nobody expects any of that to change .
Rather , modern revolutions — particularly the progressive - minded ones in which people emerge from the fray with greater rights and equality — happen in economically advancing societies , always at the point where a long period of rising living standards and high , hopeful expectations comes to a crashing end , leaving the citizens in an ugly and disgruntled mood .
As Davies put it :
“ Revolutions are most likely to occur when a prolonged period of objective economic and social development is followed by a short period of sharp reversal .
The all - important effect on the minds of people in a particular society is to produce , during the former period , an expectation of continued ability to satisfy needs — which continue to rise — and , during the latter , a mental state of anxiety and frustration when manifest reality breaks away from anticipated reality … .
“ Political stability and instability are ultimately dependent on a state of mind , a mood , in society … it is the dissatisfied state of mind rather than the tangible provision of ‘ adequate ’ or ‘ inadequate ’ supplies of food , equality , or liberty which produces the revolution . ”
The American middle class was built on New Deal investments in education , housing , infrastructure , and health care , which produced a very “ prolonged period of objective economic and social development . ”
People were optimistic ; generations of growing prosperity raised their expectations that their children would do even better .
That era instilled in Americans exactly the kind of hopeful belief in their own agency that primes them to become likely revolutionaries in an era of decline .
And now , thanks to 28 years of conservative misrule , we are now at the point where “ manifest reality breaks away from anticipated reality ; ” and the breach is creating political turbulence .
The average American has seen his or her standard of living contract by fits and starts since about 1972 .
This fall - off that was relieved somewhat by the transition to two - earner households and the economic sunshine of the Clinton years — but then accelerated with the dot - com crash , followed by seven years of Bush ’s overt hostility toward the lower 98 percent of Americans who are n’t part of his base .
Working - class America is reeling from the mass exodus of manufacturing jobs and the scourge of predatory lending ; middle - class America is being hollowed out by health - care bankruptcies , higher college costs , and a tax load far heavier than that of the richest 2 percent .
These people expected to do better than their parents .
Now , they ’re screwed every direction they turn .
In the face of this reversal , Davies tells us , it ’s not at all surprising that the national mood is turning ominous , from one end of the political spectrum to the other .
However , he warns us : this may not be just a passing political storm .
In other times and places , this kind of quick decline in a prosperous nation has been a reliable sign of a full - on revolution brewing just ahead .
2. They Call It A Class War
Marx called this one true , says Davies .
Progressive modern democracies run on mutual trust between classes and a shared vision of the common good that binds widely disparate groups together .
Now , we ’re also about to re-learn the historical lesson that liberals like flat hierarchies , racial and religious tolerance , and easy class mobility not because we ’re soft - headed and soft - hearted — but because , unlike short - sighted conservatives , we understand that tight social cohesion is our most reliable and powerful bulwark against the kinds of revolutions that bring down great economies , nations and cultures .
In all the historical examples Davies and Brinton cite , the stage for revolution was set when the upper classes broke faith with society ’s other groups , and began to openly prey on them in ways that threatened their very future .
Not surprisingly , the other groups soon united , took up arms , and rebelled .
And here we are again : Conservative policies have opened the wealth gap to Depression levels ; put workers at the total mercy of their employers ; and deprived the working and middle classes of access to education , home ownership , health care , capital , legal redress , and their expectations of a better future for their kids .
You can only get away with blaming this on gays and Mexicans for so long before people get wise to the game .
And as the primaries are making clear : Americans are getting wise .
Our current plutocratic nobility may soon face the same stark choice its English , French , and Russian predecessors did .
They can keep their heads and take proactive steps to close the gap between themselves and the common folk ( choosing evolution over revolution , as JFK counsels above ) .
Or they can keep insisting stubbornly on their elite prerogatives , until that gap widens to the point where the revolution comes — and they will lose their heads entirely .
Right now , all we ’re asking of our modern - day corporate courtiers is that they accept a tax cut repeal on people making over $ 200 K a year , raise the minimum wage , give us decent health care and the right to unionize , and call a halt to their ridiculous “ death tax ” boondoggle .
In retrospect , their historic forebears might have counseled them to take this deal : their headless ghosts bear testimony to the idea that ’s it ’s better to give in and lose a little skin early than dig in and lose your whole hide later on .
3. Deserted Intellectuals
Mere unrest among the working and middle classes , all by itself , is n’t enough .
Revolutions require leaders — and those always come from the professional and intellectual classes .
In most times and places , these groups ( which also include military officers ) usually enjoy comfortable ties to the upper classes , and access to a certain level of power .
But if those connections become frayed and weak , and the disaffected intellectuals make common cause with the lower classes , revolution becomes almost inevitable .
Davies notes that , compared to both the upper and lower classes , the members of America ’s upper - middle class were relatively untouched by Great Depression .
Because of this , their allegiances to the existing social structure largely remained intact ; and he argues that their continued engagement was probably the main factor that allowed America to avert an all - out revolution in the 1930s .
But 2008 is a different story .
Both the Boomers ( now in their late 40s to early 60s ) and Generation X ( now in their late 20s to late 40s ) were raised in an economically advancing nation that was rich with opportunity and expectation .
We spent our childhoods in what were then still the world ’s best schools ; and A students of every class worked hard to position ourselves for what we ( and our parents and teachers ) expected would be very successful adult careers .
We had every reason to believe that , no matter where we started , important leadership roles awaited us in education , government , the media , business , research , and other institutions .
And yet , when we finally graduated and went to work , we found those institutions being sold out from under us to a newly - emerging group of social and economic conservatives who did n’t share our broad vision of common decency and the common good ( which we ’d inherited from the GI and Silent adults who raised us and taught us ) ; and who were often so corrupted or so sociopathic that the working environments they created were simply unendurable .
If wealth , prestige , and power came at the price of our principles , we often chose instead to take lower - paying work , live small , and stay true to ourselves .
For too many of us , these thwarted expectations have been the driving arc of our adult lives .
But we ’ve never lost the sense that it was a choice that the America we grew up in would never have asked us to make .
In Davies ’ terms , we are “ deserted intellectuals ” — a class that is always at extremely high risk for fomenting revolution whenever it appears in history .
Davies says that revolutions catalyze when these deserted intellectuals make common cause with the lower classes .
And much of the energy of this election is coming right out of that emerging alliance .
The same drive toward corporatization that savaged our dreams also hammered at other class wedges throughout American society , creating conditions that savaged the middle class and ground the working class toward something resembling serfdom .
Between our galvanizing frustration with George Bush , our shared fury at the war , and the new connections forged by bloggers and organizers , that alliance has now congealed into the determinedly change - minded movements we ’re seeing this election cycle .
4. Incompetent Government
As this blog has long argued , conservatives invariably govern badly because they do n’t really believe that government should exist at all — except , perhaps , as a way to funnel the peoples ’ tax money into the pockets of party insiders .
This conflicted ( if not outright hostile ) attitude toward government can’t possibly lead to any outcome other than bad management , bad policy , and eventually such horrendously bad social and economic outcomes that people are forced into the streets to hold their leaders to account .
It turns out there ’s never been a modern revolution that did n’t start against a backdrop of atrocious government malfeasance in the face of precipitously declining fortunes .
From George III ’s onerous taxes to Marie Antoinette ’s “ Let them eat cake , ” revolutions begin when stubborn aristocrats heap fuel on the fire by blithely disregarding the falling fortunes of their once - prosperous citizens .
And America is getting dangerously close to that point now .
Between our corporate - owned Congress and the spectacularly bad judgment of Bush ’s executive branch , there ’s never been a government in American history more inept , corrupt , and criminally negligent than this one — or more shockingly out of touch with what the average American is going through .
Just ask anyone from New Orleans — or anyone who has a relative in the military .
Liberal democracy avoids this by building in a fail - safe : if the bastards ignore us , we can always vote them out .
But if we ’ve learned anything over the last eight years , it ’s that our votes do n’t always count — especially not when conservatives are doing the counting .
If this year ’s election further confirms the growing conviction that change via the ballot box is futile , we may find a large and disgruntled group of Americans looking to restore government accountability by more direct means .
5. Gutless Wonders in the Ruling Class
Revolution becomes necessary when the ruling classes fail in their duty to lead .
Most of the major modern political revolutions occurred at moments when the world was changing rapidly — and the country ’s leaders dealt with it by dropping back into denial and clinging defiantly to the old , profitable , and familiar status quo .
New technologies , new ideas , and new economic opportunities were emerging ; and there came a time when ignoring them was no longer an option .
When the leaders failed to step forward boldly to lead their people through the looming and necessary transformations , the people rebelled .
We ’re hard up against some huge transformative changes now .
Global warming and overwhelming pollution are forcing us to reconsider the way we occupy the world , altering our relationship to food , water , air , soil , energy , and each other .
The transition off carbon - based fuels and away from non-recyclable goods is going to re-structure our entire economy .
Computers are still creating social and business transformations ; biotech and nanotech will only accelerate that .
More and more people in the industrialized world are feeling a spiritual void , and coming to believe that moving away from consumerism and toward community may be an important step in recovering that nameless thing they ’ve lost .
And , in the teeth of this restless drift toward inevitable change , America has been governed by a bunch of conservative dinosaurs who ca n’t even bring themselves to acknowledge that the 20th century is over .
( Some of them , in fact , are still trying to turn back the Enlightenment . )
Liberal governments manage this kind of shift by training and subsidizing scientists and planners , funding research , and setting policies that help their nations navigate these transitions with some grace .
Conservative ones — being conservative — will reflexively try to deny that change is occurring at all , and then brutally suppress anyone with evidence to the contrary .
Which is why , every time our current crop of so - called leaders open their mouths to propose a policy or Explain It All To Us , it ’s embarrassingly obvious that they do n’t have the vision , the intelligence , or the courage to face the future that everyone can clearly see bearing down on us , whether we ’re ready or not .
Their persistent cluelessness infuriates us — and terrifies us .
It ’s all too clear that these people are a waste of our tax money : they will never take us where we need to go .
Much of the energy we ’re seeing in this year ’s election is due to the fact that a majority of Americans have figured out that our government is leaving us hung out here , completely on our own , to manage huge and inevitable changes with no support or guidance whatsoever .
Historically , this same seething fury at incompetent , unimaginative , cowardly leaders — and the dawning realization that our survival depends on seizing the lead for ourselves — has been the spark that ’s ignited many a violent uprising .
6. Fiscal Irresponsibility
As we ’ve seen , revolutions follow in the wake of national economic reversals .
Almost always , these reversals occur when inept and corrupt governments mismanage the national economy to the point of indebtedness , bankruptcy , and currency collapse .
There ’s a growing consensus on both the left and right that America is now heading into the biggest financial contraction since the Great Depression .
And it ’s one that liberal critics have seen coming for years , as conservatives systematically dismantled the economic foundations of the entire country .
Good - paying jobs went offshore .
Domestic investments in infrastructure and education were diverted to the war machine .
Government oversight of banks and securities was blinded .
Vast sections of the economy were sold off to the Saudis for oil , or to the Chinese for cheap consumer goods and money to finance tax cuts for the wealthy .
This is no way to run an economy , unless you ’re a borrow - and - spend conservative determined to starve the government beast to the point where you can , as Grover Norquist proposed , drag it into the bathtub and drown it entirely .
The current recession is the bill come due for 28 years of Republican financial malfeasance .
It ’s also another way in which conservatives themselves have unwittingly set up the historical preconditions for revolution .
7. Inept and Inconsistent Use of Force
The final criterion for revolution is this :
The government no longer exercises force in a way that people find fair or consistent .
And this can happen in all kinds of ways .
Domestically , there ’s uneven sentencing , where some people get the maximum and others get cut loose without penalty — and neither outcome has any connection to the actual circumstances of the crime ( though it often correlates all too closely with race , class , and the ability to afford a good lawyer ) .
Unchecked police brutality ( tasers , for example ) that hardens public perception against the constabulary .
Unwarranted police surveillance and legal harassment of law - abiding citizens going about their business .
Different kinds of law enforcement for different neighborhoods .
The use of government force to silence critics .
And let ’s not forget the unconstitutional restriction of free speech and free assembly rights .
Abroad , there ’s the misuse of military force , which forces the country to pour its blood and treasure into misadventures that offer no clear advantage for the nation .
These misadventures not only reduce the country ’s international prestige and contribute to economic declines ; they often create a class of displaced soldiers who return home with both the skills and the motivation to turn political unrest into a full - fledged shooting war .
This kind of capricious , irrational ineptitude in deploying government force leads to public contempt for the power of the state , and leads the governed to withdraw their consent .
And , eventually , it also raises people ’s determination to stand together to oppose state power .
That growing solidarity and fearlessness — along with the resigned knowledge that equal - opportunity goons will brutalize loyalists and rebels alike , so you might as well be a dead lion rather than a live lamb — is the final factor that catalyzes ordinary citizens into ready and willing revolutionaries .
* * *
“ A revolutionary state of mind requires the continued , even habitual but dynamic expectation of greater opportunity to satisfy basic needs … but the necessary additional ingredient is a persistent , unrelenting threat to the satisfaction of those needs : not a threat which actually returns people to a state of sheer survival but which put them in the mental state where they believe they will not be able to satisfy one or more basic needs … .
The crucial factor is the vague or specific fear that ground gained over a long period of time will be quickly lost …
[ This fear ] generates when the existing government suppresses or is blamed for suppressing such opportunity . ”
When Davies wrote that paragraph in 1962 , he probably could n’t have imagined how closely it would describe America in 2008 .
Thirty years of Republican corporatist government have failed us in ways that are not just inept or corrupt , but also have brought us to the same dangerous brink where so many other empires have erupted into violent revolution .
The ground we have gained steadily over the course of the entire 20th Century is eroding under our feet .
Movement conservatism has destroyed our economic base , declared open war on the middle and working classes , thwarted the aspirations of the intellectual and professional elites , dismantled the basic processes and functions of democracy , failed to prepare us for the future , overseen the collapse of our economy , and misused police and military force so inconsistently that Americans are losing respect for government .
It ’s not always the case that revolution inevitably emerges wherever these seven conditions occur together , just as not everybody infected with a virus gets sick .
But over the past 350 years , almost every major revolution in a modern industrialized country has been preceded by this pattern of seven preconditions .
It ’s fair to say that all those who get sick start out by being exposed to this virus .
Hillary Clinton is failing because this is a revolutionary moment — and she , regrettably , has the misfortune to be too closely identified with the mounting failures of the past that we ’re now seeking to move beyond .
On the other hand , Ron Paul ’s otherwise inexplicable success has been built on his pointed and very specific critique of the kinds of government leadership failures I ’ve described .
And Barack Obama is walking away with the moment because he talks of “ hope ” — which , as Davies makes clear , is the very first thing any would - be revolutionary needs .
And then he talks of “ change , ” which many of his followers are clearly hearing as a soft word for “ revolution . ”
And then he describes — not in too much detail — a different future , and what it means to be a transformative president , and in doing so answers our deep frustration at 30 years of leaders who faced the looming future by turning their heads instead of facing it .
Will he deliver on this promise of change ?
That remains to be seen .
But the success of his presidency , if there is to be one , will likely be measured on how well his policies confront and deal with these seven criteria for revolution .
If those preconditions are all still in place in 2012 , the fury will have had another four years to rise .
And at that point , if history rhymes , mere talk of hope and change will no longer be enough .

As white people get older , they like to make clear boundaries between their professional and personal lives .
They do n’t mind talking about their personal life at work , but they hate talking about their work life when they are enjoying a weekend or vacation .
But with blackberries and laptops , white people could be working anywhere , at any time .
So how do you know when they are off the clock ?
It ’s easy , check their clothes .
When white people are n’t working , they generally like to wear Outdoor Performance Clothes .
The top suppliers of these garments and accessories include North Face , REI , Mountain Equipment Co - Op , Columbia Sportswear , and Patagonia .
When you see white people wearing these , it is important that you do not discuss business matters .
Instead you should say things like “ where did you get that fleece ? ” and “ what ’s that thing holding your keys to your shorts ? ”
White people will be more than happy to talk to you about their sustainably produced possessions .
The main reason why white people like these clothes is that it allows them to believe that at any moment they could find themselves with a Thule rack on top of their car headed to a national park .
It could be 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday when they might get a call “ hey man , you know what we need to do ?
Kayak then camping , right now .
I ’m on my way to get you , there is no time to change clothes . ”
Though it is unlikely that they will receive this call , White people hate the idea of missing an opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities because they were n’t wearing the right clothes .
If you plan on spending part of your weekend with a white person , it is strongly recommended that you purchase a jacket or some sort of “ high performance ” t- shirt , which is like a regular shirt but just a lot more expensive .
The Earth 's jet streams , the high - altitude bands of fast winds that strongly influence the paths of storms and other weather systems , are shifting -- possibly in response to global warming .
Scientists at the Carnegie Institution determined that over a 23 - year span from 1979 to 2001 the jet streams in both hemispheres have risen in altitude and shifted toward the poles .
The jet stream in the northern hemisphere has also weakened .
These changes fit the predictions of global warming models and have implications for the frequency and intensity of future storms , including hurricanes .
Cristina Archer and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Global Ecology tracked changes in the average position and strength of jet streams using records compiled by the European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecasts , the National Centers for Environmental Protection , and the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
The data included outputs from weather prediction models , conventional observations from weather balloons and surface instruments , and remote observations from satellites .
Jet streams twist and turn in a wide swath that changes from day to day .
The poleward shift in their average location discovered by the researchers is small , about 19 kilometers ( 12 miles ) per decade in the northern hemisphere , but if the trend continues the impact could be significant .
" The jet streams are the driving factor for weather in half of the globe , " says Archer .
" So , as you can imagine , changes in the jets have the potential to affect large populations and major climate systems . "
Storm paths in North America are likely to shift northward as a result of the jet stream changes .
Hurricanes , whose development tends to be inhibited by jet streams , may become more powerful and more frequent as the jet streams move away from the sub- tropical zones where hurricanes are born .
The observed changes are consistent with numerous other signals of global warming found in previous studies , such as the widening of the tropical belt , the cooling of the stratosphere , and the poleward shift of storm tracks .
This is the first study to use observation - based datasets to examine trends in all the jet stream parameters , however .
" At this point we can't say for sure that this is the result of global warming , but I think it is , " says Caldeira .
" I would bet that the trend in the jet streams ' positions will continue .
It is something I 'd put my money on . "
The results are published in the April 18 Geophysical Research Letters .

All roads lead to Rove .
That was the message scrawled as an afterthought in the lower left - hand corner of the envelope I received in yesterday ’s mail .
It contained a letter from an old and dear friend of mine .
His name is Don Siegelman .
He is the former governor of Alabama and he is being held as a political prisoner of the Bush administration in a Federal prison in Louisiana .
They do n’t allow Don the luxury of stationary so he must write his letters on whatever he can find .
He wrote me on a xeroxed article he wanted me to see . [..]
When I first heard of Don being prosecuted for corruption my heart sank .
I did n’t know what to think .
It had been years since we ’d spoken and the press made it sound awful for Don ( what else ? ) .
Of course I had no idea what was really going on .
Now that I do I am horrified ... and furious .
Don is a formidable force in Alabama politics .
His friends are loyal and his supporters enthusiastic .
They re-elected him Governor in the midst of a bogus corruption trial engineered by the Bush Justice Department at the behest of Karl Rove who takes orders from you - know - who .
Don campaigned for re-election throughout the early phases of the trial .
On election night he was declared the winner , but Karl Rove ’s minions stole the election overnight by manipulating the ballots in Baldwin County .
It was classic Rovian / Republican election theft .
They did it with computers and electronic voting machines .
Don went to bed the re-elected Governor of Alabama , and woke up an unemployed defendant . [.. ]
Something that has not been reported is that they have been physically beating Don .
I do n’t know the extent of his injuries or exactly how many times it has happened – but it has been multiple times .
There are no words for the fury I feel .
This is an outrage .
And it is the most un -American thing I have ever heard .
I cry bitter tears of frustration and rage .
Please everyone .
We have to help Don , and we have to crush these thugs and put them out of the business of perverting our democracy .
We must investigate and prosecute the responsible parties , not for political reasons , but to actually serve the interest of justice .
The cause of justice calls upon us to hold these criminals accountable .
We must bring them to justice and stop such travesties from ever again happening in our United States of America .
I went to my first class and everything seemed normal .
Thank goodness because I had slept in the first day of that class .
I thought that the two profs were going to hate me .
Apparently they were understanding of the email that I had written them and did n't mind that I did n't make it to class .
Next class , prof pulls me out and asks me if I am having problems registering for my classes .
I told her that if I did , it was news to me .
Reason for her question -- she had been asked if I had been in class .
Okay , I am not thinking anything weird , yet .
Then I get a break from classes .
I went back to my dorm to take a nap .
I jumped into my bed and my muscles rejoiced that they would be given a rest finally .
Then there is a knock on my door .
Great .
Turns out that it is my resident assistant just checking to see how I am doing .
Fine , blah , blah , blah .
Anyway , somewhere in those blahs she made me call to set up an appointment with a psychologist to talk about transfering schools .
( something I want to do because I want a major my school wo n't offer me )
No more time for nap after she leaves .
Grr. Anyway , I go to my English class .
Ahh , at least one thing is normal today .
No concerns about me in that class .
Next class , prof is asking people if I had been in class .
I told him who I was and he said that he knew that I had been in class everyday .
Well , at least one normal class a day is fun .
I get back to the dorm room a little weirded out .
I got a message on my voicemail that the psychologist was waiting to see me all day .
I thought that they may have confused me with someone else .
That is until my resident director came up to my room after chasing me down at my class which got out earlier than he had anticipated .
Anyway , to sum up this weirdness , I was taken to be " evaluated . "
Turns out someone thought I was suicidal because I cried once about my grandma dying .
Last time I heard , crying because your grandma is dying is a natural thing to do .
Maybe I just have n't kept up with the National Enquirer 's standards of what behavior indicates suicidal intent .

The End of Dollar Hegemony
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
Watch Ron Paul ’s speech on video .
Before the US House of Representatives , February 15 , 2006
A hundred years ago it was called dollar diplomacy .
After World War II , and especially after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 , that policy evolved into dollar hegemony . 
But after all these many years of great success , our dollar dominance is coming to an end .
It has been said , rightly , that he who holds the gold makes the rules .
In earlier times it was readily accepted that fair and honest trade required an exchange for something of real value .
First it was simply barter of goods .
Then it was discovered that gold held a universal attraction , and was a convenient substitute for more cumbersome barter transactions .
Not only did gold facilitate exchange of goods and services , it served as a store of value for those who wanted to save for a rainy day .
Though money developed naturally in the marketplace , as governments grew in power they assumed monopoly control over money .
Sometimes governments succeeded in guaranteeing the quality and purity of gold , but in time governments learned to outspend their revenues .
New or higher taxes always incurred the disapproval of the people , so it was n’t long before Kings and Caesars learned how to inflate their currencies by reducing the amount of gold in each coin — always hoping their subjects would n’t discover the fraud .
But the people always did , and they strenuously objected .
This helped pressure leaders to seek more gold by conquering other nations .
The people became accustomed to living beyond their means , and enjoyed the circuses and bread .
Financing extravagances by conquering foreign lands seemed a logical alternative to working harder and producing more .
Besides , conquering nations not only brought home gold , they brought home slaves as well .
Taxing the people in conquered territories also provided an incentive to build empires .
This system of government worked well for a while , but the moral decline of the people led to an unwillingness to produce for themselves .
There was a limit to the number of countries that could be sacked for their wealth , and this always brought empires to an end .
When gold no longer could be obtained , their military might crumbled .
In those days those who held the gold truly wrote the rules and lived well .
That general rule has held fast throughout the ages .
When gold was used , and the rules protected honest commerce , productive nations thrived .
Whenever wealthy nations — those with powerful armies and gold — strived only for empire and easy fortunes to support welfare at home , those nations failed .
Today the principles are the same , but the process is quite different .
Gold no longer is the currency of the realm ; paper is .
The truth now is :  He who prints the money makes the rules — at least for the time being .
Although gold is not used , the goals are the same : compel foreign countries to produce and subsidize the country with military superiority and control over the monetary printing presses .
Since printing paper money is nothing short of counterfeiting , the issuer of the international currency must always be the country with the military might to guarantee control over the system .
This magnificent scheme seems the perfect system for obtaining perpetual wealth for the country that issues the de facto world currency .
The one problem , however , is that such a system destroys the character of the counterfeiting nation ’s people — just as was the case when gold was the currency and it was obtained by conquering other nations .
And this destroys the incentive to save and produce , while encouraging debt and runaway welfare .
The pressure at home to inflate the currency comes from the corporate welfare recipients , as well as those who demand handouts as compensation for their needs and perceived injuries by others .
In both cases personal responsibility for one ’s actions is rejected .
When paper money is rejected , or when gold runs out , wealth and political stability are lost .
The country then must go from living beyond its means to living beneath its means , until the economic and political systems adjust to the new rules — rules no longer written by those who ran the now defunct printing press .
 Dollar Diplomacy ,  a policy instituted by William Howard Taft and his Secretary of State Philander C. Knox , was designed to enhance U.S. commercial investments in Latin America and the Far East .
McKinley concocted a war against Spain in 1898 , and ( Teddy ) Roosevelt ’s corollary to the Monroe Doctrine preceded Taft ’s aggressive approach to using the U.S. dollar and diplomatic influence to secure U.S. investments abroad .
This earned the popular title of  Dollar Diplomacy . 
The significance of Roosevelt ’s change was that our intervention now could be justified by the mere appearance  that a country of interest to us was politically or fiscally vulnerable to European control .
Not only did we claim a right , but even an official U.S. government obligation to protect our commercial interests from Europeans .
This new policy came on the heels of the gunboat diplomacy of the late 19th century , and it meant we could buy influence before resorting to the threat of force .
By the time the dollar diplomacy  of William Howard Taft was clearly articulated , the seeds of American empire were planted .
And they were destined to grow in the fertile political soil of a country that lost its love and respect for the republic bequeathed to us by the authors of the Constitution .
And indeed they did .
It was n’t too long before dollar diplomacy  became dollar hegemony  in the second half of the 20th century .
This transition only could have occurred with a dramatic change in monetary policy and the nature of the dollar itself .
Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913 .
Between then and 1971 the principle of sound money was systematically undermined .
Between 1913 and 1971 , the Federal Reserve found it much easier to expand the money supply at will for financing war or manipulating the economy with little resistance from Congress — while benefiting the special interests that influence government .
Dollar dominance got a huge boost after World War II .
We were spared the destruction that so many other nations suffered , and our coffers were filled with the world ’s gold .
But the world chose not to return to the discipline of the gold standard , and the politicians applauded .
Printing money to pay the bills was a lot more popular than taxing or restraining unnecessary spending .
In spite of the short - term benefits , imbalances were institutionalized for decades to come .
The 1944 Bretton Woods agreement solidified the dollar as the preeminent world reserve currency , replacing the British pound .
Due to our political and military muscle , and because we had a huge amount of physical gold , the world readily accepted our dollar ( defined as 1/35th of an ounce of gold ) as the world ’s reserve currency .
The dollar was said to be as good as gold ,  and convertible to all foreign central banks at that rate .
For American citizens , however , it remained illegal to own .
This was a gold - exchange standard that from inception was doomed to fail .
The U.S. did exactly what many predicted she would do .
She printed more dollars for which there was no gold backing .
But the world was content to accept those dollars for more than 25 years with little question — until the French and others in the late 1960s demanded we fulfill our promise to pay one ounce of gold for each $ 35 they delivered to the U.S. Treasury .
This resulted in a huge gold drain that brought an end to a very poorly devised pseudo - gold standard .
It all ended on August 15 , 1971 , when Nixon closed the gold window and refused to pay out any of our remaining 280 million ounces of gold .
In essence , we declared our insolvency and everyone recognized some other monetary system had to be devised in order to bring stability to the markets .
Amazingly , a new system was devised which allowed the U.S. to operate the printing presses for the world reserve currency with no restraints placed on it — not even a pretense of gold convertibility , none whatsoever !
Though the new policy was even more deeply flawed , it nevertheless opened the door for dollar hegemony to spread .
Realizing the world was embarking on something new and mind - boggling , elite money managers , with especially strong support from U.S. authorities , struck an agreement with OPEC to price oil in U.S. dollars exclusively for all worldwide transactions .
This gave the dollar a special place among world currencies and in essence backed  the dollar with oil .
In return , the U.S. promised to protect the various oil - rich kingdoms in the Persian Gulf against threat of invasion or domestic coup .
This arrangement helped ignite the radical Islamic movement among those who resented our influence in the region .
The arrangement gave the dollar artificial strength , with tremendous financial benefits for the United States .
It allowed us to export our monetary inflation by buying oil and other goods at a great discount as dollar influence flourished .
This post -Bretton Woods system was much more fragile than the system that existed between 1945 and 1971 .
Though the dollar / oil arrangement was helpful , it was not nearly as stable as the pseudo — gold standard under Bretton Woods .
It certainly was less stable than the gold standard of the late 19th century .
During the 1970s the dollar nearly collapsed , as oil prices surged and gold skyrocketed to $ 800 an ounce .
By 1979 interest rates of 21 % were required to rescue the system .
The pressure on the dollar in the 1970s , in spite of the benefits accrued to it , reflected reckless budget deficits and monetary inflation during the 1960s .
The markets were not fooled by LBJ ’s claim that we could afford both guns and butter . 
Once again the dollar was rescued , and this ushered in the age of true dollar hegemony lasting from the early 1980s to the present .
With tremendous cooperation coming from the central banks and international commercial banks , the dollar was accepted as if it were gold .
Fed Chair Alan Greenspan , on several occasions before the House Banking Committee , answered my challenges to him about his previously held favorable views on gold by claiming that he and other central bankers had gotten paper money — i.e. the dollar system — to respond as if it were gold .
Each time I strongly disagreed , and pointed out that if they had achieved such a feat they would have defied centuries of economic history regarding the need for money to be something of real value .
He smugly and confidently concurred with this .
In recent years central banks and various financial institutions , all with vested interests in maintaining a workable fiat dollar standard , were not secretive about selling and loaning large amounts of gold to the market even while decreasing gold prices raised serious questions about the wisdom of such a policy .
They never admitted to gold price fixing , but the evidence is abundant that they believed if the gold price fell it would convey a sense of confidence to the market , confidence that they indeed had achieved amazing success in turning paper into gold .
Increasing gold prices historically are viewed as an indicator of distrust in paper currency .
This recent effort was not a whole lot different than the U.S.
Treasury selling gold at $ 35 an ounce in the 1960s , in an attempt to convince the world the dollar was sound and as good as gold .
Even during the Depression , one of Roosevelt ’s first acts was to remove free market gold pricing as an indication of a flawed monetary system by making it illegal for American citizens to own gold .
Economic law eventually limited that effort , as it did in the early 1970s when our Treasury and the IMF tried to fix the price of gold by dumping tons into the market to dampen the enthusiasm of those seeking a safe haven for a falling dollar after gold ownership was re-legalized .
Once again the effort between 1980 and 2000 to fool the market as to the true value of the dollar proved unsuccessful .
In the past 5 years the dollar has been devalued in terms of gold by more than 50 % .
You just ca n’t fool all the people all the time , even with the power of the mighty printing press and money creating system of the Federal Reserve .
Even with all the shortcomings of the fiat monetary system , dollar influence thrived .
The results seemed beneficial , but gross distortions built into the system remained .
And true to form , Washington politicians are only too anxious to solve the problems cropping up with window dressing , while failing to understand and deal with the underlying flawed policy .
Protectionism , fixing exchange rates , punitive tariffs , politically motivated sanctions , corporate subsidies , international trade management , price controls , interest rate and wage controls , super - nationalist sentiments , threats of force , and even war are resorted to — all to solve the problems artificially created by deeply flawed monetary and economic systems .
In the short run , the issuer of a fiat reserve currency can accrue great economic benefits .
In the long run , it poses a threat to the country issuing the world currency .
In this case that ’s the United States .
As long as foreign countries take our dollars in return for real goods , we come out ahead .
This is a benefit many in Congress fail to recognize , as they bash China for maintaining a positive trade balance with us .
But this leads to a loss of manufacturing jobs to overseas markets , as we become more dependent on others and less self - sufficient .
Foreign countries accumulate our dollars due to their high savings rates , and graciously loan them back to us at low interest rates to finance our excessive consumption .
It sounds like a great deal for everyone , except the time will come when our dollars — due to their depreciation — will be received less enthusiastically or even be rejected by foreign countries .
That could create a whole new ballgame and force us to pay a price for living beyond our means and our production .
The shift in sentiment regarding the dollar has already started , but the worst is yet to come .
The agreement with OPEC in the 1970s to price oil in dollars has provided tremendous artificial strength to the dollar as the preeminent reserve currency .
This has created a universal demand for the dollar , and soaks up the huge number of new dollars generated each year .
Last year alone M3 increased over $ 700 billion .
The artificial demand for our dollar , along with our military might , places us in the unique position to rule  the world without productive work or savings , and without limits on consumer spending or deficits .
The problem is , it ca n’t last .
Price inflation is raising its ugly head , and the NASDAQ bubble — generated by easy money — has burst .
The housing bubble likewise created is deflating .
Gold prices have doubled , and federal spending is out of sight with zero political will to rein it in .
The trade deficit last year was over $ 728 billion .
A $ 2 trillion war is raging , and plans are being laid to expand the war into Iran and possibly Syria .
The only restraining force will be the world ’s rejection of the dollar .
It ’s bound to come and create conditions worse than 1979 — 1980 , which required 21 % interest rates to correct .
But everything possible will be done to protect the dollar in the meantime .
We have a shared interest with those who hold our dollars to keep the whole charade going .
Greenspan , in his first speech after leaving the Fed , said that gold prices were up because of concern about terrorism , and not because of monetary concerns or because he created too many dollars during his tenure .
Gold has to be discredited and the dollar propped up .
Even when the dollar comes under serious attack by market forces , the central banks and the IMF surely will do everything conceivable to soak up the dollars in hope of restoring stability .
Eventually they will fail .
Most importantly , the dollar / oil relationship has to be maintained to keep the dollar as a preeminent currency .
Any attack on this relationship will be forcefully challenged — as it already has been .
In November 2000 Saddam Hussein demanded Euros for his oil .
His arrogance was a threat to the dollar ; his lack of any military might was never a threat .
At the first cabinet meeting with the new administration in 2001 , as reported by Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , the major topic was how we would get rid of Saddam Hussein — though there was no evidence whatsoever he posed a threat to us .
This deep concern for Saddam Hussein surprised and shocked O’Neill .
It now is common knowledge that the immediate reaction of the administration after 9/11 revolved around how they could connect Saddam Hussein to the attacks , to justify an invasion and overthrow of his government .
Even with no evidence of any connection to 9/11 , or evidence of weapons of mass destruction , public and congressional support was generated through distortions and flat out misrepresentation of the facts to justify overthrowing Saddam Hussein .
There was no public talk of removing Saddam Hussein because of his attack on the integrity of the dollar as a reserve currency by selling oil in Euros .
Many believe this was the real reason for our obsession with Iraq .
I doubt it was the only reason , but it may well have played a significant role in our motivation to wage war .
Within a very short period after the military victory , all Iraqi oil sales were carried out in dollars .
The Euro was abandoned .
In 2001 , Venezuela ’s ambassador to Russia spoke of Venezuela switching to the Euro for all their oil sales .
Within a year there was a coup attempt against Chavez , reportedly with assistance from our CIA .
After these attempts to nudge the Euro toward replacing the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency were met with resistance , the sharp fall of the dollar against the Euro was reversed .
These events may well have played a significant role in maintaining dollar dominance .
It ’s become clear the U.S. administration was sympathetic to those who plotted the overthrow of Chavez , and was embarrassed by its failure .
The fact that Chavez was democratically elected had little influence on which side we supported .
Now , a new attempt is being made against the petrodollar system .
Iran , another member of the axis of evil ,  has announced her plans to initiate an oil bourse in March of this year .
Guess what , the oil sales will be priced Euros , not dollars .
Most Americans forget how our policies have systematically and needlessly antagonized the Iranians over the years .
In 1953 the CIA helped overthrow a democratically elected president , Mohammed Mossadeqh , and install the authoritarian Shah , who was friendly to the U.S.
The Iranians were still fuming over this when the hostages were seized in 1979 .
Our alliance with Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Iran in the early 1980s did not help matters , and obviously did not do much for our relationship with Saddam Hussein .
The administration announcement in 2001 that Iran was part of the axis of evil did n’t do much to improve the diplomatic relationship between our two countries .
Recent threats over nuclear power , while ignoring the fact that they are surrounded by countries with nuclear weapons , does n’t seem to register with those who continue to provoke Iran .
With what most Muslims perceive as our war against Islam , and this recent history , there ’s little wonder why Iran might choose to harm America by undermining the dollar .
Iran , like Iraq , has zero capability to attack us .
But that did n’t stop us from turning Saddam Hussein into a modern day Hitler ready to take over the world .
Now Iran , especially since she ’s made plans for pricing oil in Euros , has been on the receiving end of a propaganda war not unlike that waged against Iraq before our invasion .
It ’s not likely that maintaining dollar supremacy was the only motivating factor for the war against Iraq , nor for agitating against Iran .
Though the real reasons for going to war are complex , we now know the reasons given before the war started , like the presence of weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein ’s connection to 9/11 , were false .
The dollar ’s importance is obvious , but this does not diminish the influence of the distinct plans laid out years ago by the neo-conservatives to remake the Middle East .
Israel ’s influence , as well as that of the Christian Zionists , likewise played a role in prosecuting this war .
Protecting our oil supplies has influenced our Middle East policy for decades .
But the truth is that paying the bills for this aggressive intervention is impossible the old - fashioned way , with more taxes , more savings , and more production by the American people .
Much of the expense of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 was shouldered by many of our willing allies .
That ’s not so today .
Now , more than ever , the dollar hegemony — it ’s dominance as the world reserve currency — is required to finance our huge war expenditures .
This $ 2 trillion never - ending war must be paid for , one way or another .
Dollar hegemony provides the vehicle to do just that .
For the most part the true victims are n’t aware of how they pay the bills .
The license to create money out of thin air allows the bills to be paid through price inflation .
American citizens , as well as average citizens of Japan , China , and other countries suffer from price inflation , which represents the tax that pays the bills for our military adventures .
That is , until the fraud is discovered , and the foreign producers decide not to take dollars nor hold them very long in payment for their goods .
Everything possible is done to prevent the fraud of the monetary system from being exposed to the masses who suffer from it .
If oil markets replace dollars with Euros , it would in time curtail our ability to continue to print , without restraint , the world ’s reserve currency .
It is an unbelievable benefit to us to import valuable goods and export depreciating dollars .
The exporting countries have become addicted to our purchases for their economic growth .
This dependency makes them allies in continuing the fraud , and their participation keeps the dollar ’s value artificially high .
If this system were workable long term , American citizens would never have to work again .
We too could enjoy bread and circuses  just as the Romans did , but their gold finally ran out and the inability of Rome to continue to plunder conquered nations brought an end to her empire .
The same thing will happen to us if we do n’t change our ways .
Though we do n’t occupy foreign countries to directly plunder , we nevertheless have spread our troops across 130 nations of the world .
Our intense effort to spread our power in the oil - rich Middle East is not a coincidence .
But unlike the old days , we do n’t declare direct ownership of the natural resources — we just insist that we can buy what we want and pay for it with our paper money .
Any country that challenges our authority does so at great risk .
Once again Congress has bought into the war propaganda against Iran , just as it did against Iraq .
Arguments are now made for attacking Iran economically , and militarily if necessary .
These arguments are all based on the same false reasons given for the ill - fated and costly occupation of Iraq .
Our whole economic system depends on continuing the current monetary arrangement , which means recycling the dollar is crucial .
Currently , we borrow over $ 700 billion every year from our gracious benefactors , who work hard and take our paper for their goods .
Then we borrow all the money we need to secure the empire ( DOD budget $ 450 billion ) plus more .
The military might we enjoy becomes the backing of our currency .
There are no other countries that can challenge our military superiority , and therefore they have little choice but to accept the dollars we declare are today ’s gold . 
This is why countries that challenge the system — like Iraq , Iran and Venezuela — become targets of our plans for regime change .
Ironically , dollar superiority depends on our strong military , and our strong military depends on the dollar .
As long as foreign recipients take our dollars for real goods and are willing to finance our extravagant consumption and militarism , the status quo will continue regardless of how huge our foreign debt and current account deficit become .
But real threats come from our political adversaries who are incapable of confronting us militarily , yet are not bashful about confronting us economically .
That ’s why we see the new challenge from Iran being taken so seriously .
The urgent arguments about Iran posing a military threat to the security of the United States are no more plausible than the false charges levied against Iraq .
Yet there is no effort to resist this march to confrontation by those who grandstand for political reasons against the Iraq war .
It seems that the people and Congress are easily persuaded by the jingoism of the preemptive war promoters .
It ’s only after the cost in human life and dollars are tallied up that the people object to unwise militarism .
The strange thing is that the failure in Iraq is now apparent to a large majority of American people , yet they and Congress are acquiescing to the call for a needless and dangerous confrontation with Iran .
But then again , our failure to find Osama bin Laden and destroy his network did not dissuade us from taking on the Iraqis in a war totally unrelated to 9/11 .
Concern for pricing oil only in dollars helps explain our willingness to drop everything and teach Saddam Hussein a lesson for his defiance in demanding Euros for oil .
And once again there ’s this urgent call for sanctions and threats of force against Iran at the precise time Iran is opening a new oil exchange with all transactions in Euros .
Using force to compel people to accept money without real value can only work in the short run .
It ultimately leads to economic dislocation , both domestic and international , and always ends with a price to be paid .
The economic law that honest exchange demands only things of real value as currency cannot be repealed .
The chaos that one day will ensue from our 35 - year experiment with worldwide fiat money will require a return to money of real value .
We will know that day is approaching when oil - producing countries demand gold , or its equivalent , for their oil rather than dollars or Euros .
The sooner the better .

Subject : America ’s Madness – John Le Carre
The United States of America has gone mad
John le Carré
America has entered one of its periods of historical madness , but this is the worst I can remember : worse than McCarthyism , worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam War .
The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams .
As in McCarthy times , the freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded .
The combination of compliant US media and vested corporate interests is
once more ensuring that a debate that should be ringing out in every town square is confined to the loftier columns of the East Coast press .
The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck , but it was he who made it possible .
Without bin Laden , the Bush junta would still be trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be elected in the first place ; Enron ; its shameless favouring of the already - too - rich ; its reckless disregard for the world ’s poor , the ecology and a raft of unilaterally abrogated international treaties .
They might also have to be telling us why they support Israel in its continuing disregard for UN resolutions .
But bin Laden conveniently swept all that under the carpet .
The Bushies are riding high .
Now 88 per cent of Americans want the war , we are told .
The US defence budget has been raised by another $ 60 billion to around $ 360 billion .
A splendid new generation of nuclear weapons is in the pipeline , so we can all breathe easy .
Quite what war 88 per cent of Americans think they are supporting is a lot less clear .
A war for how long , please ?
At what cost in American lives ?
At what cost to the American taxpayer ’s pocket ?
At what cost – because most of those 88 per cent are thoroughly decent and humane people – in Iraqi lives ?
How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America ’s anger from bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring tricks of history .
But they swung it .
A recent poll tells us that one
in two Americans now believe Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre .
But the American public is not merely being misled .
It is being browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance and fear .
The carefully orchestrated neurosis should carry Bush and his fellow conspirators nicely into the next election .
Those who are not with Mr Bush are against him .
Worse , they are with the enemy .
Which is odd , because I ’m dead against Bush , but I would love to see Saddam ’s downfall – just not on Bush ’s terms and not by his methods .
And not under the banner of such outrageous hypocrisy .
The religious cant that will send American troops into battle is perhaps the most sickening aspect of this surreal war - to - be .
Bush has an arm - lock on God .
And God has very particular political opinions .
God appointed America to save the world in any way that suits America .
God appointed Israel to be the nexus of America ’s Middle Eastern policy , and anyone who wants to mess with that idea is a ) anti-Semitic , b ) anti-American , c ) with the enemy , and d ) a terrorist .
God also has pretty scary connections .
In America , where all men are equal in His sight , if not in one another ’s , the Bush family numbers one President , one ex-President , one ex-head of the CIA , the Governor of Florida and the ex-Governor of Texas .
Care for a few pointers ?
George W. Bush , 1978 - 84 : senior executive , Arbusto Energy / Bush Exploration , an oil company ; 1986 - 90 : senior executive of the Harken oil company .
Dick Cheney , 1995 - 2000 : chief executive of the Halliburton oil company .
Condoleezza Rice , 1991 - 2000 : senior executive with the Chevron oil company , which named an oil tanker after her .
And so on .
But none of these trifling associations affects the integrity of God ’s work .
In 1993 , while ex-President George Bush was visiting the ever - democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive thanks for liberating them , somebody tried to kill him .
The CIA believes that “ somebody ” was Saddam .
Hence Bush Jr ’s cry : “ That man tried to kill my Daddy . ”
But it ’s still not personal , this
war .
It ’s still necessary .
It ’s still God ’s work .
It ’s still about bringing freedom and democracy to oppressed Iraqi people .
To be a member of the team you must also believe in Absolute Good and Absolute Evil , and Bush , with a lot of help from his friends , family and God , is there to tell us which is which .
What Bush wo n’t tell us is
the truth about why we ’re going to war .
What is at stake is not an Axis of Evil — but oil , money and people ’s lives .
Saddam ’s misfortune is to sit on the second biggest oilfield in the world .
Bush wants it , and who helps him get it will receive a piece of the cake .
And who does n’t , wo n’t .
If Saddam did n’t have the oil , he could torture his citizens to his heart ’s content .
Other leaders do it every day – think Saudi Arabia , think Pakistan , think Turkey , think Syria , think Egypt .
Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its neighbours , and none to the US or Britain .
Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction , if he ’s still got them , will be peanuts by comparison with the stuff Israel or America could hurl at him at five minutes ’ notice .
What is at stake is not an imminent military or terrorist threat , but the economic imperative of US growth .
What is at stake is America ’s need to demonstrate its military power to all of us – to Europe and Russia and China , and poor mad little North Korea , as well as the Middle East ; to show who rules America at home , and who is to be ruled by America abroad .
The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair ’s part in all this is that he believed that , by riding the tiger , he could steer it .
He can ’t .
Instead , he gave it a phoney legitimacy , and a smooth voice .
Now I fear , the same tiger has him penned into a corner , and he ca n’t get out .
It is utterly laughable that , at a time when Blair has talked himself against the ropes , neither of Britain ’s opposition leaders can lay a glove on him .
But that ’s Britain ’s tragedy , as it is America ’s : as our
Governments spin , lie and lose their credibility , the electorate simply shrugs and looks the other way .
Blair ’s best chance of personal survival must be that , at the eleventh hour , world protest and an improbably
emboldened UN will force Bush to put his gun back in his holster unfired .
But what happens when the world ’s greatest cowboy rides back into town without a tyrant ’s head to wave at the boys ?
Blair ’s worst chance is that , with or without the UN , he will drag us into a war that , if the will to negotiate energetically had ever been there , could have been avoided ; a war that has been no more democratically
debated in Britain than it has in America or at the UN .
By doing so , Blair will have set back our relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come .
He will have helped to provoke unforeseeable retaliation , great domestic unrest , and regional chaos in the Middle East .
Welcome to the party of the ethical foreign policy .
There is a middle way , but it ’s a tough one : Bush dives in without UN approval and Blair stays on the bank .
Goodbye to the special relationship .
I cringe when I hear my Prime Minister lend his head prefect ’s sophistries to this colonialist adventure .
His very real anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men .
What he ca n’t explain is how he reconciles a
global assault on al - Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq .
We are in this war , if it takes place , to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship , to grab our share of the oil pot , and because , after all the public hand - holding in Washington and Camp David , Blair has to show up at the altar .
“ But will we win , Daddy ? ”
“ Of course , child .
It will all be over while you ’re still in bed . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ Because otherwise Mr Bush ’s voters will get terribly impatient and may decide not to vote for him . ”
“ But will people be killed , Daddy ? ”
“ Nobody you know , darling .
Just foreign people . ”
“ Can I watch it on television ? ”
“ Only if Mr Bush says you can . ”
“ And afterwards , will everything be normal again ?
Nobody will do anything horrid any more ? ”
“ Hush child , and go to sleep . ”
Last Friday a friend of mine in California drove to his local supermarket with a sticker on his car saying : “ Peace is also Patriotic ” .
It was gone by the time he ’d finished shopping .
Measure for Measure : How to write a song and other mysteries .
In about a week I will load up my car with amplifiers and guitars and drive to Nashville to begin recording my next record .
I do n’t drive much anymore and I ’m glad for that except that I used to write a lot while on the road .
Solitude , boredom , and the desperate need to entertain oneself are ideal stimuli for songwriting .
I ’ve spent most of the last year inside a tour bus .
I ’ve spoken more words to journalists than I have to my friends and family .
All of this has kept me from what I realize now is my job , and that ’s to daydream .
Now I bring my bike on tour and ride every day .
Wandering in an unfamiliar town , the rhythm of walking or riding and a few hours to kill is nearly the perfect recipe for a new idea .
I ’ve got 11 songs mostly written and several dozen distinct melodies .
I never worry about the melodies drying up .
Since I can remember , I ’ve had melodies in my head .
I chew my food to them .
Almost every breath contains some fragments of an escaping melody .
If I shape my lips so as to whistle , my breath will take on a musical shape like sonic vapor .
Words are much trickier .
I would forgo words altogether if I did n’t love singing them so much .
My choice of words and my voice betray so much and that ’s what ’s so terrifying and attractive about it .
I ’m not the most forthcoming person — I only speak when I have something to say .
What is becoming more challenging of late is dealing with so many fully formed melodies that are unwilling to change their shape for any word .
So writing lyrics becomes like running multiple code - breaking programs in your head until just the right word with just the right number of syllables , tone of vowel and finally some semblance of meaning all snap into place .
I ’m kind of the opposite of the confessional singer - songwriter who fills notebooks full of poetry and intones them over a bed of chords .
Meaning or “ the truth that ’s in my heart ” usually reveals itself well after the record is released .
I ’m often surprised that the things I care about actually end up in my songs .
Until then I ’m mostly concerned with shape , tone and texture .
I ’m really an instrumentalist who sings words and if you care to pay attention you might enjoy them .
So in this post , I will begin reporting on the progress of an as of yet unfinished song , with all my doubts and insecurities laid bare .
The song in question is called ( for now ) “ Oh No . ”
It began , as do most of my songs , with a sound .
It could be a creaking door or a delivery truck or the sound of multiple stereos wafting out of bedroom windows .
For the last four years the same dancehall beat has been has been rattling the foundation of my Chicago apartment .
When I stay at my farm , sparrows , coyotes , chickens and frogs find their way into my songs as well .
In the instance of this song I was on a flight from New York back to Chicago and a young mother and her 3 - year - old son sat in front of me and it was looking to be the classic scenario of the child screaming bloody murder .
However , I was struck by the mournfulness of this kid ’s wail .
He just kept crying “ oh no ” in a way that only someone who is certain of their demise could .
Pure terror .
Completely inconsolable .
It was more moving than annoying .
So when I got home I picked up my guitar and tried to capture the slowly descending arc of that kid ’s cry .
It fit nicely over a violin loop that I had been toying with which moves from C - major to A - major .
I ’ll spend days at my farm creating loops with my violin where I record a phrase and layer on top of it , often starting with pizzicato followed by multiple string lines .
This is a handy compositional tool I also use in performance .
I can follow any whim and instantly hear how it works in counterpoint with other ideas .
It ’s perfect for someone who plays by ear and improvises as I do and who is too impatient for notation .
This helps keep ideas fluid and ephemeral but with an instant gratification playback option .
I ’ve found that I can be completely satisfied for weeks by the simplest four - bar phrase repeating over and over again .
It ’s a fragile thing where your perception of it can change it completely .
You can reconstruct all the elements the following day , note for note and go by physical memory but the feel can be elusive .
Back to “ Oh No . ”
All this child knows is that he needs to get off this plane and I can empathize .
I often find myself in a crowded room and all I know is “ I need to get out of here . ”
So begins the song with a child ’s half - dream of climbing out a window and venturing into the ravines around Lake Bluff , where I grew up .
let ’s get out of here
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one - sie and a veil .
When I was little the “ silver bridge ” spanned the ravine and marked the boundary of my known world .
Words get under my skin the same way melodies do .
Something catches my attention and I file it subconsciously .
It often begins with an archaic or obscure word I have not defined .
I just like the sound of it and its elusive meaning gives it a mysterious shine .
On the menu of a local cafe is an item called “ salsify . ”
Before I reach for the dictionary I let my imagination run wild and decide that salsify is a burrowing bronchial root like a rickety old mine that burrows deep into something .
It turns out that ’s mostly correct which encourages me further .
All I know is “ salsify mains ” sounds good to me .
Then I might think of what I want to say , what have I been fixated on of late ?
I have been thinking about how as adults we bury our emotions and I almost envied that kid on the plane who had license to express what we all were probably feeling .
And how I have felt frozen and numb of late .
( The process may seem more deliberate than it actually is — it ’s only because I ’m breaking it down for this article and have hindsight that it appears that I know what I ’m doing ) .
In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
the calcified charismatists were doing the math
It would take a calculated blow to the head
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths
What does it take to wake us up , we who feel so little ?
Are n’t we almost like sociopaths , only the kind that do n’t kill people ?
The only thing I do n’t care for in this lyric is the “ calcified charismatist ” — it just feels too clever .
I ’m known to make up words but this is too heavy - handed .
So I ’m still searching for the right words .
For a while it was “ unemployed ex-physicists , ” but that ’s too typical of something I would write .
Lately I ’m considering “ calcified arhythmitist ” or just “ arithmatist ” — something that conveys a physicist ’s sketch or formula for what will revive our harmless sociopath .
Then the cheerful refrain of “ arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths / in the calcium mines buried deep in our chests . ”
Followed by the chorus which has only taken shape in the last day , which is “ Oh no , we ’re deep in a mine / Oh no , a calcium mine . ”
Sounds a bit bleak as I break it down , but it should be a rousing little number .

1 Frog - like Baby ( unidentified baby – Nepal )
In 2006 , this bizarre - looking baby was born in Charikot , the headquarters of Dolakha district , attracting a huge number of onlookers to witness the astonishing sight .
The neck - less baby with its head almost totally sunk into the upper part of the body and with extraordinarily large eyeballs literally popping out of the eye - sockets , was born to Nir Bahadur Karki and Suntali Karki at the Gaurishnkar Hospital in Charikot .
The Karki couple is a permanent resident of Dolakha ’s Bhirkot VDC .
The bizarre baby , however , died after half an hour of its birth , Suntali , the mother , informed .
It was taken to the hospital after its death .
The news about such a baby being brought to the hospital spread like wildfire and there were hundreds gathered at the hospital to have a look .
The police had to be deployed to control the crowd .
The baby weighed 2 kg at birth and was born after the normal nine - month gestation period .
Suntali , already a mother of two normal daughters , was not suffering from any illness during the pregnancy .
Nir Bahadur , the father , says he does not feel any remorse for the newly - born baby ’s death .
“ I am happy that nothing happened to my wife , ” he said .
NOTE : Our readers , Becca and Andrew , report us that “ the baby has a condition called anencephaly , a neural tube defect ( like the cyclops baby ) , with no proper brain formation .
The baby would have died a few days later .
That ’s why women are advised to take folate in early pregnancy . ”
– Thank you !
2 13 - inch Tailed Man ( Chandre Oram – India )
With a 13 - inch tail , Chandre Oram , a tea-estate worker , has become quite an object of devotion in his native Alipurduar , West Bengal and believes that Hanuman is manifest in him .
” I was born on Ram Navami ( birthday of Lord Ram ) .
People have a lot of faith in me – they get cured of severe ailments when they touch my tail .
I believe I can do a lot of good to those who come to me with devotion , ” says the man , before whom thousands of people queue up each day to seek blessings .
In a corner of the courtyard of his home , Oram has set up a small Hanuman temple , where he receives offerings on Ram Navami , which he later offers to the deity .
NOTE : video suggested by our reader Luke , thank you !
However , because of the tail , Oram has found it difficult to get a bride .
” Almost 20 women have turned down marriage proposals .
They see me and agree to a match .
But as soon as I turn around , they see my tail and leave .
But I have decided I will marry the woman who accepts me and my tail .
Or else , I ’ll remain a bachelor like Hanuman , ” he said .
Oram ’s family is proud of his tail and has turned down offers from doctors for its removal by surgery .
“ He will not survive without his tail .
It has become part of his being , his existence , ” said Rekha , his sister .
Doctors say that true tails are rare .
But they are located in the coccygeal end of the vertebral column whereas Oram ’s tail shoots out from the lumbar region .
” The coccyx is a vestige in humans and we stopped growing tails from that region a long time ago when we evolved from monkeys .
Oram ’s case seems an aberration , an offshoot of a congenital defect , ” said eminent surgeon Dr B Ramana .
The medical community reads the monkey man ’s case as a spina bifida — a defect in the bone of the spine covered by a hole with lots of hair covering it .
3 Cyclop Baby ( unidentified baby – India )
In 2006 , this baby was born with a only one eye in India .
Medical staff who helped deliver the child believe that the child ’s condition was caused by an experimental anti-cancer drug .
Another cause written in the report by the hospital was that it could also be the result of a chromosomal disorder .
The child was diagnosed with a rare chromosomal disorder , known as cyclopia .
She was born with a single eye in the center of her forehead , no nose and her brain fused into a single hemisphere .
With such severe deformities , it was a miracle that the girl survived even a few minutes after delivery .
The baby died days later .
4 World ’s Largest Hand ( Lui Hua – China )
Lui Hua suffers from a rare condition known as macrodactyly .
When he was hospitalized in Shanghai on July 2007 , his left thumb measured 10.2 inches and his index finger measured close to 12 .
On July 20 surgeons undertook a seven - hour operation to reduce the size of Liu ’s fingers and thumb .
Doctors removed 11 pounds of flesh and bone in the procedure .
A second surgery is scheduled to take place .
Enlarged limbs can be caused by a number of medical conditions .
Lymphedema is perhaps the most common cause and results in some extraordinarily enlarged limbs .
5 Feet facing backwards ( Wang Fang – China )
Wang Fang , 27 , of Chongqing city in China , was born with her feet facing the wrong way .
She has learned to live with her condition without problems and recently refused a disability pension by being classified as disabled .
“ I can run faster than most of my friends and have a regular job as a waitress in the family restaurant .
There is no reason to class me as disabled . ”
6 Baby with Three Arms ( Liu Junjie – China )
This 2 - month - old baby named Liu Junjie from Anhui Province , China , was born with a third arm in 2006 .
Doctors successfully removed the extremely rare and well - developed third arm , but the baby required long - term physical therapy to gain function in his remaining hand , which has no palm and flexes in either direction .
” We ’re hoping to exchange information with doctors who ’ve dealt with similar cases anywhere in the world , ” said Chen , head of the orthopedics department at Shanghai Children ’s Medical Center .
“ This is so rare that we have virtually no information to go on . ”
7 Nipple on the foot ( unidentified 22 - year - old woman – Brazil )
The bizarre paper describing the case reads : “ A 22 - year - old woman sought medical care for a lesion in the plantar region of her left foot , a well - formed nipple surrounded by areola and hair .
Microscopic examination of the dermis showed hair follicles , eccrine glands , and sebaceous glands .
Fat tissue was noted at the base of the lesion .
Clinical and histopathologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of supernumerary breast tissue , also known as pseudomamma .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of supernumerary breast tissue on the foot . ”

Folger : To ' Protect marriage ' is to link gays with terrorists
by Jeremy Hooper
Anti-gay battle axe Janet Folger has penned a new piece in which she , following the lead of so many of her fringe - dwelling conservative pals , tries to spin the Sally Kern situation so that it's the gays who look like the militant ones , not the state lawmaker who compared those gays to terrorists .
And while there are a predictably large number of twists , misrepresentations , and offensive judgments cast in Folger 's commentary , there is one passage that we want to focus on specifically .
Of the supposedly widespread support that Sally has for her words that positioned gays as a corruptive voice that will ultimately destroy society , Janet says the following :
Look , the 76 percent of Oklahomans who agreed with Sally when they voted to protect marriage between a man and a woman understand that if the battle to save marriage is lost , we will have lost the foundation of our civilization .
That 's why Rep.
Kern said this agenda is the " biggest threat … that our nation has , even more so than terrorism or Islam , which I think is a big threat . "
So what Folger is implying is that by voting against gay marriage , this 76 % of Oklahomans automatically agrees with Kern .
And the irony is that if this idea is , in fact , true , then the veil that shrouds the right wing 's most common anti-marriage equality arguments ( that it 's not anti-anyone , that it 's only about marriage and not against gays , etc. ) is finally being lifted .
In her de-humanizing speech , Kern suggested a roll back of gay rights in every way , and painted a demonized portrait of queer life that made it sound as if we gays were a time bomb waiting to explode .
And not just to explode the " sanctity of marriage " -- to explode society as a whole !
She compared us to terrorists , she positioned our pushes for tolerance as attempts to " indoctrinate , " she made us sound sick and diseased , and she unapologetically stated throughout her speech that our " lifestyle " is not equal to that of a heterosexual .
If the mentality found within Kern 's tirade is fully in line with the " pro-marriage " side 's arguments , then every single thing they 've said in the past vis -à - vis their " marriage - prteocting " intent is now completely invalidated !
Or at the very least , it has just gotten easy for those of us who have always realized the truth behind the anti-gay marriage campaigns to connect the dots of bias for society at large !
Do we think everyone who has voted against gay marriage agrees with Kern ?
No , not even close !
We think there are large swaths of the population who have been duped by the outright lies of the disingenuous " protect marriage " movement .
They have been frightened by the misinformation they 've been fed , and emboldened by the false idea that to be anti-gay is to be a loving , compassionate member of the " pro-family " team .
And , of course , they have also been told that one cannot be religious and be gay - accepting .
In a world where such rhetoric does not exist , we would see a very different portrait of LGBT friendliness .
And if many of these who have been duped could only see the full picture as clearly as those of us on the other side can , then many would be downright ashamed that they have so blindly gotten behind this discrimination !
By willingly making the link between Kern and anti-marriage equality efforts , Ms. Folger is unwittingly helping us to cut through the false doctrine in which she and her " pro-family " pals traffic .
And if they truly believe that " gays=terrorism " will receive as much support at referendum as " we must protect marriage in order to protect children , " then they need to start saying the former rather than hiding behind the latter !!!
Gays ' respect and tolerance [ WND ]

okay the funny thing is that Oklahoma has one of the highest , if not the highest divorce rates outside of Beverly hills .
somewhere around 70 percent currently .
I do n't think they really have a leg to stand on anyway .
I live here and I think this is one of the lamest divorce states anywhere .
Conversely however they have one of the best divorce and child support systems in the country .
There is little to no alimony ( a social plus I think ) , and the state will track you down and garnish your check if you try to avoid paying for your kids , they will also throw you in jail if you try to cheat the system .
Because of that there is no fear that divorce will destroy your family so they get the divorce .

I 'm convinced " women " like Janet Folger , Star Parker , and Ann Coulter are all man-hating dykes .
The fact that these 3 " women " parade around saying " women should n't have any rights / should be submissive to men " , yet they 're the ones running around acting like MEN themselves , and doing the opposite of what they 're saying women should be doing proves my point .
If " women are meant to be seen , not heard " , then why are these dykes talking ?
Posted by : Scott | Mar 26 , 2008 7:18:21 AM
Do n't really appreciate your use of the word Dyke there , Scott .
Posted by : Chris | Mar 27 , 2008 7:16:23 PM
Sorry Chris , but " women " like Coulter , Folger and Parker reminds me of " Large Marge " , or that one brute lesbian in the movie ' Butch Camp ' - pushing around the real women , and acting like men themselves .
Coulter is ancient , is " pro family " , but has never been married once , nor has any children .
Somebody needs to ask Bill Maher if Ann REALLY has a dick - because there 's something wrong with that picture .

In times of financial crisis , people want nuts and bolts advice on how to survive , or even better , how to profit from the calamity .
' Tell us how to get out of this , not how we got in it , ' is the prevailing attitude -- which is ironic , since most investors are calling for more cheap credit , the policy that brought us to disaster 's door in the first place .
The Fed and the government -- the public sector -- will ' do what it takes to maintain the stability of our financial system , ' according to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , and that is precisely why we can expect more of the same -- bailouts , inflation , jittery investors , false euphoria , the continued destruction of the dollar -- not just now but for as long as the government controls the money supply .
History tells us so , and theory backs it up .
In his book , Essays on the Great Depression , published in 2000 , Ben Bernanke says ,
To understand the Great Depression is the Holy Grail of macroeconomics .
The experience of the 1930s continues to influence macroeconomists ' beliefs , policy recommendations , and research agendas . [ p .
5 ]
He says we do n't yet ' have our hands on the Grail by any means , ' but we 're getting there .
According to Bernanke , we 've made ' substantial progress ' in the last 15 years .
Bernanke will never find the Holy Grail .
To paraphrase an old song , he 's looking for it in all the wrong places .
This would hardly be worth mentioning if it were n't for the job he holds .
As such , he 's dragging us and every other prisoner of central banking along on his misguided search .
Where has Bernanke gone wrong ?
In the area of fundamental economics .
Bernanke does not understand what money is .
He and his countless watchers in the financial press talk about ' liquidity , ' not money .
Bernanke can create all the ' liquidity ' he wants , but he will not create one cent of real money .
He can't because real money emerges on the market , not from FOMC policy decisions .
To be sure , what comes out of the Fed 's powwows is something that functions like money , and therein lies a big error .
For at least the last three centuries , economists have had ample evidence that fiat money -- another name for the paper government orders us to use in exchange for real goods and services -- has a short lifespan .
It exists because it 's easy to create , and when money is easy to create , it gets created -- for the benefit of some at the expense of the rest of us .
But even those it seems to favor pay a price .
Cheap credit produces an atmosphere of euphoria while leading investors astray .
And when the tide goes out and certain firms are seen swimming naked , we hit the bust phase of the trade cycle .
The Fed runs its printing presses harder and passes out suits to the naked swimmers , if they 're deemed important enough .
It happens every time .
In what sense is this ' substantial progress ' ?
The other economic fundamental that Bernanke fails to understand is the effect of government intervention .
The state intervened to create the Fed in 1913 .
The Fed inflated the money supply during the 1920s , per its mandate and Morgan 's connections in Britain .
The Fed retrenched then started inflating again , but by then the Crash had come .
Hoover was in the White House and began aggressive intervention .
The recession fell into a depression .
Banks were failing as people discovered the banks had loaned out their money to others .
Rather than hold the banks responsible , Hoover 's successor blamed gold and declared it would no longer be money , at least domestically .
The new president called his interventions a New Deal .
It started to show promise only after the Court struck down eight of his programs in 1935 - 1936 , including his National Recovery Act ( NRA ) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act ( AAA ) , both centerpieces of New Deal legislation .
The president then went after the Court to get it to think more like him .
He also stepped up his attack on business .
The short - lived recovery ended in 1938 .
The recovery faltered because investors and businessmen did n't trust Roosevelt .
Why should they ?
He was Mr. Intervention .
He was calling them ' economic royalists . '
And he had strong popular support .
We operate today with the same ideas that ran the economy into the ground during the 1930s .
But Bernanke excuses himself on that point , saying in his book he prefers to focus on ' broad economic issues rather than historical details . ' [ p .
6 ] For his history of the interwar period , Bernanke draws heavily on the work of economist Barry Eichengreen , who blames the gold standard for ' sharp unintended declines in national money supplies , ' which he says were ' strongly associated with falling prices , output and employment . '
With gold out of the way , we 've arrived at the financial landscape we see today .
The central bank has flooded the world with liquidity , creating the housing bust with record levels of foreclosures , raising the prices of consumer goods , and fostering multibillion - dollar bailouts .
Instead of taking a close look at what the Fed does , most commentators never bother to question its existence .
In good times and bad , they clamor for more Fed liquidity .
When problems linger , they call on government to take ' bold action ' -- a Bush New Deal , perhaps -- and get the economy running again .
That interventionism has always failed is irrelevant .
That we pay a heavy price in lost liberty is never mentioned .
In the days before the Fed , recessions were allowed to self - correct and consequently did n't last long .
They could 've been avoided altogether if government had enforced property rights and defended depositors who had been robbed through fractional reserve banking .
Instead , government gave us the Fed , a cartel in which fractional reserve banking has been enshrined as sound policy .
To quote Ron Paul from Gold , Peace , and Prosperity :
The central bank never set out to protect the integrity of our money .
In fact , the Fed set out to destroy it by institutionalizing inflation .
The gold coin standard was doomed and today 's inflation made inevitable the day the Federal Reserve was created . [ p. 46 ]
If we want real prosperity , we need real money .
We need to switch to a 100 percent reserve gold standard .
We need to free money from the grip of government , permanently and completely .
Although Louisiana holds a presidential primary on February 9 , the Republican Party chooses its delegates to the national convention with a two - step caucus / convention system .
The first round was held on January 22 , when approximately 10,000 Louisiana Republicans turned out to vote in eleven different cities for delegate to the state convention .
Each U.S. House district chose 15 delegates .
It appears that Ron Paul supporters outnumbered the supporters of any of his opponents .
But since this was predicted , the supporters of Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee , John McCain , and Mitt Romney , cooperated to set up a “ fusion ” slate of unpledged candidates for Delegate .
The “ fusion ” slate , labeled the “ Pro- Life / Pro-Family ” slate , beat the Ron Paul slate in each of the 7 U.S. House districts .
Formally , the “ fusion ” slate billed itself as an “ uncommitted ” slate , and no one really knows how many supporters of each presidential candidate are on the fusion slate , except the campaigns themselves .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The remains of two U.S. contractors who were kidnapped in Iraq have been found , FBI officials said Monday .
The bureau identified the two as Ronald Withrow of Roaring Springs , Texas , abducted on January 5 , 2007 , and John Roy Young of Kansas City , Missouri , who was captured on November 16 , 2006 .
Withrow worked for Las Vegas , Nevada - based JPI Worldwide Inc. , and Young worked for Crescent Security Group .
The FBI said it had notified the families of the contractors .
Meanwhile , four U.S. soldiers died Sunday night in a roadside bombing in Iraq , military officials reported , bringing the American toll in the 5 - year - old war to 4,000 deaths .
The four were killed when a homemade bomb hit their vehicle as they patrolled in a southern Baghdad neighborhood , the U.S. military headquarters in Iraq said .
A fifth soldier was wounded .
The grim milestone comes less than a week after the fifth anniversary of the start of the war .
" No casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , Marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , " said Rear Adm .
Gregory Smith , the U.S. military 's chief spokesman in Iraq .
" Every single loss of a soldier , sailor , airman or Marine is keenly felt by military commanders , families and friends both in theater and at home . "
Of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have died in attacks and fighting and 737 in nonhostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides .
Eight of those killed were civilians working for the Pentagon .
The numbers are based on Pentagon data counted by CNN .

President Bush made remarks about lives lost in Iraq at the State Department on Monday .
" One day , people will look back at this moment in history and say , ' Thank God there were courageous people willing to serve , because they laid the foundations for peace for generations to come , ' " he said .
" I have vowed in the past and I will vow so long as I 'm president to make sure that those lives were not lost in vain ; that , in fact , there 's an outcome that will merit the sacrifice that civilian and military alike have made . "
Also Sunday , at least 35 Iraqis died as the result of suicide bombings , mortar fire and the work of gunmen in cars who opened fire on a crowded outdoor market .
Nearly 100 were wounded in the violence .
Estimates of the Iraqi death toll since the war began range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands .

Another 2 million Iraqis have been forced to leave the country , and 2.5 million have been displaced from their homes within Iraq , according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees .
Many of the Iraqis and U.S. troops killed over the years , like the four soldiers slain Sunday in Baghdad , have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have come to symbolize Iraq 's tenacious insurgency .
Watch how the bombs have become a deadly staple »
The Pentagon 's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization has been developed to counter the threat of roadside bombs in Iraq as well as Afghanistan .
The group calls such bombs the " weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists . "
Nearly 160,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq , and the war has cost U.S. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the House Budget Committee .
Senior U.S. military officials are preparing to recommend to Bush a four - to six - week pause in additional troop withdrawals from Iraq after the last of the so - called surge brigades leaves in July , CNN learned last week from U.S. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to talk about them .
The return of all five brigades added to the Iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000 but still leave about 130,000 or more troops in Iraq .
Also Monday , the U.S. military said six people killed in a weekend attack were " terrorists " and not members of an American - backed militia , as initially reported .
Those first reports suggested the area of Saturday 's helicopter strike may have been a Sons of Iraq checkpoint .
Such groups are generically referred to as Awakening Councils -- largely Sunni security forces that the U.S. military have recruited .
A police official in the north - central city of Samarra said the helicopter mistakenly hit a Sons of Iraq checkpoint , killing the six .
But the U.S. military said that it believes those killed were not part of the Sons of Iraq .
" I can tell you that two of these individuals were fiddling with something on the side of the road and trying to hide themselves under a blanket when they heard the helicopter , " said Maj .
Bradford Leighton .
" The location of the checkpoint was not at or near any known Sons of Iraq checkpoint . "
A joint Iraqi-U.S. - led coalition force is investigating the deaths .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Google Inc closed its $ 3.1 billion acquisition of online ad delivery company DoubleClick Inc on Tuesday , just hours after the deal won unconditional approval from the European Commission .
In this file photo a woman walks past a banner of Google inside a campus as Lee Kai - fu , vice - president of Google Inc. and co-president of Google China , holds a talk at the University of Hong Kong September 14 , 2006 .
Google Inc plans to make an unspecified number of job cuts at DoubleClick Inc following the closing of its $ 3.1 billion acquisition of the advertising technology company , Google said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
The approval came despite objections from rivals and privacy advocates and followed an in - depth investigation by European competition officials .
The merger , announced a year ago , was given a go - ahead by U.S. antitrust authorities late last year .
The European Commission , the European Union ’s executive arm , said the companies operate in different parts of the online advertising world and their deal was not a marriage of rivals .
“ Google and DoubleClick were not exerting major competitive constraints on each other ’s activities and could , therefore , not be considered as competitors at the moment , ” it said .
Google has by far the strongest position in Web searching in Europe .
That gives it an edge on the simple ads it sells , which appear on its search pages .
DoubleClick deals with fancy display ads that it delivers to many kinds of Web sites .
DoubleClick supplies the technology used in what is known as “ ad serving , ” which allows advertisers to target potential customer and measure how well their ads are received .
Its services are a boon to Web site owners who fill the blank space on Web pages with brand adverting delivered by DoubleClick .
Ad serving funnels the advertising of clients to one of several ad networks , such as Google ’s AdSense , which act as auctioneers connecting buyers and sellers of ads and ad space .
The Google - DoubleClick deal drew opposition from rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc .
The European Commission said once Google and DoubleClick combine , they will still be unable to marginalize other ad servers that have become attractive to big technology players .
The online ad industry rapidly consolidated last year .
Microsoft bought aQuantive for $ 6 billion , Yahoo bought BlueLithium for $ 300 million , and Time Warner Inc ’s AOL unit bought Tacoda for an undisclosed amount .
Privacy advocates complained that the Google - DoubleClick deal would allow the companies to combine their different methods of gathering information about the habits of Web surfers .
One opponent characterized the gathering of information as a form of market power -- the ability of a company to raise prices or damage competitors .
The European Commission ’s statement sought to play down the concerns , saying the deal was unlikely to have harmful effects on consumers , at least in the markets it considered .
The commission and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said privacy was outside the scope of a competition review .
The commission ’s statement on Tuesday had nothing to say about privacy .
One privacy advocate , the Center for Digital Democracy in Washington , said the FTC and the European Commission must think about the Web in a different way .
“ U.S. and European policymakers must reform the antitrust process to reflect the realities of the digital market era , where competition , data collection and content creation are seamlessly intertwined , ” it said in a statement .

Many claim to have found the answer to keeping the mind active , from crosswords and Sudoku to plenty of exercise and cold showers .
But now it seems the secret may lie in our lifestyle and what we eat to fuel our bodies .
Dark chocolate and plenty of cold meat for breakfast top the list for boosting grey matter , researchers suggest , while sex is essential for keeping the brain fit in later life .
Those wishing to improve their mental power should avoid smoking cannabis , watching soap operas and hanging out with those who moan .
But cuddling a baby , cheating at homework , reading out loud and doing a business degree at university are all good for an efficient mind .
The theories , based on research from experts around the world , are contained in the book Teach Yourself : Training Your Brain .
Author Terry Horne , a business lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire , said : " What we eat and drink , how we learn at school and what type of moods we have are all crucial .
" People can make lifestyle choices that will constantly increase our cognitive capacity throughout our adult lives . "
The book contains mental exercises and radical thinking on how diet , the environment , stress and other aspects of modern life affect our mental capacity .
It claims sex has a positive impact , listing seven chemical reactions the brain undergoes during intercourse which improve its functioning ability .
For instance , raised levels of oxytocin - or the " trust " hormone - increase a person 's readiness to think of novel or risky solutions to a problem .
Elements in dark chocolate - also prove beneficial .
Magnesium and antioxidant chemicals increase the supply of oxygen to the brain and reduce the chances of brain damage through a stroke .
Ditching a low - fat diet is also recommended to boost performance .
The book suggests a breakfast of eggs , fish or cold meat , a lunch of protein - based foods such as oily fish and dark green vegetables , and carbohydrates for dinner - but not caffeine , alcohol or red meat .
Children should not do homework on their own - minds function better when working with parents or classmates .
It also says that speaking in front of a class helps pupils because of the repetition involved .
And adults can boost memory by counting aloud to 99 in threes as fast as they can .
The book recommends that readers should seek a concept known as BLISS - Body - based pleasure , Laughter , Involvement , Satisfaction and Sex - which all enable the mind to perform well .
Mr Horne added :
" Mix with people who make you laugh , have a good sense of humour or who share the same interests as you , and avoid people who whinge , whine and complain , as people who are negative will make you depressed . "

We found that the atom was made of smaller pieces called subatomic particles -- most notably the proton , neutron , and electron .
However , experiments conducted in the second half of the 20th century with " atom smashers , " or particle accelerators , revealed that the subatomic structure of the atom was much more complex .
Particle accelerators can take a particle , such as an electron , speed it up to near the speed of light , collide it with an atom and thereby discover its internal parts .
In this article , we will look at these amazing devices and how the results they obtain tell us about the fundamental structure of matter , the forces holding it together and the origins of the universe !

Smashing Atoms Side view of a collision of two gold beams in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider Photo courtesy Brookhaven National Laboratory
In the 1930s , scientists investigated cosmic rays .
When these highly energetic particles ( protons ) from outer space hit atoms of lead ( i.e. nuclei of the atoms ) , many smaller particles were sprayed out .
These particles were not protons or neutrons , but were much smaller .
Therefore , scientists concluded that the nucleus must be made of smaller , more elementary particles .
The search began for these particles .
At that time , the only way to collide highly energetic particles with atoms was to go to a mountaintop where cosmic rays were more common , and conduct the experiments there .
However , physicists soon built devices called particle accelerators , or atom smashers .
In these devices , you accelerate particles to high speeds -- high kinetic energies -- and collide them with target atoms .
The resulting pieces from the collision , as well as emitted radiation , are detected and analyzed .
The information tells us about the particles that make up the atom and the forces that hold the atom together .
A particle accelerator experiment has been described as determining the structure of a television by looking at the pieces after it has been dropped from the Empire State Building .

Let 's see how a particle accelerator works !
A Particle Accelerator
Did you know that you have a type of particle accelerator in your house right now ?
In fact , you are probably reading this article with one !
The cathode ray tube ( CRT ) of any TV or computer monitor is really a particle accelerator . " " The CRT takes particles ( electrons ) from the cathode , speeds them up and changes their direction using electromagnets in a vacuum and then smashes them into phosphor molecules on the screen .
The collision results in a lighted spot , or pixel , on your TV or computer monitor .

A particle accelerator works the same way , except that they are much bigger , the particles move much faster ( near the speed of light ) and the collision results in more subatomic particles and various types of nuclear radiation .
Particles are accelerated by electromagnetic waves inside the device , in much the same way as a surfer gets pushed along by the wave .
The more energetic we can make the particles , the better we can see the structure of matter .
It 's like breaking the rack in a billiards game .
When the cue ball ( energized particle ) speeds up , it receives more energy and so can better scatter the rack of balls ( release more particles ) .
Particle accelerators come in two basic types : Linear - Particles travel down a long , straight track and collide with the target .
Circular - Particles travel around in a circle until they collide with the target . " " Aerial view of the SLAC linear accelerator :
The linac is underground and traced in white .

In linear accelerators , particles travel in a vacuum down a long , copper tube .
The electrons ride waves made by wave generators called klystrons .
Electromagnets keep the particles confined in a narrow beam .
When the particle beam strikes a target at the end of the tunnel , various detectors record the events -- the subatomic particles and radiation released .
These accelerators are huge , and are kept underground .
An example of a linear accelerator is the linac at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory ( SLAC ) in California , which is about 1.8 miles ( 3 km ) long . " " Schematic diagram of a cyclotron Photo courtesy SLAC Circular accelerators do essentially the same jobs as linacs .
However , instead of using a long linear track , they propel the particles around a circular track many times .
At each pass , the magnetic field is strengthened so that the particle beam accelerates with each consecutive pass .
When the particles are at their highest or desired energy , a target is placed in the path of the beam , in or near the detectors .
Circular accelerators were the first type of accelerator invented in 1929 .
In fact , the first cyclotron ( shown below ) was only 4 inches ( 10 cm ) in diameter .
Lawrence 's cyclotron used two D - shaped magnets ( called Dee ) separated by a small gap .
The magnets produced a circular magnetic field .
An oscillating voltage created an electric field across the gap to accelerate the particles ( ions ) each time around .
As the particles moved faster , the radius of the their circular path became bigger until they hit the target on the outermost circle .
Lawrence 's cyclotron was effective , but could not reach the energies that modern circular accelerators do .
" " Aerial view of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) Photo courtesy Fermilab Modern circular accelerators place klystrons and electromagnets around a circular copper tube to speed up particles .
Many circular accelerators also have a short linac to accelerate the particles initially before entering the ring .
An example of a modern circular accelerator is the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) in Illinois , which stretches almost 10 square miles ( 25.6 square km ) .
Let 's take a look inside a particle accelerator .
Inside a Particle Accelerator Photo courtesy SLAC
All particle accelerators , whether linacs or circular , have the following basic parts : Particle source - provides the particles that will be accelerated
Copper tube - the particle beam travels in a vacuum inside this tube
Klystrons - microwave generators that make the waves on which the particles ride
Electromagnets ( conventional , superconducting ) - keep the particles confined to a narrow beam while they are travelling in the vacuum , and also steer the beam when necessary
Targets - what the accelerated particles collide with
Detectors - devices that look at the pieces and radiation thrown out from the collision
Vacuum systems - remove air and dust from the tube of the accelerator
Cooling systems - remove the heat generated by the magnets
Computer / electronic systems - control the operation of the accelerator and analyze the data from the experiments
Shielding - protects the operators , technicians and public from the radiation generated by the experiments
Monitoring systems - closed - circuit television and radiation detectors to see what happens inside the accelerator ( for safety purposes )
Electrical power system - provides electricity for the entire device
Storage rings - store particle beams temporarily when not in use
In the next sections , we will examine these parts in detail , focusing on a linear accelerator like the one at SLAC .

Particle Source , Copper Tube and Klystrons Schematic diagram of the electron gun of SLAC 's linac Photo courtesy SLAC Particle Source
The particle source provides the particles that are to be accelerated .
Particles can be electrons , protons , positrons ( the first antimatter particle -- like an electron , but positively charged ) , ions , and nuclei of heavy atoms such as gold .
At SLAC , an electron gun uses a laser to knock electrons off the surface of a semiconductor .
The electrons then enter the accelerator portion of the linac .
At SLAC , positrons can be made by firing an electron beam at tungsten .
In the collision , electron - positron pairs are made .
The positrons can be accelerated by reversing the directions of the electric and magnetic fields within the accelerator .
Advertisement Advertisement Copper Tube " " Cavities in the copper tube Photo courtesy SLAC
The major structure of the particle accelerator is the copper tube .
The copper tube has a strong vacuum inside through which the particles travel .
The tubes are made of copper because copper conducts electricity and magnetism very well .
At the SLAC linac , the copper tube is made of more than 80,000 copper cylinders brazed together for more than 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) !
The copper tube is arranged to form a series of cells called cavities .
The spacing of the cavities is matched to the wavelength of the microwaves .
The spacing allows the electric and magnetic fields to repeat their pattern every three cavities .
Electrons or positrons in the beam come through the cavities in small bunches .
The arrival of each bunch is timed so that it gets a push from the electric field across the cavities . " " Diagram of klystron , waveguide and copper tube of the linac Photo courtesy SLAC Klystrons Klystrons make microwaves , much like a kitchen microwave oven except that the klystrons ' microwaves are about 1 million times more powerful .
Klystrons produce microwaves by way of an electron gun .
The electrons travel through the klystron in cavities , where their speed is regulated .
As the electrons change speed in the klystron , they give off radiation in the form of microwaves .
The microwaves are conducted through copper waveguides to the copper tube of the accelerator .
Waveguides carry waves efficiently without losing intensity .
The klystron and waveguides are kept under high vacuum to ease the flow of the waves .
Magnets , Targets and Detectors " " Magnets are used to confine the particle beam .
Photo courtesy SLAC " " Magnets are arranged with opposite poles to confine the particle beam .
Photo courtesy SLAC Magnets Magnets , either conventional electromagnets or superconducting magnets , are placed along the accelerator tube at regular intervals .
These magnets keep the particle beam confined and focused .
Imagine that the particle beam is like shot pellets fired from a shotgun shell .
Typically , the pellets ( electrons ) tend to spread out .
If the pellets are spread out , then they do not make many collisions within the narrow area of the target .
However , if the pellets are confined by an external force ( magnetism ) to a narrow path , then they will make many collisions in the narrow target area .
The more collisions , the more events that can be observed in any one experiment .
Advertisement Advertisement
The magnets generate a field within their core .
There is no magnetic force in the center where the electrons travel .
If the electrons stray from the center , they will feel a magnetic push back into the middle .
By arranging the magnets in a series of alternating poles , the electrons can remain confined down the length of the tube .
Targets Targets vary with the type of experiment .
Some targets can be thin sheets of metal foil .
In some experiments , beams of different particles ( electrons , positrons ) collide with each other inside the detectors .
Detectors
The detectors are one of the most important pieces of equipment in the accelerator .
They see the particles and the radiation after the collision .
Detectors come in many types , from bubble and cloud chambers to solid - state electronic detectors .
A collider laboratory may have several types of detectors located at various parts of the accelerator .
For example , a bubble chamber contains a liquid gas , such as liquid hydrogen .
As the particles released from the collision pass through the chamber , they vaporize some of the liquid , leaving a bubble trail as shown below .
A cloud chamber detector has a saturated vapor inside the chamber .
As an energetic particle passes through the vapor , the vapor is ionized , producing a trail much like the one made by a jet moving through a cloud ( see " Why do those long white clouds form behind jets flying high overhead ? " for details ) .
One detector at SLAC is the SLAC Large Detector ( SLD ) .
The SLD is a large , barrel - shaped , solid - state detector that stands more than six stories tall and weighs more than 4,000 tons !
SLD is a multi- layered detector .
Each layer sees a different event : " " Inside SLD Photo courtesy SLAC Vertex detector - detects position of tracks of particles
Drift chamber - detects positions of charged particles at several points along their tracks .
Curved tracks reveal the momentum of the particle ( related to its mass and velocity ) .
Cerenkov detector - sees radiation given off by rapidly moving particles and determines the particles ' velocity
Liquid argon calorimeter - stops most of the particles and measures their energy
Warm iron calorimeter - detects muons ( one of the subatomic particles )
Magnetic coil - separates the two calorimeters
For details on the workings of each part , see SLAC Virtual Visitor Center : Detectors .
Vacuum and Cooling Systems Cooling tubes through the copper structure of the linac Photo courtesy SLAC Vacuum Systems Vacuums must be kept in accelerators for two reasons : to prevent sparking caused by microwaves in air , which would damage waveguide and accelerator structures
to prevent loss of energy that would occur if the beam collided with air molecules A combination of rotary pumps and cold traps are used to maintain the low vacuum ( one- millionth of an atmosphere ) .
Rotary pumps work like fans to remove air .
Cold traps use liquid gases ( usually nitrogen ) to cool the surface of the trap .
Any air or dust molecule will be attracted to the cold surface and removed from the tube .
Cold traps must be kept cold or else they will release the collected dust and air molecules .
Advertisement Advertisement " " Cooling tubes through a magnet Photo courtesy SLAC Cooling Systems
The electric currents passing through the copper tubing in the accelerator produce vast amounts of heat .
This heat must be removed for two reasons : to prevent the copper tubing from melting - this would destroy the structure
to prevent the copper tubing from expanding - this would break the vacuum seals
The SLAC linac has tubes of water to cool the copper tubing of the accelerator structure and the magnets .
The cooling water is circulated to cooling towers above ground to remove the heat .
Any superconducting magnets get cooled with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium .
Because the linac is underground , there is less chance of seasonal heating and cooling .
Atom Smasher Computers and Electronics Wide - angle view of the control room of a particle accelerator Photo courtesy Fermilab Computers and electronic systems do several tasks in the operation of a particle accelerator : control the particle source , klystrons and magnets used in accelerating the particles
monitor the beam
collect and record the data from the experiments
analyze the data
monitor the safety systems
shut down the system in the event of an emergency Particle accelerators have many computers that control the system .
These computers generally have the highest - speed microprocessors available , with large amounts of computer memory and data storage .
These computers are often networked together .
In some cases , computer data analyses may be done by on - or off - site supercomputers .

Shielding , Monitors , Power and Storage
The main ring is located inside a concrete tunnel underground .

Because accelerated particles are forced to change speeds , change directions or hit targets , they lose energy .
This energy is often in the form of ionizing radiation like x-rays or gamma rays .
In addition to radiation , energized particles themselves present a hazard to human health .
To prevent leakage of radiation while the accelerators are in operation , they are shielded .
Accelerator structures are often located in concrete tunnels underground .
The concrete and the earth shield the environment .
Technicians are not in the tunnels when the accelerators are operating , and control rooms are shielded with concrete .
In addition , workers wear radiation badges and are monitored constantly .
Particle accelerators in the United States fall under the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which licenses their use and regularly inspects them for safety .
If the accelerator is affiliated with a university , the university 's radiation safety office also participates in this process .
Monitors
The tunnels are often equipped with closed circuit televisions to monitor the equipment and gauges within the accelerator .
Radiation detectors are located throughout the accelerator structures to monitor for leakage in the shielding and protect the workers .
Advertisement Advertisement Electrical Power Systems
As you can guess from our description of the equipment , particle accelerators use a lot of electricity .
In some places , this is supplied through the local power company .
Some accelerators have their own electric generators on - site .
Storage Rings
Because it takes so much effort to accelerate particles for an experiment , many accelerators have storage rings .
Storage rings maintain a beam that has already been accelerated .
For example , if you are colliding an electron beam with a positron beam , you may have to keep one beam in storage while you accelerate the other .
A storage ring has the same components as the main accelerator but with fewer klystrons .
The particles travel around the ring at the accelerated speed , needing only one or two klystrons to compensate for any lost energy as the beam changes directions .
Now that we 've seen what 's inside an accelerator , let 's see what can we learn from these devices .
Subatomic Particles Standard model of the atom Photo courtesy Fermilab
With all of this technology , what have we learned about the structure of matter ?
When physicists first began using accelerators in the 1950s and1960s , they discovered hundreds of particles smaller than the three well - known subatomic particles -- protons , neutrons and electrons .
As bigger accelerators were built , ones that could provide higher energy beams , more particles were found .
Most of these particles exist for only fractions ( less than a billionth ) of a second , and some particles combine to form more stable composite particles .
Some particles are involved in the forces that hold the nucleus of the atom together , and some are not .
In examining this complicated picture , a standard model of the atom has emerged .
According to this model , matter can be divided into the following building blocks : Advertisement Advertisement Fermions - subatomic particles that make known matter and antimatter matter leptons - elementary particles that do not participate in holding the nucleus together ( examples - electron , neutrino ) quarks - elementary particles that do participate in holding the nucleus together anti-matter - counter - particles of quarks and leptons ( anti-quarks , anti-leptons )
Hadrons - composite particles ( examples - proton , neutron )
Bosons - particles that carry forces ( four known types )
In the next section , we 'll delve into the details of each of these subatomic particles .
Forces
There are four fundamental forces or interactions : Strong - holds the nucleus of the atom together
Weak - involved in - involved in radioactive decay
Electromagnetism - interactions between charged particles ( electricity and magnetism )
Gravity - attractive force based on mass and distance
Fermions : Matter and Anti-matter Fermions distinguish between matter ( leptons and quarks ) and anti-matter .
Leptons Leptons are extremely small particles ( less than 10 - 15 m radius ) that have no known size or internal structure .
They have tiny masses , travel very fast and are best described by wave functions .
The best known examples of leptons are the electron and the neutrino .
The leptons have been classified into : Advertisement Advertisement electron - electron neutrino
muon - muon neutrino
tau - tau neutrino Quarks Quarks are extremely small particles ( less than 10 - 15 m radius ) that participate in the strong nuclear force .
Isolated ( single ) quarks have never been found , probably because they combine with each other so quickly .
Quarks also have fractional electric charges .
They are classified as follows : down ( d ) - charge = - 1/3
up ( u ) - charge = +2/3
strange ( s ) - charge = - 1/3
charm ( c ) - charge = +2/3
bottom ( b ) - charge = - 1/3
top ( t ) - charge = +2/3 ( most massive , discovered in 1995 ) As of now , quarks are thought to be the most fundamental particles .
Antimatter Not much is known about antimatter .
The first anti-matter particle discovered was the positron , which has a mass similar to an electron but with a positive charge .
This area of particle physics is currently under investigation .
Hadrons , Bosons and the Big Bang Hadrons
These particles are combinations of quarks .
They have mass and reside in the nucleus .
The two most common examples of hadrons are protons and neutrons , and each is a combination of three quarks : Proton = 2 up quarks + 1 down quark [ +1 charge on proton = ( + 2/3 ) + ( + 2/3 ) + ( - 1/3 ) ]
Neutron = 2 down quarks + 1 up quark [ 0 charge on neutron = ( - 1/3 ) + ( - 1/3 ) + ( + 2/3 ) ]
Bosons
These particles are thought to be exchanged when forces occur .
A force is defined as a push or pull .
But that does not tell us what it really is or how it is mediated .
Richard Feynman suggested that forces occur when two particles exchange a boson , or gauge particle .
Think of two people on roller skates :
If one person throws a ball and the other one catches it , they will be pushed in opposite directions .
In this analogy , the skaters are the fundamental particles , the ball is the force carrier and the repulsion is the force .
In the case of particles , we see the force , the effect , but not the exchange .

There are four known bosons : Gluon - mediates the strong force , but only operates over distances of 10 - 13 cm
W and Z - mediate the weak force ( 1/10,000 strong force ) , but only operate over distances of 10 - 15 cm
Photon - mediates electromagnetic force ( 1/137 strong force ) and operates over an infinite distance A fifth gauge particle ( graviton ) has been proposed , but has not yet been found .
The graviton is thought to mediate gravity , which is 10 - 39 strong force and operates over an infinite distance .
Historically , James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism in the 19th century .
As physicists have constructed more powerful accelerators with higher temperatures and energies , they have seen that certain forces come together , or unify .
Particle - accelerator experiments have shown that the electromagnetic force and the weak force can be combined into the electroweak force .
Many physicists believe that all of the forces stem from one force that existed long ago .
Theories attempting to unite the forces are called unified theories or grand unified theories ( GUT ) .
It is hoped that GUTs will tell us what the universe may have been like in its beginnings .
Because accelerator experiments have simulated what are thought to be the conditions that existed just fractions of a second after the Big Bang , they may provide evidence to support or refute various GUTs .
According to the Big Bang theory : Prior to the Big Bang , the universe was extremely hot and small and matter existed only as free quarks .
Once the explosion happened : Rapid inflation occurred and the universe cooled .
Quarks combined into hadrons .
The forces separated .
Matter ( atoms ) formed .
Matter condensed into galaxies , stars , etc .
By making bigger and bigger particle accelerators , physicists can simulate the conditions that existed within 10 - 43 seconds of the Big Bang !
Quick , which is smaller : 298,548 or 298,000 ?
If you picked 298,548 , you 're not alone .
That 's the ol ' precision heuristic in price magnitude judgments doing its thing .
A recent study from Cornell University suggests that because we tend to use precise numbers for small amounts and round off very large numbers ( lots of zeros ) , sellers can actually con consumers into thinking a price is smaller than it is by replacing those zeros with other digits .
To prove this point , the authors gathered a bunch of people together and then flashed some house listings with various prices in front of them .
They then asked their subjects which prices seemed high or low and found that very precise prices , like $ 391,534 , were actually seen as cheaper than round ones like $ 390,000 .
Intrigued , the authors when out to look for more evidence of this warped magnitude effect .
After examining 27,000 real - estate transactions , they discovered that having at least one zero at the end of the list price lowered the final sale price by about 0.72 percent compared with houses listed at a similar price .
Three zeros lowered it by 0.73 percent .
And each additional zero lowered it another 0.39 percent .
The lesson ?
Whether you 're selling your house or pawning something off on Craigslist , the more precise the price , the better the deal you 're likely to get .

At one point or another , you ’ve probably heard the speculation that once the Boomers start selling their stocks and mutual funds to support their retirement , the flood of sales will cause the market to crash .
That ’s plain wrong : the Boomers were born over a period of 18 years , and they will retire over a similar span ; moreover , most of them will not start cashing in their stocks immediately .
Most people , evidence shows , wait to break into their 401 ( k ) s until they have to .
David Wise , the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research ’s aging program , has , along with his colleagues , run multiple models looking at what will happen as the Boomers sell out , and he believes the effect will likely be modest .
But the outlook for equity markets is cloudy nonetheless .
The problem is more basic : stock prices reflect both a company ’s current earnings and its expected growth in earnings .
A high price - to - earnings ratio means investors expect fast growth in future earnings .
If you think economic growth is going to slow , the stock market looks overvalued today .
Historically , stocks in aggregate have tended to trade at P/E ratios between 12 and 20 .
Right now , the P / Es of the three major indexes are on the high end of that range , implying the expectation of faster - than - usual economic growth .
That sort of growth will be awfully difficult to achieve as the Boomers retire — and the problem could persist for decades .
It is possible that , as the Yale economist Irving Fisher infamously said in 1929 , “ Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau . ”
Many analysts have joined the debate over whether the Baby Boomers have saved enough for retirement .
Optimists tend to look at the amount Boomers have saved relative to their incomes , compared with how much their parents had saved at the same age .
But Boomers are living longer , so they will need more money than their parents did .
And even with the new prescription - drug benefit , they can expect to spend more on health care .
Perhaps most important , the Baby Boomers have fewer children .
My grandmother has one daughter living nearby to help with shopping , another ( my mother ) overseeing her finances , and a third who is only a plane - flight away in case of emergency ; when my grandfather was dying , my mother drove up to Newark for weeks at a time .
My parents ’ familial support network will be thinner : divorced and living in different cities , they will have to share the same two daughters .
Given the vicissitudes of the modern economy , neither child may be living nearby when help is required .
This is demographically typical , which means that not only will the Boomers be paying for help that family used to provide , they will also have fewer people to call on for financial assistance .
Despite all that , the Boomers themselves are remarkably optimistic about their prospects .
A 2004 survey by the AARP showed that a solid majority are confident of their ability to prepare financially for retirement , which may be why 69 percent of them say that they are fairly or very optimistic about the future .
More than 70 percent of them think that they will work at least part - time , but only a quarter expect to do so because they need the money ; more are expecting to fulfill dreams of entrepreneurship or just to use work to break up the routine of grandkids , travel , and bingo .

We mistakenly described nitrous oxide , one of the byproducts of an engine powered by liquid hydrogen , as being environmentally safe in the article below .
It is a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide .
However , the developer , Reaction Engines , has a research project under way to devise ways of eliminating or capturing all of the NOX elements produced by the fuel .
The artist 's impression looks like something out of a science fiction film .
But a hypersonic passenger plane that could fly to Australia from northern Europe in less than five hours has been designed in Britain .
With funding from the European Space Agency , a team of engineers and scientists has come up with the A2 , a plane they believe could carry 300 passengers at a top speed of more than 3,000 mph .
The project is part of an EU drive to push forward the boundaries of air travel .
Scientists were asked to find out if it was possible to build a commercial plane that used the sort of technology more closely associated with travel to the edge of space and beyond .
Oxfordshire - based Reaction Engines designs and develops space transport and hi-tech propulsion systems .
Its directors are experts in fields ranging from space rockets and weapons systems to nuclear power .
One of the firm 's main projects is the development of Skylon , an unpiloted reusable spaceplane intended to provide inexpensive and reliable access to space , which is expected to take approximately 10 years to develop and be capable of transporting 12 tonnes of cargo into space .
Alan Bond , a senior engineer and managing director at the company , said the A2 could be operating within 25 years if there was demand for it .
Bond said : " The A2 is designed to leave Brussels international airport , fly quietly and subsonically out into the north Atlantic at mach 0.9 before reaching mach 5 across the North Pole and heading over the Pacific to Australia .
" The flight time from Brussels to Australia , allowing for air traffic control , would be four hours 40 minutes .
It sounds incredible by today 's standards but I do n't see why future generations can't make day trips to Australasia . "
Reaction Engines estimates that the cost of the flight would be similar to a current first class fare .
Moreover , the company claims , the plane would not leave much of a carbon footprint .
The key to the design is the fuel it would use .
Conventional fuels would not be able to get the A2 up to the
necessary speed , and so Reaction Engines has designed an engine that would run on liquid hydrogen .
A spin -off is that liquid hydrogen is potentially much greener than conventional fuel - rather than producing vast amounts of carbon emissions it gives off water vapour and nitrous oxide .
Another advantage of the design is that while the 132 metre-long A2 is much bigger than conventional jets it would be lighter than a Boeing 747 and could land on current airport runways .
But there are a few hitches .
For one thing , the A2 might not be great for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia , as it does not have portholes .
The heat generated by travelling so quickly makes it difficult to install windows that are secure and not too heavy .
One solution Reaction Engines has proposed is to install flat screen panels where the window would be , showing images of the scene outside .
In recent days the design has been discussed excitedly on science and environment talkboards .
Some believe it would be too expensive to produce commercially .
There is also concern that producing the liquid hydrogen could prove to be more environmentally damaging than Reaction Engines believes .
And there are fears that because the plane would fly at around the height of the ozone layer it could cause damage to the atmosphere .
Still , Bond said that within 25 years 10 % of air travel could be hypersonic .
Some routes , such as Europe to India , would not work so well , because the plane would have to go a long way round to avoid having to travel at supersonic speeds over populated areas .
But he thought the A2 could get to California by travelling hypersonically across the Atlantic , then conventionally across the US .
Reaction Engines claims it would be quieter than Concorde ever was .
Bond accepted the project was still at the early exploratory stages .
The next phase is more work on the A2's environmental impact .
" Our work shows that it is possible technically ; now it 's up to the world to decide if it wants it . "
Explainer : Concorde 's legacy
The owner of the first hypersonic airline will have to overcome the failed legacy of Concorde , which made its last passenger flight nearly five years ago .
British Airways and Air France grounded the supersonic service after a decline in bookings and a series of technical problems .
The root cause of its failure - low passenger demand - is a warning to all backers of futuristic aviation projects .
Despite the benefits of a three - and - a - half hour flight time , its owners struggled to convince enough customers to pay £ 6,800 for a return ticket from London to New York .
The economic considerations were also underpinned by serious doubts over safety following a crash in Paris eight years ago in which 113 people died .
Chris Tarry , an aviation industry analyst , said a hypersonic jet service would be many times more expensive and would raise serious questions about passengers ' ability to withstand sub-orbital travel .
Similar concerns helped ground the Hotol hypersonic passenger jet project run by BAe , the defence company , more than a decade ago .
" Is this a commercial means of travel ?
No .
You have to have something that is viable , " said Tarry .

Late last night word started circulating that Sony 's suits decided that delivering crapware - free PCs was a great idea , particularly if they could get consumers to pay $ 50 for a PC free of the bloat .
For the uninitiated , " crapware " is the loving term we give to all the useless and often quite irritating software that comes pre-installed on a new PC .
ISPs software , anti-virus software that wo n't work in 60 days , pointless " media players " and " managers " are just some of the examples of software that are routinely uninstalled on new PCs we receive in the lab .
It 's a real pain , and sometimes these crappy programs cause you problems .
We learned at 2007 's International CES , straight from Michael Dell himself , that " crapware " generates significant revenue for the PC industry , accounting for some $ 60 of revenue per machine at Dell .
In an industry with razor - thin margins , it 's not hard to see why crapware is popular with OEMs like Dell and Sony .
Not everyone can rake in Apple - like margins on computer hardware ( of course , Apple is better on crapware than most , too ) .
Engadget last night reported that Sony was going to allow consumers a " Fresh Start " for $ 50 , an option to pay Sony for the pleasure of not having a lot of useless junk installed on your PC .
Readers across the Internet were incensed to see Sony try and monetize this , although a lesser contingent were open to the possibility .
We reached out to Sony , and the grinding gears eventually spit out an oracular response : they 've already killed the charges for " Fresh Start . "
A spokesperson said that " Fresh Start " will be a " no charge " option for some laptops .
" Fresh Start " will not be available on all computers ordered from Sony , however .
We can only guess that the company still relies on the profits from crapware across some of its desktop and laptops lines , and therefore will only be offering " Fresh Start " on select , higher - end systems like those running Windows Vista Business Edition .
Ed Bott , also covering the story , had a chance to talk Sony 's Mike Abary , senior VP of the VAIO division .
According to Abary , the whole thing was the result of an internal miscommunication and should have never happened in the first place .
I find that explanation difficult to believe .
Sony is a giant company , so anything is possible , but the checks and balances that should be in place ought to prevent a $ 50 price tag being accidentally applied to something that 's supposed to be free .
In either case , the reaction online appears to have only encouraged Sony to move quickly and kill the program 's fees .
One wonders if it will also kill the spread of the program to other PCs and notebooks in the future .
We 're guessing the answer is " yes . "
Obligatory plug for the PC - De-crapifyer .
1 . We are here at Ruby conf 2007 in Charlotte North Carolina .
I am here with Evan Phoenix of the Rubinius Project .
How about we get started with you introducing yourself , what you do , how you got to Rubinius ?
Sure .
Right now I am employed by Engineyard who has graciously allowed me to work on Rubinius .
Originally I was working about 50 % of the time on Rubinius and 50 % of the time on support issues for them .
In the intervening months I moved more and more working on Rubinius , currently it 's about 100 % Rubinius right now .
2 . How did you get started with Rubinius ?
Did you get started with Smalltalk ?
It all started a few years ago when I was working at a project called Sydney , which got me interested in how the Ruby interpreter was working .
I went and actually did a big clean up of the existing interpreter , learnt the internals and found that there was a lot of hairy corners , and there were a lot of things that I felt like I wanted to experiment with .
So I started to write little experiments here and there .
I got to a certain point where the experiments outgrew the existing architecture , and it was about then that I thought maybe I could write my own Ruby interpreter and that 's where I took it from there .
I had been aware of Smalltalk and so I used it for a spring board during research , getting Smalltalk books , and immersing myself in that world trying to figure out how they solved similar problems .
Since then I ironically have never written any Smalltalk code for work , just playing around here and there , but I have a merely text book knowledge of it .
3 . Were you using Squeak Smalltalk or any other Smalltalks ?
Yes , I have experimented with Squeak , but that 's pretty much it .
In doing research and looking for ways for improving Rubinius I looked at other things : Smalltalk X is one , there are a lot of other Smalltalk implementations that you can find .
4. Strongtalk ?
Yes , Strongtalk .
Unfortunately the Strongtalk source is very hard to get into so I have used it not so much for taking code out of there but rather using it for ideas about how they solved some problems .
5 . Could you quickly explain the basics of Rubinius .
How does it relate to Smalltalk ?
What does it do ?
Sure , it uses the same architecture decisions as the first Smalltalk VMs , a lot of the current Smalltalk VMs use .
There are a couple of things : basically make everything first class , keep the internals of it very small and provide a very small number of primitive operations and build everything on top of it .
It 's not so much like a real Smalltalk , it 's architecturally similar .
6 . I think you based most of your work on Squeak Smalltalk .
Are other Smalltalks implement the same way , as I think they are implemented mostly in C , C ++?
There are some differences and unfortunately for the Smalltalk world , it is hard to find the source for a lot of Smalltalk VMs .
There are some that have been abandoned and you can find the source from Squeak being open source it is really easy to find a source for it .
But I have used documentation from things like Visual Works to describe , doing certain optimizations like stack frame allocation , and that kind of things , because they write those documents out .
And I have used those to get ideas for how to build up Rubinius .
7 . The basic VM of Rubinius is written in C .
Is that true ?
In the beginning there were plans for writing even the shotgun VM which is the VM written in C and Ruby , with a language called CUBY .
Yes it is written in C .
We never came with a good name for it , it was like CUBY and we talked about having a name for it .
Actually the eventual goal is to reduce the amount of C code that we have hand written and start to generate more C code .
We already do some kind of C meta programming in that we do things like we have two files that are in shotgun that when run as Ruby files output large snippets of C code which are included and that 's mainly for stuff like the primitives and for the instructions , which allows us to keep them organized and also to do some preprocessing on the actual code before it gets compiled .
A lot more pre processing that you can do with CPP and normal C preprocessor .
But as we move forward into the end of 1.0 and into 2.0 , whatever that might be , the aim is actually to stop writing C and build up that tool so we can really begin to write in it as much as you can in Ruby or Ruby - esque , and have it then output to C .
8. Cuby or whatever it is called , would that be Ruby with features cut ?
That 's funny , part of the reason we have n't used it is because I have n't decided on a really good implementation for it .
We have gone back and forth on how we think it should work .
Initially there was the idea that you would write some code and it will look just like normal Ruby and it would function exactly the same as normal Ruby , you could run it .
It could use all that core class stuff array bracket and fixnum plus and all that kind of thing , and we may still do that .
Another approach that I have been banging around is the idea that it would be syntactically correct Ruby , but it will in fact use a completely different hierarchy of classes , what you would actually do is call methods , do normal operations , but there is no real expectation that they are functioning on normal Ruby strings or Ruby arrays or fixnums they would actually be operating on totally different class hierarchy .
In that way you can go ahead and implement that class hierarchy in normal Ruby and still run this code , but then you can change the assumptions so that it is easier to generate the C code .
One thing that I struggled with initially about doing this was the ability to do type inference , the way I have written it required some fairly sophisticated type inference to try and generate the code and I could n't really get it working really well and that 's why I decided to handwrite the C for the time being .
So anything that we can do to make the type inference stage simpler is better .
Things like having Ruby code that looks like Ruby but has completely different assumptions lets us do things like assuming types about method names and maybe no operator overloading , so you can assume certain aspects of what the code implies .
9 . We just recently heard here at Ruby conf that you rewrote the Rubinius compiler that compiles Ruby source code to Rubinius byte code .
Can we talk about the motivations for that ?
Sure .
The compiler that we use now , which is sort of like ' Compiler One ' , grew out of my original prototype compiler .
That one ran on 1.8 and the idea was to just run and generate some kind of bytecode that we could then load into the shotgun VM that we were writing separately .
For about 6 months the only way to get code into Rubinius was actually to compile it in 1.8 and have it saved to a file and you could load that file into Rubinius , the compiler was n't working yet inside Rubinius .
It was cobbled together with my initial idea of what the compiler should look like .
They were all my initial assumptions and all my initial ideas .
In terms of a prototype means that it probably that more than half of them were wrong , just because it is a prototype .
And as we have gone further down the road I realized I have been uneasy with the stage that the compiler is at .
As we worked on more syntax and get to more edge cases , the compiler has started to increase in complexity none linear to the number of lines of code .
So every feature we add seems to add , like if there were 3 lines that we needed to add seems that the complexity has gone up like 2 x or 3 x .
There is something wrong with initial architecture .
So I took a step back and decided to reevaluate the architecture and that was why I have started to rewrite it .
Being a rewrite of the prototype it has gone fairly quickly because I can use the existing one as the basis for the new one .
10 .
Talking about compliers : there has been a discussion about supporting different languages on top of Rubinius .
What 's your impression of that , what 's your idea about that ?
I would love to .
In fact I have been talking with Ola Bini a few times about the ability of developing a simple Lisp that would run on top of the Rubinius VM .
I think that there is a real big , market is n't the right word , mindshare maybe , for the idea that you can do this based on the fact that the compiler is very approachable being all written in Ruby and if you can write some kind of parser for your language is very simple to use the built in compiler classes : we have some classes called " Assemblers " and " Encoders " to basically drive these two classes to generate bytecode for you .
So we are doing things like if you are compiling some new language and you decide " Ok , I need to call this method " it is very simple , we have a whole class hierarchy , we have a very fairly well defined interface of saying " Ok , I want to generate some bytecode that does these operations " .
That is very simple it 's all in Ruby .
So I think there is a big opportunity there for that to be pushed forward .
11 . How easy would it be , what would you have to do to create a new compiler ?
Could you do that at runtime ?
With irb ?
Or do you have to rebuild Rubinius ?
Either really .
I mean it being a normal built in class you have to require it , to bring in a complier which might not be available yet .
Then you can do things like if you decide that you want to create a system like a method directly , let 's say you decided that there are some operations that you want , some order of operations that you can't represent properly in Ruby , you can actually drive the assembler directly and say : " Send this method to this object and if that does n't work then jump to this bytecode " .
You can drive it all directly right there .
Because it is so simple it is very easy to write .
If you had a parser for a new language , we saw a demonstration of Packrat at Ruby Conf which is a PEG parser , you could easily have a Packrat kind of parser and as it was completing each thing it was actually calling the Rubinius assembler and say " Ok , I am doing this operation , I need you to call these methods " .
And it would build it up as it went through it .
Being fairly simple , it is not a very complicating process .
13 .
So there is no Ruby intepreter , there 's a bytecode interpreter ?
Yes I have played around with the idea of having an interpreter where it was actually one that was written entirely in Ruby and it would just basically live on top of the VM , the bytecode VM .
14 .
One of the interesting features you added is very fast debugging support .
Could you talk about how that works ?
Sure .
One thing is that Rubinius community unfortunately does n't have very good track record of using a debugger unlike like other programming languages and some people have attributed that fact to the debugger itself while debugging things , slows down the program you are debugging , like orders of magnitude .
And I know for a fact that other runtimes , even such as C , which is actually where I got the idea for the Rubinius debugger infrastructure , is able to do things , and even other Smalltalks ones can do things at totally false speed .
That is where I got the inspiration for it .
The way that it works is as follows : the current debugger in 1.8 , 1.9 sets a function to be called every time a certain operation occurs so that you can do things like every time a line is hit you can check " Oh am I supposed to break on this line ?
If so then run some stuff " .
Unfortunately that means that every line you have to be checking , should have been a breaking here .
The way around that is actually with a thing called bytecode replacement .
There is a special bytecode in Rubinius called " Invoked debugger " .
And whenever you want to set a break point you basically go find the method in question that you want to set , that is a completely different class , how to find it is a completely different problem .
Once you found it you can easily figure out which operations correspond to which line , or which method call or whatever you want to locate it .
And then you swap out the current instruction with the invoke debugger one and then you sit back and wait .
And what happens is when the VM is executing the bytecode and hits an invoke debugger it will actually send - Rubinius has this concept of channels in the VM , the channels control when threads run if a channel is empty and the thread is receive on it , then the thread will go to sleep and the VM will wait and if someone sends something down that channel it will wake up the thread so that it can receive that object .
That 's exactly how the debugger works .
The thread that has the code that is being debugged , when it does invoke debugger it sends the method context object from where it is to over a channel to the debugger .
So the debugger wakes up and says " Oh someone is being debugged now " , it gives us a method context object and then it can figure out from there " Oh , ok , I am here , I am at this location , this is the instruction pointer , and that means I am at this line " and then you can debug from there .
It works very well because you do n't do any work until you need to .
Just with the bytecode replacement .
15 .
Is this also how you implemented the profiler ?
No , although we had plans of implementing right now the only profiler you have is the sampling profiler .
We did n't implement an instrumenting profiler but our plans actually are : we can go ahead and implement the same way that 1.8 has its profiler which is to go ahead and have the ability to add hooks , so whenever you enter a method or exit a method you can run some code .
Something better that I 'm thinking about now , again works the same way as C does , which is you compile a file you have to indicate " Yes , I want to go ahead and compile this for profiling and it actually puts in some code before the method runs and when the method exits .
You do n't really want a profile the kernel you want to profile just your library .
You compile your library with profiling support and then you go run your library and it calls the profiler as it needs to , and then later on you can easily dump the results .
That 's for the future .
What we have now is a sampling profiler which is very simple .
All you do is you turn it on and you say " How often would you like the sampling profiler to see what 's going on ? " .
Say 10 milliseconds .
Every 10 milliseconds it says " Ok " and it looks at what the VM is doing and it saves the current method context object in an array and does that every 10 milliseconds , 100 milliseconds however long you want .
And then when you call " Stop " on it , it gives you back this giant list of method context objects .
And then the method context objects are really rich , you can go and look at them all and figure out " Ok I got hundreds out of thousand samples , 500 of them where in one method .
Obviously I am spending a lot of time with that method and in that method I was in one section of code 490 of them .
So obviously that section of code is the one that we are spending a lot of time in " .
But you can work from there .
It is not as accurate as an instrumenting one but it provides a real low impact way of profiling because the fact that the method context objects are already first class .
The only thing the VM has to do is to record what was going on , in C I used some research that I have found about how to make sure that basically it 's just one memory write .
Every time it comes around it just does one memory right and then it is done .
16 . Is there also a way to save the context object ?
I think context objects are serializable in Rubinius .
Is that true ?
The plan is to make them .
I have n't done it yet just because we had other issues but they are architected to be serializable , so that you can dump an entire spaghetti stack of what was executing one time to disc , read it back and continue executing .
17 . Would this be kind of a bit like Smalltalk images in a way ?
Yes , you could actually engineer your application that way so you could start it up , let it get to a certain point and then save it out to disk .
And the next time you un-serialize it , you just continue where you saved it out to disc .
So if you have an application , well there are some kind of issues with that , right now it is just a stack , not the whole heap that gets saved out to disk , and that is partially what you need in order to do stuff like fixed initialization , say your program takes 10 minutes to initialize but once it is running it runs great .
Unfortunately unless we can serialize the heap you can't really save the whole thing after 10 minutes , but I have read the code and done some research on how to dump the heap properly , how to read it back in so you can do stuff like implementing Smalltalk images and I have every indication to think that eventually Rubinius will have an image based option .
Simply because it handles a certain class of problems better than the file based one .
18 . There is a company called Gemstone which provides object oriented databases , has done so for a long time , they do them for Smalltalk , they have their own Smalltalk version where build their objects in the database , and they have expressed an interest in Rubinius and using Rubinius .
Could you elaborate on that ?
Yes , sure .
They approached me , I think at RailsConf 2007 about the idea of getting Gemstone into Ruby .
We had some talks and they sent some announcements that they want to go ahead and build in the Gemstone C++ library which is this large object logic persistence library that they have been working on for 25 years .
And they wanted to go ahead and hook that into Rubinius .
We are not done yet , they have had their engineers busy , they wanted to wait until we were close to 1.0 which actually works best for us .
What we have done is done a little bit of leg work getting the object memory subsystem ready for them , writing a few hooks in place so that when they are ready to start they can do it .
I think it is a really big thing because it is going to mean that Rails applications running under Rubinius will have access to the Gemstone object persistence layer to store everything which is a really attractive alternative to using a relational database .
19 .
Do you know anything about how they are going to implement this , how they are going to hook into Rubinius ?
Yes , we have done a little bit of leg work for them , we allocated some space called the literal " tag range " in Rubinius object memory subsystem , so that when they are ready to hook into it they can .
I am not completely up on Gemstone 's technology , vocabulary , or even exactly the whole thing , but my understanding is that when an object is on disk it is represented in the system with just like an integer where that integer indicates either a listing in a table or an address that the object is really located at on disk something to that effect , a serialized form , or a pointer to that object .
And we have allocated space for them to go ahead and put those in , and then it seems like they have a couple of different ways , I actually asked them this , they have a Java product as well , and where they hook in with the Java product , and they said they actually get a license from Sun to write their own Java product .
So they have their own JVM because they had to hook in really low layer to Java to get the object persistence layer in , with Rubinius because of the way that the objects work , for the most part it requires one hook in the VM , which is the ability to read an instance variable .
So whenever you read an instance variable you may or may not have to fetch that thing off disk .
We basically provide them with those hooks in those places to pull things in off disk .
20 .
Talking about the heap , there is an interesting feature in Ruby that is called " objects space " that allows Ruby developers to iterate all the objects on the heap .
What 's the current status of that in Rubinius ?
In Rubinius the iteration part each object which is a main part of object space is not implemented .
I want to have some kind of implementation for it by 1.0 .
I am really interested in how to implement it in an efficient way .
I know that JRuby implements it in a kind of a brute force way , because that 's the only way you can do it in Java and I am exploring different ways of doing it efficiently .
The reason it has become difficult is that each object is really tailored to the memory model of 1.8 .
And that is that objects once they are allocated in memory they are stuck at that address .
So it is very easy to walk all the objects from one side to the other , because they are always going to live in the same place .
Rubinius uses more modern techniques for object memory mainly the ability to compact and move objects from one place of memory to another .
In fact that is the only way that the young generation in the object memory space works is to actually copy things a lot .
Consequently if you are iterating over all the objects and half way through you decide you need to copy everything from one section of memory to another to compact them , it seems like it 's non deterministic to figure out where you were in the first place and continue on in a linear way .
And so I need to do more research .
If it turns out that the only way to do it is to do it the same way that Java does it , which is basically that the VM keeps a giant hash of weak references to all the objects that are in the systems and then just walks over the weak references , like JRuby does it , then we will implement it that way .
But I am hoping that we can figure out some more efficient way to do it .
One option that I have considered although not efficient at all is basically putting a mode that the garbage collector could be in where it no longer collects .
So turn off the garbage collector while you are iterating over the object so that things do n't move .
And then once you are done , go ahead and give things back .
That has some kind of nasty consequences , because all objects get allocated in the old object space then , and then you basically have to just continually allocate more and more memory because you can't move anything around .
That 's an option , but that 's more of a last resort .
21 . You said effectively remove the new generation ?
Yeah , if you stop the garbage collector the object memory subsystem will let the young generation fill to capacity and then they will start allocating objects in the old generation .
And then the old generation will then just continue all new objects will go to the old generation until you are done iterating , until each object had returned and then you could actually say " That took too long , go out and do a full garbage collection sweep over all objects and try to get everything back into order " .
It plays havoc with the garbage collector but I am confident that we will figure out a fairly decent way of implementing it .
22 . Talking about the garbage collector , you added an interesting feature for a figure called the " fork - friendly garbage collector " .
What do you mean by that ?
1.8 has a current limitation in that the garbage collector stores information , a garbage collector specific information about each object inside the object , the mark bits .
And that makes sense from a data locality issue of storing it there .
Unfortunately it is very bad for the virtual memory subsystems of operating systems .
When you fork , pretty much all objects , all virtual memory subsystem in OSs these days , do n't copy the memory from a parent to a child , they go ahead and let the child continue to use the pages , the sections of memory that the parent was holding on to .
In a normal C program , when you fork , 90 % of the time you continually used the pages of the parent , it could be years that you continue to use them .
With Ruby 1.8 the big problem isonce you forked and the garbage collector runs again it is going to walk over all the objects again and it is going to be basically dirty or set new pieces of information on every page .
So the minute the garbage collector runs to a child , the operating system has to double the amount of memory it is using .
The way that we approach it in Rubinius is : the young generation is , by the way that it is architected has to be copied , because it is a copy compacting collector you are always going to have to basically duplicate those pages .
The young generation is only about 3 MB , that 's very easy .
The old generation on the other end , the objects are allocated in one section of heap .
And then the garbage collector information about those objects is located in a completely different section of memory .
So when the garbage collector decides " I need to make sure whether or not these objects are still good " it uses this mark table to catalog each object .
So without having the right into each object it can keep track of what it needs to be doing .
And that allows the OS to continually share these pages between the parents and their children .
That 's a big win because in Rubinius and MRI as well , the implementation of all the methods is stored in the heap .
The code for actually what to perform in those cases is stored in the heap .
When you fork from a parent to a child , there is a 90 - some % chance that you are going to be able to share 90 % of your data between parents and children , just because they have the same implementations for methods and for classes and stuff .
Those will continue to be shared between them .
You can fork off a 100 different children whereas in 1.8 that causes you incredible memory pain , in Rubinius it does n't really cause you any memory pain , because those will continue to be shared .
23 .
This is a problem that exists in Java and other systems where you can't really share application level code .
You mentioned the spaghetti stack .
That 's used for implementing continuations .
Partially yes .
In a normal implementation , the stack of execution or when you go to execute some functions the data about how that execution is working is stored in a stack .
The parent that calls the child is stored higher than the child and it continues down .
With a spaghetti stack instead , the information about the execution is stored as a object , and that object has just a field called sender that points to the person who called this method .
It is called a spaghetti stacks because it is a chain , they are connected from sender to object , to sender to object , back all the way to the top to some context that has no sender which means you reached the top .
And the great thing about those is that those all live virtually in the heap , there are some optimizations underneath the hood that allows them to be created and destroyed very quickly in the case they do n't actually need to live in the heap , but for the most part they can always be put in the normal Ruby heap , they can be normal Ruby objects , so continuations all they have to do is store the most current method context about that whole chain of things in time .
And then later on when it wants to go ahead and continue to run it just has to make that method context object the current one and then it continues to run .
So you can duplicate method context objects to copy continuations that continue to run and you can do all that stuff to them .
24 . How would you compare your continuation performance or implementation to other Ruby versions ?
It is certainly better than other Ruby implementations just by the fact that the way that it is implemented it allows itself to be implemented in a much simpler way .
Rubinius is totally stackless which means that as you are executing Ruby methods you never advance the C stack underneath the hood .
Although people have found creative ways of saving the C stack , it is a very problematic thing - saving it .
Instead Rubinus just does n't use any C stack to run things .
You can always dump the entire Rubinius stack which is completely associated with the C stack .
From that respective the continuations are very cheap , lightweight and simple .
25 . Moving away a bit from technical information here - you 've recently moved to the version management system , git which was written by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel
What are your experiences with it ?
We have liked it a lot .
There are places where it is not as user friendly as subversion , but the fact that it is all tool based , and we were able to do things like really getting an incredible about of information about the code and about how the development process is working out of git , is very simple .
And that has proved to be incredibly nice .
I personally have become fairly addicted to using local branches which is something where because every time you receive a " git clone " or " git archive " you have all the history about it , you can do things like create local branches and work on things .
I have 8 or so branches , at a time usually for small fixes , for experiments , for things like I am working on .
Sometimes I get tired with working on some experiment and I just go ahead and leave it in a branch and leave the checked in and committed , but just leave it locally .
Continue to work on some other bug fixes or things that are more pressing .
I can always go back to that code that is stored on disk on my laptop and work on it then .
I love that feature of it .
One thing that has proved to be invaluable here at the conference is that the upstream bandwidth to the Internet is fairly limited .
All I had to do was set up git to serve out to git repository located on my laptop people can clone it locally or earlier I just started my git repo put it on a flash drive and get it to somebody else .
They have all the history then , it is very simple to share then .
It is actually really nice for these conferences / hack - fest scenarios where the locality of programmers is better so it is nice to have the locality of the code in source control .
27 .
Are there any issues with running git on Windows ?
It seems like that is being worked on .
I know there are some issues , people can't run under Cygwin which is as Windows people tell me not a real solution , although the people working on it running under MinGW which is a GCC for native Windows and I think they are making good strides with that .
There is a worry when we initially moved to git that we will be alienating some people that we are upping in the bar that they would have to jump over in order to contribute .
I have set up a read only as subversion copy of our git repository that we used Tailor for that whenever someone commits to git those changes are automatically propagated over to this read only subversion archive .
If people want to check it out , see it , and compile it , maybe write a couple of patches and send them in to us , they can do that with a subversion environment that they are accustomed to .
And as they get more into the project we insist that they move to git .
But that give us that new user friendly smell that they like .
29 .
What was the reason for git ?
Just flipping a coin ?
A little bit .
I do n't want to say " Because it is in Python and I am a Ruby guy " .
I had heard great things about Mercurial
At the time , and maybe this is not true anymore but my understanding was that Mercurial did n't have local branches and that was something that I had become really accustomed to , actually originally with SVK I became really accustomed to it with SVK that was a feature I was determined to have .
And so we decided to go down the git road .
30 .
To finish up , we want to ask you about , let 's say people have watched this interview and are itching to contribute to Rubinius what 's your management style .
Are you the big benevolent dictator like Matz ?
I try not to be .
There are certain things , like being founder of the project I can put my foot down on occasion , but I actually try to delegate as much work as possible .
Not just because I am lazy , although I am a programmer so I am inherently lazy , but because that lets other people own parts of the code and I feel like code ownership equates to the desire to make it better .
I have Brian Ford , who is the guy who works on his piece , the spec admiral , the spec general , I actually do n't make any decision with relation to specs I decided early on that I ask him " Should we do it this way ? " and he says yes or no and his opinion is the opinion .
We have other people who have come on who have proven to be invaluable in certain aspects and I basically made them the guru , the owners of those sections of code .
And I think that worked out really well , I am new player to software project management so I am doing what seems like the thing to do .
And so far it has worked pretty well .
We have n't had to cut off any committers because they got pissed of with the project .
We had certainly have committers who have shown up done some work and then disappeared but that 's normal for an open source project .
Relationships between the BBC and internet industry have plunged to an all - time low , after the BBC 's internet chief Ashley Highfield used a blog post yesterday to tell ISPs to get stuffed - and even threatened to name and shame them .
The cost of carrying iPlayer traffic has been a sore point for ISPs , who must absorb steeply rising traffic costs .
Regulator OFCOM 's Market Impact Assessment estimated the P2P version of iPlayer would create up to £ 831 m in extra costs for the internet industry .
In the first month of the " low bandwidth " iPlayer , ISPs saw streaming costs rise 20 per cent .
( See iPlayer Politics : Behind the ISPs vs BBC row . )
But Highfield , Director of Future Media and Technology at the £ 4 bn - a - year corporation , said the BBC wo n't help them out .
" I would not suggest that ISPs start to try and charge content providers , " he scolds .
" They are already charging their customers for broadband to receive any content they want .
If ISPs start charging content providers , the customer will not know which content will work well over their chosen ISP , and what content may have been throttled for non-payment of a levy . "
Highfield instead advises them to pass the increased costs onto their customers in the form of tiers of service ( ie price increases ) .
And if ISPs did n't follow his " advice " , and dared to traffic shape their networks to manage their bandwidth hogs , Highfield threatened that the BBC would name and shame them .
" Content providers , if they find their content being specifically squeezed , shaped , or capped , could start to indicate on their sites which ISPs their content worked best on ( and which to avoid ) .
I hope it does n’t come to this , as I think we ( the BBC and the ISPs ) are currently working better together than ever . "
Being put on the BBC's List of Shame could have serious commercial repercussions for internet providers .
( Highfield also raised eyebrows with his assertion that " The best technical solution is usually Moore ’s law " .
An oddly ignorant thing to say , since the capacity and price of copper and fibre connections have very little to do with the density of transistors on a semiconductor die .
Earth to Ashley : Ceci n'est pas une pipe . )
It 's a lose - lose situation for the ISPs .
If they refuse to carry iPlayer material , they lose customers and go out of business .
If they do carry iPlayer material , and traffic shape their networks , the BBC will shame them , and they go out of business .
Who'd be an ISP ?
Highfield 's heavy - handed intervention may undo much of the conciliatory work undertaken by iPlayer boss Anthony Rose .
As we reported recently , the BBC is exploring building its own Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) to ease the delivery costs for ISPs .
One executive at a major ISP stormed back at Highfield :
" Relying on the customer 's failure to read the small print is not the basis for a digital content strategy . "
And so the bloodbath nears . ®
To figure out how we pick mates , scientists have measured every shape and angle of the human face , studied the symmetry of dancers , crafted formulas from the measurements of Playboy models , and had both men and women rank attractiveness based on smelling armpit sweat .
After all this and more , the rules of attraction for the human species are still not clearly understood .
How it all factors into true love is even more mysterious .
But a short list of scientific rules for the game of love is emerging .
Some are as clearly defined as the prominent , feminine eyes of a supermodel or the desirable hips of a well - built man .
Other rules work at the subconscious level , motivating us to action for evolutionary reasons that are tucked inside clouds of infatuation .
In the end , lasting love depends at least as much on behavior as biology .
But the first moves are made before you 're even born .
Symmetry equals sex
Starting at conception , the human body develops by neatly splitting cells .
If every division were to go perfectly , the result would be a baby whose left and right sides are mirror images .
But nature does n't work that way .
Genetic mutations and environmental pressures skew symmetry , and the results have lifelong implications .
Good symmetry shows that an individual has the genetic goods to survive development , is healthy , and is a good and fertile choice for mating .
" It makes sense to use symmetry variation in mate choice , " said evolutionary biologist Randy Thornhill of the University of New Mexico .
" If you choose a perfectly symmetrical partner and reproduce with them , your offspring will have a better chance of being symmetric and able to deal with perturbations . "
Thornhill has been studying symmetry for 15 years and scanned faces and bodies into computers to determine symmetry ratios .
Both men and women rated symmetrical members of the opposite sex as more attractive and in better health than their less symmetrical counterparts .
The differences can be just a few percent — perceivable though not necessarily noticeable .
By questioning the study participants , Thornhill also found that men with higher degrees of symmetry enjoy more sexual partners than men of lower symmetry .
" Women 's sex - partner numbers are dependent on things other than attractiveness , " Thornhill told LiveScience .
" Because of the way that the sexual system in humans works , women are choosey .
They are being sexually competed for .
They have to be wooed and all that . "
Those hips
Body shape is of course important , too .
And scientists have some numbers to prove it .
Psychologist Devendra Singh of the University of Texas studied people 's waist - to - hip ratio ( WHR ) .
Women with a WHR of 0.7 — indicating a waist significantly narrower than the hips — are most desirable to men .
And an analysis of hourglass figures of Playboy models and Miss America contestants showed that the majority of these women boast a WHR of 0.7 or lower .
In general , a range of 0.67 to 1.18 in females is attractive to men , Singh concluded in a 2004 study , while a 0.8 to 1.0 WHR in men is attractive to women , although having broad shoulders is more of a turn -on .
What exactly is encoded in the hip ratio ?
A big fat clue to whether the person will have enough energy to care for offspring .
Where fat is deposited on the body is determined by sex hormones ; testosterone in men and estrogen in women .
If a woman produces the proper amount and mixture of estrogen , then her WHR will naturally fall into the desired range .
The same goes for a male 's testosterone .
People in the ideal hip - ratio range , regardless of weight , are less susceptible to disease such as cardiovascular disorders , cancer , and diabetes , studies have shown .
Women in this range also have less difficulty conceiving .
" The idea is that beauty is conveying information about health and fertility , and we admire that , " Singh said in a telephone interview .
Face it
The structure of a person 's face also gives insight to fertility .
Estrogen caps bone growth in a woman 's lower face and chin , making them relatively small and short , as well as the brow , allowing for her eyes to appear prominent , Thornhill explained .
Men 's faces are shaped by testosterone , which helps develop a larger lower face and jaw and a prominent brow .
Men and women possessing these traits are seen as attractive , Thornhill said , because they advertise reproductive health .
Thornhill also points to the booming nip - ‘n'- tuck business — which is very much about improving a person 's symmetry — as evidence that people find the quality attractive .
Another recent study revealed that symmetrical dancers are seen as more attractive .
Sniff this
Research reported last month found women both smell and look more attractive to men at certain times of the month .
And symmetrical men smell better .
Borrowing sweaty undershirts from a variety of men , Thornhill offered the shirts to the noses of women , asking for their impressions of the scents .
Hands down , the women found the scent of a symmetrical man to be more attractive and desirable , especially if the woman was menstruating .
By now you might be wondering how much of this we 're consciously aware of .
The rules of attraction , it turns out , seem sometimes to play out in our subconscious .
In some cases , women in Thornhill 's study reported not smelling anything on a shirt , yet still said they were attracted to it .
" We think the detection of these types of scent is way outside consciousness , " Thornhill said .
A 2002 study found women prefer the scent of men with genes somewhat similar to their own over the scent of nearly genetically identical or totally dissimilar men .
These subconscious scents might be related to pheromones , chemical signals produced by the body to communicate reproductive quality .
The human genome contains more than 1,000 olfactory genes — compared to approximately 300 genes for photoreceptors in the eyes — so pheromones have received a lot of attention from basic research scientists as well as perfume manufacturers .
But the role of pheromones in the human realm remains controversial .
Animal attraction
Pheromones clearly act as sexual attractants in the animal world .
Older male elephants , for example , exude sexual prowess with a mix of chemicals the younger bulls can't muster .
Milos Novotny of the Institute of Pheromone Research at Indiana University has shown that special molecules produced by male mice can simultaneously attract females and repel , and even anger , rival males .
Other studies have found similar responses throughout the animal kingdom .
Yet many researchers are not sold on the idea that these odorless compounds play a role in human attraction .
Count evolutionary biologist Jianzhi Zhang of the University of Michigan among the skeptical .
In 2003 , Zhang showed that a gene mutated 23 million years ago among primates in Africa and Asia that are considered to be human ancestors , allowing them to see color .
This let the males notice that a female 's bottom turned bright red when she was ready to mate .
" With the development of a sexual color scheme , you do n't need the pheromone sensitivity to sense whether a female monkey is ready to mate , " Zhang said .
" It 's advantageous to use visual cues rather than pheromones because they can be seen from a distance . "
A study last year , however , suggested that human pheromones affect the sexual area of the brains of women and gay men in a similar manner .
Sex goes visual
Pheromones , like other scents , hitch a ride through the air on other particles , such as water droplets .
They generally hover just 10 inches off the ground , however .
So odds are slim they 'll waft up to a human nose and fuel sudden passion at a nightclub .
Watch any construction worker whistling at a passing woman from half a block away , and you can see how visual cues can be more powerful .
And while they enter the nose like other scents , that 's where the comparison stops .
A pheromone 's destination is a special organ called the volmeronasal organ , which humans now lack .
From here the sexy scent travels along a neural pathway to the brain separate from other scents .
Evolution played a role in this , too .
After our ancestors began to see color , a gene important in the pheromone - signaling pathway suffered a deleterious mutation , making it impossible for the scent signals to reach the brain , Zhang said .
Imagine a train , leaving from Los Angeles to New York , discovers that the tracks in St. Louis are destroyed .
Although the classical pheromone pathway in both Old World primates and humans is dysfunctional , the mechanism for producing pheromones still works .
Some scientists believe human pheromones might be influencing our decisions along the normal olfactory pathway .
Lasting relationships
The rules of attraction might drive our initial decisions , for better or worse .
But lasting relationships are about much more than what we see and smell .
Behavior plays a key role , with biology an intriguing contributing factor .
One of the oldest theories about attraction is that like begets like .
It explains that eerie perception that married couples sometimes look awfully similar .
Last year , J. Philippe Rushton , a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario , looked into the relationships of people 's genes .
Based on a set of heritable personality traits , having similar genetics plays 34 percent of the role in friendship and mate selection , he found .
" The main theory is that some genes work well in combination with each other , " Rushton told LiveScience .
" If these genes evolved to work in combination , then you do n't want to break that up too much for your offspring .
Finding a mate with similar genes will help you ensure this . "
If your spouse is genetically similar , you 're more likely to have a happy marriage , for example .
Child abuse rates are lower when similarity is high , and you 'll also be more altruistic and willing to sacrifice more for someone who is more genetically like you , research shows .
It probably comes as little surprise people are drawn to individuals with similar attitudes and values , as psychologist Eva Klohnen at the University of Iowa found in a 2005 study of newlywed couples .
These characteristics are highly visible and accessible to others and can play a role in initial attraction .
When it comes to sticking together for the long haul , researchers have shown that likeness of personality , which can take more time to realize , means more .
Comedy can also help a relationship .
But the importance of humor is different for men and women , says Eric Bressler of McMaster University .
A woman is attracted to a man who makes her laugh , Bressler found in a 2005 study .
A man likes a woman who laughs at his jokes .
True love
Somewhere amid attraction and sex , we all hope , are strong feelings of love .
But which of all the motivations really drives us ?
Interestingly , brain scans in people who'd recently fallen in love reveal more activity related to love than sex .
" Romantic love is one of the most powerful of all human experiences , " says Helen Fisher , an anthropologist at Rutgers University .
" It is definitely more powerful than the sex drive . "
The rules of attraction make up a pretty long list .
No scientist knows the order of the list .
But near the top is perhaps one of the toughest characteristics to gauge in advance in the search for the perfect partner .
Despite all their differences , men and women place high value on one trait : fidelity .
Cornell University 's Stephen Emlen and colleagues asked nearly 1,000 people age 18 to 24 to rank several attributes , including physical attractiveness , health , social status , ambition , and faithfulness , on a desirability scale .
People who rated themselves favorably as long - term partners were more particular about the attributes of potential mates .
After fidelity , the most important attributes were physical appearance , family commitment , and wealth and status .
" Good parenting , devotion , and sexual fidelity — that 's what people say they 're looking for in a long - term relationship , " Emlen says .

Passing the House of Representatives on a voice vote , S. 1858 has been sent to President Bush for signature .
The Newborn Genetic Screening bill was passed by the Senate last December .
The bill violates the U.S. Constitution and the Nuremberg Code , writes Twila Brase , president of the Citizen ’s Council on Health Care ( CCHC ) .
“ The DNA taken at birth from every citizen is essentially owned by the government , and every citizen becomes a potential subject of government - sponsored genetic research , ” she states .
“ It does not require consent and there are no requirements to inform parents about the warehousing of their child ’s DNA for the purpose of genetic research .
Already , in Minnesota , the state health department reports that 42,210 children of the 780,000 whose DNA is housed in the Minnesota ‘ DNA warehouse ’ have been subjected to genetic research without their parents ’ knowledge or consent . ”
The federal government lacks the Constitutional authority as well as the competence to develop a newborn screening program , states Rep. Ron Paul , M.D. ( R - TX ) .
He states that all hospitals will probably scrap their own newborn testing program and adopt the federal model , whatever its flaws , to avoid the loss of federal funding .
“ Drafters of the legislation made no effort to ensure that these newborn screening programs do not violate the privacy rights of parents and children , ” Dr. Paul noted .
Ms. Brase has called on President Bush to veto the bill .

Culture Clash Could Doom Microhoo !
from the internal - frictions dept
We do n't link to anthropologists much on Techdirt , but Grant McCracken recently wrote a really interesting post on the cultural dimension of corporate mergers .
McCracken points out that culture matters a lot in a company 's success .
Every really successful firm succeeds by developing a distinctive corporate culture that boosts productivity by giving employees a shared set of assumptions about how to do business .
In many cases , employees become like the proverbial fish in water : the corporate culture is so pervasive that the employee barely notices it .
In other cases , employees explicitly debate the meaning of their shared corporate identity : Google employees commonly debate the most " Googly " way to approach a particular problem .
When two firms merge , the existence of a shared corporate culture can no longer be assumed .
Differing cultural assumptions among employees are likely to produce new frictions .
One company might be more bureaucratic , work longer hours , have different procedures for evaluating new products , or have any number of other differences in the way they do business .
Any of these disagreements can be a barrier to the smooth functioning of the merged company .
If the two separate firms are to become a single , organic one , management must find a way to convince employees of the acquired firm to embrace the culture of the acquiring firm .
If they fail , the company will limp along with simmering disagreements over strategy and tactics .
That was a big part of the problem with the AOL Time Warner merger , for example .
These kinds of cultural assumptions are particularly important in the software industry , where success is often driven by the ability to recruit and retain the most talented programmers .
One of Google 's key advantage over the last few years has been the perception that it's a more cutting - edge place to work than Yahoo ! or ( especially ) Microsoft .
Many smart programmers view Microsoft as too big , bureaucratic , and slow - moving to develop really innovative products , and since they want to work on hot new technologies , they often go elsewhere .
Acquiring another multi-billion - dollar company is likely to exacerbate this perception , especially if it causes some of Yahoo !'s best programmers to jump ship in the process .

Origins :
This item , a final examination for graduating eighth grade students ( or graduating high school students , depending upon which version you have ) is similar to other exams from that time and purpose , and it ’s of interest because it ’s supposed to be documentary evidence of how shockingly our educations have declined over the last century or so .
Why , most adults could n’t muster a passing score on this test today , people think ; that mere schoolkids were expected to pass it is proof that the typical school curriculum has been steeply “ dumbed down ” over the years , pundits claim :
[ Thomasson , 2001 ]
The object of this exercise was only to reveal what many of us have known for some time .
The dumbing down of American public education over the past 100 years has been substantial , particularly in the last 50 years .
When Great - grandma says she only had an eighth - grade education , do n’t smirk .
What nearly all these pundits fail to grasp is “ I ca n’t answer these questions ” is not the same thing as “ These questions demonstrate that students in earlier days were better educated than today ’s students . ”
Just about any test looks difficult to those who have n’t recently been steeped in the material it covers .
If a 40 - year - old ca n’t score as well
on a geography test as a high school student who just spent several weeks memorizing the names of all the rivers in South America in preparation for an exam , that does n’t mean the 40 - year - old ’s education was woefully deficient — it means the he simply did n’t retain information for which he had no use , no matter how thoroughly it was drilled into his brain through rote memory some twenty - odd years earlier .
I suspect I ’d fail a lot of the tests I took back in high school if I had to re-take them today without reviewing the material beforehand .
I certainly would n’t be able to pass any arithmetic test that required me to be familiar with such arcane measurements as “ rods ” and “ bushels , ” but I can still calculate areas and volumes just fine , thank you .
Ah , but this is high school ( or even eighth grade ) stuff , people say — it ’s basic knowledge that everyone should remember and use .
Nonsense .
The questions on this exam do n’t reflect only items of “ basic knowledge ” — many of the questions require the test - taker to have absorbed some very specialized information , and if today ’s students ca n’t regurgitate all the same facts as their 1895 counterparts , it ’s because the types of knowledge we consider to be important have changed a great deal in the last century , not necessarily because today ’s students have sub-standard educations .
Consider :
To pass this test , no knowledge of the arts is necessary ( not even a nodding familiarity with a few of the greatest works of English literature ) , no demonstration of mathematical learning other than plain arithmetic is required ( forget algebra , geometry , or trigonometry ) , nothing beyond a familiarity with the highlights of American history is needed ( never mind the fundamentals of world history , as this exam scarcely acknowledges that any country other than the USA even exists ) , no questions about the history , structure , or function of the United States government are asked ( not even the standard “ Name the three branches of our federal government ” ) , science is given a pass except for a few questions about geography and the rudiments of human anatomy , and no competence in any foreign language ( living or dead ) is necessary .
An exam for today ’s high school graduates that omitted even one of these subjects would be loudly condemned by parents and educators alike , subjects about which the Salina , Kansas , students of 1895 needed know nothing at all .
Would it be fair to say that the average Salina student was woefully undereducated because he failed to learn many of the things that we consider important today , but which were of little importance in his time and place ?
If not , then why do people keep asserting that the reverse is true ?
Why do journalists continue to base their gleeful articles about how much more was expected of the students of yesteryear on flawed assumptions ?
Perhaps some people are too intent upon making a point to bother considering the proper questions .
Consider the following , a certification examination for prospective teachers , prepared by the Examiners of Teachers for the Public Schools in Zanesville , Ohio , in the late 1870s :

Plenty of critics maintain that most of today ’s teaching candidates could n’t pass this test .
Well , even if that were true , it would n’t make today ’s candidates all that different than their 19th century counterparts .
As Joseph Crosby , the man who created the English Grammar and Orthography sections of this exam , wrote to a friend in 1876 :
I gave them a pretty severe test in Grammar , and some of them did make terrible work of it .
One young lady said the singular of “ Swine ” was “ pigs ” , another “ a hog ” .
One being asked to give me the past tense of “ I lie down ” said “ I lied ” , which she certainly did .
Out of some 30 or 35 words I gave them to spell , not over 10 were spelled correctly by any one , several missed on all but 5 or 6 —
Yet they blushed & tried so hard to do well — and many were graduates of the High School — that I was sorry for them .
I had no idea that graduates could be so ignorant .
And after all , do we really care these days whether our educators know the “ feminines of the words hero , bachelor , and ox ” ?
Although this exam may indicate , as Velz wrote , that “ [ o ] ur notion of nineteenth - century education as primitive and backward may need modification , ” perhaps what it demonstrates most is the truth of the aphorism that the more things change , the more they stay the same .

元ネタは 「 怠慢はプログラマの美徳」というけれど というエントリ。
スクリプト言語 はJavaに恋している
スクリプト言語 はJavaに恋をしているのです。寝ても覚めてもJava、Javaと騒ぎ立てます。
PHPもPythonもRubyも、いつもJavaとの比較を行います。 XXのシステム はPHPだとか執拗にJavaを意識します。君たちはそんなにJavaが好きなのかい？
JavaはXXでよくないからスクリプト言語であるXXを使いなさい、というプロパガンダ記事をよく見かけます。
対して、こういう理由でJavaを使うべきだ、というプロパガンダ記事は随分と少なくなりました。
つうかね 、Java がほんとに使いやすくなったら、スクリプト言語なんてイチコロなんだよ。今、スクリプト言語に人気があるのとは対照的に
Java に元気がないのは 、Java 自身の失態がいちばんの原因だよ、ほんと。
まるで好きな女の子に相手にされなくて強がって陰口を叩いているかのようです。
Javaはたしかに融通がきかないところもある。変数を扱うたびに型、型、型。
きっちりとしたその性格はキャリアウーマンのごとく。
対してスクリプト言語は少年のごとく。型なんて面倒なものいらねぇよ。とにかく作ってみようぜ！
でも、そんなスクリプト言語の憧れの的はやはりJavaなのです。 Javaに対して 「俺たちの魅力」をアピールしている。
Javaはすでに確たる地位を手にしているので、わざわざプロパガンダしてまで交際を申し込む必要はないのです。
黙っていても富豪令嬢のようなJavaには言いよる相手ばかりなのですから。
Javaはもう、シェアを奪いに行く立場ではなくなってしまった。
シェアを取ろうと躍起になる「元気さ」は確かにないかもしれません。
怠慢はプログラマの美徳
Java 屋とスクリプト言語屋の間には、
「めんどくさい」と感じるセンスについて超えられない壁が存在している。
本質的でない事柄に関する記述があったときに、スクリプト言語屋は「めんどくさい」と感じ、Java 屋はそれを感じないか、または「これは必要な冗長性だ」と本気で思い込んでいる。
ここで重要なのは 「本質的でない事柄に関する記述」とは何かという点です。
Java屋が言う 「必要な冗長性」がスクリプト言語屋の前提の下では無意味で面倒くさいものである、
というのが実態でしょう。
スクリプト言語というのはフットワークの軽さが売りで、ちょっとしたアイデアをすぐに形にするには都合がよい。
反面、刹那的な代物で、保守性に乏しく、巨大で複雑なシステムを構築する言語としては適さない代物です。
世の中もそれが分っていて、スクリプトに都合のよい仕事はスクリプトで行うし、 重厚長大なシステムはJavaなどの巨大建築向けに設計された静的言語を用いるのが通例です。
これらの適用箇所の違いは、さまざまな前提の違いを生み出します。
小規模なソースコードではデメリットにならないことが、大規模になると無視できなくなったりするわけです。
その点を隠してスクリプト言語はいいよ！というのはプロパガンダか、無知かのいずれかでしょう。
怠惰のセン ス
さて、前置きが長くなりましたが、スクリプト屋とJava屋の怠惰のセンスの違いについて見てきましょう。
あらかじめ断わっておきますが、壁ではなく方向性の違いなのです。
どちらかが優れているというものではありません。
スクリプト言語は手軽さを売りにしています。手軽であることが正義という世界ですから、
怠惰の方向性もまた、記述の手軽さといった方向に向かいます。
そのため型推論を好みます。プロトタイプベースのオブジェクト指向を好みます。
勢いで作って、さくさく動かすことを掲げ、その障壁となるものを排除するように怠惰であろうとします。
IDE など使いません。高機能な統合IDEは起動に時間がかかります。ちょっとしたソースを書くのに
そんなものを使ってられない。ちょっとしたテキストエディタにシンタックスハイライトの機能があれば十分。
デバッグは動かしながらやればいいのです。まずは動かすまでが楽であること。それがスクリプト屋の怠惰のセンスです。
Java屋は堅牢さを重視します。何千というクラスを取りまとめ、何十万行というソースを統括し、
基幹システムとして鎮座する機能を作り上げる使命を背負っているからです。
Java屋の怠惰のセンスは重厚長大なシステムを設計・製造・運用・保守していくための怠惰です。
静的な強い型付けを好みます。変数を扱うたびに型、型、型。
しかし、そうすることでコンパイルの段階で、システムを動かすまでもなくバグを取り除けるのです。
Java屋の望む怠惰はそういう怠惰です。そしてそのための面倒は大事の前の小事にすぎないと考えます。
「 Write once , run anywhere 」 という合言葉 はJava屋の怠惰の一端を表しています 。
高機能なIDEを日常的に使います。テキストエディタでプログラムなんて書く気も起きません。
EmacsでJavaを書いてはいけない と Emacsの開発をしたジェームス・ゴスリン氏が語っているぐらい（彼はJavaの生みの親でもある）。
起動時間が長い？朝にIDEを起動して一日中使うのだからなんら気になりません。
Java6でスクリプト呼び出しができるようになった理由
Javaのような静的言語とスクリプト言語は、そもそもターゲットが違っているのです。
Javaに恋してJavaの領分をスクリプト言語で行おうとする人もいることでしょう。
でも、うまくいっていますか？もはやJavaは空気のように当たり前に基幹システム使われています。
スクリプト言語がそれを置き換える日はこないことでしょう。
逆 にJavaがスクリプト言語の代わりになるのであれば、そもそもスクリプト言語が生まれ来ることもない。
「 つうかね 、Java がほんとに使いやすくなったら、スクリプト言語なんてイチコロなんだよ。 」
というのは、スクリプト言語の領分をJavaで代替えできるならという話。 そう、Javaはスクリプト言語の代わりにならない。逆にスクリプト言語もJavaの代わりにならない。
そこで適材適所たるこれらを連携する機能性を、ということでJava6.0から追加になったのが javax.scriptパッケージなわけです。
Javaに恋するスクリプト言語には、JRubyやJythonといったようにJavaVM上で動くように Javaのバイトコードを書き出すようなアプローチを試みたものもあります。
それとはまた違った方法で、Javaとスクリプト言語はうまくその長所を生かせる
土台ができてきたということなのです。
果たしてスクリプト言語のアプローチはJavaに届いたかのように見えます。
この先、その仲がうまくいくのかどうかは注目していきたいところですね。

Eating fruit and veg is more important than whether produce is ' green ' , says expert
Parents who want their children to eat healthily should focus more on serving them extra fruit and vegetables and less on giving them expensive organic produce , according to one of the country 's leading nutrition experts .
Lord Krebs , former head of the Food Standards Agency , said families were becoming ' deeply confused ' by conflicting messages about healthy eating .
The market for organic food reached more than £ 2bn last year , with most consumers from households with children under the age of 15 .
An average of £ 37 m is spent each week on organic produce , mostly in south - east England .
The agency is reviewing all the evidence on nutritional differences between organic and non-organic food to see if it needs to alter its recommendations to consumers ; at present , these are that there is no safety or health reason for switching to organic .
Two recent studies suggesting that there may be benefits to eating organic tomatoes and drinking organic milk have prompted a fresh look at the evidence .
However , according to Krebs , an eminent scientist and principal of Jesus College , Oxford , there is still no reliable , peer - reviewed evidence to show that there is any clear health benefit to eating this ' green ' produce .
' The organic message can sometimes be a distortion from the more important messages , ' said Krebs .
' If a parent is asking , " how can I improve the health of my children ? " they may think , " Oh , I can give them organic food " .
But that is far less important than the decision to feed them more fruit and vegetables , or the decision to give them less salt . '
His concerns about the claims made for organic produce were that ' they add to the mix of confusion in people 's minds about what it means to eat healthily ' .
When Krebs chaired the agency , he came under pressure to validate claims that organic food was better for people - but refused to endorse the produce .
However , the Soil Association still maintains that organic food is better for health .
A spokeswoman said : ' There is now a rapidly growing body of evidence which shows significant differences between the nutritional composition of organic and non-organic food .
Studies have shown that on average organic food has higher levels of iron , calcium , magnesium , phosphorus and vitamin C. '
A European Union - funded project , involving 33 academic centres across Europe and led by Newcastle University , is now investigating the nature of produce from organic and non-organic farming techniques .
According to the Soil Association , one conclusion is clear : ' Organically produced crops and dairy milk usually contain more beneficial compounds such as vitamins and antioxidants , ' said the spokeswoman .
' The research has shown up to 40 per cent more beneficial compounds in vegetable crops and up to 90 per cent more in milk . '
But Krebs said : ' I think protecting consumers is about telling them the honest truth so that they can make up their own mind , informed by impartial evidence . '
A spokesperson for the agency said : ' The weight of current scientific evidence does not support claims that organic food is more nutritious or safer than conventionally produced food .
However , a number of new studies have recently emerged focusing on nutritional differences between organic and non-organic food . '

A new lab experiment confirms results reported a year ago : people prefer to not know how their actions effect others , when such knowledge would induce them to sacrifice to benefit others .
In the baseline version , each subject chose between five pairs of numbers ( x , y ) , where x is how much money he gets and y is how much money some other subject gets .
In each pair ( x , y , ) each number was drawn randomly from the set { 1,1,4,4,7} .
Here 40 of 63 subjects appeared to put heavy weight on benefits to the other person in making their choices .
In the other treatment , each subject was shown only the x value for each of his five pairs , but could at no cost choose to see the y values .
Of the 40 subjects who in the baseline version heavily weighted benefits to others , only 10 of them chose to see the y values .
The others just picked the best option for them .
" If only people knew how bad things are here in Z - land , they ’d do something . "
Yes , and maybe that is why they do not know .

As people try to wrap their heads around the nuances and weird quirks of the Democratic Party 's process for determining our Presidential nominee , something that will probably begin to raise some eyebrows and prompt some discussion is that our next president could be chosen by people whose votes for president are n't counted in the electoral college .
That 's right , the Democratic nominee for President could be determined by the votes of delegates from the US Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa and Puerto Rico .
It now appears that the short of a deal cut between Obama and Clinton , we probably wo n't know our nominee until the Democratic convention in Denver at the end of August .
That means the late contests will be cited by the candidates as evidence that they have the momentum going in to the Denver convention .
On May 6th Indiana and North Carolina vote .
On May 13th , it 's West Virginia .
May 20th Kentucky and Oregon will be showered with attention .
And the last primaries are scheduled for June 3rd , in Montana and South Dakota .
But note that those are the last scheduled primaries .
The last contest is a caucus , on June 7th .
In Puerto Rico .
Yes , our final scheduled contest — which could change if Michigan and Florida reschedule their contests and conduct DNC - sanctioned delegate contests in June — is in Puerto Rico .
Will the candidates go to Puerto Rico ?
Will Iowa - type questions about ethanol be replaced with questions about Puerto Rican statehood and whether the Navy should have kept bombing Veiques ?
Who will Carlos Beltran and Pudge Rodriguez endorse ?
And how many times will they mention Roberto Clemente ?
It seems like every day there 's something new to learn about our nomination process .
VOTER TURNOUT ….Via Brendan Nyhan , here ’s a fascinating little piece of political science research that even hardened pols might want to pay attention to .
A trio of academics decided to test different ways of boosting voter turnout and discovered one sure - fire way of getting dynamite results : send out letters telling people whether they and their neighbors have voted in past elections and promising to send a followup letter after the election .
The unsubtle message is : voting records are public information , and if you do n’t vote this year your neighbors will know about it .
So do your civic duty , dammit .
Result : turnout among those who got the letters was a whopping 8.1 percentage points higher than the control group .
A sample of the letter the poli sci boffins sent out is at the right .
Now , I know what you ’re thinking : this is kind of creepy .
And sure , it is .
But 8 percentage points ?
Most campaign managers would sell their grandmothers into white slavery for that kind of an advantage .
If you could target these mailings solely to likely Democratic or Republican voters , and thereby increase turnout for your candidate by 8 points , you ’d be hailed as America ’s next political wunderkind .
And it ’s cheap , too .
If a bunch of political scientists can afford to do this , it ’s chump change for a presidential campaign .
So : who do you think is more likely to do this ?
Democrats or Republicans ?
And will they try to hide the source of the mail ( it is kind of creepy , after all ) ?
Or will they do it out in the open and just take the hit ?
Or , alternately , do it openly and then brazen it out by claiming that they ’re really performing a public service and the electorate ought to be grateful ?
Anyway , there ’s plenty of time to get cracking and have these mailings ready to go for November .
But only if you get started now .
Anyone listening ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. audio historians have discovered and played back a French inventor ’s historic 1860 recording of a folk song -- the oldest - known audio recording -- made 17 years before Thomas Edison invented the phonograph .
“ It ’s magic , ” audio historian David Giovannoni said on Thursday .
“ It ’s like a ghost singing to you . ”
Lasting 10 seconds , the recording is of a person singing “ Au clair de la lune , Pierrot repondit ” ( “ By the light of the moon , Pierrot replied ” ) -- part of a French song , according to First Sounds , a group of audio historians , recording engineers , sound archivists and others dedicated to preserving humankind ’s earliest sound recordings .
It was made on April 9 , 1860 , by Parisian inventor Edouard - Leon Scott de Martinville on a device called the phonautograph that scratched sound waves onto a sheet of paper blackened by the smoke of an oil lamp , Giovannoni said .
Giovannoni said he learned on March 1 of its existence in an archive in Paris and traveled to the French capital a week later .
Experts working with the First Sounds group then transformed the paper tracings into sound .
“ It ’s important on so many levels , ” Giovannoni said in a telephone interview .
“ It does n’t take anything away from Thomas Edison , in my opinion .
Thomas Edison is generally credited as the first person to have recorded sound . ”
“ But actually the truth is he was the first person to have recorded ( sound ) and played it back .
There were several people working along the lines of Scott , including Alexander Graham Bell , in experimenting -- trying to write the visual representation of sound before Edison invented the idea of playing it back , ” Giovannoni said .
The recording will be presented on Friday at a conference of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections at Stanford University in California , Giovannoni said .
It is also posted on the Webhere .
The U.S. experts made very high - resolution digital scans of the paper .
First Sounds said that scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California converted these scans into sound using technology developed to preserve and create access to a wide variety of early recordings .
“ It ’s like discovering the world ’s oldest photograph and learning that the photograph was taken 17 years before the invention of the camera , ” Giovannoni said .
“ In this case , the oldest sound that we can generally hear , up until today , has been from 1888 .
This predates it by 28 years . ”
Giovannoni said that phonautograph recordings were never intended to be played .
“ What Scott was trying to do was to write down some sort of image of the sound so that he could study it visually .
That was his only intent , ” Giovannoni said .

This means that Windows might be installed to an unsupported directory in the update area .
If this error occurs , you will also not be able to keep your personal files and applications during the update .
The only choice is nothing .
If you continue this path , Windows will remove all files , folders , and applications installed on your computer .
This is not a widely documented solution , so your experience may be different , but it has worked for me in the past .
This issue occurs when Windows Setup cannot find the default folders for files and applications on your computer .
By default , Windows tries to find them in the C : \ Programs directory .
However , if you installed them elsewhere , you may encounter errors .
The complete error looks like this :
You cannot save Windows settings , personal files and applications because your current version of Windows might be installed in an unsupported directory .
Case 1 : Inconsistency between the current version and the installation media
For some users , there are differences between the versions of the installation media and the installed Windows .
For example , you ca n’t use the Windows 10 Professional installation media to properly install Windows 10 Home .
Also check if your Windows is monolingual or not .
The problem can also occur if you are using 32 - bit installation media on 64 - bit Windows or vice versa .
Make sure the installation media and the current version are in the same Windows variant category .
You can see most of the information about your computer by right - clicking the This PC icon and choosing Properties .
Also use the official Windows installation media tool to complete the installation .
Case 2 : The user ’s folder was moved
On your computer , there is a user folder under drive C , namely “ C : \ Users \ ” .
This is the default setting for all Windows installations .
However , you can accidentally move your “ user ” folder that corresponds to your account .
Without this folder in the right place , Windows cannot clean up the installation , because before a new installation it is necessary to back up the lost files .
Find the folder and put it back in place .
Otherwise , you have no choice but to manually back up this folder and perform a clean install .
Case 3 : Changing registry values
There are certain values ​​in the registry .
If they are changed , it may interfere with the update or new installation .
These registry values ​​can result in an unsupported directory error .
Press Win + R and type regedit to open Registry Editor .

Catch 2,200 : 9 Propositions on the U.S. Air War for Terror
Let ’s start with a few simple propositions .
First , the farther away you are from the ground , the clearer things are likely to look , the more god - like you are likely to feel , the less human those you attack are likely to be to you .
How much more so , of course , if you , the “ pilot , ” are actually sitting at a consol at an air base near Las Vegas , identifying a “ suspect ” thousands of miles away via video monitor , “ following ” that suspect into a house , and then letting loose a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone cruising somewhere over Iraq , Afghanistan , Somalia , or the tribal areas of Pakistan .
Second , however “ precise ” your weaponry , however “ surgical ” your strike , however impressive the grainy snuff - film images you can put on television , war from the air is , and will remain , a most imprecise and destructive form of battle .
Third , in human terms , distance does not enhance accuracy .
The farther away you are from a target , the more likely it is that you will have to guess who or what it is , based on spotty , difficult to interpret or bad information , not to speak of outright misinformation ; whatever the theoretical accuracy of your weaponry , you are far more likely to miscalculate , make mistakes , mistarget , or target the misbegotten from the air .
Fourth , if you are conducting war this way and you are doing so in heavily populated urban neighborhoods , as is now the case almost every day in Iraq , then civilians will predictably die “ by mistake ” almost every day : the child who happens to be on the street but just beyond camera range ; the “ terrorist suspect ” or insurgent who looks , at a distance , like he ’s planting a roadside bomb , but is just scavenging ; the neighbors who happen to be sitting down to dinner in the apartment or house next to the one you decide to hit .
Fifth , since World War II , air power has been the American way of war .
Sixth , since November 2001 , the Bush administration has increasingly relied on air power in its Global War on Terror to “ take out ” the enemy , which has meant regular air strikes in cities and villages , and the no less regular , if largely unrecorded , deaths of civilians .
Seventh , in Afghanistan and especially in Iraq ( as well as in the tribal areas along the Pakistani border ) , the use of air power has been “ surging . ”
You can essentially no longer read an account of a skirmish or battle in one of Iraq ’s cities in which air power is not called in .
This means ( see propositions 1 — 4 ) a war of constant “ mistakes , ” and of regularly mentioned “ investigations ” into the deaths of “ militants ” and “ insurgents ” who , on the ground , seem to morph into children , women , and elderly men being pulled from the rubble .
Eighth , force creates counterforce .
The application of force , especially from the air , is a reliable engine for the creation of enemies .
It is a force multiplier ( and not just for U.S. forces either ) .
Every time an air strike is called in anywhere on the planet , anyone who orders it should automatically assume that left in its wake will be grieving , angry husbands , wives , sisters , brothers , relatives , friends — people vowing revenge , a pool of potential candidates filled with the anger of genuine injustice .
From the point of view of your actual enemies , you ca n’t bomb , missile , and strafe often enough , because when you do so , you are more or less guaranteed to create their newest recruits .
Ninth , U.S. air power has , in the last six and a half years , been an effective force in a war for terror , not against it .
Who ’s Counting ?
What does this mean in practice ?
It means something simple and relentless ; it means dead people you might not have chosen to kill , but that you are responsible for killing nonetheless — and even if you do n’t know that , or are unwilling to acknowledge it , others do know and will draw the logical conclusions .
What does this mean in practice ?
Consider just a typical collection of some of the small reports on air strikes in Iraq that have slipped into our world , barely noticed , in recent days :
Six U.S. - allied Sunni fighters from the “ Awakening ” movement were reportedly killed in strikes by an AH - 64 Apache helicopter on two checkpoints in the city of Samarra on March 22 .
( “ The U.S. military denied the checkpoint it attacked … was manned by friendly members of the so - called awakening councils and said those killed were behaving suspiciously in an area recently struck by a roadside bomb …
It … said the incident was under investigation …
AP Television News footage of the aftermath showed awakening council members loading bodies into a pickup . ” )
Fifteen people in a single family were reportedly killed by U.S. helicopters in the city of Baquba in northern Iraq on March 23rd .
( “ The US military forces were not available to comment on the reports … ” )
In Tikrit , Saddam Hussein ’s hometown , five civilians , including a judge , Munaf Mehdi , were reportedly killed and ten wounded from strikes by “ fixed - wing aircraft ” in a “ battle with suspected al - Qaeda Sunni Arab militants ” on March 26 .
( “ Preliminary assessment , ” according to the U.S. military , “ indicates that despite coalition forces ’ efforts to protect them , several civilians were injured or killed during the ensuing gunbattle . ” )
According to the Iraqi police , a U.S. plane strafed a house in the southern city of Basra , killing eight civilians , including two women and a child on March 29th .
According to Iraqi police sources , five people , including four policemen were killed and three wounded when U.S. helicopters struck the city of Hilla in southern Iraq .
According to another report , two police cars were also destroyed and an ambulance fired upon .
A U.S. F / A - 18 carried out a “ precision strike ” against a house in Basra , reportedly killing at least three civilians , two men and an elderly woman , while burying a father , mother , and young boy in the rubble on April 3rd .
( “ ‘ Coalition forces are unaware of any civilians killed in the strike but are currently looking into the matter , ’ the military said …
Associated Press Television
News showed cranes and rescue workers searching for survivors in the concrete rubble from the two - story house that was leveled in the Shiite militia stronghold of Qibla . ” )
In most of these cases , the facts remain in dispute ( if anyone , other than the U.S. military , even cares to dispute them ) ; the numbers of dead may , in the end , prove inaccurate ; and the equivalent of he says / she says is unlikely to be settled because , most of the time , no reporter will follow up or investigate .
Such cases generally follow a pattern :
The U.S. military issues a brief battle description in which so many militants / insurgents / terrorists have been taken out from the air ; local officials or witnesses claim that the dead were , in part or whole , ordinary citizens ; the U.S. military offers a denial that civilians were killed ; if the story does n’t die , the military announces that an investigation is underway , which no one generally ever hears about again .
Only on rare occasions , in our world , do such incidents actually rise to the level of real news that anyone attends to .
There may be an Iraq Coalition Casualty Count website and an Iraq Body Count website , but there is no Afghan version of the same , nor is there a global body count ( www.gbc.com) to consult on such War on Terror civilian deaths from the air .
Usually , when such events recur , there are n’t even names to put with the dead bodies and the reports themselves drop almost instantaneously beneath the waves ( of news ) without ever really catching our attention .
Even if you believe that ours is the only world that really matters , that we are the only people whose lives have real value , that does n’t mean such deaths wo n’t matter to you in the long run .
After all , what we do n’t know , or do n’t care to know , others care greatly about .
Who forgets when a loved one is suddenly killed in such a manner ?
Even if we are n’t counting bodies in the air - war subsection of the President ’s Global War on Terror , others are .
Those whom we think of , if at all , as “ collateral damage ” know just what ’s happened to them and to their neighbors .
And they have undoubtedly drawn the obvious conclusions .
Our “ Strike Weapons ” and Theirs
Here ’s the sorry reality : Such occurrences in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere in the “ arc ” of territory that the Bush administration has , in a mere few years , helped set aflame are the norm .
Our “ mistakes , ” that is , are legion and , in the process of making them , our planes , drones , and helicopters have killed villagers by the score , attacked a convoy of friendly Afghan “ elders , ” and blown away wedding parties .
For us , “ incidents ” like these pass by in an instant , but not for those who are on the receiving end .
The attacks of 9/11 are usually not placed in such a context .
We consider ourselves special , even unique , for having experienced them .
But think of them another way :
One day , out of the blue , death arrives from the air .
It arrives in a moment of ultimate terror .
It kills innocent civilians who were simply living their lives .
This happened to us once in a manner so spectacular , so devastating as to make global headlines .
But small - scale versions of this happen regularly to people in that “ arc of instability ” — and , if there were to be a global body count organization for such events , it would long ago have toted up a death toll that reached past that of September 11 , 2001 .
Let ’s remember that , after 9/11 , Americans , from the President on down , spent months , if not years in mourning , performing rites of remembrance , and swearing revenge against those who had done this to us .
Do we not imagine that others , even when the spotlight is n’t on them , react similarly ?
Do we not think that they , too , are capable of swearing revenge and acting accordingly ?
The above list of incidents covers just a couple of weeks in one embattled country — and just the moments that made it into minor news reports that I happened to stumble across .
But if you read reports from Iraq carefully these days , few describing U.S. military operations in that country seem to lack at least a sentence or two on air operations — on what is really a little noticed “ air surge ” over that country ’s cities and especially the heavily populated slum “ suburb ” of eastern Baghdad , Sadr City ( once known as Saddam City ) largely controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army militia .
With perhaps two and a half million inhabitants , if it were a separate city , it would be the country ’s second largest .
Here , for instance , are a few lines from a recent Los Angeles Times piece by Tina Susman on escalating fighting in Baghdad : “ American helicopters fired at least four Hellfire missiles and an Air Force jet dropped a bomb on a suspected militia target …
A U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad , Lt. Col.
Steven Stover , rejected Iraqi allegations that U.S. airstrikes and gunfire have killed mainly civilians .
‘ There might be some civilians that are getting caught , but for the most part , we ’re killing the bad guys . ’
‘ We ’re very precise , ’ he said , adding that many airstrikes had been called off when it was not possible to get a ‘ clean hit ’ that would avoid hitting noncombatants . ”
Or this from Sameer N. Yacoub of the Associated Press : “ The U.S. military said one of its drones launched a Hellfire missile during the night at two gunmen shooting at government forces in a different part of Sadr City . ”
Or this : “ Three US airstrikes in northeastern Baghdad have killed 12 suspected gunmen and wounded 15 civilians , Iraqi police and US military say . ”
Each of these came out while this piece was being written , as did this :
According to the AP , air strikes in a remote province of Afghanistan aimed at a warlord allied with the Taliban may have killed numerous civilians .
( “ Other provincial leaders said many civilians were killed in the hours - long clash , which included airstrikes in the remote villages of Shok and Kendal … U.S. officials and the Afghan Defense Ministry have denied that any civilians were killed . ” )
Whatever happened in these latest air attacks , the deaths of civilians are not some sideline result of the War on Terror ; they lie at its heart .
If your care is safety — a subject brought up repeatedly by Senators who wanted to know from U.S. commander General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker this week whether the surge had made “ us ” safer — then , the answer is :
This does not make you safer .
And yet , do n’t expect this counterproductive way of war to end any time soon .
After all , the Air Force already has underway its “ 2018 bomber , ” due for delivery the same year that , according to the chief American trainer of Iraqi forces , Lt. Gen.
James Dubic , the Iraqi army will theoretically be able to guard the country ’s frontiers effectively .
And do n’t forget the 2018 bomber ’s successor , “ a true ‘ next generation ’ long - range strike weapon ” that “ may be a traditional bomber or an exotic ‘ system of systems , ’ with features such as hypersonic speed . ”
Maybe by then , the Iraqis will actually be successfully defending their borders .
Until then , think of the U.S. air war for terror as a Catch 2,200 — every application of force from the air resulting in the creation of a counterforce on the ground , another kind of “ strike weapon ” for the future , while those collateral bodies pile ever higher .
Perhaps , by 2018 or 2035 , worldbodycount.com will be operative .
Note :
The invaluable website Antiwar.com was especially invaluable this time around when it came to tracking news accounts of recent U.S. air attacks .
Please note , though , that the dates given in the piece for the attacks are approximate .
All I had were the datelines on news stories , which may not reflect the actual day of each attack .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
As gasoline prices broke records in 2007 , Americans cut back on their driving for the first time in more than 20 years , according to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration .
Total travel fell 0.4 percent to 3.00 trillion miles from 3.01 trillion miles in 2006 .
In December , when U.S. retail gasoline averaged $ 3.02 a gallon , travel fell 3.9 percent to 236.6 billion miles from 246.3 billion miles in 2006 .
With gasoline prices still climbing , other data shows Americans are responding by changing their gas - guzzling habits .
Not only are they driving less , but they are buying more fuel - efficient vehicles and utilizing more public transportation .
Daily ridership on U.S. subways and public buses is at the highest level in more than 50 years .
Artful persuasion depends on eye contact , but not just any kind .
If one person prefers brief glances and the other is busy staring deeply , then it may not matter how good the jokes are or how much they both loved “ Juno . ”
Rhythm counts .
Voice cadence does , too .
People who speak in loud , animated bursts tend to feed off others who do the same , just as those who are lower key tend to relax in a cool stream of measured tones .
“ Myself , I ’m very conscious of people ’s body position , ” said Ray Allieri of Wellesley , Mass. , a former telecommunications executive with 20 years in marketing and sales .
“ If they ’re leaning back in their chair , I do that , and if they ’re forward on their elbows , I tend to move forward , ”
Psychologists have been studying the art of persuasion for nearly a century , analyzing activities like political propaganda , television campaigns and door - to - door sales .
Many factors influence people ’s susceptibility to an appeal , studies suggest , including their perception of how exclusive an opportunity is and whether their neighbors are buying it .

According to the New York Times , the Canadian government is “ ready to declare as toxic a chemical widely used in plastics for baby bottles , beverage and food containers as well as linings in food cans . ”
The chemical is called bisphenol - a , or B.P.A. , and is classified as a hormone disruptor .
Studies have linked low - dose B.P.A. exposure with permanent changes to the genital tract , increased prostate weight , a decline in testosterone , creating breast cells predisposed to cancer , prostate cells more sensitive to hormones and cancer , and hyperactivity .
Moreover , when ingested B.P.A. mimics the effects of estrogen .
“ Repeated exposure to either bisphenol - A or the natural estrogen over several days produced insulin resistance , a pre-diabetic state in which tissues lose their sensitivity to normal concentrations of insulin , ” reports Ben Harder for Science News Online .
“ Animal studies have suggested that exposure to the chemical early in life causes obesity ” and “ might contribute to gestational diabetes in women . ”
Tom Mosakowski , writing for Natural News , adds that the “ damaging effects of the chemical include impairment and unnatural changes to sex organs and their functions , increased tumor formation , hyperactivity , neurotoxin effects , and signs of early puberty . ”
A cursory glance at headlines reveal that cancer , obesity , diabetes , and hyperactivity are rampant and on the increase , thanks mostly to B.P.A. in canned foods , baby bottles , water pipes , dental sealants , plastic water and soda containers and plastic wrap , etc .
“ The National Toxicology Program , part of the National Institutes of Health , concluded that there was ‘ some concern ’ that fetuses , babies and children were in danger because bisphenol A , or BPA , harmed animals at low levels found in nearly all human bodies , ” writes Marla Cone of the Los Angeles Times .
“ An ingredient of polycarbonate plastic , BPA is one of the most widely used synthetic chemicals in industry today .
It can seep from hard plastic beverage containers such as baby bottles , as well as from liners in cans containing food and infant formula . ”
Other studies indicate very “ low doses of BPA completely inhibited the activity of estrogen .
Because estrogen normally increases the growth and regulates viability of developing neurons … these results support the idea that BPA may harm developing brain cells , ” according to Scott Belcher of the University of Cincinnati .
In short , B.P.A. is a complimentary cocktail for the dumbing down process , now well underway .
In EU dominated Europe , the level of B.P.A. is apparently not high enough .
The EU recently increased the level of exposure it considers safe for human health , or maybe that should be effective for dumbing down the commoners and increasing cancer , early puberty , obesity and diabetes , as mandated by our eugenics obsessed rulers .
In fact , if a study conducted by the Yale School of Medicine is any indication , synthetic estrogens in plastic may be a near perfect eugenics tool , as “ widely - used plastics have a detrimental effect on a developing fetus [ and ] cause fertility problems . ”
Jack Bend , a professor of pathology at the University of Western Ontario in London and one of the Canadian government ’s outside scientific advisers , told the New York Times B.P.A. “ may prove to cause damage in much the same way as early exposure to mercury . ”
But then we are told mercury is safe , even healthy for children .
If synthetic estrogens are in our food and drink — including baby bottles — maybe our rulers can phase out destructive vaccines , especially now that increasing numbers of people are learning about the link between autism and mercury - laden vaccinations .

WASHINGTON , March 26 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's positive rating has dropped to a new low of 37 percent in an NBC / Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday .
According to the poll , the New York senator 's positive rating slid 8 percentage points in two weeks and she had a negative rating of 48 percent in a week where she admitted making a mistake in claiming she had come under sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia .
Clinton 's Democratic rival , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , also saw a slight dip in his positive rating , to 49 percent from 51 percent , the poll found .
Clinton , who would be the first female U.S. president , and Obama , who would be the first black president , are in a heated battle for the Democratic nomination to face presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in November 's election .
The survey was taken after Obama gave a speech last week on race in America and rejected racially charged remarks by his pastor in Chicago of two decades , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
NBC said 32 percent of respondents said Obama " sufficiently addressed the issue " and 26 percent said he needed to say more about the Wright controversy .
More than half of those surveyed -- 55 percent -- said they were " disturbed " by the videos of Wright that were widely circulated on television and the Internet , the poll found .
In head - to - head matchups , Obama and Clinton were even at 45 percent .
In general election matchups , Obama led McCain by 44 percent to 42 percent and McCain led Clinton by 46 percent to 44 percent .
When asked which candidate could unite the country if elected , 60 percent said Obama , 58 percent said McCain and 46 percent said Clinton .
The poll of 700 registered voters was conducted on Monday and Tuesday and had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points .
NBC said its pollsters oversampled African - Americans to get a more reliable cross tabulation on questions regarding Obama 's speech on race .

DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will court the “ faith vote ” at a forum this weekend , seeking support from a sizable constituency with a major influence on U.S. politics .

Organizers say the nationally televised forum on Sunday night at Messiah College near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , will allow the candidates to discuss how their religious faith informs their positions on issues such as global poverty , AIDS , climate change and abortion .
Religion plays a much bigger role in U.S. politics than elsewhere in the developed world , reflecting Americans ’ comparatively high rates of belief and church attendance .
“ It would be unlikely anywhere else to find presidential candidates who would feel compelled to answer questions from religious groups , ” said Matthew Wilson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ In many European societies , many politicians are reluctant to discuss their faith convictions publicly but here we expect them to do so . ”
The forum will be closely watched as it comes just over a week before Pennsylvania ’s crucial Democratic primary election that the Obama camp hopes could clinch the hard - fought contest to pick the party ’s candidate to run in November ’s presidential election .
It is also aimed at a national audience .
Conspicuous in his absence will be the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , whose party has been more closely linked with the “ faith vote ” -- especially among the evangelical Protestants who account for 1 in 4 U.S. adults .
McCain declined an invitation to the forum , which was organized by Faith in Public Life , a non-partisan resource center , and is expected to draw religious activists from across the political spectrum and a range of Christian backgrounds as well as Jewish and Islamic leaders .
“ I frankly did not have the scheduling time to go there , ” McCain told reporters in Dallas .
“ I respect that forum and many other forums but I could show you a stack of requests to go to different forums around the country and I just simply can’t meet all of those . ”
The evangelical movement has been broadening its agenda beyond “ hot - button ” issues such as opposition to abortion and gay marriage that helped propel President George W. Bush to the White House by getting conservative Christian Republicans to the polls .
The forum ’s topics reflect this change and some see a missed opportunity for McCain to address liberal evangelicals .
Conservative Christians regard McCain with suspicion on many grounds , including his past support for stem cell research .
Centrist evangelical activists such as David Gushee , a theology professor at Mercer University in Atlanta , have spoken well of McCain because he has combined a staunch opposition to abortion with concern for climate change and an unflinching condemnation of torture in the U.S. fight against militants .
“ This is what is so fascinating about his no -show .
He is the one apparently who is least comfortable talking about issues of faith and how his faith might intersect with his public vision and this would give him a chance to do so , ” said Gushee , who will attend the event .
Obama and Clinton have both been more open talking about their faith in public .
DEMOCRATS AS CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS
All three presidential candidates belong to Protestant denominations -- vital credentials in a country where many expect their political leaders to have a religious and preferably Christian affiliation .
McCain was raised in the Episcopal Church but now attends a Baptist church , while Obama is with the United Church of Christ and Clinton is a Methodist .
Obama is almost sure to face renewed scrutiny at the forum over controversial sermons made by his pastor Jeremiah Wright in which he branded the United States as racist and said the September 11 attacks in 2001 were payback for its foreign policy .
Obama has largely weathered the storm , thanks partly to a widely lauded speech in which he distanced himself from Wright ’s comments .
But they still roil in the background .
Evangelical leaders say they are looking for different things from each party .
“ We want to determine the Republicans ’ interest in addressing the needs of the vulnerable , ” said Joel Hunter , an influential Florida mega - pastor who supported Mike Huckabee when the Baptist preacher and former Arkansas governor made his populist but failed bid for the Republican nomination .
“ We also want to gauge the Democrats ’ interest in community and faith - based solutions and not just handing it all off to the government , ” said Hunter , who will also be at the event .
Exit polls in some states have turned up sizable and , to some , surprising numbers of evangelical Democrats .
Exit polls from Ohio ’s primary in early March suggested that 43 percent of white evangelical voters voted Democratic .
In 2004 , Bush won about 78 percent of this vote nationwide .
The issues to be raised on Sunday are also important to Roman Catholics , a large group in Pennsylvania , many of whom have been influenced by the Vatican ’s social teachings .
According to some exit polls in Pennsylvania ’s closely contested presidential race in 2004 , Democratic Sen.
John Kerry narrowly won among Catholics .
But for the more conservative followers of the faith , Democratic candidates remain a tough sell because of their support for abortion rights .
“ The first thing I look at is whether they are pro-life or not , so there is not a lot of choice on the Democratic side , ” said Carolyn Astsalk , a Catholic who lives near Harrisburg .

If you 've been wondering how are Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails doing since they ditched their record company and decided to give away parts of their new album , Ghosts I - IV , and sell the rest for peanuts ( $ 5 , ) you need n't worry : they 're doing just fine .
In fact , 800,000 transactions in the first week have generated $ 1.6 million in revenue .
And that 's after Trent himself urged his fans to freely exchange and distribute the album via P2P .
I guess this is the final nail in the coffin of the theory that " you cannot compete with free , " but we 're sure that the music industry will keep singing that tune for quite a while .

In all the discussion of the anniversary of our invasion of Iraq , one question has yet to be asked .
Why is that so many people went along with it in the first place ?
In one sense , the answer is obvious .
The British public has always supported wars at the beginning , before their cost becomes apparent .
Whether it was the Victorian adventures in the Sudan , Ethiopia and the Boer War , the sending of troops abroad has always been accompanied by flags , cheers and bunting .
That is until the Second World War , when the country itself was threatened by invasion .
But then that is not the atmosphere in which the Iraq invasion took place .
The extraordinary thing about this war was that it took place almost without public rejoicing .
Millions took to the streets to protest .
But there were virtually no demonstrations in support nor an atmosphere of much enthusiasm in Parliament .
MPs and commentators supported the war because they supported the Prime Minister .
In that sense , the Iraq venture was almost unique in British history in that it was one man 's war – Tony Blair's .
If he had not insisted on it , there would have been few calls from others to go ahead .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
That does n't explain the poverty of the pre-war parliamentary debate , particularly when you compare it to the Falklands debate , when the enthusiasm for invasion was much more vigorous and widespread , but when every MP standing up to talk felt it incumbent to discuss the issue in grave , and even moral , terms and to consider the options .
It did not happen this time partly because Parliament and the media no longer " do " options .
With large parliamentary majorities and the decline in the advisory role of the civil service , there is no discussion of alternatives and was n't in this case .
Even those who favoured invasion as a means of getting rid of Saddam Hussein never looked into what alternatives there could have been , let alone took any interest in the appalling disaster that was the sanctions regime on Iraq over the previous decade .
There were voices from the inside warning of the dangers , but in the general mood of war acceptance they were easily ignored .
There is a generational point , too , to explain the contrasting tenor of the Falkland and Iraq debates .
New Labour and the post -1997 intake was filled largely with what might be called the " jammy generation " , a group that on the whole had had life very easy .
Not a few had been parachuted into their seats , most had come from a background in politics , media , advertising and research with a political career in mind .
They had views on economics and society , but no particular sense of what was right and wrong in the big judgements .
Effectiveness is what mattered and it is still in terms of effectiveness that the Iraq war is almost exclusively discussed today .
The people on the demonstrations thought it was a matter of principle and morality .
The people inside the Commons , with a few honourable exceptions , did not .
Even the influx of women MPs , which some had hoped might alter the framework of debate , did n't and it was n't only because , being new to the game , they were over - anxious to play by the male rules .
The strongest voices against the war among women came from the older generation of Mo Mowlam and Clare Short , not Blair 's babes .
But the main reason that so many went along with the Iraqi venture was that they felt no reason not to .
It all seemed so easy and so apparently costless .
No one expected many casualties , nor a huge burden on the taxpayer .
The downside risk was not that we would n't win but that we would win too easily and that anyone who opposed the war would thus appear cowardly and anti-democratic .
And in their way of thinking they were right .
The occupation is now seen as a terrible failure , but the overthrow of Saddam was achieved at relatively little cost .
The loss of British lives , in Iraq and in Afghanistan , has been pretty much taken for granted .
The same with money .
The figures on the expenditure on Iraq and Afghanistan have risen , but at no point in any Budget have they been sufficient to be treated as a constraint on other expenditure .
Of course , the experience of Iraq has put people off the idea of humanitarian intervention .
But the main impact has been on the Iraqis themselves , rather than people back home , except in terms of occasional terror .
That is what worries me .
I fear the British , in their hearts , still believe our military is second to none and that we can win any war with ease and at not much cost to ourselves .
We still have every right , and the overwhelming military superiority , to intervene where we think it fitting ; it was only that we did n't get the post - planning correct on this occasion .
Next time it happens , Parliament will go along with it , just as it did five years ago .

It looks like public access to the Home beta on the PlayStation 3 may be coming soon .
Scans of what is claimed to be the latest issue of PlayStation :
The Official Magazine from the US have emerged on the PlayStation forums that quote SCEA 's senior director of PSN , Susan Panico , as saying , ?
We?ll be opening up the Home beta to the public very soon and hope to see you there .?
The scan also shows Panico saying , ?
It puts a human face onto social networking , but in this case , the social structure is based on a common passion ?
games .
It ?s made for gamers by gamers .
The initial goal for Home is to facilitate communication and enhance the game experience .
Home allows people to strategize , launch into games , and come back into Home to talk about it .
Its core value is a ' For the people , of the people , by the people ' philosophy and we want to achieve this in the most entertaining way possible .
" Sounds nice , does n't it ?
Of course , there 's always the possibility that the scans are fake .
The poster attracted criticism thanks to the magazine allegedly being the May edition , but several other posters have chimed in to say they also received the magazine .
It 's also standard practice in publishing to put the month after an issue is released on the cover .
SPOnG contacted Sony for confirmation , but no comment was available at the time of press .
On Tibet Frontlines , Protestors ' Shot Like Dogs '
There are unconfirmed reports from Tibet of killings by Chinese troops .
DHARAMSALA , India , March 17 , 2008  --
The Chinese military is shooting Tibetan demonstrators " like dogs , " a Tibetan exile group said Monday , firing " indiscriminately " intro groups of people protesting Chinese rule .
The accusation was leveled by the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy , a group run by exiled Tibetans in Dharamsala , India , home to the Dalai Lama .
Exile groups in India receive some of the few reports from inside Tibet and have provided some of the only reporting from there since last Monday , when the most significant Tibetan protests in 20 years began .
" People have been saying they 're shooting our people like dogs , " Tenzin Norgay , the spokesman for the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy , told ABC News , citing his sources inside Tibet .
He spoke just a few hours after a deadline set by the Chinese government expired for the protestors to stop or face a crackdown .
The protests , he says , continued , and so did the retaliation .
" From reports we have been able to gather , the military forces , they do not tolerate anything more than a few minutes and then immediately they begin shooting or beating .
And if the crowd goes out of control they shoot indiscriminately , " Norgay said .
News Blackout
He said his group had confirmed that 55 protestors had been shot to death in the last few days .
The Tibetan government in exile , which is seated in Dharamsala , maintains that it has confirmed at least 80 deaths in the capital of Lhasa alone during one week of protests .
If the Chinese military is in fact shooting into crowds , the accusation is impossible to prove .
The Chinese government has kicked all journalists out of the region and exiled groups ' sources are anonymous and refuse to speak directly to the media for fear of their safety .
The Chinese government denies shooting protestors over the last week , saying that Tibetans themselves are at fault .
The " atrocities of the Tibetan independence forces manifested ... the hypocrisy and deceit of its peace and non-violence propaganda , " foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said , according to the Associated Press .
" The Chinese government will unwaveringly protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
" Unwavering " for China has clearly meant a massive mobilization of soldiers and police to quell the protests .
ABC
News witnessed hundreds of buses filled with soldiers , rumbling along the road to Tibet on Monday , hours before the deadline expired .
But the protestors themselves have also been unwavering , and seem to be more aggressive than ever .
They have burned buildings , attacked cars with baseball bats and thrown rocks at Chinese authorities .
Those methods have long been used by revolutionaries around the world , but never so often by Tibetans .
And as the actions and rhetoric on both sides rose over the last week , a fault line within the Tibetan independence movement has been exposed .
The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the movement , the living God who won a Nobel Peace Prize for advancing non-violent protest in Tibet .
But the 72 - year - old 's faith in Gandhian resistance has left some of his followers frustrated .
' Issue Has to Do With Every Tibetan '
" He is the leader , yes , but every single Tibetan has the responsibility " to fight for independence , Tsewang Rigzin , the president of the Tibetan Youth Congress , told reporters in Dharamsala .
" The issue of Tibet is not an issue of an individual or an individual organization .
The issue of Tibet has to do with every single Tibetan . "
He sat in front of a sign that read " Rise Up , Resist , Return . "
Unlike the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan Youth Congress stands for aggressive protest .
Unlike the Dalai Lama , it stands for Tibetan independence from China and not just autonomy .
And unlike the Dalai Lama , it believes that China should be stripped of the Olympics .
" There is a growing frustration within the Tibetan community , especially the younger generation , " Rigzin said .
" His holiness ' brand of ' middle way ' has been in existence for the last 20 years .
And as of right now , nothing has come of it whatsoever . "
The Dalai Lama has stuck to his principles .
" Particularly in our case , " he said during a press conference on Sunday , " violence is almost like suicide . "
But he pointedly did not condemn the protesters ' actions during the press conference .
He said he did n't have the power to stop the demonstrations , though he admitted that he'd received requests not to intervene .
" Generally , Tibetans follow , I think quite sincerely , non-violent peaceful " protest , he told reporters .
" Of course , individual human beings , emotions become out of control , and [ that leads to ] violent actions .
So this is possible . "
Asked by ABC
News whether he supported the demonstrators and had the power to stop them , the Dalai Lama parried , saying , " I have no such power . "
Perhaps he is not standing in the way because he and his advisers realize this is a moment the Tibet movement needs to seize .
The Summer Olympics begin in only five months .
Never have so many eyes been on China .
And it seems that never has he been so impressed by the possibilities of this week 's protests .
When the Dalai Lama heard the Chinese impose a deadline to the protestors , he said , " I got the same sort of mental state which I experienced in 1959 . "
That is an extremely significant year for the Tibetan people — the year the Dalai Lama fled to India , and the year Tibetans tried to seize their homeland through force .
" One side , Chinese military determined to crush .
Other side , Tibetan side also , determined to resist that , " he said .
Emotions have never been higher here .
Lobsang Tsering , a 28 - year - old monk , left Tibet in 1989 to move to a monestary in Dharamsala .
He has been following the protests in Tibet closely .
Situation in Lhasa
" So many people have been killed in Lhasa .
Yesterday 15 were killed in Amdho .
And yet the protesters continue , with only a photo of the Dali Lama and the Tibetan flags as their weapons .
They have no guns .
The Chinese have the guns , " he said .
While being interviewed he and another monk received a call from one of their friends in Tibet .
The caller described a scene of violence unfold right in front of his eyes .
" The police are beating 70 people , " the called said .
" One policeman just hit a monk 's head with a baton .
The monk is bleeding right now . "
As he continued describing the scene , the violence turned worse .
" Oh !
Just now , two people were killed .
I saw it right in front of me . "
Tsering was inconsolable .
Speaking a few hours before the Chinese deadline , he feared that the violence would only get worse .
" If the Chinese shoot bullets into the Tibetans , the feeling is felt in the heart of those of us in exile , " he said .
He started crying , and hugged a visiting reporter .
" When I think about the news from the last couple of days , I feel mad .
I do n't know what to do . "
On December 23 , 2005 CanWest MediaWorks launched a legal challenge against the Canadian government 's ban on direct - to - consumer advertising of prescription drugs .
CanWest's Legal Claim
The company 's statement of claim in the Ontario Superior Court names the Attorney General of Canada as the defendent to an action that challenges the the constitutionality of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations that ban direct - to - consumer ( " DTC " ) advertising of prescription drugs .
A legal firm summarises that statement of claim as being that " the challenged provisions are inconsistent with section 2 ( b ) of the Charter that guarantees freedom of expression .
Such advertising is permitted in the U.S. , and Canadians are currently exposed to DTC through U.S. media sources .
The media company has taken the position that the safety concerns addressed by the challenged provisions could be addressed within new legislation that conforms to the Charter and which does not discriminate against Canadian media outlets . " [ 1 ]
( The Court File number is 05 - W - 303001 PD2 ) .
In a CanWest MediaWorks media release , which is not available on their website , the company states that " The current advertising restrictions are unfair , ineffective and discriminatory ...
Canadians are already inundated by American advertisements , making the issue one of ' basic business fairness ' between the two markets ...
Before replacing existing regulations on direct - to - consumer advertisements , the government should first consider whether present guidelines violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms . " [ 2 ]
CanWests Remedy Dismissed
Barbara Mintzes , from the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research at the University of British Columbia , argues that there is a need for better enforcement of the existing legislation .
" CanWest 's solution is to get rid of the law .
This is like saying that if corner stores are getting away with selling cigarettes to 13 year olds , we might as well get rid of the age restrictions , " she told the British Medical Journal . [ 3 ]

What do Cliff Stearns , John Shimkus and Fred Upton have in common ?
They 're all members of the House telecommunications subcommittee , and they 've each publicly accused Google of having " duped " the Federal Communications Commission by " gaming " a recent multibillion - dollar auction of wireless frequencies , shortchanging federal coffers .
They also have this in common : Each has received more than $ 100,000 in campaign contributions over their careers from telephone and cable interests locked in a battle with Google over the use of those frequencies .
AT&T is each of the lawmaker 's top career campaign contributor , donating more than $ 200,000 to the candidates during their tenures in office , according to the Center For Responsive Politics ' OpensSecrets.org website .
Verizon , BellSouth , and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , the principal trade association of the cable television industry , we other major campaign contributors .
The frequencies auction raised almost $ 20 billion for the federal government , about twice the amount expected before bidding began in January .
The congressmen , however , assert that the government could have netted even more if the F.C.C. had used different auction rules .
They have not called for the auction to be invalidated .
Steve Tomaszewski , a spokesman for Shimkus , said the lawmaker was concerned that Google " played fast and loose with the spirit of the rules , " adding that he was " sure " that AT&T 's campaign contributions " did not have anything to do with his comments . "
Representatives of Stearns and Upton did n't respond promptly to requests for comment .
Verizon Wireless won the auction for the coveted C block licenses in March with a $ 4.7 billion bid .
Its bid came after Google met the $ 4.6 billion reserve price , triggering F.C.C. rules requiring the winner of the spectrum to let customers mix and match wireless handsets and applications on any service using those frequencies .
The lawmakers argue that Google acted in bad faith by never intending to win the auction outright , but intending instead to simply trigger the " open access " provisions .
This , they contend , deprived taxpayers of billions of dollars , because Google did n't have to win the auction to achieve its goal , and because other major bidders – including AT&T as well as Verizon Wireless – were reluctant to offer more because the " open access " provision would deny them the monopoly right to sell electronics that operate on those frequencies .
In testimony before the subcommittee , F.C.C. Chairman Kevin Martin , also a Republican , denied that his agency had been duped .
" My goal was to make sure that whoever won the C - block had an open platform , " he said .
Google supported the open access because it would let consumers use any wireless device or software on the system as long as it does n't harm the network .
That would benefit Google , which is ramping up its Android open source mobile platform .
Established wireless interests are none too excited by that prospect , because it could break their stranglehold on how consumers use cellphones .
Verizon has not commented on the congressmen 's charges , but Google dismissed them .
" Consumers were the big winner in the auction , not any company , " said Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich .
" This auction generated not only a record amount for the U.S.
Treasury , but also historic new rights for wireless consumers as a direct result of Google 's bidding .
By any measure , that 's a huge success for consumers , and we 're proud of our role in helping make that happen . "
Art Brodsky , spokesperson for Public Knowledge , a consumer rights group that lobbied for the open access rules , called the lawmakers ' charges " ridiculous . "
" The F.C.C. wanted Google to enter the auction more than Google wanted to enter it , " Brodsky said .
" Google put in a bid sufficient to trigger open access provisions that will help consumers , " he said .
Silicon Valley - based tech analyst Rob Enderle also scoffed at the lawmakers ' charges , noting that Google is currently sitting on a $ 15 billion cash hoard .
" If Google had won the auction they would have paid , but they got the result they wanted for free , " Enderle said .
" And I doubt anyone involved did n't realize what their goal was . "

The promise of piezoelectric fiber pairs
Piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires make electricity :
The gold - coated layer scrubs the other layer .

Nanotechnology researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are developing a shirt that harvests energy from the wearer 's physical motion and converts it into electricity for powering small electronic devices worn by soldiers in the field , hikers and other users .
The research , funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and described in the Feb. 14 issue of Nature , details how pairs of textile fibers covered with zinc oxide nanowires generate electricity in response to applied mechanical stress .
Known as " the piezoelectric effect , " the resulting current flow from many fiber pairs woven into a shirt or jacket could allow the wearer 's body movement to power a range of portable electronic devices .
The fibers could also be woven into curtains , tents or other structures to capture energy from wind motion , sound vibration or other mechanical energy .
" The two fibers scrub together just like two bottle brushes with their bristles touching , and the piezoelectric - semiconductor process converts the mechanical motion into electrical energy , " says Zhong Lin Wang , a Regents professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
" Many of these devices could be put together to produce higher power output . "
Wang and collaborators Xudong Wang and Yong Qin have made more than 200 of the fiber nanogenerators .
Each is tested on an apparatus that uses a spring and wheel to move one fiber against the other .
The fibers are rubbed together for up to 30 minutes to test their durability and power production .
The researchers have measured current of about four nanoamperes and output voltage of about four millivolts from a nanogenerator that included two fibers that were each one centimeter long .
With a much improved design , Wang estimates that a square meter of fabric made from the special fibers could theoretically generate as much as 80 milliwatts of power .
So far , there is only one wrinkle in the fabric , so to speak - washing it .
Zinc oxide is sensitive to moisture , so in real shirts or jackets , the nanowires would have to be protected from the effects of the washing machine .
The research was funded by NSF's Division of Materials Research .
" This multi- disciplinary research grant enables materials scientists and engineers from varied backgrounds to work together towards translating basic and applied research into viable technologies , " said NSF Program Manager Harsh Deep Chopra .
The research was also sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Emory - Georgia Tech Nanotechnology Center for Personalized and Predictive Oncology .

You know how we love the electric cars around here , but internal combustion sure does sound sexy -- a big V - 8 literally brings the noise in a way the nearly - silent whir of an electric motor can't hope to match .
Well , it looks like the mad geniuses behind the $ 80,000 Fisker Karma plug - in hybrid have hit upon an appropriately high - tech solution : speakers placed inside and out that allow drivers to give their rides any sound they want , including one described as " like something between a Formula One car and a jet plane . "
Interesting , to be sure -- but seeing as the Karma can hit 125 mph and go from 0 - 60 in six seconds , we'd be happier if that rig just screamed at people to get out of the left lane .

Hello ;
Over the last few months , the Epiphany development team has been discussing the future of the Gnome web browser .
We feel that we have n't been living up to the full potential of a well - integrated Gnome application , due to both internal and external constraints .
The Epiphany user interface is built on top of an abstraction layer above the web rendering engine , enabling us to support multiple back - ends .
Currently Epiphany supports the Mozilla browser engine ( Gecko ) , and the WebKit engine .
The Epiphany dependency on Gecko creates a number of problems for us .
The Gecko release cycle is very long ( e.g. Gecko 1.8 was released with Firefox 1.5 in 2005 ; 1.8.1 with Firefox 2.0 in 2006 and 1.9 will be released sometime this year with Firefox 3.0 ) , prone to delays and not synchronised with the unvarying 6 - month Gnome release cycle .
Furthermore , it and the feature work on Gecko are mostly driven by the Firefox browser , our main competitor on the Gnome desktop .
Also the embedding API of Gecko ( GtkMozEmbed ) has been unmaintained and stagnant for a long time .
Finally , the current plans for " Mozilla 2.0 " bring much uncertainty to us , as well as much work to account for their proposed big API changes .
We are a small team , with only one maintainer and a hand - full of regular contributors .
Maintaining the abstraction layer , and the Gecko back - end require lot of effort and time .
Much time alone is spent on keeping up with Gecko API changes , and we have not had much contributions to the Gecko back - end in a long time .
Therefore we have decided to radically change the future of Epiphany in the upcoming 2.24 development cycle .
We will drop the abstraction layer , making the code more maintainable , allowing faster development and enabling us to take advantage of the features of the back - end directly .
Furthermore , we will choose only one web engine back - end to support and concentrate our efforts on it instead of spreading our efforts to multiple back - ends and restricting us to the common features all back - ends support .
This single back - end will be * WebKit *.
We see several advantages in WebKit .
These include : * The WebKit APIs .
The API has been designed from the ground up , and feels like any other GObject based API .
A two - way GObject bindings to the web page 's DOM , and to JavaScript is in development ; this will allow us and our Extensions to access the DOM directly , which has n't been possible before in Epiphany in either C or Python .
* WebKit uses Gnome technologies directly .
Similarly to Gecko , it uses Cairo for graphics , and Pango for the rendering .
On top of that , it uses libsoup for the network layer , and GStreamer for the < video > and < audio > tag support in HTML5 .
* Starting in time for Gnome 2.24 , WebKit / GTK + will implement a 6 - month release cycle synchronised with the Gnome release schedule .
*
We feel that WebKit has the momentum , and can bring more developers to both Epiphany directly and the Gnome platform by extension .
WebKit / GTK + already has more people working on it than are working on either GtkMozEmbed or the Epiphany gecko back - end .
* WebKit is a better match for * other * uses in Gnome , e.g. as a HTML widget in Yelp , in Devhelp , and as an editor in Evolution replacing GtkHTML .
We will propose WebKit as an approved external dependency for Gnome .
In case that we are unable to complete this development in time for 2.24.0 , we will delay the new Epiphany to 2.26 .
For this end , we will maintain the gnome - 2 - 22 branch in a state that allows us to potentially make the 2.24.0 release off of that branch .

“ This is the miracle of not having securities mapped to the underlying loans , ” said Josh Rosner , a specialist in mortgage securities at Graham - Fisher , an independent research firm in New York .
“ There is no industry repository for mortgage loans .
I have heard of instances where the same loan is in two or three pools . ”
The process of putting together a mortgage pool begins when a home loan is originated by a bank or mortgage lender .
That loan is typically sold to a Wall Street firm that pools it with thousands of others .
Once a pool is packaged , it is sold to investors in different slices , based on risk .
A trustee bank oversees the pool ’s operations , ensuring that payments made by borrowers go to the appropriate investors .
Lawyers who represent troubled borrowers complain that trustees overseeing home loan pools often do not produce proof , usually in the form of a mortgage note , that their investors own a foreclosed property .
And a recent study of 1,733 foreclosures by Katherine M. Porter , an associate professor of law at the University of Iowa , found that 40 percent of the creditors foreclosing on borrowers did not show proof of ownership .
Such proof gives a creditor standing to foreclose against a borrower and is required by law .
“ The big issue in all these cases , whether we are dealing with a bankruptcy court , a state court or a federal court , is who really owns the mortgage note , and that is allegedly what they securitized , ” said O. Max Gardner III , a lawyer who represents borrowers in foreclosure in Shelby , N.C. “ A collateral question is , has that mortgage note really been transferred and assigned to the securitization trust ?
If not , then they really do n’t have standing .
It ’s Law School 101 . ”
When a loan goes into a securitization , the mortgage note is not sent to the trust .
Instead it shows up as a data transfer with the physical note being kept at a separate document repository company .
Such practices keep the process fast and cheap .
Because most foreclosures proceed without challenges from borrowers , few judges have forced trustees like Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York to prove ownership by producing a mortgage note in each case .
Borrower advocates cheered Judge Boyko ’s ruling .
The plaintiff ’s argument that “ ‘ Judge , you just do n’t understand how things work , ’ ” the judge wrote , “ reveals a condescending mindset and quasi- monopolistic system where financial institutions have traditionally controlled , and still control , the foreclosure process . ”
The cases could be filed again in state court , however .

10 - year - old forced to lick teacher 's toes

No sexual gratification , so no criminal charges yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 10 - year - old Atlanta - area boy was forced to kiss and lick his teacher 's toes .
And though the teacher , Jody Kilpatrick of Temple Elementary School in Carroll County , has apologized for the incident , a preliminary investigation found no criminal intent since she apparently received no sexual gratification from the physical contact .
The child told investigators his classmates physically restrained him and forced him to kiss his teachers feet  and the teacher went along with the abuse .
" Ms. Kilpatrick asked [ my son ] , did he want to see her toes , and he was , like , okay , I 'll look at your toes , " explained Denise Strozier , the boy 's mother .
" So , a student that was his friend and another student took his hands and put them down , behind his back , and she stood there and allowed these children to push my son to the ground , and he licked her toes .
And she gave him candy . "
Later , the teacher , as well as one of the students , signed the child 's yearbook , with messages openly joking about what happened that day .
Chief Deputy Brad Robinson told a local TV news crew that investigators have concluded , preliminarily , that the teacher 's intent was not criminal because there is no evidence she sought to derive any sexual gratification , which he said is key to prosecutors seeking to prove wrongdoing in cases involving physical contact between teachers and children .
But Strozier wants the teacher fired .
" Outrage doesnt begin to describe how I feel right now , " she said .
" It s like a game to her .
It s a joke to her . "
Robinson believes Strozier 's complaint is an issue for the school board to address rather than the sheriff 's office .
The Carroll County school superintendents office is investigating , and declined to comment .
The Georgia Professional Standards Commission 's code of ethics for teachers states " An educator should demonstrate conduct that follows generally recognized professional standards . "
Unethical conduct includes " committing any act of child abuse " and " encouraging an inappropriate physical relationship . "
" I do n't know what to say .
I 'm just literally dumb - founded that this has happened in my son's school , " Strozier said .
The Carroll County district attorneys office will make the final decision on whether to indict the teacher later this month .
The school board will decide whether to discipline her .

You have just been arrested for robbing a shop with a shotgun and dragged to the local police station .
A sergeant takes a cloth helmet bristling with electrodes and pulls it over your head .
Pictures of the crime scene are flashed before you on a computer screen : an image of the shopkeeper victim ; a picture of a man standing in the store ; a photo of the gun used in the hold - up .
You remain silent - but to no avail , for your brain has already revealed your complicity by emitting tiny electrical signals as each image matches your own memories of the robbery that you recently committed .
It sounds fantastic .
Nevertheless , such scenes have already been played out in lawyers ' offices and police stations in America as the fledgling technique of brain fingerprinting has been introduced to solve crimes .
Success suggests that in the near future criminals may betray their guilt - not through physical evidence but through their own unconscious thoughts .
' People remember the major events in their life , even a serial killer , ' said Lawrence Farwell , the inventor of brain fingerprinting .
' That tends to have a solid record in the brain . '
Unlike discredited lie - detecting techniques , which measure changes in breathing , heart rate and other variables to determine if suspects are trying to deceive their interrogators , brain fingerprinting is designed to discover if specific information is stored in a person 's brain .
The technique exploits the fact that the brain emits an electrical signal known as a P300 exactly 300 milliseconds after it is confronted with a stimulus that has special significance to that individual - for example , a victim 's face .
' The fundamental difference between the perpetrator of a crime and an innocent person is that the former has the details of it stored in his brain , ' added Farwell .
' The innocent suspect does not . '
Thus a robber will inadvertently emit a P300 signal - which can be picked up using electrodes fitted to his skull - when shown an image of his victim or the gun he used to rob him .
An innocent person who has never met the victim or used a gun will not emit such signal .
Farwell told The Observer he had already used the technique with total success in mock crimes created using FBI agents in order to reveal those who possessed knowledge hidden from others .
He believes the technique could have vital criminal and security uses .
A terrorist attempting to hijack and crash a jumbo jet would reveal his intent through his reactions to photographs of aircraft cockpits , for example .
Farwell - who has received substantial US government backing - has now set up his own company , Brain Fingerprinting Laboratories , to market the technique , though his technology is not without critics .
Prof Peter Rosenfeld , of Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , believes that not enough attention has been paid to factors that could distort the outcomes of brain fingerprint profiles .
Memories change over time , as he points out .
And it could be discovered that psychopaths have very different responses than others .
' It will take a substantial amount of research before this is ready , ' Rosenfeld told the journal Nature .
Nevertheless , brain fingerprinting has already claimed several legal successes , including the case of Terry Harrington who was given a life sentence after being convicted of a night watchman 's murder in Iowa in 1978 .
Farwell showed Harrington 's electronic brain patterns were not consistent with someone who had been present at the crime scene .
The evidence was rated as admissible at a post - conviction hearing and played a key role in having Harrington freed late last year .
But now brain fingerprinting faces its most controversial case .
A few weeks ago , Farwell used his technique to show that Jimmy Ray Slaughter - convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his daughter Jessica and his partner Melody - lacked any knowledge of key details about the crime scene , including the positions of the victims ' bodies .
Nevertheless , prosecutors last month asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set an execution date for Slaughter .
Brain fingerprinting is now expected to play a key role in attempts to block his execution .
There are tons of Star Wars products out there .

I 've been to Russia now four times , and one of the most interesting and unusual retail practices in stores there is the Russian sales clerks ' habit of tearing almost every sales receipt before they hand it to you or set it down on the counter ( see picture above ) .
Supposedly , this practice goes back to the Soviet days , when most
stores had the merchandise behind counters and glass cases .
To make a purchase , you would ask an employee to get the merchandise for you and prepare a sales receipt , which you take to a second employee / cashier .
After you paid , you would take the receipt back to the first employee to pick up your stuff .
Then that employee would tear the receipt , to finalize the transaction , and prevent customers from trying to come back and get a second item later for free .
Although no longer necessary , the " receipt - tearing " practice continues to this day at almost every retail store in Russia out of an old Soviet - era habit !
Makes it a little inconvenient when you need to present receipts back in the USA for reimbusement !
If you believe urban legends and folklore , the Earth is littered with portals , doors , gates and other forms of ingress to that fiery supernatural underworld commonly known as Hell .
There was even one on my undergraduate college campus : Kenyon College 's " Gates of Hell " are nothing more than twin stone edifices that demark North Campus from South Campus , but it 's said that if you touch the phallic post in the middle of them at midnight , it 's straight to Hell for you :
Somewhat more famously , there 's also one in New Jersey ( a system of drainage tunnels ) , though films like Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate and video games like Doom 3 portray such portals in more classical form ; ie , complete with demons , licking flames , creepy music , etc .
But Door to Hell enthusiasts do n't have to settle for a lousy stone post or make - believe movies anymore -- because the world - at - large recently found out about a real Door to Hell .
But do n't start packing an overnight bag yet , intrepid traveler ; located deep in the remote desert of Darvaza in Turkmenistan , in a region difficult to obtain permission to visit , hundreds of meters from a road and ringed by dunes and rises that shield it from view , is this :
Yep , that 's a big fiery hole .
And it 's been burning for more than 35 years , thanks to some Russian prospectors who knocked it open , noticed it was full of poison gas and decided it would be a good idea to light a match , so that the gas could " burn off . "
( As you can see , that did n't work so well . )
Measuring about 50 meters by 20 meters , it generates enough heat that you can only stand near its lip for a few minutes .
Locals claim that animals are mesmerized by it , and it attracts countless moths and other insects to its flame at night , the only time it 's visible from far away .
Website English Russia tells the story of its discovery ( somewhat charmingly ) this way :
Once the geologists were drilling for gas .
Then suddenly during the drilling they have found an underground cavern , it was so big that all the drilling site with all the equipment and camps got deep deep under the ground .
None dared to go down there because the cavern was filled with gas .
So they ignited it so that no poisonous gas could come out of the hole , and since then , it 's burning , already for 35 years without any pause .
Nobody knows how many tons of excellent gas has been burned for all those years but it just seems to be infinite there .
And there 's even a video !
Watch and be amazed :
In case you 're feeling Hella intrepid , here 's a Google Map of the DtH .

Nuclear plants can fail when the heat from the reactor is not removed quickly enough from the core .
This can happen in pressurised water nuclear reactors if the water in the cooling system boils , because steam is a much poorer conductor of heat than liquid water .
These reactors have a primary water cooling system that directly takes heat away from the reactor .
It is sealed under huge pressure to prevent it boiling and conducts heat to a secondary water cooling system that is not sealed .
But this secondary system is also at risk of boiling .
If that happens , heat builds up in the primary cooling system , which can lead to meltdown .
Ronald Baney and colleagues at the University of Florida in Gainesville , think they can tackle this problem by turning to diamond â€ “ one of the best heat conductors known to science .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Their idea is to add diamond nanoparticles to the water of the secondary cooling system to dramatically improve its ability to transfer heat .
Baney and colleagues say such nanoparticles are chemically inert and radiation resistant , so are unlikely to clump together in a way that could block the cooling system .
However , they do n't say how much a diamond - based heat transfer fluid might cost .

The Pirate Bay has just launched jesperbay.org as a countermeasure to the Danish ISP block that was announced yesterday .
The site is named after Jesper Bay , the head of the Danish IFPI and gives detailed instructions for affected customers on how to regain access to The Pirate Bay .
Pirate Bay co-founder Brokep told TorrentFreak about the domain name : “ We ’ll associate his name with something positive instead of his negative IFPI vibe . ”
The Pirate Bay team is also asking fellow BitTorrent admins to help out , by redirecting all customers from Tele2 , to The Jesper Bay .
They have written a piece of code that will redirect all the users from Tele2 to The Jesper Bay , so they can change their DNS .
The ruling of IFPI vs. Tele2 was officially released a few hours ago ( translation included at the end of this post ) .
It concludes that the ISP - Tele2 - assist in copyright infringement because they give their customers access to The Pirate Bay , therefore they have to prevent access to the site .
A dangerous ruling , which is expected to result in Pirate Bay being blocked by other Danish ISPs , similar to what happened in the AllofMP3 case last year .
However , it does not end there , other divisions of the IFPI throughout Europe have already announced that they will start similar cases .
Today , the IFPI in Norway and Finland announced that they too are considering taking action against Internet providers .
The executive director of IFPI Finland , Arto AlaspÃ¤Ã¤ , announced that they are considering taking action against ISPs in Finland : “ Similar block petitions are likely to be used in Finland , ” he said .
AlaspÃ¤Ã¤ was soon followed by his Norwegian colleague , Marte Thorsby , who told Dagbladet .
no : “ The verdict is very positive for us .
We have to see if we can get this to Norway as well . ”
Sebastian Gjerding , spokesperson for the Danish pro-piracy lobby Piratgruppen , told Torrent Freak yesterday : “ It ’s very frightening that the IFPI can get through the courts with something like this .
In Turkey and China its the state that decides what information the people can access and what should be censored .
In Denmark its apparently the record industry . ”
For now , Jesperbay makes it pretty easy to lift the block .
Let ’s hope Tele2 will appeal against the IFPI , so it only has to be a temporary solution .

Deimos , the administrator of Demonoid has announced that he is stepping down for good due to his preoccupation with ' real - life ' issues .
For those tearing their hair out with dismay , you can stop now .
The site will be resurrected under a trusted new admin and Deimos is asking the community to give him support .
Ever since Demonoid had to leave Canada , there has been speculation about the future of the site .
Although the tracker has been returning periodically from various places – the latest being Ukraine – no solid news has been coming out about a proper comeback .
Deimos , the Demonoid admin , has been very quiet – until now , that is .
In a message on the SubDemon forums , Deimos breaks his silence :
Hello Everyone ,
It is with great sadness ( and not a little relief ) that I announce that I will be stepping down as admin of Demonoid , with effect from today .
Demonoid is currently suffering from a number of things , prime amongst these being my distraction with real - world issues , and so I have handed the reins over to a new administrator – a close friend of mine , which I trust completely and has the knowledge and time to take care of the site .
He will , in due course , be making his own announcements about the future of Demonoid .
Of course , speculation over the future of the site is fun , but it is ultimately fruitless – you will all , in the near future , become aware of what the future holds .
I trust that you will all give your support to the new admin as he finds his feet while he resurrects Demonoid .
Thanks again for your support in making Demonoid what it was and is .
Goodbye and good wishes – it has been a blast !
– Deimos
It ’s great news for the BitTorrent community that the future of Demonoid is in trusted hands and for some , quite a surprise after such a long wait .
But it just might be worth it if one of the world ’s most popular trackers does indeed come back with a bang .
Update : The Demonoid RSS feeds started to work again .
THE business of memory is a solid and solemn thing .
Plaques are unveiled on the wall ; stone memorials are built in the square ; the domed mausoleum rises brick by brick over the city .
But the business of memory is also as elusive as water or mist .
The yellowing photographs slide to the back of the drawer ; the voices fade ; and the last rememberers of the dead die in their turn , leaving only what Thomas Hardy called “ oblivion 's swallowing sea ” .
The approach of the death of Lazare Ponticelli therefore caused something of a panic in France .
This derdesders , “ the last of the last ” , was for a while the only man in the country who remembered the first world war because he had fought in it .
The suburb of Kremlin - Bicetre , where he lived , had like most other communities in France a memorial to the war dead .
But , more important , it had Mr Ponticelli , who up to his 111th year appeared every November 11th in his flat cap and brown coat , lean and bright - eyed , gamely managing the few steps required to lay his small bunch of carnations there .
The most astonished and serious observers were always children , to whom — if they wanted — he would tell his stories .
Successive presidents of France strove to honour Mr Ponticelli .
It was a way of detaining all the other shadows he represented : the 8.4 m workmen , peasants and common folk who , in pointed steel helmets and flapping greatcoats , had gloriously defended the fatherland as poilus , or foot - soldiers , between 1914 and 1918 .
Jacques Chirac suggested a state funeral for him and perhaps interment in the Pantheon , alongside Rousseau and Voltaire .
Nicolas Sarkozy proposed a mass at Les Invalides .
Mr Ponticelli wanted none of that : no procession , no racket , pas de tapage important .
He was grateful for his belated Légion d'Honneur , which he kept with his other medals in a shoe - box .
But he was keenly aware that he drew such attention only because he was the last .
What had become of the others ?
The stretcher - bearers in the Argonne , for example , who had told him they did n't dare leave the trench for fear of German fire .
The man he had heard from no - man 's land , caught in the barbed wire and with his leg severed , screaming to be rescued , until Mr Ponticelli ran out to him with wire - cutters and dragged him back to the lines .
The German soldier he tripped over in the dark , already wounded and expecting to be killed , who mutely held up his fingers to show him that he had two children .
The comrades who helped him , because he could not read or write , to keep in touch by letter with the milkmaid he had met before the war .
Or the four colleagues who held him down when , after the battle of Pal Piccolo , the army surgeon gouged out of his cheek a piece of shrapnel already lodged in gangrene .
With each new round of shelling , he said , they all expected the worst .
They would reassure each other by saying , “ If I die , you 'll remember me , wo n't you ? ”
Mr Ponticelli felt he had a duty to try , but struggled .
These were mes camarades , les gars , un type : faces , not names .
And as he faded , even those faces lost their last hold on the living .
Bread for tobacco
In many ways Mr Ponticelli was not typical of the poilus .
He was an Italian , from dirt - poor Emilia - Romagna , who followed his family to France to find work .
Some of his childhood , peacetime memories were perhaps as rare as his wartime ones : catching thrushes by hand in the rocky fields , hand - stitching his own shoes , setting up a chimney - sweep business in Nogent - sur - Marne .
He thought France “ paradise ” , and enlisted in the Foreign Legion at 16 , under-age , by way of thanks .
When Italy joined the war in 1915 he switched to an Italian Alpine regiment , but only because two policemen marched him bodily to Turin ; and he kept his French military passbook carefully on him through three years as a machine - gunner , until he was able to return to paradise again .
In 1939 he became a French citizen , and the rest of his life was spent setting up Ponticelli frères , a company that still builds and takes down chimneys and makes industrial piping .
Increasingly , however , people wanted to talk to him about the war .
He always courteously obliged them , though by the end his thin , scratchy voice came out in gasps .
It was as important to him as it was to them to underscore the horror and futility of it .
More than anything , he was appalled that he had been made to fire on people he did n't know and to whom he , too , was a stranger .
These were fathers of children .
He had no quarrel with them .
C'est complètement idiot la guerre .
His Italian Alpine regiment had once stopped firing for three weeks on the Austrians , whose language many of them spoke ; they had swapped loaves of bread for tobacco and taken pictures of each other .
To the end of his life , Mr Ponticelli showed no interest in labelling anyone his enemy .
He said he did not understand why on earth he , or they , had been fighting .
On March 17th he had his wish , or most of it : a state funeral for all the poilus at Les Invalides , and then a simple family burial .
The government badly wanted this last foot - soldier to be memorialised ; but he preferred to be uncelebrated and ordinary , even in some sense forgotten , and thus the more symbolic of all the rest .
Your faith in the Hillary Clinton candidacy for President is admirable .
That is , we admire your pluck and your recognition of this chance for a woman to be President .
But , we wonder , do you really think that Hillary Clinton is really an " on - her - own female " candidate , or is n't her candidacy really the result of a convenient marriage to a former President ?
How did she get to this position in politics ?
Did she win her spurs the hard way by getting elected to a school board , then the city council , then the state legislature , then Washington , or did she instead ride into town on the coattails of her husband .
Is n't a fact that Hillary is what she is because of Bill Clinton ?
Okay , your argument is that Hillary is the major factor in Bill Clinton 's life and that he would not be a former President of the United States if it were not for the solid advice Hillary gave him as he scrambled up the heap in Arkansas and then inside the national Democratic Party .
You can hold on to that illusion , because every First Lady could claim that , but no First Lady has ever attempted the audacious assertion that she was part of the Constitutional government .
It is impossible , in fact , for a First Lady to know anything about half the government when she does not have a security clearance .
Or , are you saying that Bill Clinton , in addition to his philandering defied his own government and disclosed top secret information to his bedtime partner .
If he gave such information to Hillary , then to whom else did he impart state secrets ?
Okay , yes , Hillary did head up the Health Care initiative .
What happened to that ?
Yes , we know that it did not get off the ground .
Whose fault was it that it did not ?
Was that Bill 's fault for entrusting to Hillary or was it that some big mean Republicans on the Hill beat her up and Bill could not protect her ?
You see , we do not understand which part of the coattails Hillary rode in on are quality experience .
Certainly her imaginings of sniper fire are not real .
We are suggesting that most of it — all but name recognition — are unreal , false , and illusory .
If Hillary is not an authentic bootstraps femme candidate — and clearly she is not — then what does she represent .
Are all you fans centrist , DLC , triangulating , opportunists ?
We believe you might be slightly confused , but not all centrists .
We believe you are holding on to the false illusion of Hillary 's authentic female candidacy and in the back of your minds you are telling yourself that a centrist candidacy is a safe candidacy , likely to pick up the stray independent vote .
But this is another illusion , a falsehood carefully disseminated by the Clinton campaign .
Hillary is constitutionally a conservative .
She belongs to a fundamentalist religious group that preached a form of Christofascism in its early days .
Hillary and Bill ( and they are inseparable , you know — a twofer that wo n't stop with pillow talk ) .
She was born and raised a conservative Republican .
She became a Democrat only in the Arkansas sense which , folks , is not the mainstream of the Democratic Party by any means .
The truth is that Clinton centrism is plain old down home opportunism , lusty and barren of the things that Progressives and Liberals hold dear , such as helping social programs , the rule of law , ethical behavior , promotion of liberty for all , and progress !
Hillary is not a safe centrist , she is a political opportunist and a very cheap - shot mud-slinging one at that .
Independents know this and they are appalled .
They are more likely to vote Green this year in disgust over the tactics and mean - spirited stuff coming out of both Clinton mouths .
But down ( or up ) at the level of policy is where Hill and Bill fail utterly .
Despite Hillary 's back - pedaling on NAFTA , Bill remains steadfastly a global free - trader .
He has to because he was bought and sold by corporate interests long , long ago .
If you think that Hillary 's talk about revising NAFTA is pure campaign feldergarb , you are as smart as I think you are .
There is n't a chance in hell of a new Clinton regime standing up to the do - nothing politics of the global free - traders .
The consequences to you Clinton fans will be a deep recession that scrapes the bottom and feels like a great depression among the poor and the less fortunate in the middle classes .
You can take the road you are following , which is the road through the Pennsylvania primary to see if your candidate has the grit to mount a surge .
When you think " surge " remember that Hillary was in favor of this war in Iraq even though there were many voices , including Barack Obama 's , against it .
She was not tricked or lied to .
She made a decision to look tough for her own political purposes and it has cost 4,000 American lives and 30,000 American maimed and disabled , not to mention hundreds of thousands of destroyed lives in Iraq .
You are supporting a candidacy that is built on fallacy and coattails and illusion .
You need to wake up to the reality of your situation and understand that the struggle is not to elect the first female President but to cleanse the Democratic Party of its opportunist centrists .
If you do not abandon your idealistic illusions the result will be an out - of - office house - cleaning , and believe us , the Progressive and Liberal body of the party will remove the opportunists completely .
You should understand now that these centrists will easily become the liberal wing of the Republican Party as it was for most of the twentieth century .
So , are you really Republicans or do you have the good reflexes of the real Democratic Party ?
Tell Hillary .
We will hear it .
Sincerely ,
JB

John D. Morris , an apparel industry analyst for Wachovia , said that the ailing economy was not necessarily forcing all retailers to negotiate .
But he says he believes that when there is an opportunity for negotiation , the shopper has the upper hand .
“ This is one of the periods where the customer is empowered , ” Mr. Morris said .
“ The retailer knows that the customer is enduring tough times  and is more willing to be the one who blinks first in that stare - down match . ”
While tough times give people more incentive to change their behavior , it is the wealth of information about products made available on the Internet that gives consumers the know - how to try it .
People now can quickly amass information on product availability and pricing , helping them develop strategies to get the best deal .
Michael Roskell , 33 , a technology project manager from Jersey City , N.J. , said he and a friend from high school periodically visit electronics stores .
While Mr. Roskell expresses interest in buying an item , his friend acts as though he is dissatisfied with the price and threatens to leave .
“ We play good cop , bad cop , ” Mr. Roskell said .
In February , he said , the friends got $ 20 off a pair of $ 250 speakers at 6th Avenue Electronics in the New York area .
Earlier , he and the same friend negotiated to buy two 46 - inch high - definition Sony televisions at P. C. Richard & Son , a New York - area electronics chain .
List price : $ 4,300 .
Price after negotiation : $ 3,305.50 .
“ My parents never did this , ” Mr. Roskell said .
“ But once you get it , you realize there ’s a whole economy built on this . ”
The strategy can even work when buying pants .
At least it did for David Achee of Maplewood , N.J. , who said he went to a Polo Ralph Lauren store in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan last month and became interested in a pair of pants on the clearance rack for $ 75 .
He told the salesperson that he had seen a similar pair on the Internet for $ 65 , adding that he thought the pair on the rack looked worn ( even though he did not really think so ) .
He got the pants for around $ 50 , he said .
The Zero X Motorcycle was designed from the ground up to be a 100 % electric bike .
What makes this new bike truly different is that it contains 168 individual high - power lithium ion cells and is expected to endure six years of hard riding .
Zero Motorcycle ’s power grid technology has the highest power density ( power storage per weight ) battery pack on the market , delivering the full current of the battery pack immediately , safely and without overheating .
Riders get the enjoyment of up to 2 hours of quality riding without seeing any impact on performance .
To complete the cycle and keep it green , the Zero X battery unit is 100 % recyclable and landfill approved .
You can see some videos of the bike in action here .
The designer , Neal Saiki , applied his aerospace engineering degree and 15 years as a leading mountain bike designer to the problem .
The chassis is made out of aircraft aluminum making it one of the lightest motorcycle frames on the planet at 18 pounds .
More than 300 individual parts were custom fabricated and result in a total weight of only 140 pounds .
That helps the Zero X weigh in at less than half the weight of a gas powered motorcycle .
According to Saiki , people who initially wanted to buy a Zero X unit decided to do so because the motorbike is silent and emissions - free .
However , customers were reportedly also impressed with its performance .
The bike was recently demonstrated in Vegas , here is a reaction :
“ I rode the Zero X prototype in a demonstration motocross race in Las Vegas in 2007 and was very impressed , ” said National Motocross Champion , Hall of Famer and TV commentator Jeff Emig .
“ I ’m expecting the production version to have a huge impact in the motor sports industry . ”
If you are interested , you can buy one from the company ’s Web site — a standard bike costs $ 7,450 , plus $ 300 for shipping across the US .
Click to viewHere 's a frightening but real proposition : if you are caught breaking certain traffic laws , not only do police have the right to search you — they can go through all your electronic data as well — your text messages , call histories , browsing history , downloaded emails and photos .
In a recent academic paper , South Texas Assistant Professor Adam Gershowitz explains that because many traffic violations are arrestable offenses , just as a cop could search your pockets for drugs , said cop can also search your pockets for a smartphone and go through all its contents .
The same is true for any standard arrest , and given the amount of data in current smartphones , it 's a scary proposition ( even for law - abiding citizens like us ) .
Advertisement
We 'll give you the CliffsNotes version of Gershowitz 's 30 - page article in which he outlines the situation .
The Issue :
While society and technology have changed drastically over the last few decades , the search incident to arrest rule has remained static .
Thus , if we think of an iPhone as a container ­­like a cigarette package or a closed box , police can open and search the contents inside with no questions asked and no probable cause required , so long as they are doing so pursuant to a valid arrest .

A Recent Precedent :
The Fifth Circuit 's recent 2007 in United States v. Finley is representative .
Police arrested Finley after a staged drug sale .
The police then searched Finley incident to arrest and found a cellphone in his pocket .
One of the investigating officers searched through the phone 's records and found text messages that appeared to relate to drug trafficking ... ­­the court explained that " police officers are not constrained to search only for weapons ... they may also , without any additional justification , look for evidence of the arrestee 's crime on his person in order to preserve it for use at trial .
The Solutions :
Courts and legislatures can attempt to minimize this invasion of privacy by changing the legal rules to require that searches be related to the purpose of the arrest , by limiting searches to applications that are already open , by restricting suspicionless investigation to a small number of discrete steps , or by limiting searches to data already downloaded onto the iPhone , rather than data that is merely accessible through the iPhone 's internet connection .

I guess the larger moral of the story is that if you plan on getting arrested , do n't have a smartphone in your pocket with all the seedy plans .

Retraction ' Is IKEA Giving Danes the Doormat Treatment ? '
Last week , SPIEGEL ONLINE published an article about IKEA products named after Danish cities .
We regret that we must retract the article because of inaccurate reporting .
We apologize for the error .
Yves Rossy , recently achieved a landmark which went largely unheralded .
Rossy ’s feats might well go down among the most daring as well as momentous in aviation history .
Check out these amazing photos .
Rossy made headlines in 2003 when he flew 12 kilometres for the loss of just 3000 metres of altitude , achieving his feat by jumping out of plane wearing three metre , carbon fibre wings .
The former military pilot , 45 , who flies Airbuses for Swissair , spent five years developing his wings for his flying man project but went one better with his ‘ jet - man ’ project by adding two kerosene - powered jet engines to his original wing design to become the first man to fly like a bird : horizontally .
At 7:30 pm on June 24 , 2004 Rossy dropped from 4000 m over the Yverdon airfield .
After opening the wings , he glided to 2500 m , ignited the engines and waited 30 seconds for them to be able to stabilize and begins to open the throttle .
At 16 m , he achieved horizontal flight for more than 4 minutes at 100 knots ( 115 mph ) .
" It was absolutely fantastic ; freedom in three dimensions … I felt like a bird . "
That ’s how Rossy described his land - mark flight .
Looking like Buzz Lightyear from the film Toy Story as he soared over the Alps at 180 km / h .
To perfect the performance , the aerodynamic wings were improved and their span was increased to 3 meters .
Because there was a loss of rigidity due to the inflatable side of the wings , Yves had to stop his collaboration with " Prospective Concepts " , who made the original design , and work only with " ACT Composites " who then created foldable carbon wings , able to be used from a Pilatus Porter plane .
Handles were also fixed onto the wings so that Yves could electronically manipulate the wingtips , this giving him the freedom to decide when he wanted to either glide or dive .
These new wings were tested quite a few times with different weights on them so as to see how and where the kerosene port and engines would be placed .
Many simulations were tested before being able to fix on the real engines and most importantly before being ignited .
The veteran thrillseeker has entered the Guiness Records for various pioneering flights and was just as enthused about this one .
" It would be a great device for James Bond so he can go behind enemy lines , " he said .
He also holds a record for dangling from the wing of a biplane , and lists his hobbies as " bare - foot water - skiing , wakeboard , hydro- speed , delta flying and paragliding , snowboarding and aerobatic flying " .
In 2002 Yves contacted the worlds leading model jet engine Company , " Jet - Cat " , based in Germany .
The company , which specialises in motorising miniature planes , quickly showed its interest to help
Yves install engines onto his wings .
Many tests were made with different engines , different air intakes , and they even had to test at altitudes reaching 4000 m as these particular engines had never been tested before at such an altitude .
A test team was taken up in a Pilatus Porter so that fine - tuning could be made until the engines worked perfectly at high altitude .
Once all ignition tests had been done at ground level , the real thing was ready to be done , but like all prototype experiments , success is certainly not guaranteed on the first trial .
Anything is possible , ignition failure , ignition of only one engine , flight instability and even spinning is possible , but all of these failure tests were made during the long testing sessions .
After running in to turbulence
Yves cut off the two engines despite having half full tanks at the time .
Giuliani deep ' in the hole ' over campaign debts John Byrne

This " Winding down a presidential campaign that sputters  like cleaning up after one of those great Hollywood epics that remain unfinished  can be a complicated , joyless task , " the New York Times ' Michael Cooper writes artfully in Wednesday editions .
" After the dream dies , there are lots of bills to pay and loose ends to tie up . "
 We are deeper in the hole than I thought we would be ,  wrote John Gross , the campaigns treasurer , in an e-mail message to several senior campaign aides obtained by the Times .
 Windown is likely to be less than projected , but travel expenses are higher ,  Gross added .
 We can not prefer any one creditor .
We probably could make a 10 % payment to all qualified creditors at this point , but probably not much more .
Gross did not respond to followup emails from the Times .
A " senior campaign official " which the Times granted anonymity , said " all creditors would be paid and that a report to be filed this month with the Federal Election Commission would show that the campaign had roughly $ 9 million on hand at the end of January , with about $ 2 million in debts . "
If Giuliani is deeply in debt , it should n't come entirely as a surprise .
According to a 2007 Washington
Post piece , the erstwhile mayor has routinely stayed at recherche hotels while enjoying the luxury of private jets .
" Whether it was $ 2,010 at the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia , $ 4,034 at La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad , Calif. , or $ 5,370 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco ( dining room pictured at left ) , the former mayor found himself top - notch lodging , " the Post wrote .
" ( At the Fairmont , The Trail got a glimpse of the candidate 's large suite -- it had a fantastic view of the bay , overlooking Alcatraz Island . )
Water views seem to be a prized asset for Giuliani -- during an early trip to New Hampshire , the former new york mayor stayed at the Wentworth by the Sea resort , a AAA Four - diamond resort that advertises ' postcard - perfect views of the waterfront ' in Portsmouth . "
" He also spent more than $ 565,000 reimbursing various corporate supporters for private jet travel , " they added .
" The biggest chunk of those flights came via Elliott Asset Management , a New York hedge fund known by some as a " vulture fund , " so - named because they buy debt cheaply from cash - starved countries , and then sue them for the full repayment .
The head of the firm , Paul Singer , is in charge of Northeastern fundraising for Giuliani . "
In addition to private planes , Giuliani spent a whopping $ 800,000 on charter jets .
Headed for Olympics ?
Beware of Big Brother Olympics attendees should expect to be bugged and searched , U.S. says .
March 20 , 2008  --
If you 're planning on attending this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing , expect your hotel room to be bugged and searched while you 're not there .
That 's one of the warnings in a new fact sheet on the 2008 Olympics issued today by the U.S. State Department to Americans who intend to go to the games that are being hosted by the Chinese government .
" All visitors should be aware that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations , " the fact sheet says .
" All hotel rooms and offices are considered to be subject to on - site or remote technical monitoring at all times .
Hotel rooms , residences and offices may be accessed at any time without the occupant 's consent or knowledge . "
This is similar to advice that U.S. officials visiting China follow .
The U.S. military has been increasingly worried about Chinese electronic surveillance capabilities .
ABC News was granted exclusive access to the head of the U.S. Pacific Command , Adm . Timothy Keating , as he met with top Chinese military leaders in January .
Keating told ABC News ' Jonathan Karl that even his staff members leave their electronic devices behind for fear that the Chinese could hack into them .
" It 's our assessment that the Chinese have the capability to penetrate our electronic systems .
We would rather they not do that , " Keating said .
The State Department 's fact sheet also warns that Americans may not be able to access certain portions of the U.S. Embassy 's Web site while within China , a sign of China 's growing ability to restrict Internet access to sites it sees as challenges to its rule .
Americans traveling in China are encouraged to register first with the U.S. embassy through its Web site .
However , according to the fact sheet , " Since this registration system site is not always available from within China , registering before you leave home is highly recommended . "
The State Department says that the terror threat for the Games is low but cites recent violence in Tibet and a purported attempt to blow up a passenger plane in China earlier this month as " good examples of how potentially dangerous events can occur in the run-up to the Olympics . "
The State Department says that there is no evidence to suggest that Americans will be targets of violence during the games .
Some activists have sought to tie the Beijing Olympics to the genocide in Darfur because of China 's cozy trade relationship with the Sudanese government .
Some groups hope to use the global spotlight cast by the games to highlight these and other human rights issues in China .
If any Americans are planning on protesting , however , the State Department 's fact sheet has some advice as well .
Though other warnings in the fact sheet do not mince words , the State Department refers diplomatically to China 's heavy - handed police control of political dissent .
" The threat level for political violence also remains low .
In most major metropolitan areas , the Chinese authorities employ an overwhelming police / security presence to ensure that demonstrations remain peaceful .
Protestors must receive an official permit from municipal authorities before being allowed to gather , " the fact sheet says , without referring to any specific issues .
The fact sheet also contains a warning for dual U.S. - Chinese citizens who use their Chinese passports to enter the country .
" If you are a dual American - Chinese citizen and are arrested or detained in China , the choice you made on which passport to use in entering China will be very important , " the fact sheet says .
" U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials are often denied access to arrested or detained Americans who do not enter China using their U.S. passport . "
Does Anybody Care ?
Will the EAC or DoJ - or Even State Officials - Take Action Before the November General Election ?
Error Rates Found to be MORE THAN 40 THOUSAND PERCENT HIGHER Than Allowed by Law ...
Ellen Theisen Byon 4/10/2008 , 7:04 am PT
Guest blogged by Ellen Theisen , VotersUnite .
Org
Over two years ago , the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against New York State to force the state to comply with the federal requirement to equip every polling place with voting systems that are accessible to people with disabilities , as mandated by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) .
Meanwhile , the DoJ has taken no action at all to stop any state from using voting equipment that has been proven to violate HAVA ’s requirement for accurate vote - counting .
While it 's important for every citizen , disabled or not , to be able to vote privately , a private vote is meaningless if that vote is not counted accurately .
Despite the equal weight HAVA gave to both important mandates , the federal requirement for accurate vote - counting is being wholly ignored by the states , and even the federal government .
Two recent incidents which have been making headlines --- in New Jersey and Ohio --- illustrate clear , undeniable violations of the federal accuracy requirement .
They are impossible to deny or ignore .
For the moment , however , federal officials are doing exactly that ...
INCIDENT ONE : February 2008
Sequoia E-Voting Machines Miscount in Six New Jersey Counties ...
New Jersey election officials discovered discrepancies in the 2008 primary election summary reports of 60 of their Sequoia Advantage touch - screen e-voting machines .
Sequoia blamed the discrepancies on poll worker error , but subsequent discoveries disprove the company ’s explanation .
One of the Sequoia Advantage vote summary tapes from Englewood Cliffs , District 4 , in Bergen County , New Jersey showed 106 votes cast by 105 ballots .
In addition , the automatic counter on the machine showed only 105 voters .
( At least one other machine reported the same types of discrepancies . )
Princeton computer science professor Ed Felten offers more details and photos of the tapes here .
Since the machine counter matches the total number of Republican and Democratic ballots cast , it appears that the machine added one vote to the totals for one of the candidates .
In this case , the error rate on the Englewood Cliffs Sequoia Advantage machine was over 60,000 percent higher than the maximum error rate allowed by HAVA .
Section 301( a ) ( 5 ) of HAVA spells out the mandatory standards for error rates on voting systems .
It says :
The error rate of the voting system in counting ballots ( determined by taking into account only those errors which are attributable to the voting system and not attributable to an act of the voter ) shall comply with the error rate standards established under section 3.2.1 of the voting systems standards issued by the Federal Election Commission which are in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act .
Section 3.2.1 of the 2002 Voluntary Voting System Standards , which were in effect when HAVA was enacted , defined the accuracy requirements for DREs as follows :
... the system shall achieve a target error rate of no more than one in 10,000,000 ballot positions , with a maximum acceptable error rate in the test process of one in 500,000 ballot positions .
The “ maximum acceptable error rate ” of one in 500,000 ballot positions ( choices on a ballot ) is an error rate of 0.0002 % .
But the error rate for the Advantage machine was 0.12 % , which is the number of miscounted votes ( 1 ) divided by the number of possible choices on all ballots .
That error rate is more than 600 times as high ( or 60,000 % ) as the maximum error rate allowable under by federal law .
INCIDENT TWO : March 2008
Diebold / Premier E-Voting System Miscounts in Butler County , Ohio ...
In a letter sent this week from Butler County , OH election officials , it was revealed that on March 4 , 2008 , the Diebold GEMS central tabulator failed to upload and store 105 ballots recorded on their AccuVote touch - screen voting machines , even though the system reported that all the ballots on the 1,599 memory cards had been uploaded successfully .
The elections website of Butler County ( which has since corrected the GEMS error ) reports that 94,053 ballots were cast in the election .
The 105 ballots missed by the GEMS upload software represent from 0.08 % to 0.18 % of the ballot positions counted by the system ( depending on the proportion of Democratic to Republican ballots stored on the memory card – there were nearly twice as many contests on the Republican ballot ) .
But remember , HAVA allows a maximum error rate of 0.0002 % .
This means the error rate on the Butler County GEMS server was between 400 and 900 times as high ( 40,000 % to 90,000 % ) as the rate allowed by federal law .
Now that these facts are known , using New Jersey ’s version of the Sequoia Advantage e-voting machines or Butler County ’s version of the Diebold AccuVote / GEMS system ( v.1-18-24.0 ) in the November 2008 election would be a violation of federal law .
But the problem may be even more serious .
The bugs that caused the miscounts have not yet been found or analyzed .
Since software bugs are typically carried forward from one software version to the next unless they are found and fixed , these same bugs may very well be present on all Sequoia Advantage e-voting machines and all versions of Diebold GEMS ( which is used to accumulate vote totals from Diebold / Premier 's paper - based optical scan systems , as well as from their touch - screen e-voting machines ) .
So , it is quite possible that any jurisdiction using the Sequoia Advantage or Diebold GEMS could well be in violation of federal law if those same systems are used in November .
These are just two recent examples , from within the last two months , of vote - counting errors on electronic equipment far beyond the the rate allowable by law .
Dozens of such incidents , reported all across the country , have occurred in every recent election cycle .
How long will the Justice Department , the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) , and states continue to ignore the mandate of HAVA --- and more importantly , the mandate of democracy --- for accurate vote - counting ?
CORRECTION : Due to information discovered after our initial publication of this story , it was necessary to recalculate the error rates reported above .
While the initial article had reported error rates as high as " half a million percent , " the numbers have now been adjusted to note a somewhat lower error rate , though one which is still far in excess of that allowable by law .
Theisen has post a detailed description of how she derived the above numbers in comments below .
UPDATE 4/15/08 :
The state of NJ declares the numbers are n't what they seem to be --- and what even the counties thought they were --- on the official paper audit trail tapes from the state 's Sequoia touch - screen systems , adding what appears to be yet another violation of HAVA to the points already made above .
Full details now here ...
UPDATE 4/16/08 : " Bacchus " at the Guerrilla News Network links up to this article , and adds the following insightful preamble to their coverage :
40,000 percent over the legal limit ?
That ’s a lot , is n’t it ?
According to my calculations , if I were driving 40,000 percent drunker than the legal limit , my blood would be about 64 proof .
Not even Jesus can compete with that !
If I were driving 40,000 percent faster than the legal speed limit , I estimate that I ’d be driving at about mach 32 , or here to the moon in nine hours .
But if I were voting on a machine with an error rate 40,000 percent higher than the legal limit ?
Why , I must be an American !
California 's powerful congressional delegation needs to go back to Congress to reconsider the Real ID
Act that requires states to issue driver 's licenses that meet federal standards , according to the head of the California Assembly 's Transportation Committee .
Assemblyman Pedro Nava ( D - 35 ) introduced a non-binding resolution to that effect Monday afternoon in response to concerns about privacy , security and the high price of the federal mandate – which the government 's most recent estimate pegs at $ 4 billion nationally .
The feds are only ponying up a token amount of money , but say states can dip into their federal homeland security grants to help pay down the bill .
Howard Posner , a policy consultant to the Transportation Committee , said that last year the committee contemplated moving legislation to accept Real ID , but reconsidered after " looking at the cost , and the incredible inconvenience for driver 's license holder and the privacy issues . "
" We heard the feds had enacted this without any kind of review process or holding hearings , " Posner said .
" We thought someone ought to step back and see if this is the most cost effective way to secure driver 's licenses . "
When asked who the resolution 's allies were , Posner named three groups – the ACLU , AARP , and the conservative group Eagle Forum .
Congressman James Sensenbrenner ( R - WI ) added the the Real ID mandate to a must - pass defense spending bill in 2005 , leaving the details to be determined by the Department of Homeland Security .
After much delay , the final regulations were issued in February of 2008 .
The resolution , which needs to go through a set of committees in both of California 's legislative bodies before coming to a floor vote , would tentatively join California to a group of 17 states that have expressed opposition to the unfunded mandate .
Three states have outright rejected Real ID , setting up a showdown on May 11 , when the federal government says it will not allow residents of Montana , Maine , South Carolina and New Hampshire to use their state I.D. cards for federal purposes .
That means that residents of those states will not be able to use their driver 's licenses to board planes ( they 'll have to get pat - downs ) , and will be barred from federal courthouses or Social Security Administration buildings unless they have a passport .
California 's resolution does n't go nearly that far , since the state has already gotten the extension , but still might boost the anti-Real ID movement given the state 's size , clout and dire finances .
If passed , the California resolution ( .pdf ) , known as AJR 51 , does not need the signature of California 's Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to go into effect .

On CNN ’s “ Late Edition ” today Wolf Blitzer interviewed outspoken critic of the Iraq war , Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska .
Blitzer asked Hagel about critics of the war who say that the president is ignoring reality and living in a dream world .
Hegel replied , “ Well , I think this is another episode of Alice in Wonderland , what ’s up is down and what ’s down is up .
What do you mean stability and security ?
Baghdad , for example , has been , over the last year , essentially , ethnically divided .
You ’ve separated the Sunnis and the Shias .
And to somehow make some assertion that things are looking much , much better in Baghdad and its calm again and it ’s back to where it used to be is just not the case . ”
He continued , “ And when you look at the casualties the United States has taken since the so - called military surge , over 900 deaths ; you look at almost 30,000 wounded and the money we ’ve put in there — and then the other point of this is , too , if , in fact , the surge has calmed things to a point where the president and others are saying , well , they ’ve done a great service and they ’ve achieved some terrific things , why then is the administration talking about keeping more American troops in Iraq for the remainder of this year than we had before the surge ? ”

Hagel also had some tough words for the positions of all three remaining presidential candidates on Iraq .
“ Well , obviously , what I ’ve heard , like the American people have heard , is McCain , on one side , saying we ’ll stay there until there ’s victory and whatever it takes , we ’re going to win .
On the other side , both Obama and Clinton have both said , we ’re coming out .
That ’s not good enough .
Because each of the two final candidates are going to have to enunciate how we are coming out ; how responsibly are we coming out ?
Under what basis ?
Under what timeline ? ”
The Senator elaborated on his point , “ I do n’t agree with John McCain — and you know this , Wolf .
I think John and the president and others have put the Iraqi situation in the wrong context .
This is n’t a win or lose .
The Iraqi people will decide whether they want — the government they want in place and when .
We can help them .
But we should n’t be framing this up as win or lose .
Because , when we do that — and this is where I have a major disagreement with McCain — then , on that basis , we ’ll be there forever .
Because the Iraqis are going to have to find some political accommodation , some political reconciliation to fix this , just as General Petraeus said . ”
I have the upmost respect for Chuck Hagel .
He is veteran who has seen combat , and when he saw that this war was a mistake , he was n’t afraid to buck the flag waving in his party and speak his mind .
I think Hagel has a better understanding of what it will take to get out of Iraq than either the president , or the three remaining major party presidential candidates .
It will be possible for the Democratic nominee to elaborate on their position during the general election campaign , but it is clear that Hagel believes that we ca n’t afford four more years of hope and spin on this war .
If Bush / Cheney / McCain all want to drink the Kool - Aid on Iraq that is their choice , but our troops are the people who are those responsible for paying the ultimate price for their fantasy .

So long , and thanks for all the fish WOO !
This was way way funnier in my head at 40,000 feet in the air as I slowly went insane from cabin fever and jet lag .
Also , sorry for the delayed update but I totally overestimated how coherent I 'd be after getting back from interstate .
And that jenga thingy I wrote in the first panel totally has it's own jingle , with ev-ery - one is broke into syllables , and it 's been playing over and over in my head nonstop .
It 's like a tiny personal hell .
Anyway , this is late enough as it is so enough jabbering on .

" Stop Trading ! " segment Monday , Jim Cramer defended his assertion that it was safe to bank with
Bear Stearns
( JPM ) - Get Report
and reminded viewers he had n't recommended buying the stock .
" I said the common stock was worthless on Friday , " Cramer said .
He drew a distinction between buying shares of Bear and banking with the broker .
" If you kept your money in Bear , you made out .
You got the liquidity .
I could 've caused a run on the bank and said , ' Take your money out of Bear . ' "
Cramer said that to cause a run on Bear would have been " reckless " and " stupid . "
" I can not cause a run .
It turned out the
Federal Reserve
guaranteed the money , " Cramer continued .
He said that although the Fed has guaranteed the money " in the vault " at Bear Stearns , but did n't guarantee the equity .
People who bank with Bear will be alright , he said .
" We got a guarantee .
JPMorgan
( JPM ) - Get Report
is now Bear .
... I came out and said at $ 36 the stock was worthless , for heaven 's sake . "
However , " Keeping your money at Bear turned out to be 100 % right .
... Every billionaire got bailed out by the Fed . "
Cramer said he believes that common shares of most large banks are " worthless . "
Cramer said JPMorgan got a great price for Bear .
" Each time , they say , ' We looked at the books .
We can't make that bid work . ' ...
They say , ' How bout 2 bucks ? ' and it's done . "
Cramer said that the Fed should have guaranteed
Fannie Mae
( FNM )
paper .
" This government , they could care less about Fannie Mae , " he said .
" I said the Fed should be in there buying $ 200 billion in Fannie Mae paper , not financing JPMorgan to steal Bear . "
He said that Bear would have survived if the government had guaranteed Fannie Mae paper .
Concerning lawsuits JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon may face in the wake of the buyout , Cramer said , " He probably just made $ 30 billion .
They said the paper 's almost worthless .
It 's worth a lot . "
He said the deal was a " good trade by Jamie . "

Introduction
Microsoft just released Windows Vista Service Pack 1 but that does n't mean they are resting on their laurels .
Amongst other things , Windows Vista Service Pack 1 includes support for DirectX 10.1 , something ATI would be profoundly happy to mention time and time again as only their graphics cards at the moment support DirectX 10.1 .
Is n't it odd that NVIDIA has yet to include support for DirectX 10.1 even in their latest releases , the GeForce 9600 GT and the GeForce 9800 GX2 ?
In fact , they have virtually thumbed their noses at that " insignificant " update .
Well , they have their reasons .
Six years ago at SIGGRAPH 02 , NVIDIA 's chief scientist , David Kirk , was already talking about ray tracing :
“ I ’ll be interested in discussing a bigger question , though : ‘ When will hardware graphics pipelines become sufficiently programmable to efficiently implement ray tracing and other global illumination techniques ?’.
I believe that the answer is now , and more so from now on !
As GPUs become increasingly programmable , the variety of algorithms that can be mapped onto the computing substrate of a GPU becomes ever broader .
As part of this quest , I routinely ask artists and programmers at movie and special effects studios what features and flexibility they will need to do their rendering on GPUs , and they say that they could never render on hardware !
What do they use now : crayons ?
Actually , they use hardware now , in the form of programmable general - purpose CPUs .
I believe that the future convergence of realistic and real - time rendering lies in highly programmable special - purpose GPUs . ”
Since then , NVIDIA has taken quiet but real steps in moving towards ray tracing as the future of real - time 3D rendering for games .
The G80 and subsequent G92/94 architectures , for example , have been designed for general purpose programming .
NVIDIA has even created a hybrid CPU / GPU ray tracing renderer called Gelato to make use of the new GPGPUs ( General Purpose GPUs ) .
Even ATI has not been sitting still .
Their bluster about the advantages of DirectX 10.1 over DirectX 10 aside , the guys in ATI are not stupid .
They have seen the writing on the wall .
This is one of the reasons why ATI chose to merge with AMD .
Needless to say , Intel has been actively working on ray tracing .
It is to their advantage if ray tracing takes off , because unlike rasterization , ray - tracing works best on multi-core processors .
It also obviates the need for the GPU which has stolen much of the limelight in recent years .
In October , 2007 , Jeffrey Howard wrote two [ email protected ] articles ( first article , second article ) about Intel 's ray - tracing work .
The first quoted Daniel Pohl 's work in which he was about to modify Quake IV to work with the Intel ray - tracing engine .
Just using an 8 - core Intel processor , Daniel was able to achieve almost 100 fps at the resolution of 1024x1024 .
With further optimizations and even faster processors , it 's not unthinkable that even the latest crop of games would be able to run at incredible frame rates without the help of any GPU .
The best thing about ray - tracing , according to Jeffrey , is that it 's extremely scalable .
That means if you replace the 8 - core processor with a 16 - core processor , you will get twice the frame rate , and so on .
That leads us to Microsoft .
Even they know that the release of DirectX 10.1 is not going to make Windows Vista any more attractive to gamers .
Numerous articles have been written about the image quality differences between DirectX 10 and DirectX 9 and they all tell the same story - it just is n't all that significant .
Now , ray - tracing would certainly be something else altogether .
Take a look at the example on the right ( from Intel ) .
See the rendering difference between a rasterized image and a ray - traced image ?
Notice the more realistic reflections and shadows in the ray - traced image .
Would you switch to Windows Vista if doing so allows your games to look THAT realistic ?
Hell , yeah !
That brings us to the crux of the matter - DirectX 11 ...

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Fly Phishing Posted by Sean @ 18:12 GMT
Some phishing gangs have a new technique .
They 're using trojan - spy applications .
Last week we received the following e-mail message :
Notice that the message does n't mention anything about providing an account - name or password .
Instead , it attempts to convince the recipient that they need to install a Digital Certificate for enhanced safety .
( Anybody want to buy a bridge ? )
The message links to a site with the following :
It 's basically a page full of jargon designed to overwhelm the potential victim .
What happens if the victim falls for the bait and installs the " certificate " ?
A trojan - spy will be installed .
So now the phishers do n't need to ask for passwords anymore , they can just take them .
This technique keeps the classic element of phishing by mimicking the trusted institution — the bank .
What they 've adjusted is the part that people have become skeptical of , which is giving away their password when requested by e-mail .
Update :
Here 's a brief video that we captured last week when the site was online .
You 'll find it on the Lab 's YouTube Channel .
BEIJING  A Chinese court sentenced an outspoken human rights advocate on Thursday to three and a half years in prison after ruling that his critical essays and comments about Communist Party rule amounted to inciting subversion , his lawyer said .
The conviction of the advocate , Hu Jia , 34 , one of the most prominent human rights proponents in China , has quickly drawn outside criticism of China at a time when the government is already facing international concern over its handling of the Tibetan crisis .
Mr. Hu’s case has been followed closely , especially in Europe , and critics say his conviction is part of a government crackdown to silence dissidents before Beijing hosts the Olympic Games in August .
In Bucharest , Romania , where President Bush was attending NATO meetings , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized the sentence and said that the United States would continue to raise the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders in the months leading up to the Olympics .
A team of researchers at the University of Alberta , including a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania , have discovered a gene that is able to block HIV , and thought to in turn prevent the onset of AIDS .
Dr. Stephen Barr , a researcher in the Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology at the U of A , says his team identified a human gene called TRIM22 that can block HIV infection in a cell culture by preventing the assembly of the virus .
Barr says " interestingly , when we prevent cells from turning on TRIM22 , the normal interferon response ( a natural defense produced by our cells to fight infection by viruses such as HIV ) is useless at blocking HIV infection .
This means TRIM22 is an essential part of our body 's ability to fight off HIV . "
Barr 's team finds the results very exciting because it shows our bodies have a gene that is capable of stopping the spread of HIV .
They are now trying to figure out why this gene does not work in people infected with HIV and if there is a way to turn this gene on in those individuals .
" We hope that our research will lead to the design of new drugs and / or vaccines that can halt the person - to - person transmission of HIV and the spread of the virus in the body , thereby blocking the onset of AIDS . "

Mike Huckabee accepted more than 90 gifts from Arkansans he appointed to state posts .
Huck 's gift - givers ended up in state posts
Mike Huckabee accepted more than 90 gifts from 21 Arkansans he appointed to state posts during his decade as governor , a Politico analysis of state public records found .
Since he set his sights on the White House , those supporters , their families and their companies have kept on giving .
They contributed nearly $ 161,000 to a pre-presidential campaign account and Huckabee 's official campaign committee since late last year , according to state and federal campaign finance records .
Advertisement
Huckabee ’s gifts became issues in his two gubernatorial campaigns as his opponents tried to stoke voter doubts about his judgment and ethics .
As he surges in Iowa and nationally , Huckabee ’s primary rivals are expected to make similar arguments .
Huckabee ’s personal attorney , Kevin Crass , was designated by his campaign to respond to Politico .
It ’s “ a coincidence ” that there ’s some overlap between the list of gift givers and appointments , said Crass , adding Huckabee “ understood that you ca n’t trade appointments for gifts and that did n’t happen . ”
Most of the posts Huckabee ’s benefactors landed were on unpaid boards and commissions .
Not all of the gifts came before the appointments — several came from old friends and there ’s no clear evidence of any quid pro quo .
Still , his annual hauls were attention - grabbing .
In one year , the value of the gifts given to Huckabee amounted to more than $ 112,000 — nearly double his $ 67,000 state salary .
And he wrangled with the state Ethics Commission over gift rules , with the commission twice finding he ’d broken them ( one violation was later overturned ) .
Huckabee twice sued the commission , once seeking a statute of limitations on ethics complaints and in another suit he sought to narrow the scope of prohibited gifts .
Ironically , he was represented before the ethics commission by Crass and one other lawyer who in 1998 donated their services — as gifts .
Huckabee later named one of the attorneys , Tom Mars , to head the Arkansas State Police .
At the time , the job paid $ 77,000 a year , which Mars said was a “ very significant pay cut . ”
Mars , now general counsel for Arkansas - based Wal - Mart , is backing the presidential campaign of New York Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton , for whom he worked as a law clerk during her days as an attorney in Little Rock .
He ’s given $ 2,300 to her campaign .
Crass served on Huckabee ’s 143 - person volunteer transition team when he became governor , an assignment he described as “ nice ” but not “ anything that was coveted or prestigious . ”
He and his wife have contributed $ 4,600 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
Crass estimated that Huckabee made more than 1,000 appointments during his decade as governor , and that he naturally looked to his Republican allies .
The fact that some of them had given the former governor gifts also is a product of Southern culture , he said .
“ He came from a background where people exchanged gifts and supported one another , ” said Crass .
“ That ’s just the Southern way . ”
Game , fish and political contributions
Huckabee is an avid hunter and fisherman , and his appointees to the state ’s influential Game and Fish Commission provide a window into the layered relationship he had with supporters .
At least four Huckabee appointees to the seven - member commission had given the governor gifts and are now counted among his presidential donors .
Ronald Pierce is one of Huckabee ’s longtime fishing buddies and the owner of a bass boat manufacturer .
From 1997 to 2000 , Pierce loaned Huckabee a pair of boats that today would retail for about $ 40,000 each .
He also gave Huckabee and his wife , Janet , jackets and rain suits .
Huckabee named one of the loaner boats “ State Business ” because , he once joshed , according to the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , it allowed his secretary to tell callers “ He ’s out on State Business ” when he was on fishing trips .
After Huckabee ’s gifts drew some bad press , Huckabee became concerned that “ it would kind of look bad ” if Pierce loaned him a new boat , Pierce told Politico .
So Pierce ’s company pulled its loaners and sold the governor a new boat — albeit at a reduced price usually reserved for professional fishermen whose patronage is good marketing .
“ The governor driving your boat on the lake is going to help you , ” Pierce explained .
Huckabee last year tapped Pierce for a seat on the Game and Fish Commission and this year Pierce and his wife gave $ 4,600 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
Pierce said he accepted the appointment reluctantly , and that it was n’t linked to the gifts .
His campaign contribution is based on his long friendship and support for Huckabee , he said .
“ A lot of people tried to use him .
I do n’t know that he did anything for them , ” Pierce said .
“ You could n’t buy that man off if you wanted to . ”
Among Huckabee ’s other Game and Fish Commission appointees was Sheffield Nelson , a lawyer and two - time Republican gubernatorial nominee who gave Huckabee hunting and fishing trips and split the cost of a $ 1,400 turkey mount .
Nelson and his wife contributed a total of $ 14,600 to Hope for America , an account the governor set up in Virginia before launching his presidential bid , and Huckabee ’s campaign .
Lester Sitzes , a childhood friend of Huckabee , also landed a seat on the commission .
Huckabee has said he promised Sitzes a spot on the commission when the two were teens .
Sitzes grew up to become a dentist , and gave his longtime friend a shotgun , a pistol and $ 250 worth of dental care .
Sitzes and his family donated nearly $ 8,000 to Hope for America and Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
Finally , George Dunklin Jr. , co-owner with his sister of a farm company , gave Huckabee a $ 300 hunting trip before getting a seat on the commission .
Dunklin said the trip did n’t help him land the commission seat ; in fact , Huckabee ’s Democratic predecessor had appointed Dunklin to a different board .
“ I wanted to take him duck hunting .
It ’s really just as simple as that , ” said Dunklin .
He has donated $ 2,000 to Huckabee ’s campaign and his firm gave $ 10,000 to Hope for America .
Other benefactors kept on giving
The fuzzy line between appointees and supporters is echoed in other Huckabee appointments .
Jim Lindsey , a developer and former Razorbacks football star , gave Huckabee a hunting - related gift — duck mounts — in 1998 .
The following year he was named to the board of trustees for the University of Arkansas .
Lindsey contributed $ 2,300 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign as well as $ 100,000 to Hope for America .
Bryan Jeffrey , a Little Rock CPA , gave Huckabee free accounting services for one year , and the next year he was named to the state ’s Development Finance Authority .
Jeffrey contributed $ 2,300 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign and his firm works for Huckabee ’s presidential campaign , earning more than $ 70,000 in the first nine months of this year .
Ron Fuller , a lobbyist who was Huckabee ’s top fundraiser and paid for his wife to scuba dive in Puerto Rico , later got appointed to the state ’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board .
Last year , Fuller ’s company contributed $ 1,000 to Hope for America .
Jerry Davis , the late CEO of a food wholesaler , and his wife gave the Huckabees more than $ 5,400 in gifts , including an $ 800 cashmere and fox cape , a pair of $ 600 watches , $ 1,000 cuff links and a suit .
Davis was named to the state police commission .
He died in 2004 , but this year his widow , Shirley Davis , gave $ 2,300 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
William Ferren , who founded and is chairman of an Arkansas oil company that gave Huckabee a suit , was appointed to the Correction and Community Punishment Board .
He gave $ 750 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
In all , Huckabee accepted more than $ 54,000 in clothes for himself and his family during his decade as governor .
And the lion ’s share — $ 25,000 — came from Jennings Osborne , a colorful businessman who was by far the most generous gift giver to the Huckabees .
Osborne , whose website describes him as “ Little Rock 's own version of Elvis ” gave Huckabee , his family and staff more than $ 60,000 worth of gifts , including $ 11,000 in flowers , nearly $ 12,000 worth of pastries and more than $ 25,000 in clothes .
Huckabee appointed Osborne to a seat on the commission that oversees the stadium where the University of Arkansas football team plays some home games , and Osborne and his wife contributed $ 4,100 to Huckabee ’s presidential campaign .
Osborne , who was rebuked by the Arkansas Supreme Court for an extravagant Christmas light display he set up annually at his home , has said he expects nothing for his generosity .
Just gifts , no campaign cash
Huckabee also gave appointments to givers of less extravagant gifts who have yet to appear in his campaign donation reports .
He accepted a barbecue grill from a resort owned by the family of a man he appointed to the state ’s State Parks , Recreation and Travel Commission .
He accepted as gifts seemingly common services , including car repairs .
He reported receiving free eye care and “ eye wear ” from an optometrist and an ophthalmologist — both of whom he tapped for spots on the boards overseeing their respective professions .
In 1996 , when the governor ’s mansion was being refurbished , Huckabee received free “ general contracting and interior design services ” from designer Georg Anderson and furnishings from cotton magnate Charles Adams .
The next year , Huckabee named Anderson , as well as Adams ’ wife , Myrna Vine Adams , to the Arkansas Governor 's Mansion Commission .
When Adam 's furniture gift , worth more than $ 70,000 , was first revealed , Huckabee claimed it was his family ’s to keep .
He backed down after a lawsuit was filed over the furniture and his family ’s use of a $ 60,000 - a- year fund , which the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette reported had been used to pay for pizza , a doghouse , a magazine subscription and pantyhose for Janet Huckabee .
The suit was settled with the furniture still in the mansion and Huckabee , while admitting no wrongdoing , acknowledging a dispute “ regarding reimbursements . ”
Chocolate teacakes were wrongly classed as a biscuit for two decades
The UK Treasury is facing a £ 3.5 m bill , because of VAT wrongly imposed on a Marks and Spencer teacake , the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) has ruled .
Customers paid VAT for 20 years before the authorities accepted the product was a cake , which does not command VAT .
The UK argued that paying back the total sum would " unjustly enrich " M&S as customers had paid the money .
The ECJ ruled that , in principle , VAT had to be repaid in full , but left the final decision to the British courts .
We are pleased with the outcome which endorses our position - we 're optimistic that the House of Lords will now find in our favour
Marks and Spencer spokeswoman
That decision will be taken by the House of Lords and HM Revenue and Customs said it was too early to make a comment .
" This is a very complex judgment on which it would be premature to make any comment until the House of Lords has handed down its judgment , " Revenue and Customs said in a statement .
Marks and Spencer welcomed the ruling .
" We are pleased with the outcome which endorses our position .
" We 're optimistic that the House of Lords will now find in our favour and hope that this will conclude the matter and draw a line under this protracted litigation , " a spokeswoman said .
Cake or biscuit UK tax officials acknowledged that chocolate teacakes had been wrongly classed as biscuits in 1994 , prompting M&S to launch a legal battle to have the wrongly - paid VAT returned .
How VAT works on cakes and biscuits Under UK tax rules , most traditional bakery products such as bread , cakes , flapjacks and Jaffa Cakes are free of VAT , but the tax is payable on cereal bars , shortbread and partly - coated or wholly - coated biscuits .
The complexity of the legal battle surrounds the difference made by the tax authorities between companies classed until 2005 as repayment and payment traders .
While M&S was classed as a payment trader which owed VAT to the government at the end of a financial quarter , it argues that the main supermarkets , which were owed VAT by the authorities , were treated differently on the issue of chocolate teacakes .
It complains that HM Revenue and Customs handed supermarkets back the VAT wrongly paid by customers on chocolate teacakes , while refusing to do the same for Marks and Spencer .
Unjust enrichment Customs officials point to a ruling by the VAT and Duties Tribunal which said that M&S would not have made much more profit on the teacakes if VAT had been removed .
In the tribunal 's opinion , compensation of more than 10 % ( £ 350,000 ) would have amounted to unjust enrichment of the company .
But the European Court of Justice says the principle of " fiscal neutrality " means that tax authorities cannot make a distinction between different companies .
It says it is up to the House of Lords to decide whether such a distinction was made .
VAT ON CAKES AND BISCUITS
How various products are classifed by HM Revenue and Customs Zero rated [ no VAT ] Standard rated [ 17.5 % VAT ] " Biscuits " Chocolate chip biscuits where the chips are either included in the dough or pressed into the surface before baking

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea told its communist neighbor on Wednesday to stop a barrage of insults and threats which it said were adding to tension across one of the world ’s most heavily militarized borders .

REUTERS / Park Chang-ki/ Yonhap
Hermit North Korea , unsettled by the new South Korean president ’s demands it show more respect for human rights and uphold its part of an international denuclearization deal , has shown its outrage through furious rhetoric and , last week , a missile test .
“ Your random slander and tension - raising moves are not benefiting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and we strongly ask you to immediately halt such acts , ” the Defence Ministry said in letter to its North Korean counterpart .
Since the two governments are technically at war and have no direct contact , the letter had to be sent by fax from the United Nations Command on the so - called Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) which divides the Korean peninsula .
The increasingly frosty exchanges have cast a shadow over the “ sunshine policy ” of previous Seoul governments of the past decade , which ensured massive aid flows to the impoverished North for little in return apart from the hope of stability .
They also come as North Korea has been dragging its heels over a promise to make a full disclosure to the international community of everything it has been doing to develop a nuclear arsenal in return for aid and an end to its isolation .
“ We are really running out of time , ” chief U.S. envoy to the North Korea nuclear talks , Christopher Hill , told reporters after talks with South Korean foreign ministry officials in Seoul .
NUCLEAR DEAL DELAY
North Korea has threatened to cut off dialogue with Seoul and demanded an apology after the head of its Joint Chiefs of Staff last week said it would hit the North ’s nuclear weapons base if it attacked but had no plan for a pre-emptive strike .
Some analysts say Pyongyang may be using the attacks to try to deflect blame for its delay in implementing the nuclear deal -- which major powers hope will eventually lead to its complete atomic weapons disarmament .
But they say it is likely to be restrained from taking the fiery rhetoric into something more dangerous by China , its only significant ally and which has no interest is North Korea adding to its problems ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games , its launching party as a world power .
North Korea has also blamed the nuclear agreement delay on the United States and some analysts have said Pyongyang , with its long record of brinksmanship over the nuclear issue , may be hoping to squeeze a last concession out of President George W. Bush before his term ends .
On Tuesday , the North ’s official media in its first public acknowledgement that Lee Myung - bak was South Korea ’s new leader , described him by name with a string of insults .
And it derided new President Lee ’s offer of substantial investment in the North , which has come with the condition that Pyongyang ’s government mend its ways .
But the latest war of words has had little impact in the South .
Its financial markets , long used to angry rhetoric across the border , have largely ignored the latest expressions of hostility .
It also appears to have barely touched the campaigning for next week ’s election for the National Assembly when Lee ’s party is expected to win a majority .

The membership of the National Federated Union of Porn Stars wishes to register an official complaint and related Cease and Desist request .
Your incessant searching for a “ girl who fucks like a porn star , ” the somewhat similar “ girl who sucks dick like a porn star , ” and the unending fake posts regaling how “ she took my spewing cum all over her face like a porn star ” are interfering with the conduct of business in the legitimate porn industry .
A recent study concluded that the prevalence of these requests and reports have in fact begun to convince a startling proportion of otherwise normal women that they should and must behave like porn stars .
This is still a trend in its infancy but gentleman , should this phenomenon reach critical mass we , the real porn stars of America , will be shit out of luck , not to mention jobs .
Evidence to support the emergence of this trend include but are not limited to : 1. Brazilian wax “ technicians ” report a 5,000 % increase in business over the last year .
This flies in the face of reason and we cannot understand why so many otherwise normal women are paying someone to mercilessly rip out their pubic hair with hot wax .
We are here to tell you that being bound and gagged while having a complete stranger shoot cum all over our faces while being fucked up the ass by another stranger is a goddamned walk in the park compared to the pain and humiliation of kneeling on a paper covered table on all fours in a closet sized “ salon ” room while an uppity bitch clucks disapprovingly while ripping the hair from your asshole with hot wax .
And while we , the porn stars of America , get paid to do both of these things , your girlfriends do not .
2 . Speaking of ass fucking …
Now guys , we know you love the ass fucking .
Love to see it , love to think about it , and you love to pretend that you are doing it .
But consider for a moment what the world will be like if all the normal women out there catch the “ porn star fever ” that is beginning to spread and begin ass fucking as a matter of course .
Sure , you may enjoy that now but how will you feel when , as you start to lose your hair and thicken around the middle you finally settle down and get married ?
You will then be all but guaranteed to wed someone who has ass fucked every man she has ever dated .
Do you want to live in that world ?
We did n’t think so .
Please , for the love of God leave the ass fucking to the real porn stars of America .
3 .
Fake Boobs .
All us porn stars have them .
It ’s pretty much a prerequisite for the job of American porn star .
We understand your primal fixations and we are not going to bother you by over thinking them .
We are here to meet every one of your infantile ‘ I want to suck my mommy ’s tit ’ unexamined needs .
And we ’ll even do it while we ’re shoving our hairless assholes around some strangers cock .
But your girlfriends are all caught up in the spreading “ porn star fever ” and are now seeking breast augmentation at alarming rates .
Seriously , how sexy is it going to be when you have to take your future wife , who has been fucked up the ass by every man she ever dated , to the hospital to remove her ruptured and toxic fake boob ?
Leave the fake boobs to us and appreciate your woman ’s normal gorgeous tits .
Look guys , the real porn stars of America have always been there for you .
And we want that relationship to continue .
We all know that even if this ill - considered craze overtakes the nation that most of you will still be sitting at home alone stroking one out night after night .
And let ’s be honest , you need us for that .
And in a very real way , you need us to be different from the women that you work with , different from women you are neighbors with , play pub trivia games with and yes , you need us to be different from the women you date and fuck .
Our value is linked to the fact that we do things that normal women do n’t do .
Our value is also inextricably linked to the fact that you will never fuck us .
So you can see how turning all these normal women into pseudo porn stars kinda ruins it for everyone .
So please , do your part to stop the “ porn star fever ” from spreading .
Tell your woman you love her tits and her pussy just the way they are and then fuck her , but not up the ass , until she cries and begs for mercy .
Let ’s keep the earth on its right and proper axis and keep the porn stars of America on the Internet and the real women in your bed , if you ’re lucky .
Thank you , The membership of the National Federated Union of Porn Stars

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc AAPL.O is expected to launch a high - speed wireless version of iPhone in the second quarter and produce as many as 8 million of the devices in the third quarter , according to Bank of America .

Apple shares closed up $ 2.76 , or 2 percent , at $ 143.01 after the prediction in a research report about the third - generation phone from Bank of America analyst Scott Craig .
Shares in AT&T Inc T.N , the exclusive U.S. carrier for iPhone , closed up flat at $ 37.66 after rising to $ 38.39 earlier in the day .
“ Our latest channel checks point to a significant production build of a 3G iPhone beginning in the month of June after an initial small build in May , ” he said .
AT&T said last year it expects to be able to sell a 3G version of iPhone in 2008 , but it declined comment on specific launch dates on Friday .
Apple representative Jennifer Bowcock declined comment .
Craig said that now he expects production volume to be much higher than his previous estimates .
He said Apple planned to build more than 3 million high - speed iPhones in May followed by more than 8 million in the third quarter of the year .
Craig , who had previously estimated 8 million iPhone units for the whole of 2008 , said that was starting to look conservative unless some of the plans were pushed back .
Many other analysts have said they expect Apple , which is holding a developer conference in June , to launch an advanced iPhone around that time .
Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart said it would make sense for Apple to bring out its high - speed iPhone in June around the time it launches an upgrade to iPhone software .
Apple has said it expects to have sold 10 million iPhones by the end of 2008 .
It said in January that it had sold more than 4 million iPhones since the phone was launched in June .

When Apple features unknown , obscure bands in its iPod ads , the bands go on to sell tons of records , making Billboard charts and gaining respect and admiration across the world .
Apple 's mediawide influence has become so great , music industry experts have compared it with Oprah Winfrey 's ability to create bestsellers through her Book Club .
The ads are all over most Bay Area Bart Stations including the Powell Street station , located inside the Westfield Shopping Center between Market and Mission streets .

Sales of iPod players have flattened , but Apple says there are still buyers out there and the market has not been saturated .

Apple Inc. is reportedly in talks to offer free access to its iTunes music library to customers who pay extra for an iPod or iPhone .
The Cupertino technology company is discussing a deal with the major record labels , but the negotiations hinge on how Apple and the music companies would share the revenue , the Financial Times reported .
Representatives for Apple , EMI , Sony BMG and Warner Music declined to comment Wednesday .
A spokesman for Universal Music Group did not return phone calls .
If the plan is realized , Apple could charge a premium for iPods and iPhones in return for permission to download unlimited songs for free from iTunes .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Apple also is studying a plan , according to the paper , that would allow iPhone owners , who already are billed monthly for their cell phone services , to pay a regular subscription in exchange for unlimited access to its library , an arrangement that Apple CEO Steve Jobs has scoffed at in the past .
Apple 's iTunes Store is the No. 2 music retailer in the United States behind Wal - Mart , according to the market research firm NPD , selling more tracks than Target , Best Buy and Amazon.com .
The iPod also remains the most popular digital media player on the market , and the iPhone has quickly captured market share since its introduction last year .
At the same time , the number of iPods sold during the most recent quarter was flat , and Wall Street has expressed concern that the iPod may be beginning to saturate the market , something that Apple executives have denied .
The rumored deal could be a move to encourage consumers to continue purchasing iPods , now that some of the music sold on iTunes can be played on any MP3 player , not just the iPod , said James McQuivey , an analyst with Forrester Research .
Amazon.com and other online retailers also have started selling music not protected by copyright restrictions .
" The big shift in music right now is to MP3 files that are not connected to a particular device , " McQuivey said .
" That means any MP3 player is as good as any other MP3 player . "
Apple does not make much of a profit from its iTunes music sales , Jobs has said .
But it draws millions of dollars in revenues from iPod sales .
David Pakman , CEO of eMusic , a rival online music retailer , said he worries that Apple could take advantage of its monopoly in the digital music player market - the iPod commands about 85 percent of the market - and take over the online music retail market .
" If they were to bundle iTunes digital music downloads with every iPod , that would be anti-competitive behavior , " he said .
Apple 's rumored proposal is modeled after a deal that Nokia struck with Universal last year for its upcoming " comes with music " offer .
Nokia plans to sell " comes with music " cell phones later this year that will be accompanied by a one - year pass to its music library .
Customers will be able to download as many tunes as they want and keep them after the year is up , said Bill Plummer , a Nokia vice president .
The songs , however , will be copyright - protected and will only play on the cell phone and a registered computer .
With the introduction and passage of H.R.1955 , this nation is about to embark upon a course that if implemented cannot be reversed .
All that stands between a Police - state and what used to be the USA , is the Senate version of this legislation that will soon come up for a vote . *
Since this originated from the years of hearings conducted by the House Un- American Activities Committee , chaired by Joseph McCarthy , a review of the questions raised during those years can cast new light on this subject .
To this end I reviewed the text of the film " Good Night and Good Luck " which was scrupulously researched for accuracy by the producers ­ especially the words of Edward R. Morrow .
The script for the film used programs that were aired on : " See it Now . "
I used some of his words below to get a better view our current situation ( * ) .
In only one instance did I quote Morrow directly ( ** ) .
* Government has the solemn obligation to protect the national security of the United Sates and at the same time it has the duty to also protect the existing legal rights of all its citizens .
This puts everything done by this government since Bush took office , into direct violation , of the basic requirements of many long - standing US laws .
* No nation with the scope and depth that this one had can exist for long , as a one - party state .
The United States of America has become that one - party system , since the Supreme Court anointed the appointment of George W. Bush , to become president on 12 -12-2000 .
The ' party ' is " the party in power . " no other designation need be applied .
* Conspiracies cannot become the focus of a nation ; without that nation becoming a mere shadow of its former self .
That is what began to happen to us during the McCarthy era , the years of the Red Scare .
During those years the Joe McCarthy Hearings attempted to turn the focus of the nation 's thoughts into a national witch hunt that foresaw a communist under every bed , and behind every shadow .
Part of this obsession ended with censorship , blackmail and the black - listing of many who wrote , directed , acted , or performed in the arts in America .
* Dissent must never become confused with disloyalty , and since accusations are not proof , we must look to the settled laws of this country for solutions : and not simply capitulate to the fear and panic that the NWO seeks to generate .
Convictions depend upon evidence and due process of law .
Fear of Fear is the enemy .
Free people must speak now or forever hold their tongues ; because this unthinkable obscenity , this attempted legalization of ' Thought - Crimes ' ­ if it is allowed to become law ­ shall destroy this nation in a Chain Reaction , with No End in Sight .
** We can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape our responsibilities for the results .
We proclaim ourselves , as indeed we are , The defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world :
But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home .
Cassius was right ; ' the fault dear Brutus is not within our stars but in ourselves .'**
In the 1950 's no one could have envisioned the degree to which our technology has now advanced .
To " spy " on another was much more difficult than it is now .
Today our communications companies are paid by us , but they work directly for the US government insofar as these corporations send everything we say , by phone or computer , directly to various government agencies in the name of National Security ­ and they have been doing this since two months after Bush took office , which was seven months before 911 .
However the data mining of 2001 is nothing compared to what is happening now because the new spy systems are international as well as national .
" The proposals from National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell , which have entered into a draft of US Cyber - Security Policy , would legitimize data trawling on a scale that would make the current controversy about warrantless wiretapping seem like much ado about nothing , " the < http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/15/wiretap_policy_landgrab/>Register explains .
" Intelligence agencies have long angled for this kind of surveillance ability .
The infrastructure and computing power needed to tap into Americans ' email and web search history may already exist .
However a change of president , to say nothing of a Democratic Congress , may represent a block on such ambitions . "
( 1 ) And : " A vast intelligence program is to establish a global biometric database known as " Server in the Sky " that will collate and provide an " International Information Consortium " with access to the biometric measurements and personal information of citizens of the US , UK , Australia , Canada and New Zealand in the name of fighting the " war on terror " .
As reported by the < http://www.guardian.co.uk/humanrights/story/0,,2241005,00.html>London
Guardian , the plan is being formulated by the FBI with the cooperation of the home offices and law enforcement agencies of American allies . "
( 2 ) Obviously his goes far beyond the kinds of charges that could have been leveled against Americans , anonymously , in the 1950's .
Given the levels of the Fear - of - Fear in America now , coupled with the totally complicit misuse of what was the US Department of Justice .
The ordinary citizen now stands no chance whatever against this onslaught that is being directed against all of us !
This will be true : unless and until the public openly and clearly rebels over this theft of their rights , and demands redress for their grievances , in the streets as well as in what 's left of the tarnished courts .
We cannot survive without the right to be free of these illegal and invasive powers being wielded by an illegal police state that has already removed our rights to assemble , to protest , to speak freely , and now it wants to take total control over our minds and thoughts as well !
* Anyone who now opposes or criticizes either the status quo or the one - party state , must be " giving aid and comfort to the enemy . "
Consider the number of security files that have been created to date ­ not on ' foreign terrorists ' but on American - citizens , without warrants , and without " probable cause . "
( That number is CLASSIFIED ) .
Political ideals and private thoughts are a private matter , between individuals and their own consciences ; yet under the new terms dictated by Homeland - Security your every act , your every thought , and your every conversation will be considered as possible evidence against you : without warrants , without due process or the right to confront your accusers - even the charges are SECRET !
The actual " crimes " themselves will be determined AFTER you have been arrested and interrogated and possibly tortured ( that too is now ' legal ' ) ­ so anyone can easily see just how different our situation now is , from the one that was created by the House of Representatives when they held their hearings on " Un- American Activities , " way back there in the 1950's !
See the film , " Good Nigh and Good Luck " to get the flavor of that day and time .
. .
These " new legal interpretations " that shall go into effect , once the Senate passes it 's version of the Thought - Crime Bill , will owe more to the Barbaric nature of the conditions that made up the Inquisition than they do to anything like what used to be the American Criminal Justice System .
Yet those who twisted the laws and wrote the bogus new terms of torture and confinement , without charges , into the US legal system ­ have never been charged for their crimes - so this Treason against the people of the United States continues unchallenged to the present moment !
* Mature people have never had to fear new ideas or the ideas of others just because they might be different from their own .
Indeed that is how this nation grew , free from governmental imposition of religious doctrines , such as those that Old World Europe had to endure :
This nation embraced new and exciting ideas and creative competition , in both culture and commerce which then fostered a level of national prosperity that the world had never seen before .
A huge part of that success was based upon the free and open marketplace of ideas that stands diametrically opposed to censorship , to the Fear - of - Fear , and to the close - minded tyrannies of the fascist police - state mentality that is currently descending upon us like the Sword of Damocles .
Ideas and information are as important and necessary to life in this Republic as freedom and justice are to a thriving democracy .
We must fight this or surrender - because there is no middle - ground !
In the McCarthy years , people finally rebelled ' for the greater good , ' not for the Maximum - Bucks : but Greed had not yet completely swallowed most Americans at that point .
Yet - thanks to a long line of US presidential puppets that have each added to the agenda of the New World Order - today - things are much different now !
* The future of the corporations was once tied to the future of the country - that is they were until the individual members of the Corporatocracy became larger than most nations !
Now the Corporatocracy is demanding total control not only over this government , but over everything and everyone in the world .
I know that sounds like a comic - book - concept , but unfortunately that 's exactly what they say they want to do !
* Again the age - old question arises : Can anything of substance survive if is motivated by only one ideal , administered by its own one party system .
If that single goal is the control of all the wealth and power on the planet , does it stand a chance ?
History says : ' this cannot be ' because monomaniacal constructs such as this one , always self - destruct !
What 's at issue now is how many more lives and dreams must go up in smoke before Americans decide to finally bring an end to The New World Order and to the criminality of its fascist police - state tactics , once and for all !
The McCarthy years were ugly , but they also marked the first and last time that television was ever used to actually inform the public about a topic that the public needed to understand .
There have been documentaries by the hundreds , but the use of commercial television to " inform the public " died with the death of Edward R. Murrow 's " See It Now . "
The public must take back their airwaves from the commercial giants that now own them ,
The country has to find a way to give the public an unbiased view of world events : so that this kind of treason can no longer be shoved down the ignorant throats of an entire people ­ without some other way to hear and see and maybe actually understand what 's really going on .
This needs to be done immediately after the revolution - maybe their first story might be " The Death of the New World Order " ! kirwanstudios@sbcglobal.net

Senate Bill 2506 introduced by Senator Kalani English , and also signed by Senator Suzanne Chun-Oakland , as well as House Bill 2580 sponsored by Representative Millie Carroll will move to ban aspartame from the State of Hawaii .
Efforts continue to ban this deadly excitoneurotoxic carcinogenic drug that is addicting the public and triggering so many symptoms and diseases from MS and lupus and seizures to Parkinson's , diabetes and obesity and even blindness and death .
An aspartame documentary , Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World , explains how Don Rumsfeld got this marketed when the FDA said no .
http://www.soundandfury.tv/pages/rumsfeld2.html
Masquerading as an additive it's a deadly drug that interacts with other drugs and vaccines .
No one can forget the gallant efforts of Senator Gerald Ortiz y Pino who sponsored the Senate bill to ban aspartame in New Mexico .
One picture that remains in my mind is addressing the Senate with Senators sipping Diet Coke .
Dr. Ken Stoller said " It 's hard to believe we are going to get anywhere with you drinking this but consider the children . "
Aspartame is a teratogen triggering birth defects and mental retardation , reducing IQ , and triggering all types of behavioral and psychiatric problems .
http://www.mpwhi.com/report_on_aspartame_and_children.htm
Stephen Fox of Santa Fe , Managing Editor of the Santa Fe Sun News and prime New Mexico moving force behind the legislature efforts to ban aspartame , commented on the great consumer progress implicit in these two bills in Hawaii : " This is wonderful news coming from Hawaii ; the Legislators and their bill drafters saw the merit in keeping almost all of the same language from the 2006 and 2007 New Mexico bills , especially regarding the states ' rights and their obligation to protect citizens health , which are not " preempted " by massive failures at the FDA .
" These New Mexico bills were overwhelmed and eviscerated in New Mexico by some of the most vicious corporate lobbyists I have ever encountered , representing Ajinomoto of Japan , the world 's largest aspartame and MSG manufacturer , as well as their duped American corporate henchmen / colleagues who use massive amounts of Aspartame , like Coca Cola , Pepsi , Altria / Kraft Corporate services , and others .
The same lobbyists will show up in Honolulu , make no mistake ...
" These corporations have everything to lose if such bills advance and ultimately lead to the inevitable product liability and personal injury suits from those damaged by aspartame , which number in the hundreds of millions , despite their cooperate serving propaganda and lies .
" My profoundest appreciation goes to the Hawaii activists who brought up these imperative issues , and to the Legislators who see the merit and need to protect the health of all Hawaiians , no matter what duplicity is perpetuated by the top brass and corporate lackeys at the FDA . "
47 Members of the UK Parliament have asked for a ban and efforts in New Zealand continue with a circulating petition for ban .
Aspartame was never proven safe .
Here is the Board of Inquiry Report of the FDA that revoked the petition for approval : http://www.mpwhi.com/fda_petition1.doc
In the US a petition has been filed with the FDA to ban aspartame based on an imminent health hazard .
Twelve toxicologists wrote the FDA Commissioner in June asking for a ban having to do with the Ramazzini Studies showing aspartame to be a multipotential carcinogen .
http://www.mpwhi.com/aspartame_letter_to_fda.pdf
We thank Hawaii for their efforts at safeguarding the people of that state and standby to help in anyway possible .

Webware writes about Friendfeed this morning .
A quote from the article that drew my attention :
The vision
FriendFeed is currently a “ social - network aggregator . ”
It picks up the stuff you do online and tells your friends about it , saving them the hassle of visiting all your online hangouts to see what you are up to .
But as many people have noticed , this leads to social overload .
It ’s too much information to process .
Buchheit and Taylor were clear with me that they have more work to do on FriendFeed to make the core aggregation feature more useful .
In particular , they want to add intelligence to the service so it highlights what you ’re interested in , not every last thing your friends are doing .
I have been using Friendfeed irregularly the past few weeks .
I was thinking about this the other day .
Why am I less enthusiastic about the service than a lot of bloggers ( here and here for example ) out there ?
The service gets full attention of the blogging world and seems to be the new pet for tech geeks ( I wonder how many non-techies are on Friendfeed ? ) .
I have had a few good times on Friendfeed , but these times were characterized by the interaction that took place over there .
People commenting on something and replying to each others comments .
Interaction is what I like most in any kind of service .
I like Twitter for just that reason .
While Twitter was made for people to answer the question “ what are you doing ? ” , I like Twitter much better when an uncontrolled , unexpected , funny and often surprising @conversation starts ( that is , people actually addressing each other on Twitter instead of addressing the whole world ) .
It ’s interaction and it makes the service work for me .
Based upon my own experiences I ’ve come to a pretty harsh , untested , unfounded conclusion about social network aggregators .
They are based upon the wrong assumption .
And the founders of Friendfeed seem to understand this pretty well .
There is one major flaw in such services , they lack intention .
Let me explain what I mean by that using a quote from that webware article .
“ It picks up the stuff you do online and tells your friends about it , saving them the hassle of visiting all your online hangouts to see what you are up to . ”
This quote says it all .
Friendfeed and the like are build to save us the hassle of finding out what our friends are doing .
They assume that it brings us value to sit back in a lazy chair to find out what our friends are doing .
But the problem with that assumption is that it does n’t bring us enough value .
Just think about it for a minute .
Off all the things you do in a day , all the people you meet , all the things you read , write , think .
How much of that stuff is actually interesting for your “ friends ” to know about ?
Would you bother to tell them about it if Friendfeed did n’t exist ?
I bet that more than 90 % of your experiences in a day are n’t really worth mentioning to your friends .
But Friendfeed and the likes ca n’t make that distinction .
They publish everything you have imported into Friendfeed , making the rest of the world look at 90 % useless information to dig up perhaps less than 10 % good stuff .
Why ?
Not because there is too much information .
it ’s because of a lack of intention .
By now each Friendfeed user probably has imported 10 - 20 RSS feeds and is n’t even remotely aware of all the stuff he is sharing automatically .
Because of this lack of intention most of the shared stuff is worthless .
If I see something that I know my friend really likes and then share it intentionally with him , it provides us both with value .
But if I spill my guts to the world without thinking about what I ’m sharing it makes most of the things I share pretty worthless .
Precisely for this reason I believe that services such as Twitter are far more valuable than Friendfeed .
If someone posts a Tweet , he or she is using intention .
It is a conscious act to say something out loud .
Does that mean all Tweets are valuable .
Off course not .
But if intention is there , then you will see value far more likely than when something is aggregated automatically .
Friendfeed might look great to us tech geeks and bloggers .
Mostly because the service is being used to draw attention to blog posts , tech info , breaking news , etc .
It is a way to get attention for something , to draw traffic to your site .
Friendfeed is becoming a traffic driver as Fred Wilson points out .
Instead of getting RSS readers to you blog , which takes a lot of time and dedication from a blogger , we can now all post our stuff to Friendfeed .
And some folks are likely to click on the link out of curiosity .
But I have serious doubts that such a social network aggregator provides non -tech people any value .
What if we could see all “ social ” activities of our friends without them having the intention of sharing something specific with us ?
The information value , fun or surprise factor would diminish rather quickly .
It is like the Facebook news aggregator .
I am not a heavy Facebook user , but I ca n’t say that I get a lot of value knowing my friends just took a movie quiz , played a game of scrabble , poked or zombied someone .
Call me old - fashioned , but it just does n’t provide me value .
But if one of my Facebook fiends intentionally sends me a personal message , it immediately provides me with value .
Paul Buchheit and Bret Taylor came from Google , and did a great job technically aggregating everything into Friendfeed .
They did an even greater job drawing venture capital and getting the blogosphere to really get hyped over Friendfeed .
But honestly , they should really rethink the basic principle of Friendfeed .
They should stop trying to figure out what is valuable to me as a user , as shown in this quote :
Buchheit and Taylor were clear with me that they have more work to do on FriendFeed to make the core aggregation feature more useful .
In particular , they want to add intelligence to the service so it highlights what you ’re interested in , not every last thing your friends are doing .
There is n’t an algorithm that will filter out the garbage and show me the valuable stuff .
The principle is simple , garbage in means garbage out .
And Friendfeed has made it very simple for its users to draw in anything at all .
I never INTENDED to have all that stuff shared 😉
I ’ll keep reminding myself when new services arrive that interaction is what it is all about .
Forget aggregation .
Aggregation is for convenience , for the unintended .
Interaction is intentional and therefore always more interesting !
Return to Transcripts main page PAULA ZAHN NOW American , Iraqi Forces Join in Falluja Assault ; Reservist Sues to Keep from Returning to Iraq Aired November 8 , 2004 - 20:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
PAULA ZAHN , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening and welcome to what promises to be another busy week for PRIME TIME POLITICS .
Tonight , the battle for Falluja ; 10,000 American troops fight to clear the city of Iraqi insurgents .
Plus , the making of a Republican family feud .
The religious right takes credit for the president 's victory .
Now they want their agenda to be his priority .
And the outspoken former Senator Bob Kerrey on the war , the Republican majority and how to heal his own Democratic Party .
But we begin tonight with a dose of reality , the new reality in Washington .
Republicans rule .
The Democrats will just have to adjust to that .
But when it comes to setting priorities , some Republicans may have to adjust as well .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN ( voice - over ) : President Bush is back for another term in the White House , but he faces a lot of pressure from some of his strongest supporters .
Conservative Christians and evangelicals want action on a broad social agenda , including a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage .
The White House says that takes time .
SCOTT MCCLELLAN , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY :
The president remains committed to doing everything he can to protect the sanctity of marriage .
He believes very strongly that it is a sacred institution between a man and a woman .
With that said , the president during the campaign outlined a very comprehensive agenda focused on big priorities .
ZAHN : Big priorities in the short term are getting next week 's lame duck session of Congress to raise the debt limit , so the government can keep borrowing money , finish work on spending bills , and pass intelligence reforms inspired by the 9/11 Commission .
Longer - term priorities include tax simplification , reforming Social Security , and education , plus Iraq and the war on terror .
Where does that leave issues like the marriage amendment ?
MCCLELLAN : It 's a priority .
He 'll continue to talk to members of Congress about it .
You have new members coming into Congress as well .
He 's already reached out to some of those , on both sides of the aisle , and he 'll continue to do that on priorities .
No , I 'm talking more broadly , not specifically this issue .
ZAHN : Democrats are also adjusting to the new political reality in Washington and some may be questioning the value of staying in the minority .
Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer of New York , Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New Jersey could be tempted by upcoming races for governor in their home states .
New Jersey votes next year .
Governor Jim McGreevey said goodbye to his staff today .
He is finally resigning after announcing back in August that he is gay and had an affair with a man , a man who happened to be on his payroll .
GOV .
JAMES MCGREEVEY ( D ) , NEW JERSEY :
To be clear , I am not apologizing for being a gay American , but rather , for having let personal feelings impact my decision - making , and for not have having had the courage to be open about whom I was .
ZAHN : McGreevey lamented that , in his words , dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of different views .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : And joining me now , a Democrat who has served as both a governor and U.S. senator .
Bob Kerrey also was a member of the 9/11 Commission and is now president of the New School University here in New York .
You better not do much more , because I can barely get that all into the introduction .
BOB KERREY ( D ) , FORMER U.S. SENATOR : That 's it .
That 's it .
ZAHN : Welcome back .
KERREY : Thank you .
ZAHN : I wanted to start off tonight by talking about the role that faith and the evangelical vote played in the reelection of President Bush .
And one of your former colleagues , Senator Hart , wrote quite pointedly about that issue in an editorial today .
And he said -- quote --
" It should concern us that declarations of faith are quickly becoming a condition for seeking public office .
Declarations of faith are abstractions that permit both voters and candidates to fill in the blanks with their own religious beliefs . "
He thinks that 's dangerous .
Do you ?
KERREY :
Well , it can be if you do n't understand the importance of keeping the government secular , so that you can practice whatever religion you want .
( CROSSTALK ) ZAHN :
Do you fear that 's going to happen the second go - round of the Bush administration ?
KERREY :
Well , I think it 's not likely , but it 's potentially there .
When the president stood up at a faith - based initiative program and said , we do n't need a rule book , we just need the good book , and held up a Bible , that was a mistake .
That sends a signal that the New Testament is going to be the rule of law .
And it can not be .
We have got to keep that separation , so that we can practice our religion , whatever our religion is .
Or if we choose not to practice a religion , we can choose that as well in this country .
ZAHN : So what do you think is going to be the defining moment for the president when it comes to whether in fact he rules by the good book or rules more ...
( CROSSTALK )
KERREY :
Well , I think it actually could become this same - sex marriage amendment .
Look , my religious belief causes me to conclude that homosexuality and heterosexuality are both natural states , that God put gay and straight on this Earth alike .
And it 's taken us a while to come to terms with that , but that 's my religious belief .
It 's an article of faith .
It 's not based on science or a political calculation .
And , as a consequence , I find myself saying any church that wants to deny a right for a man and a man to get married , that 's fine with them .
The Catholic Church wo n't let me get married in the church , even though I would prefer it , because I wo n't have my first marriage annulled .
But marriage is a legal issue as well .
And just as the government should n't tell the church what to do , the church should n't tell the government what to do .
And I fear that 's what this is all about , as well as people not really understanding that homosexuality is a state that people acquire at birth .
It 's not a choice that 's been made .
ZAHN : Well , a lot of Americans do n't think it 's an article of faith according to their own religious convictions .
( CROSSTALK )
KERREY :
They need to hear Democrats say -- this is n't a political calculus .
This is n't us trying to put together a coalition .
It 's just as important a religious belief of mine as it is those who say I 'm uncomfortable with same - sex marriage .
I think it is in fact a natural state .
It was a question that was asked during the debate and I think answered improperly .
That was the one where John went on about the vice president 's daughter .
That set off a wave of anger , etcetera , rather than focusing on the question , which is , do you choose it or are you born that way ?
And Americans need to understand that .
I think the president understands that .
The question is , will he push that as a religious issue ?
ZAHN : The former president , President Clinton , in a piece over the weekend suggested John Kerry lost for a number of reasons , particularly because he did n't think John Kerry connected in rural America with voters , particularly on moral issues , including the issue of gay marriage , and went on to say the Republicans had a clear message and a great messenger , that they used a culture war to leave the Democrats -- quote -- " demonized , cartoonized , as aliens . "
Did they not understand the culture war going on in this country ?
( CROSSTALK )
KERREY : President Clinton never faced an opponent as tough as George W. Bush .
His father was n't as tough and Bob Dole was n't as tough .
George W. Bush is a very tough campaigner .
He is an intuitive politician .
He 's an incumbent president .
And he was an exceptionally difficult person for John Kerry under the best of circumstances .
ZAHN : Was John Kerry an intuitive campaigner ?
KERREY :
He 's not as intuitive a politician as George Bush is .
I mean , George W. Bush 's father is n't as intuitive .
I 'm not as intuitive .
George Bush knows when to kiss the baby .
And that 's a hard thing to teach .
In fact , it 's an impossible thing to teach .
He 's very good on the street and he 's good with the message .
His message was , I will keep you safe , and the other guy wo n't .
And when you are the incumbent , it 's a much higher standard for an opponent to prove that you 're wrong .
So ...
ZAHN : The American public , by and large , did n't think John Kerry was the guy to do that .
KERREY :
That 's correct , because the president had a case , a very simple case to make : I am the commander in chief .
I won the war in Afghanistan , even though John Kerry supported it , even though , by the way , there 's a credible case that the president 's own negligence prior to 9/11 at least in part contributed to the disaster in the first place .
ZAHN : How so ?
KERREY :
Well , the 9/11 report says in chapter eight -- now that it 's beyond the campaign , so the promise I had to keep this out of the campaign is over .
The 9/11 report in chapter eight says that , in the summer of 2001 , the government ignored repeated warnings by the CIA , ignored , and did n't do anything to harden our border security , did n't do anything to harden airport country , did n't do anything to engage local law enforcement , did n't do anything to round up INS and consular offices and say we have to shut this down , and did n't warn the American people .
The famous presidential daily briefing on August 6 , we say in the report that the briefing officers believed that there was a considerable sense of urgency and it was current .
So there was a case to be made that was n't made .
( CROSSTALK )
ZAHN : But what we continue to hear from this administration is that the threat was much too diffuse .
There was no way you could zero in on the fact that al Qaeda was going to use jets as bombs and ram them into buildings .
KERREY :
That is a straw man .
The president says , if I had only known that 19 Islamic men would come into the United States of America and on the morning of 11 September hijack four American aircraft , fly two into the World Trade Center , one into the Pentagon , and one into an unknown Pennsylvania that crashed in Shanksville , I would have moved heaven and earth .
That 's what he said .
Mr. President , you do n't need to know that .
This is an Islamic jihadist movement that has been organized since the early 1990s , declared war on the United States twice , in '96 and ' 98 .
You knew they were in the United States .
You were warned by the CIA .
You knew in July they were inside the United States .
You were told again by briefing officers in August that it was a dire threat .
And what did you do ?
Nothing , so far as we could see on the 9/11 Commission .
Now , that 's in the report .
And we took an oath not to talk about it during the campaign , I think correctly so , to increase the capacity of that commission 's report to be heard by the people 's Congress .
But the report , I think , it 's difficult for a challenger .
If I had been the challenger , it 's difficult to make that case when you are running against an incumbent .
He can stand back and say , oh , you 're just grousing .
ZAHN : Oh , we could n't connect the dots is what we heard .
Final question for you sir .
In Falluja ...
KERREY : Yes .
ZAHN : There are some Democrats that suggest that this incursion was delayed until after the election because of the vulnerability of the U.S. troops and this could be a very bloody campaign .
Where do you stand ?
KERREY : Oh , I think it 's likely it was delayed until after the election .
And it 's probably a smart thing to do .
This is as much a political battle inside of Iraq as it is a military battle .
And everybody knows that who has talked to people that 's over there .
So I think it 's likely that it was .
ZAHN : Bob Kerrey , thanks for dropping by .
KERREY : You 're welcome .
Nice to see you .
ZAHN : Always appreciate your perspective .
Still to come on PRIME TIME POLITICS , it 's the next great divide , but it 's not between Republicans and Democrats .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN ( voice - over ) : With Democrats on the sidelines , the president 's toughest critics could be fellow Republicans .
Iraq , the deficit , conservative judges .
Tonight , the Republicans divided by victory .
And the battle of Falluja , turning point or just another step in a long , hard slog ?
And tonight 's voting booth question : Does President Bush have a mandate to implement his agenda ?
Go to CNN.com / Paula and vote .
The results and much more as PRIME TIME POLITICS continues .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : A president with a mandate , a 10 - seat majority in the Senate , at least 25 seats in the House .
So everything should be smooth sailing for Republicans , right ?
Well , maybe not .
Now they are facing battles among themselves .
Here 's our congressional correspondent Joe Johns .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
JOE JOHNS , CNN CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) : Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter symbolizes the tug of war between conservatives and moderate Republicans in the Congress .
Long thought to be the next Senate Judiciary Committee chairman , conservative groups are rising up against Specter because he said judicial nominees who oppose abortion might have a tough time to getting confirmed .
But he said there is still time to work with the president .
SEN .
ARLEN SPECTER ( R ) , PENNSYLVANIA :
He and I have worked very well together .
He does n't expect me to agree with every last point .
We 've had differences .
But on judicial nominations , he is relying upon me to have prompt hearings .
JOHNS : What some conservatives can't forgive is Specter 's opposition the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork during the Reagan years .
Specter helped get Bork rejected .
BRUCE FEIN , CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT :
It 's hard to conceive of him giving the full support for a Bush nomination that a chairman of a committee ought to .
JOHNS : Conservative legal expert Bruce Fein says the Bush agenda would be in jeopardy if Specter gets the job .
FEIN : Senator Specter clearly falls short of the mark .
He may well be able to say with some conviction and truth , well , I wo n't oppose the president , but that is not , it seems to me , a satisfactory answer .
JOHNS ( on camera ) :
But moderates and conservatives can disagree on more than just judges , From gay marriage to the Patriot Act to creating private accounts in Social Security , to tax cuts to tax reform , the math in the Congress works in the president 's favor to stay the conservative course .
( voice - over ) : Grover Norquist is a leading voice from the right on tax fairness issues .
GROVER NORQUIST , PRESIDENT , AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM : With 55 Republicans in the Senate , one or two guys do n't get in the way .
And there are two or three Democrats who are up for reelection in two years who need to be for tax reduction .
So the folks who thought they could be in the middle or one foot on either team do n't find themselves in the catbird seat now .
JOHNS : Still , the president has said a new term is an opportunity to reach out to the whole nation and some of his colleagues are hoping he can do that regardless of the numbers .
SEN .
CHUCK HAGEL ( R ) , NEBRASKA :
We have got big issues domestically , internationally .
I think the president understands that we cannot , we , the Republican Party , even though we control the Congress and the White House , can't do this alone .
JOHNS : Republican leaders are expected to take their cues from the White House , which said Monday that no one should be surprised the president is pursuing exactly what he talked about on the campaign trail .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : And that was congressional correspondent Joe Johns .
Joining me now from Lynchburg , Virginia , the Reverend Jerry Falwell , founder of Liberty University , and from Washington tonight , Austin Ruse , president of the Culture of Life Foundation , a conservative Catholic group .
Great to have both of you with us .
Welcome .
AUSTIN RUSE , PRESIDENT , CULTURE OF LIFE FOUNDATION : Glad to be with you .
ZAHN : Reverend Falwell , I know you are astute enough politically that you know you are not going to get everything you want from this president , but what does he have to deliver to keep his conservative base happy ?
JERRY FALWELL , CHANCELLOR , LIBERTY UNIVERSITY :
Well , first of all , I have never and religious conservatives in this country have never distrusted this president .
He has led the way .
He is the guy who introduced the federal marriage amendment .
He is the man who said he wants to get good strict constructionists on the Supreme Court and on the federal benches and he is the guy who wants to have a flat tax , etcetera , etcetera .
I 'm here to help him .
We put 30 million people at the polls and we do n't regret a moment of it .
And , yes , Arlen Specter does give me pause .
We got rid of Tom Daschle .
We do n't need a Republican Tom Daschle .
And if he cannot give the president total and loyal support , then somebody else should be chair .
But that 's a minor bump in the road .
And Bill Frist can take care of that .
And I 'm sure he will .
ZAHN : But you still have n't addressed the question of what he has to deliver to you .
I think I understand what you 're saying in a judicial sense .
So you want a flat tax .
( CROSSTALK )
FALWELL : We want some pro-life , pro-family , strict constructionist judges .
We have enough of the other side right now .
I have a little problem with Mr. Specter .
Robert Bork was maybe the most qualified member of the Supreme Court ever to go up there , and Specter is one of the guys who shot him down .
I have a hard time forgetting that .
I want to see the federal marriage amendment passed as early next year as possible .
I am not talking about stopping the war to do that , but I am saying that we waited a long time and this -- we did n't start this battle , but these are the people who helped put 55 senators in place and a majority in the House .
And the president is a fine , committed Christian who I trust will do just what he has said he will do .
ZAHN : All right , Austin , we just heard the reverend say what would be a priority in his mind , but if you listen to what was laid out with his agenda today , moral issues were barely even touched .
The issue of tax reform came up and Social Security .
How quickly do you think the president needs to address this issue of a federal marriage act ?
RUSE : Well , this president has been the Middle East pro-life and pro-family president that we have had .
But we believe that he will move forward on all fronts that are important to us .
ZAHN : So you were n't let down today ?
RUSE : No , not at all , not at all .
FALWELL : Nor I .
RUSE : Of course , we want the president to lead us publicly on these issues , but he spoke about these issues in the campaign , both the federal marriage amendment and also abortion judges and the whole panoply of conservative social issues .
And we absolutely believe that he will come through on each and every one of them .
ZAHN : Reverend , I heard in your first answer how strongly you support the president , and yet I am left with the very distinct impression from other conservatives I 've spoken with there was a great disappointment in the president when it comes to the issue of war , and many of them said they held their criticism , they held back their tongues , because they did n't want to hurt his reelection bid .
You can't be satisfied with what 's going on in Iraq right now , can you ?
FALWELL : I believe the president has done the only thing that a good president whose primary responsibility is the defense of freedom , defense of the citizenry , could possibly do .
I believe the war in Iraq was as just a war as World War II with Adolf Hitler was .
I believe that what the president is doing is the right thing .
I believe the assault on Falluja today -- my only regret was , we did n't finish it last April .
And I hope that this war on terrorism , not only Afghanistan and Iraq , but wherever else the president needs to pursue terrorism -- I believe the only way to solve this problem is with force .
Negotiating with the bin Ladens and the Saddam Husseins of this world is futile .
I do support the president 1,000 precent .
ZAHN : Austin , I recently spoke with Reverend Pat Robertson .
And he got scorched by many conservatives for what he said on the air .
He recalled a conversation he had with the president .
He said that he warned the president that this was going to be a war we should n't enter , the there were going to be tremendous American casualties .
He said the president did n't think there would be any casualties .
Am I talking with conservatives on a different planet here ?
Because the conservatives I have spoken with are adamantly opposed to this war and they hate these deficits .
RUSE : I can't speak for other conservatives , and my organization does not work on this particular issue .
But it seems to me that the situation in Iraq is a transformative experience for the Middle East .
Certainly , things have n't gone perfectly after Baghdad fell .
But I also think that a lot of the news coming out of the Middle East is skewed .
I think a lot of the news is much better than we see in the media here in America .
And I think , in the coming weeks and months , something very important is going to happen there , namely , an election , which they have not had before .
And I say let 's wait and see .
( CROSSTALK )
FALWELL : And , Austin , three million women voted in Afghanistan recently , and that is something phenomenal in the Middle East .
ZAHN : Gentlemen , we are going to have to leave it there .
Reverend Jerry Falwell , Austin Ruse , appreciate both of you for joining us tonight .
RUSE : Thank you so much .
ZAHN : My pleasure .
And , over the weekend , the president 's adviser Karl Rove made it clear the administration wants to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage .
Yet the president has said he 's OK with civil unions for gays .
And with Christian conservatives feeling their power , can Republicans find a compromise ?
We 'll look at that next .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : Lots of talk today about the president putting more conservative judges in federal court .
Here 's a sample from talk radio's G. Gordon Liddy .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP , " THE G. GORDON LIDDY SHOW " )
G. GORDON LIDDY , HOST : Political power talks .
And you have shown it .
You got out and you voted and you put the president over the top and you added to the power of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives and critically in the Senate .
That 's power .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I agree wholeheartedly in the agenda that should be met .
We need the right judges in place .
And ...
( CROSSTALK )
LIDDY : Yes .
What we need is judges who will judge and not legislate .
The liberals are all whining and sniveling and carry on and giving various excuses .
The people of faith expect their positions to be honored .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
ZAHN : It is the talk of talk radio , the Bush agenda and the conservative Christian agenda , that is , and how closely the two might mesh over the next four years .
Before the break , we heard from the conservative Christian side .
Joining me now from Washington , Ann Stone of Republicans For Choice , and Patrick Guerriero , executive direction of the pro-gay rights Log Cabin Republicans , which retracted its endorsement of President Bush earlier this year .
Good to have both of you with us .
PATRICK GUERRIERO , DIRECTOR , LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS : Good to be with you , Paula .
ANN STONE , REPUBLICANS FOR CHOICE :
Thanks , Paula .
ZAHN : Thank you .
So , Ann , tonight , I want to start with something that Senator Arlen Specter had to say on CNN earlier today , when he seemed to distance himself from the pro-life position .
And we should make it clear before people listen to it that he is next in line to assume -- the pro-choice position -- excuse me -- next in line to assume the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Let 's listen .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
ARLEN SPECTER ( R ) , PENNSYLVANIA :
The facts are that I have supported all of President Bush 's nominees in the committee and on the floor and I voted for strict constructionist who are pro-life judges .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
ZAHN : Do you think the senator is trying to save his confirmation ?
STONE : I think he 's telling the truth .
And , in fact , I would say the Christian right deserves to give Arlen Specter this chairmanship .
He has bled for them .
He bled for them on Clarence Thomas .
And if they are still bringing up Robert Bork , I 'll tell you , they need to get over it , because he really bled on Thomas .
As well , I think Republicans need to stop and remember that it was Arlen Specter that stopped Hillary 's health care plan .
Remember that famous diagram he did ?
ZAHN : I do remember that diagram , but do you think his nomination is in jeopardy right now , Ann ?
There seemed to be an awful lot of backlash based on some of the comments he made last week .
And then he later softened those comments .
STONE : Yes .
I 'm on a lot of e-mail lists for the Christian right and there is a real firestorm .
And it just seems that here they won tremendous victories or victories that they perceive , and yet they still have to go on to the attack .
What ever happened to do unto others is what I want to know .
And at some point they are going to have to realize they won some stuff .
They need to come up with a proactively positive agenda and stop with the savaging and personal character assassination they are doing , especially with somebody like Arlen , who really has been a good soldier for Republicans .
While he is pro-choice and he votes pro-choice , he has come through for the president on more than one occasion .
ZAHN : Do you think he 'll end up heading up the Senate Judiciary Committee ?
STONE : I would hope so .
This is a test for the Bush administration , in fact , to see whether or not they are going to be able to be an administration for all of the people or they 're going to simply represent a small vocal minority .
You know , if you look at the exit polling , if you believe that 22 percent voted on moral values , not all of them were conservative moral values , but even if you say most of that was , there 's still 80 percent of the people voting on other things .
ZAHN : Patrick , how big of a setback was this election for gays ?
GUERRIERO : I think it was certainly a wakeup call for gay and lesbian Americans .
I was just thinking that , in listening to Reverend Falwell a few moments ago , I have now seen two things over the last few weeks I never thought I would see in my lifetime .
As a Red Sox fan , I have seen them win the World Series , and I actually agreed with much of what Reverend Falwell said .
Conservatives deserve credit .
Despite my disappointment in some of the tactics used , they delivered people to the polls .
And anyone who says otherwise is lying to you .
And , second , the American people trust Republican leadership more now when we talk about protecting their families during a war on terrorism and dealing with issues likes Social Security and tax reform .
ZAHN : But how about the issue of gay rights and gay marriage ?
GUERRIERO : What Reverend Falwell will -- where we separate ways is , Reverend Falwell and others wo n't tell you or want to talk about the fact that , even in this election , where a lot of people did vote around issues relating to moral values , two out of three of the voters support civil unions for gay and lesbian families in America .
And while the marriage debate was new , and it drove some people to the polls .
And most of the country is just navigating through this issue , under the surface is a real movement to realize we need to do something for part of the American family that does n't have hospital visitation and other basic things that most Americans agree on .
A short setback , a good wakeup call , but I think a great hope for the future .
ZAHN : Patrick , we just have 30 seconds left .
Do you think in this administration , there will be a big push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage .
GUERRIERO :
The president has made a promise he would aggressively move in that direction with , while Log Cabin will stand with the president on a series of issues , we will not stand with him on trying to right discrimination in the constitution .
It 's something that wo n't be good for the country and we should n't mark up our nation 's founding document doing that .
ZAHN : Patrick Guerriero , Ann Stone , thank you both for joining us .
GUERRIERO : Good to be with .
STONE : Thank you .
ZAHN : Thank you .
And while the Bush administration plans it 's domestic agenda , it's in the process of executing an important and long - delayed military goal .
American and Iraqi troops launch a massive assault on Falluja .
The latest on that coming up .
And please remember to weigh in on today 's booth voting question , does President Bush have mandate to implement his agenda .

ZAHN : At least 10,000 American and 2,000 Iraqi forces have begun the fight to take Falluja from Iraqi insurgents .
The outcome is critical to President Bush 's hopes of holding elections in Iraq just two months from now .
Here 's senior Pentagon correspondent , Jamie McIntyre .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
JAMIE MCINTYRE , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT
( voice - over ) :
When the long threatened offensive finally kicked off , U.S. trooped were pumped .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
We 're going to smack the crap out of them .
That would be nice .
MCINTYRE : With more than 2,000 Iraqi troops , and more than 10,000 American soldiers .
The Pentagon is confident the estimated 3,000 insurgents can be routed .
But Pentagon officials downplaying any suggestion the battle for Falluja is a final show down with the insurgents .
DONALD RUMSFELD , DEFENSE SECRETARY : I would not think of it that way .
And I think it would be a mistake for anyone .
Listen these folks are determined .
These are killers .
They chop people 's head off .
GEN .
RICHARD B. MYERS , JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF :
If there were a silver bullet , we 've would have shot that long time ago .
There 's not a silver bullet .
This is very challenging work .
MCINTYRE : The U.S. is highlighting the Iraqi in retaking Falluja .
Even dropping the Pentagon 's name for the operation , Phantom Fury , for one picked by Iraq 's interim prime minister , Operation Dawn .
There have been some reports of Iraqi troops deserting or failing to report for duty , but the Pentagon insists it 's an isolated problem .
RUMSFELD : What one ought to expect from time to time , we 're going to see this type of thing .
And on the other hand there have been commando units , and some rad control elements and some regular Iraqi forces and police forces that have done a very good job .
MCINTYRE :
The other big question is whether the insurgents and their leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi will melt away and regroup somewhere else .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : And Jamie McIntyre joins me now from Pentagon tonight .
So , Jamie , how strong was the resistance from the insurgents in this initial battle ?
MCINTYRE : Well , we do n't have a real clear picture of it , but here 's a good indication of it , we have no reports at this point of any U.S. or Iraqi casualties .
And That 's Probably an indicator that the strongest fighting is yet to come .
If you take a look at a map of Falluja , you can see that the objectives that they 've taken so far are sort of on the outside of town .
The -- that little red dot over there , that 's the hospital to the left hand side of the screen .
That 's where the Iraqi commando's went .
Those two bridges over the Euphrates River , they 've been -- they 've been secured by Marines .
Very little resistance there .
And the Jolan District , that 's where they believe the bulk of the insurgents are holed up .
There 's been fighting , but it looks like the big push into the center of the city and the strongest most deadly combat is to come .
But they have encountered is a lot of booby traps -- road side bombs have been rigged to go off .
And they have been spending a lot of time neutralizing that threat .
ZAHN : So if the belief is the strongest attack is yet to come , what might that look like .
MCINTYRE : Well , it could be some pretty nasty street to street fighting as they move into the area , depending on whether the insurgents stand and fight .
But again , they 're well aware of the insurgent tactics .
They want to make sure they do n't walk into any traps , and they want to make sure they have the upper hand .
ZAHN : Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon thanks for that late report tonight .
And now joining me from Washington , Dan Senor the former spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and until recently an adviser to the Bush / Cheney campaign .
Welcome back , good to see you , Dan.
DAN SENIOR , FMR .
SPOKESMAN FOR COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY IN IRAQ : Good to be with you , Paula .
ZAHN : Thank you .
So , the administration is making a big deal about Iraqis forces joining Americans forces working side by side .
But we can't ignore the fact that half of an Iraqi balion ( ph ) , battalion failed to even showed up for duty .
What is the discrepancy in the battle readiness for the American troops and the Iraqi troops .
SENOR : One army -- one military has been fighting wars for a couple hundred years .
One has been basically training and equipping and organizing for a few months here , just over a year , and really ramped up in the last six to eight months .
ZAHN : Are they ready ?
SENOR : Sure .
I think the incidents of none participation are isolated , far fewer than we saw last April .
I think , the professionization of the Iraqi security services is are more sophisticated than it was eight , nine months ago .
Look , there 'll be isolated incidents , but I think that the morale of the Iraqi troops is high .
I think they are very committed , they 're very serious , they 're very patriotic group of young men .
And I think what 's most telling with regard to their commitment is Abu Musab al - Zarqawi has been targeting them .
There 's been some dreadful , awful , tragic attacks against the Iraqi security forces over the last couple of months .
And yet each day there 's a bombing in a military training facility or recruiting facility , the next day Iraqis are lining up to serve .
So I think the commitment and as I said , the patriotism is there , it 's just a matter of constantly upgrading , modernizing , professional .
ZAHN : But Dan , you and I understand that there 's a big difference between a sense of commitment and patriotism and the issue of reliability .
How reliable are these Iraqi troops ?
SENOR : Well , look , as I said , I do n't think you can do a one to one ratio at this point and compare the professionization and the modernization with American troops .
But that 's OK .
They can still play a prominent role in the operations and have a significant impact , even if they have n't been fighting wars like our military has been for a couple of hundred years .
Here 's the important point , Paula , when insurgents are being confronted by a military in a the Jolan District of Falluja , are they being confronted by American Marines alone or are they also being confronted by Iraqis ?
Our capacity to break the back of the insurgency and kill the morale of the insurgency is dramaticly enhanced when you have Iraqis being confronted by Iraqis .
Not just Iraqi 's being confronted by Marines .
At the end of the day that 's one of the most significant contribution that these Iraqi security forces make .
ZAHN : Help me understand that , Dan .
The insurgents will see that there are Iraqi troops at the -- in front of the Marines ?
How will they distinguish that on the battlefield ?
SENOR : The -- the insurgency we face in Iraq basically has two groups .
There are the domestic Saddamists , remnants of the former regime who stuck around and are fighting another day .
And then there are the foreign terrorists that have come into the country , the professional terrorists , people like Zarqawi and the al Qaeda element .
And what we 've seen in recent weeks is a little bit of a rift emerging here , between the foreign fighters , the foreign professional terrorists and the domestic insurgents .
And that 's for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the domestic insurgents do n't want to go head to head against their fellow countrymen in uniform .
There 's a -- there 's a real sense of national pride in this country .
There 's a real sense of connection .
And when they see Iraqis defending their country , the insurgents have a much different attitude than when they 're confronted by Marines , U.S. Marines who they could in their own minds justify as , oh , they 're occupation forces and we 're fighting against occupation forces .
ZAHN : Of course , only time will tell .
SENOR : But fighting against Iraqis has a far different psychological effect .
ZAHN : You 're telling me they 're going to recognize that from a couple of hundred yards away ?
Or half a mile away ?
SENOR : But this is -- this is classic urban warfare , Paula .
I mean , there 's going to be face - to - face , hand - to - hand combat here .
I mean , Iraqis will be engaged by troops in some way , shape or form in many cases in very close proximity .
ZAHN : Secretary Rumsfeld has made it very clear he does n't view this as the final showdown against the insurgents .
What are the possibilities that more American troops will be required to really tamp down this movement ?
SENOR : You know , I think at this stage right now , now that this operation is just getting under way , it 's premature to have a speculative discussion about troop leads going forward .
Let 's let this process play out here for a few days .
I would say , though , that -- that success in Falluja , while it will not necessarily be the final battle , it is -- it is a key decisive battle , because it is -- it is the center of the insurgency .
It 's the headquarters .
It 's the base of the operations .
And if we and the Iraqis are successful in confronting that centerpiece there , it will make operations in the surrounding areas much easier .
ZAHN : Dan Senor , as always , good to see you .
Thanks for your time tonight .
SENOR : Good to be with you .
ZAHN : Thanks .
And many of the troops fighting and risking their lives in Iraq are reservists .
Some fought in the Gulf War .
Others have been ordered to Iraq more than once .
When we come back a soldier who served , then sued to keep from going back .
He 'll tell us his story .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : The military calls it stop loss .
Others say it amounts to a back - door draft .
Either way , some American reservists are going to court over the military 's attempts to keep them in the ranks longer than they thought they signed up for .
Maria Hinojosa has one soldier 's story .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
MARIA HINOJOSA , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) :
You would n't know Captain Jay Ferriola if you saw him on a street .
You would n't know that he sued the U.S. government , saying he was a victim of involuntary servitude .
This former Army captain could have been the face of a new generation of Iraqi war veterans , veterans who have completed their tour of duty and now refuse to go back .
That 's less likely now because last week , in an out of court agreement , the Army did what Captain Ferriola wanted : they let him go free .
JAY FERRIOLA , FORMER ARMY CAPTAIN :
It was n't more of a fear of going over , it was that , you know , I completed my obligation .
And I was continuing my career in the civilian world and did n't want to give up 18 months , or lose 18 months of my life , whether I was going to Iraq or if I was going to Paris .
HINOJOSA : His lawyer , Barry Slotnick , had been preparing for a legal battle against the government , trying to prove that the Army had breached its contract with Captain Ferriola .
BARRY SLOTNICK , ATTORNEY :
This is someone who served out his contract , served his country , resigned properly and was a meritorious soldier .
Others that stand in Jay 's shoes will be relieved by what happened in court today .
HINOJOSA : Slotnick says he has already received numerous messages from soldiers who want to challenge their deployments , all , he says , because the Ferriola case proves you can fight the military in court and win .
SLOTNICK : You sign up .
You do your time and you 're unavailable .
We do not have a draft in this country .
HINOJOSA : This is new terrain for a new generation of lawyers , judges and soldiers , who may choose to fight in court rather than serve in this war .
The Army says it has only one case pending , but veterans in anti- war groups say they 're getting a lot of calls from desperate soldiers who want to fight what many describe as a backdoor draft .
Congressman Charles Rangel believes one solution is reinstating a national draft .
REP .
CHARLES RANGEL ( D ) , NEW YORK : I , for one , believe if we had a draft we might take a different look at our foreign policy .
And it might be if that we were talking about kids of Congress people , kids of the CEOs , kids of those in the Pentagon and the cabinet , then maybe some adjustment in thinking about using troops and the military as the main thrust in our foreign policy .
HINOJOSA : On the streets of Harlem , there are fears that a draft could be more than just talk .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
If the time comes to me to go to war , I would go to war for my country .
HINOJOSA : Two weeks ago , Alberto Arcy ( ph ) returned from the front lines in Baghdad .
He should have served a year but was ordered to stay 16 months .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I wanted to come home , but the way I look at it I 'm a soldier .
So I had to do what I had to do , you know ?
Whether I serve -- I made that commitment to serve the United States of America .
HINOJOSA : And even women here are talking about a draft in extreme terms .
( on camera ) You 've heard people say this ?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes .
HINOJOSA : They 'd rather go to jail ?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes .
HINOJOSA : Than get drafted ?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes .
HINOJOSA : What do you think about that ?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE :
To be honest , I would , too .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
ZAHN : That was Maria Hinojosa reporting for us tonight .
And for all the talk of politics and military strategy , war is a store that is probably best told by those who fight it and those who die fighting .
When we come back , some final letters home that will move your heart .
We 'll be right back .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
ZAHN : There is nothing more precious than letters sent home from a son , a daughter , a husband or wife at war , and if that loved one is killed , nothing is more heart breaking .
Well , on Thursday , Veterans ' Day , our sister network , HBO , premieres a documentary called " Last Letters Home : Voices from the American Troops of the Battlefields of Iraq . "
And Life Books , which is also owned by Time Warner , has just published a book of these letters .
Listen to these touching words read by the relatives who received the letters .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I look around me at the people that I 've spent the last five months with , lived , slept , ate , fought with .
They do n't know my whole story , about my loving family and wife , and I do n't know their complete story , either .
Everyone knows , however , that each one of us have a story and a home and a mother .
And for that reason we share an unspoken kinship that carries us together through each day .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I am not an idealist who thinks I can change the world , but I can still be doing some sort of good .
I want to be able to believe in what I am doing .
I could never do that just working an ordinary job .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I 've been a little depressed lately , but I 'm trying to keep my chin up .
I really miss home .
Tomorrow will be exactly three months since I got deployed .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE :
He called me the Friday before he died and told me there was a letter in the mail .
I promised I would n't read it , but he knows me .
I 'm nosy .
I 'm going to read it .
And when he was killed the letter did n't come , and did n't come .
And I needed it to come .
When I got out of the hospital from having Carson four weeks later and I checked the mail .
And it was there .
And it was the hardest and best thing I ever read , because I know exactly how he feels is about us .
But at the same time I know I lost the love of my life and the father of my children .
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I love you and I miss you , and we 're going to Olive Garden and D.Q. the day I get back .
Tell everyone I said hi and one day I 'll get home .
Your loving son , Robert Wise , just in case .
And then he put , " There 's no place like home , " parentheses , " click , " " There 's no place like home , " parentheses , " click . "
And in capitals , " There 's no place like home , " parentheses , " click .
Damn , it did n't work again . "
The day that he died , I did expect to hear from him that day , because it was my birthday .
But I got -- I got a knock on the door instead .
And no matter what anybody tells you , when they knock on your door , they do n't have to say a word , because when you open the door and you see two uniforms and a chaplain , nobody has to say anything .

Scientists have switched on the world 's most powerful laser , which for one - trillionth of a second is 2,000 times more powerful than all the power plants in the United States .
The laser 's output tops a petawatt , which is a quadrillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000 ) watts of power .
In the basement of the physics building at the University of Texas at Austin , the school 's High Intensity Laser Science Group built a petawatt laser in hopes of recreating astronomical phenomena like supernovae in miniature .
" We can put materials into states that you can't access here on earth , " said Mikael Martinez , the laser project 's manager .
" You 'd have to go out into space and hang out with an exploding star to observe what we plan to observe here in Texas . "
When the scientists turned on the laser on March 31 , it became the world 's most powerful operational laser , but it does n't yet hold the record for the most powerful laser ever built .
That honor , at least for a few more months , belongs to the now mothballed Nova laser built at Lawrence Livermore National Lab .
The Nova produced 1.25 petawatts of power when it was first switched on in 1996 .
Martinez said he expected his project to break that record within the year , reaching between 1.3 and 1.5 petawatts .
Below , we take a virtual walk through the tech – amplifiers , compressors and crystals – that make this Texas - size laser so powerful .
The power of a laser , its output in watts , is determined by the energy of the laser pulse , measured in joules , divided by its duration , measured in seconds ( tiny fractions of a second in this case ) .
So , to get high power , you can either turn up the energy or cram the same amount of energy into a shorter duration pulse – or do both .
The problem is that turning up the energy makes it more difficult to get short pulses .
The solution to this problem require an almost Rube - Goldberg setup inside a 1,500 - square - foot cleanroom .
The most powerful laser in the world starts , poetically enough , with a " seed laser " that puts out a wimpy nanojoule of energy for a couple hundred femtoseconds ( that 's 10 - 15 seconds ) .
It must be run through a series of amplifiers , compressors , and stretchers before it can recreate the conditions inside the sun for a trillionth of a second .
.
The seed laser is run through what is known as a stretcher .
The device uses a diffraction grate that works like a prism does for standard light to separate the laser into its constitutent wavelengths .
This , in effect , lengthens the pulse from the femtosecond range ( 10 - 15 second ) to the nanosecond range ( 10 - 9 second ) .
Doing so , however , reduces its energy even further from nanojoules to picojoules .
Scientists go through this process because it makes the pulse easier to manipulate in the next step : amplification .
First , the newly elongated seed pulse is juiced by entirely different lasers using special crystals in a process called optical parametric amplification .
This takes the power of the laser all the way to one joule .
Then , it hits the rod amplifier , which is a 24 - centimeter - long piece of glass that gets pumped with lights that the laser pulse can absorb .
The scientists run the laser through these rods eight times to bring the energy of the laser to 20 joules .
Below , we see what is called the " laser chain , " with a green pump lamp running .
Finally , that pulse is fed through a disk amplifier , which can be seen below .
Inside this amplifier , two disks of glass are juiced with pump lights that , after four passthroughs , bring the laser up to about 250 joules of energy .
The final step is to recompress the pulse , which the stretcher had previously elongated , for maximum power .
Below , we see the compressor chamber .
Another diffraction grate inside this chamber , seen in the very top picture , recombines the spread - out wavelengths into a short pulse about 150 femtoseconds long , although with considerable energy loss .
But even at 1 joule of energy , the setup yields that whopping petawatt of power .
Martinez summed up the whole process , saying , " We play a trick on the laser .
We take the short pulse and stretch it wider .
Then we go and amplify the pulse .
Then the very last thing we do is recompress that pulse back . "
The actual laser pulse will come out of the round hatch seen at the left of the chamber , where it will be directed at a target to mimic a nuclear explosion or an exotic dense star .
The work is sponsored by the National Nuclear Security Administration and totaled about $ 7 million in equipment costs .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s supreme leader implicitly endorsed hardliners seeking to tighten their grip on parliament by urging voters on Wednesday to shun candidates backed by Western “ enemies ” in Friday ’s election .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari ( R ) welcomes Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a military parade in the city of Yazd , about 560 km ( 350 miles ) south - east of Tehran January 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Iran Student News Agency / Handout
“ Whoever is favored by our enemies to be in the ruling and legislative bodies of our country should not be sent there because he would act as the enemies want , ” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech broadcast on state television .
It was the clearest statement yet by Khamenei , Iran ’s highest authority , on the March 14 vote to the 290 - seat legislature which conservatives are confident of winning after many leading reformists were barred from running .
And his comments were likely to please President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has stonewalled the United States and its Western allies with hardline rhetoric over Iran ’s nuclear program .
Friday ’s vote is a popularity test for Ahmadinejad , who is expected to seek re-election in 2009 despite being criticized at home for his foreign and economic policies .
“ Whoever Iran ’s enemy does not want ... in parliament should be there because he would serve Iran ’s interests , ” Khamenei said .
He did not name reform - minded groups seeking political and social change , who conservatives portray as Western lackeys bidding to undermine the Islamic state .
Reformist leaders reject these allegations but say the odds of winning seats are heavily stacked against them after their leading candidates were banned in a pre-vote vetting process .
Ties between Washington and Tehran were cut shortly after Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution , in which the U.S. - backed shah was ousted .
The two states are now embroiled in a deepening standoff over the Islamic Republic ’s disputed nuclear ambitions .
“ What the Americans want contradicts the interests of Iran , ” Khamenei said .
WESTERN “ PUPPETS ”
Even though conservative factions are expected to retain their dominance of parliament , they include long - time rivals of Ahmadinejad and others who have deserted him over his handling of the $ 280 billion economy .
He has been blamed for stoking inflation by profligate spending of windfall oil revenues .
Critics also accuse him of isolating Iran with his hardline rhetoric against Western powers which suspect that Iran’s
nuclear program is aimed at building bombs .
Tehran says it is aimed at generating electricity .
Khamenei tends to stay above the fray of day - to - day politics but has nonetheless called Ahmadinejad ’s government the most popular in 100 years and has praised his handling of the nuclear standoff with the West .
Khamenei said that those candidates who had not “ drawn clear lines between themselves and the enemies and their puppets ” were not the best people for office .
He called for a high turnout in Friday ’s vote which he said was counter to what Iran ’s foes wanted .
