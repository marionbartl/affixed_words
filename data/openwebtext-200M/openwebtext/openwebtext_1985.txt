One of the most important swing states in America still cant safeguard the vote .
So says a new report , commissioned by Ohios top elections official , that found all five voting systems used in the Buckeye State to have critical flaws  that could undermine the integrity of the 2008 general election .
 It was worse than I anticipated ,  Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said of the investigation .
 I had hoped that perhaps one system would test superior to the others . 
The $ 1.9 million federally financed study , conducted by corporate and academic teams in parallel assessments and released Friday , found that voting machines and central servers made by Elections Systems and Software ; Premier Election Solutions , formerly Diebold ; and Hart InterCivic ; were easily corrupted .
According to the New York Times , at polling stations , teams working on the study were able to pick locks to access memory cards and use hand - held devices to plug false vote counts into machines .
At boards of election , they were able to introduce malignant software into servers .
Ken Fields , a spokesman for Election Systems and Software , said his company vehemently opposed some of the reports conclusions .
 We can also tell you that our 35 years in the field of elections has demonstrated that Election Systems and Software voting technology is accurate , reliable and secure ,  he said .
Brunner -- a Democrat who succeeded controversial Republican and Bush - backer J. Kenneth Blackwell -- ordered the study as part of a promise to revamp voting after the state made headlines for hours - long lines in the 2000 and 2004 elections .
Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland , also was home to a scandal that led to the convictions of two elections workers on charges of rigging recounts .
The Times reports that Brunner proposed replacing all of the states voting machines , including the touch - screen ones used in more than 50 of Ohios 88 counties .
She also wants all counties to employ optical scan machines that electronically record paper ballots that voters fill in by hand .
In addition to switching machines , Ms. Brunner recommended purging polling stations that are used for fewer than five precincts and introducing an early voting period 15 days before Election Day .

Microbes Churn Out Hydrogen at Record Rate
In new table - top reactor , bacteria from wastewater produce abundant , clean hydrogen from cellulose , or even vinegar , and a little electricity
In a microbial electrolysis cell , bacteria break up fermented plant waste to form hydrogen
November 12 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
By adding a few modifications to their successful wastewater fuel cell , researchers have coaxed common bacteria to produce hydrogen in a new , efficient way .
Bruce Logan and colleagues at Penn State University had already shown success at using microbes to produce electricity .
Now , using starter material that could theoretically be sourced from a salad bar , the researchers have coaxed those same microbes to generate hydrogen .
By tweaking their design , improving conditions for the bacteria , and adding a small jolt of electricity , they increased the hydrogen yield to a new record for this type of system .
" We achieved the highest hydrogen yields ever obtained with this approach from different sources of organic matter , such as yields of 91 percent using vinegar ( acetic acid ) and 68 percent using cellulose , " said Logan .
In certain configurations , nearly all of the hydrogen contained in the molecules of source material converted to useable hydrogen gas , an efficiency that could eventually open the door to bacterial hydrogen production on a larger scale .
Logan and lead author Shaoan Cheng announced their results in the Nov. 12 , 2007 , online version of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Bruce Logan is a clear leader in this area of research on sustainable energy , " said Bruce Hamilton , NSF director of the environmental sustainability program at NSF and the officer overseeing Logan 's research grant .
" Advances in sustainable energy capabilities are of paramount importance to our nation 's security and economic well - being .
We have been supporting his cutting - edge research on microbial fuel cells for a number of years and it is wonderful to see the outstanding results that he continues to produce . "
Other systems produce hydrogen on a larger scale , but few if any match the new system for energy efficiency .
Even with the small amount of electricity applied , the hydrogen ultimately provides more energy as a fuel than the electricity needed to drive the reactor .
Incorporating all energy inputs and outputs , the overall efficiency of the vinegar - fueled system is better than 80 percent , far better than the efficiency for generation of the leading alternative fuel , ethanol .
Even most electrolysis techniques , methods to extract hydrogen from water using electricity , pale in comparison to the new method .
" We can do that by using the bacteria to efficiently extract energy from the organic matter , " said Logan .
By perfecting the environment for the bacteria to do what they already do in nature , the new approach can be three to ten times more efficient than standard electrolysis .
Additional information about the new technology and how it works can be found in the Penn State press release at http://www.psu.edu/ur/2007/biohydrogen.htm.
The work of Logan and his colleagues has been featured in two prior NSF press releases :

Fox News pushes claim Media Matters is ' criminal enterprise '
On the Sept. 28 broadcast of his radio show , host Mark Levin concluded that Media Matters is a " criminal enterprise . "
Fox News -- on air -- went beyond reporting Levin 's remarks by inviting guests to debate the legality of the media watchdog group .
" I believe every time they file a tax return telling the government that ' we 're non-political , non-partisan , '... I believe that they 're committing perjury , " Levin said during excerpts of his show rebroadcast by Fox .
" If there was ever a lawsuit against this group , " he continued , " and there was full discovery of emails and phone logs and testimony under oath or in depositions , the whole game would be up and they'd be completely exposed for what they are -- which is a criminal enterprise . "
Democratic strategist Regina Calcaterra , who appeared on the Fox and Friends program to defend Media Matters , said Levin , who is a lawyer , should be " concerned about making frivolous allegations that can lead to malpractice sanctions . "
" If Media Matters is educational and it is not lobbying or is not endorsing a candidate , it is legally permissible .
Just like the Heritage Foundation , " she continued , referencing a prominent conservative think tank that is also non-profit .
" Liberals have used unions in the past , and now they 're using tax payers to pay for their propaganda , " countered Fox News analyst Angela McGlowan , who added that " the Heritage Foundation comes out with policy papers .
What does Media Matters come out with ?
Lies . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on October 2 .
THEY almost did n't make it , but in the last hour Ehud Olmert , the Israeli prime minister , and Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , agreed on a joint statement .
Four months of preliminary talks had failed to produce what Mr Abbas and Condoleezza Rice , the American secretary of state , had hoped to brandish at this week 's peace summit in Annapolis : an agreement to predetermine some aspects of the final - status deal that would ultimately create a Palestinian state next to Israel .
In the end , Ms Rice had to settle for less , but the Palestinians and Israelis did agree two things .
Final - status talks will begin on December 12th .
And the United States will monitor both sides ' compliance in the meantime with the “ road map ” peace plan of 2003 , under which Israel is meant to freeze settlement - building in the West Bank while the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) takes action against militants who attack Israel .
Both these agreements still lack some important detail , however .
While teams of negotiators will work continuously to hammer out all the issues of a peace deal — the borders of the Palestinian state , the division of Jerusalem , the fate of 4.5 m
Palestinian refugees abroad , the sharing of water resources , and so on — nobody has specified whether the starting point will be a blank slate or a previous near - deal such as the informal 2001 Taba agreement negotiated in Egypt .
That could make a big difference to how fast things progress .
So too could the fact that there will be no American go - between for them .
Likewise , the United States has agreed to supervise both sides ' compliance with the road map ; a potential win for the Palestinians since in the past Israel has been the de facto arbiter of performance .
But it is unclear how , and how strictly , America will actually do this .
So far , it has only appointed a general , James Jones , as a security envoy to the PA .
Much clearer is that Israel will not make his job easy .
An Israeli official says that any impression that Mr Olmert plans a total construction freeze , as the road map stipulates , is a “ convenient misperception ” .
A more telling measure of Mr Olmert 's intentions may be how vigorously he goes after the 100 - plus “ unauthorised ” outposts established by hardline settlers , of which the road map requires him to dismantle around 60 .
Previous attempts to take even one down have led to violent clashes between the police and settlers , who are regrouping for a showdown after losing their fight to stay in the Gaza Strip in 2005 .
As for the Palestinians , the American arbitrator will find himself squeezed between the Israeli reading of the road map — that the PA must entirely dismantle terrorist groups before any final - status deal that the two sides reach can go into effect — and the Palestinian one , which is that it need only get the task well under way .
The two sides hope to conclude the final - status deal itself within a year .
But given the complexity of the issues and the fragile politics on each side , this looks over - ambitious to some .
Mr Olmert will have to keep conceding enough to keep the peace process going , but not so much that it prompts right - wing parties to leave his coalition .
They have already started throwing out banana skins , such as a parliamentary bill earlier this month that would make it much harder for Israel to give up any of Jerusalem to the PA .
Mr Abbas , for his part , having got much less out of Annapolis than he originally insisted on , is vulnerable to the jibes of Islamist opponents .
His security forces have been cracking down with unusual harshness on anti-Annapolis demonstrations in the West Bank this week , something that could cost him precious legitimacy .
A coalition of the fearful
For a conference so thin on content , though , Annapolis was surprisingly thickly attended .
Few expected Saudi Arabia to send its foreign minister , but there he was , along with 40 leaders , many from Islamic states without diplomatic ties with Israel .
To what extent this is a victory for President George Bush , though , is also not yet clear .
One reason the Arabs showed up , as American officials argue , is because they may share Mr Bush 's desire to create a united , mostly Sunni front against mostly Shia extremists led by Iran .
Syria 's decision to send its deputy foreign minister — less than a full negotiator , but more than just a token presence — in return for a merely token discussion at Annapolis about Syrian - Israeli peace may have signalled that Syria , too , is worried about ending up on the wrong side of the barricades .
The show of solidarity certainly produced some alarmed noises from Tehran and fist waving from its Islamist allies , Lebanon 's Hizbullah and the Palestinians ' Hamas .
Yet the Saudis and others may also have come because they felt they had no choice .
It would have been too easy for America to paint them as the cause of Annapolis 's failure .
With Lebanon fearing more civil conflict as it tries to break a deadlock over the election of a president , Syria 's role is crucial ; some , indeed , think its invitation to Annapolis is what has prevented Lebanon from exploding already .
But Mr Bush offered Syria no concessions , instead giving it a clear rebuke in his speech with a reference to Lebanon 's need for an election “ free from outside interference and intimidation ” ( see article ) .
The question now is whether America can convert the show of support it got at Annapolis into anything more substantial .
That is the message I got after reading Larry Swedroe ’s “ Wise Investing Made Simple ” .
I totally agree with this assessment .
You are not supposed to have fun with a serious thing like investing for your future goals .
Also , trying to beat the market is a really futile .
All you need to do is have a well diversified portfolio of index funds and leave it .

In a series of stories that are clear and simple yet profound in their meaning , Larry explains how the financial markets really work and how any investor who comes to understand this will be able to make more informed and better investment decisions , no matter how intelligent he / she is .
As the title suggests , Larry takes complicated concepts , and breaks them down into simple to follow stories .
He uses scenarios relating to sports strategies and other ordinary life examples to relate the reader to the given financial concept he is explaining .
One of my favorites stories was about how bets are placed on sporting events ( points , spread , etc. ) and how that compares to many of the market transactions .
He weaves thru all these concepts with humor as he endeavors to welcome the reader to what he calls “ the winning game . ”
New and experienced investors will enjoy and learn from this book .
If you want more depth in any given area , read one of his other books that will tell you more in detail about the broad concepts he presents here .
Also , since this book is written for US readers , Canadians need only make a few minor adjustments to limit foreign exchange exposure and include additional domestic asset classes to end up with comparable portfolios that he recommends .
I would strongly recommend reading this book , if you feel that you are smart enough to beat the stock market by choosing the right stocks at the right time .
" The manner in which the Americans relate to the intelligence report on Iran is similar to the way in which they viewed those reports they received during the Holocaust on railways transporting hundreds of thousands of Jews to their death at Auschwitz , " Minister Yitzhak Cohen of Shas said during a security cabinet meeting Sunday morning on the Iranian nuclear issue .
" It can not be that ( US President George W. )
Bush is committed to peace as was declared at Annapolis , and then the Americans propagate such an intelligence report which contradicts the information we have proving Iran intends to obtain nuclear weapons , " Cohen said .
" How can we rely on the Americans if they publish this report that emasculates what the world explicitly knows regarding Iran , and renders impotent the entire struggle against the Iranians ? "
Minister Cohen asserted that the report must have been " ordered by someone who wants dialogue with Tehran " and formulated an historical analogy to express just how serious the situation is :
" In the middle of the previous century the Americans received intelligence reports from Auschwitz on the packed trains going to the extermination camps .
They claimed then that the railways were industrial .
Their attitude today to the information coming out of Iran on the Iranians ' intention to produce a nuclear bomb reminds one of their attitude during the holocaust . "
Cabinet Member Cohen had this to say to his fellow ministers not present in the meeting : " Whoever thinks that the president of Iran is a lover of Zion , with Kosher certification from the Americans , misleads and is mislead .
He is not a lover of Zion , but instead an aspiring strangler of Zion .
Someone in America fell asleep on his watch , but we must remain awake and aware . "
' Pressure on Iran must continue '
Neither Cohen nor the Shas party would confirm nor deny the remarks the minister made in the meeting .
Earlier a senior security source told Ynet that " Iran will do all in its power to proceed on the path ( to a nuclear weapon ) , while trying to confuse the western world . "
In the meeting , policy makers attempted to formulate the Israeli response to the American National Intelligence Estimate , published last week , which asserted that Iran suspended its activities for acquiring nuclear weapons in 2003 .
British Response Report : UK spy chiefs believe Iran ' deceived ' CIA over nuclear program Sunday Telegraph report says British intelligence has serious doubts that Tehran has shelved nuclear weapons program .
' Iranian nuclear staff , knowing their phones were tapped , deliberately gave misinformation ; they will say anything to throw us off , ' UK official quoted as saying Report : UK spy chiefs believe Iran ' deceived ' CIA over nuclear program
The uniform stance of most cabinet members is that Israel must neutralize the effects of the American intelligence report .
According to senior ministers , Israel has information proving that Iran did not cease in its efforts to obtain a nuclear bomb , and is only acting in secret .
Nevertheless , none of the three top ministers , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , or Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni seeks to create a confrontation with the American administration .
A senior security official who has seen the materials Israel possesses claims that there is enough incriminating information regarding Iran 's intentions .
" Even if the world lacks clear evidence , the ( Iranian ) agenda is clear .
We have no doubt that it is ( President Mahmoud ) Ahmadinejad and the Ayatollahs who are directing the program .
Israel has gathered enough information to obligate the international community to continue with its intensive activity against creating a bomb , " he said .
Yishai : Delaying the inevitable
Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai , also of Shas , said before the cabinet meeting : " International pressure on Iran must continue .
We know the truth , as does the rest of the world .
We must not play dumb in the face of the report 's supposed findings .
This report is mistaken and is only trying to delay the inevitable .
It has only intensified the danger .
Do n't say this is more of the usual , because we are thus likely to fall asleep and wake up with a nuclear Iran . "
Minister Yishai warned that " these attempts at postponement endanger us and the world at large . "
According to the minister , this is not the right time to address the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities , but that " we must act on all levels to eliminate the Iranian danger . "
Over the weekend NATO foreign ministers met and decided to continue applying pressure on Iran after European Union leaders expressed the identical opinion in a meeting last week with American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Foreign Minister Livni , who met with Rice in Brussels during the NATO convention , welcomed the unified front , but instructed Israeli ambassadors and representatives throughout the world to expand the diplomatic struggle to impose additional sanctions on Iran .
The Foreign Ministry , it seems , fears Moscow and Beijing will use the NIE 's findings as an excuse to veto any such sanctions on Iran in the Security Council , which is set to begin conducting on the issue Monday .
The UN nuclear watchdog chief said on Thursday Iran was clarifying atomic development efforts on schedule , countering Western doubts , but Tehran must step up cooperation to resolve remaining questions this year .
Mohamed ElBaradei summarised findings of an International Atomic Energy Agency report on Iran at a debate of the IAEA 's governing board , where differences simmered over whether Iran 's improved transparency is cause for hope or further scepticism .
The West fears Iran is secretly trying to build atom bombs .
Iran says it only wants electricity from uranium enrichment .
Western states on the 35 - nation board were expected to dwell on Iran 's defiant campaign to enrich uranium despite agreeing to a plan for transparency .
Developing nations were likely to highlight Iranian steps towards openness and warn against rising Western pressure they feel could lead to dangerous conflict .
ElBaradei , believed to be concerned by US - led criticism of the transparency plan 's limitations and resolve to isolate Iran with harsher sanctions , said the plan was on track  after some Western powers suggested Iran was dragging its heels .
" It is proceeding according to schedule ...
There has been good progress , " he said , in getting Iran to own up after years of stonewalling about secret 1980s and '90s efforts to acquire centrifuge enrichment technology from nuclear smugglers .
" Our progress over the past two months has been made possible by an increased level of Iranian cooperation .
However , I would urge Iran to be more proactive in providing information and accelerating the pace of cooperation so the agency will be able to clarify all major remaining outstanding issues by the end of the year , " he said .
That call reflected the fact that the next issues to resolve will be more difficult due to possible military dimensions .

Joe Armstrong had fault tolerance in mind when he designed and implemented the Erlang programming language in 1986 , and he was subsequently the chief software architect of the project which produced Erlang / OTP , a development environment for building distributed real - time high - availability systems .
More recently Joe wrote Programming Erlang : Software for a Concurrent World .
He currently works for Ericsson AB where he uses Erlang to build highly fault - tolerant switching systems .
DDJ : Joe , what 's unique about Erlang as a language ?
Why do we need a language like it ?
JA : Erlang is a concurrent functional programming language .
Basically there are two models of concurrency :
Shared state concurrency
Message passing concurrency
Virtually all language use shared state concurrency .
This is very difficult and leads to terrible problems when you handle failure and scale up the system .
Erlang uses pure message passing concurrency .
Very few languages do this .
Making things scalable and fault - tolerant is relatively easy .
Erlang is built on the ideas of :
Share nothing .
( Process can not share data in any way .
Actually , this is not 100 % true ; there are some small exceptions . )
Pure message passing .
( Copy all data you need in the messages , no dangling pointers . )
Crash detection and recovery .
( Things will crash , so the best thing to do is let them crash and recover afterwards . )
Erlang processes are very lightweight ( lighter than threads ) and the Erlang system supports hundreds of thousands of processes .
It was designed to build highly fault - tolerant systems .
Ericsson has managed to achieve nine 9's reliability [ 99.9999999 % ] using Erlang in a product called the AXD301 .
[ Editor 's Note : According to Philip Wadler , the AXD301 has 1.7 million lines of Erlang , making it the largest functional program ever written . ]
DDJ : So are programmers really using Erlang in the real world , or is it solely of academic interest ?
JA : Absolutely .
Commercial use is far greater than academic .
It was developed at the Ericsson Computer Science Lab for building fault - tolerant systems .
It 's used by Ericsson in a number of products .
Outside of Ericsson , Erlang is used by a number of start - ups for building high - performance servers .
Most notably ejabberd which is a jabber server .
This is probably the best featured and fastest free jabber server on the market , it 's being used as a back - end in a lot of products .
Some pretty fast - moving startups in the financial world have latched onto Erlang ; for example , the Swedish www.kreditor.se.
Erlang gives them a great commercial advantage over their competitors .
DDJ : It seems that , what with multi-core processors and the like , we 're rapidly approaching the day of commodity parallelization .
When you designed Erlang in the 1980s , did you ever expect parallel systems would be a commodity , or did you see it as primarily a language for high - performance computing only ?
JA : It was never a language for high - performance computing .
It was a language for building fault - tolerant distributed systems .
Ericsson has always used parallel hardware in its switching products -- right from the AXE in the mid 1970s .
There is a " school " of parallel programming inside Ericsson .
Erlang is the third language in a progression of languages : PLEX -> Eri-Pascal -> Erlang .
The Erlang philosophy was always to build system with lots of cheap processors and allow them to fail .
We do n't prevent failure ; we live with it and recover when failures occur .
That 's what Erlang was designed to do .
That 's why there is " no shared state " .
Shared state and failure are ill - suited bed - fellows .
Today multi-cores are really like " distributed system on a chip " with very high - speed message passing .
Since we have share - nothing and concurrency , Erlang programs map beautifully onto multi-cores .
Ericsson is shipping products on dual - cores that run virtually twice as fast as the uni-cores with only tiny changes to the code .
DDJ : In addition to your book Programming Erlang , can you point readers to websites where they can find out more about this most interesting programming language ?
JA : Yes , there is the Open Source Erlang site at www.erlang.org which , among other things , includes the full source code of the current Erlang system .
Then there is the Erlang community site at www.trapexit.org.
Other top executives include Heidi Miller , the chief executive of treasury and security services at JPMorgan Chase ; Amy Woods Brinkley , the chief risk officer at Bank of America ; and Erin Callan , chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers .
But with Ms. Cruz no longer a candidate to run Morgan Stanley , the top executive ranks at the big Wall Street firms remain largely devoid of women seen with a viable chance of becoming chief executive anytime soon .
Women have also not been considered for recently created openings at Citigroup and Merrill Lynch .
Firing a top executive is never a pleasurable experience , as any chief executive will say .
But in the case of Mr. Mack , who for Ms. Cruz has been a mentor , champion as well as her most stubborn defender against her many enemies , the decision to force her retirement was undoubtedly wrenching .
On Thursday night , just hours after the news of Ms. Cruz ’s departure had become public , he presided over a cocktail party for former Morgan Stanley executives now in the hedge fund industry at the Asia Society .
“ It ’s been a rough day , ” he said to the audience , according to a person who was there .
In 1982 , Mr. Mack was a rising star in the firm ’s fixed income business — at the time a relative backwater for Morgan Stanley compared with its blue - chip underwriting and advisory business .
And while women investment bankers could occasionally be found , women traders were a rarity .
With her brash personality , Ms. Cruz took quickly to the rough and tumble culture of Morgan ’s trading business — soon securing the nickname Cruz missile .
She carved out a niche as foreign exchange trader with an expertise in derivatives and in 1993 , Mr. Mack , who had become president of the firm , made her co-head of the firm ’s foreign exchange business and one of the top women executives at the firm .
In 2000 , Mr. Mack promoted her again to a more substantial post — running the bank ’s fixed income business , one of the biggest profit generators at Morgan Stanley .
While Ms. Cruz had done well as a foreign exchange trader , running fixed income was a larger challenge and Mr. Mack ’s elevation of her over male candidates raised eyebrows , according to executives who worked with her at the time .
Last Thursday
I participated in a panel at the Future in Review ( FiRE ) conference in San Diego , Calif .
Very cool – I got to meet one of my heroes : iRobot founder Helen Greiner .
( My own Master ’s thesis at the University of Illinois was in robotics . )
Helen took a ride in the Tesla Roadster and came away with a big smile .
But fun as it was , I decided to cut out early and hustle across town to testify at the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) hearings on the future of the Zero Emissions Vehicle ( ZEV ) mandate .
Members of the public ( including execs from all the big car companies as well as individuals with relevant opinions ) were each given strictly - enforced 3 - minute slots for testimony .
The whole hearing was " Back to the Future , " with both CARB and all the large car companies once again urging continued research into hydrogen fuel cells , but with the dates moved further out and the number of required fuel cell cars on the road reduced by an order of magnitude .
Hey , forget fuel cells , how about researching a Mister Fusion instead ?
The most amusing testimony for me was from Ballard Power Systems .
Unlike the car companies , the Ballard spokesman urged CARB to increase the number of fuel cell cars required , transparently increasing the demand for their own fuel cells …
Also entertaining was when both a CARB board member and the BMW spokesman recommended changing the definition of a large - volume car manufacturer so that BMW would not be forced into a fuel cell program as their California sales surpass 60,000 cars .
They were followed by the Honda spokesman who specifically requested that BMW be required to join the fuel cell brotherhood .
I did not originally plan to be at the hearing because of the FiRE conference .
I wrote my testimony at the last minute on the back of a copy of Chris Paine ’s prepared testimony , with overflow on the back of Alec Brook ’s testimony .
It ’s always risky to use sarcasm in public speaking , but I could not resist .
Here is what I said in my 3 minutes :
Good afternoon , Members of the Board .
I am Martin Eberhard , cofounder and CEO of Tesla Motors , based here in California .
Tesla Motors will begin shipping highly - desirable , DOT - compliant electrical cars with well over 200 miles range later this year – perhaps you saw one of our prototypes outside .
We have already pre-sold more than 400 cars ; 2008 production will easily exceed 1,000 cars , exceeding the worldwide fleet of fuel cell cars .
Additionally , we will deliver Tesla - built battery systems for the newly revived TH!INK City Car this year , with a standing order for many thousand batteries per year .
The Air Resources Board continues to show a bias toward hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and against the less expensive and more efficient battery electric vehicles .
This bias is clearly seen in the ARB Independent Expert Panel Report .
Tesla
Motors believes this bias is not justified by science or the evidence of actual vehicles and infrastructure .
However , we are actually delighted by the way this bias finds implementation in the ZEV mandate .
For the results of this mandate is that all of our potential EV competitors – all the big car companies – remain mired in non-productive , deeply - expensive fuel cell programs , keeping them out of the EV marketplace , and indeed out of the serious ZEV marketplace entirely .
Every year spent on fuel cell programs by GM , Ford , Honda , and the rest is another year we at Tesla Motors can build our technological and market lead in the obvious winning technology : battery electric vehicles .
We therefore sarcastically and enthusiastically encourage you to maintain the hydrogen bias and keep our competitors in the quagmire .
Meanwhile , we are on schedule to place 15,000 battery electric Tesla vehicles on the road by the end of 2010 .
Sarcasm aside , would n’t it be nice for our environment if we had a few competitors ?
Everybody ’s got a horror story about a bureaucratic nightmare , but if you can top this one , call me collect at your earliest convenience .
Ann Collard was seven months pregnant with her third child in June when an abatement notice came from the Glendale Fire Department .
She and her husband , Mike , were ordered to clear some foliage and maintain 5 feet of “ vertical clearance between roof surfaces and overhanging portions of trees . ”
The Collards knew their oaks and sycamores needed a trim .
And so they talked to neighbors , did a little research and called a recommended tree trimmer based in Orange County .
For $ 3,000 , the guy said , he ’d remove about 15 % of the foliage and they ’d be in the clear .

The Collards asked if a permit was necessary .
Not at all , said the licensed trimmer , who told the Collards he ’d done lots of work in Glendale .
On the third day of the three - day job , the city ’s urban forester happened to be in the neighborhood , and noticed the tree trimmer doing his thing .
“ She saw what was happening and said , ‘ Stop !
Cease and desist ! ’ ” says Mike , a work - at - home software and computer guy .

Glendale has an indigenous tree protection ordinance that dates to the 1980s .
It was enacted to discourage developers and homeowners from bulldozing or hacking trees willy - nilly .
Earlier this year , because of citizen complaints that native trees were still being ruined , the city approved more restrictions and bigger fines .
None of which the Collards knew about .
They now admit that had they read the Fire Department notice closely , they would have seen in small print that a free permit was required to trim oak and sycamore branches larger than 1 inch in diameter .
But it was an understandable oversight .
A week after her first visit , the urban forester was back , telling the Collards an arborist would come by soon to assess the damage .
The Collards recall being told they might want to hire an attorney .

“ That ’s when we realized the gravity of the situation , ” says Ann .
“ I was pregnant and crying , but it did n’t help . ”
In August , the Collards got a visit from the arborist .
She looked at the trees , took measurements and jotted down notes .
How bad could it be ?
The Collards began to anticipate the possibility of a fine , but it was n’t as if the trees were mauled .
They looked pretty good , in fact .
Finally , on Oct. 1 , a letter arrived .
It was from Glendale ’s Neighborhood Services administrator .
Advertisement
“ Dear Owner , ” it began .
“ The city of Glendale is committed to maintaining a community with quality streetscapes that include the care and well - being of protected indigenous trees . ”
The letter informed them they had improperly pruned 13 trees , some of them on city property because they were near the street , and some on their own property .
The fine was listed on Page 2 , where the Collards were informed they would be charged “ two times the value of the damaged tree (s ) . ”
“ Total : $ 347,600 . ”
“ I about passed out , ” says Ann .

She ’d been worried they might get fined as much as , say , $ 3,000 .
“ But this was n’t like ‘ Oh no , we wo n’t be able to go on that vacation we were planning , ’ ” she said .
Fortunately , the city did not ask for the Collards ’ newborn son as part of the settlement .
But the prospect of financial ruin had the former high school sweethearts wondering if they could serve jail time instead of taking out a second mortgage .
The Collards began dialing City Hall for help .
Advertisement
“ Is there somebody who could adjust the amount ? ”
Ann recalls asking , without ever getting an answer .
“ But even if they met us halfway , that ’s $ 170,000 .
We ca n’t pay that , either . ”
Ann points out that White House aide Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby was fined $ 250,000 for perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the case of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
She adds , with appropriate exasperation , that Glendale Memorial Hospital drew a $ 25,000 fine in October for a medical error in which “ a person was killed . ”
The Collard home is in a relatively high danger zone for wildfire , so I can understand why the Fire Department told them they needed to trim back flammable plants .
But if the city ’s going to go after anybody , they ’d be better off citing the Collards ’ next - door neighbor , whose branches are perilously close to the house .

“ It ’s ridiculous , ” said Frank Ramos , who lives across the street and ca n’t believe City Hall could leave the Collards hanging like this .
The yard looks good , he said .
It ’s not like the trees were butchered .
He said he ’d have done the same thing in their shoes .
“ They ’re a nice couple . ”
The Collards are $ 1,200 in to an attorney who got hold of the arborist ’s report , which alleged they ’d had up to 60 % of the foliage whacked on some trees .
The trimmer used spiked shoes , too .
A no-no .
The Collards are sorry they did n’t know about the required permit , but they dispute the 60 % allegation and have before - and - after pictures to argue their point .
The report also said some of the trees were worth as much as $ 100,000 .
I ’d like to go on the record as being in favor of trees , but if the Collards really have more than $ 1 million worth of trees , maybe they should declare their property a national forest and secede from Glendale entirely .
Advertisement
And how about that team of geniuses who bloodlessly produced a $ 347,600 fee notice and blithely stuck it in the mail without a single person saying , “ Hey , wait a minute .
Is n’t this insane ? ”
The Collards called City Hall repeatedly to see if someone might offer them an option other than robbing a bank .
When they got no satisfaction , they started a website , www.glendaletreefine.com, to lay out their case and call for revision of the tree - cutting ordinance .
Glendale residents quickly weighed in , slamming City Hall .
“ Absolutely ridiculous , ” wrote Stephen .
Advertisement
“ Two words - common sense ! ” wrote Jonathan .
The Collards soon found out they were n’t the only victims of excessive fines .
“ I was fined $ 175,000 for cutting two sycamores after my architect contacted the city and was warned not to touch oak trees , ” says John Oppenheim , a registered nurse and single dad .
“ I am not a criminal , though because of a string of bad advice , I did make a mistake . ”
Only after the tree fine story got some attention did city officials step up .
City Councilman John Drayman told me the Collards should n’t have to pay a nickel .
Councilman Frank Quintero called the whole thing a fiasco and an embarrassment .
Advertisement
When I got hold of Mayor Ara Najarian , he said I was the first to learn that City Atty .
Scott Howard had decided to drop the case against the Collards .
So they ’re completely off the hook ?
For now , Najarian said .
But they ’ll be called in for a conference at some point .
And might they still be fined ?
Advertisement
Possibly , he said , but nowhere near $ 347,600 .
How much , then ?
Maybe $ 10,000 , maybe less , Najarian said .
And maybe the tree trimmer should get stuck with the bulk of the fine .
Yeah , and maybe the city should apologize to the Collards , pay their lawyer fees , and clear the deadwood out of City Hall .

Cheney and Lieberman wo n't be happy .
NY Times :
A new assessment by American intelligence agencies concludes that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains on hold , contradicting an assessment two years ago that Tehran was working inexorably toward building a bomb .
The assessment , a National Intelligence Estimate that represents the consensus view of all 16 American spy agencies , states that Tehran ’s ultimate intentions about gaining a nuclear weapon remain unclear , but that Iran ’s “ decisions are guided by a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic and military costs .
Instead , the N.I.E. concludes it is more likely Iran could have a bomb by the early part to the middle of the next decade .
The report states that the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research judges Iran is unlikely to achieve this goal before 2013 , “ because of foreseeable technical and programmatic problems . ” ... read on
Matt Yglesias predicts what the reaction will be to it :
The only appropriate response to this is to do what we 've done already with IAEA information on Iran , with IAEA information on Iraq , and with Intelligence and Research Bureau information on Iran : ignore it .
Islamofascism is on the march .
Deniers and appears must be ignored .
Here 's the declassified portions of the New Iran NIE about how the Iranian nuclear hype is mostly hype .
I 'd assume William " the bloody " Kristol is in meetings all day --- red veins popping out of his neck and yelling at the White House for letting this report see the light of day .
“ Peaking ” is commonly observed for oil production in many regions of the world ( e.g. Laherrere 2005 ) .
According to Hubbert ( Hubbert 1956 ) the production curve of crude oil and of other minerals is “ bell shaped ” and approximately symmetric ; that is the peak occurs when approximately half of the extractable resources have been extracted .
From the regional data , it is a logic step to extrapolate to worldwide production and arrive to the conclusion that a global peak ( “ peak oil ” ) will be reached .
In most cases , the analyses based on the Hubbert model say that peak oil could occur within a few years from now .
Since crude oil is the single major source of primary energy in the world , it is widely believed that the consequences of peaking could be important , or even disastrous .
However , there is a problem with the idea that we are close to a worldwide oil peaking : no major energy resource ( oil , gas , and coal ) has peaked globally so far .
So , how can we know that the global case is comparable to the regional cases we know ?
One way to answer this question is to look at the economic and geologic mechanisms that produce peaking .
The Hubbert model has been analyzed in several studies ( Naill , 1972 , Reynolds 1999 , Bardi 2005 , Holland 2007 ) .
In all these models , peaking and decline is the result of the gradual increase of the cost of production of the resource ; in turn due to depletion .
These costs can be seen in monetary terms , but can be measured in energy units as well .
In the case of oil , this increasing cost is related to factors such as the lower success rate with oil prospecting , the necessity of exploiting smaller fields , and the higher costs of processing lower quality oil .
These costs will gradually reduce profits and , therefore , reduce the willingness of operators to invest in further extraction .
That will slow down the growth and , eventually , cause the peak and the successive decline .
This analysis is independent on the kind of resource considered and on the global / regional conditions of extraction .
However , this interpretation is far from being accepted by everybody .
Some say that many regional cases of peaking are not due to progressive depletion but to political or market factors or both ( see , for instance , Engdhal , 2007 for a recent restatement of this idea ) .
Hubbert ’s model is also criticized because it does n’t take into account prices .
In the global case , it is said , increasing market prices will keep profits coming and , therefore , operators will continue investing on increasing the extraction rate ; if not forever at least well beyond the midpoint .
This interpretation goes back to the 1930s , ( Zimmermann 1933 ) with the so called “ functional model ” of minerals extraction that had a considerable success in the later economic literature ( e.g. Nordhaus 1992 , Simon 1995 , Adelman 2004 ) .
Recent model studies that take prices into account ( Holland 2006 ) indicate that peaking should occur anyway , but the idea that increasing prices will invalidate the Hubbert model lingers around .
Some studies , indeed , assume that oil production will never peak worldwide but , rather , reach a longlasting plateu ( CERA 2006 ) .
Theories come and go , but one thing is certain : even the most elegant theory needs to be supported by facts .
If we can find historical examples of global resources that have peaked and declined following a bell shaped curve , that will strongly support the idea the Hubbert theory holds for global production .
Up to last year , there was only one example of such a case reported in the literature : that of whaling in 19th century ( Bardi 2006 ) .
Whales are not a mineral resource , but the whale stock behaved as a non renewable resource as whales were “ extracted ” ( hunted ) at a rate much faster than their reproductive rate .
Recently , Dery and Anderson ( 2007 ) have shown that the global production of at least one mineral resource , phosphate rock , has peaked in the 1980s .
Just two cases may not be enough to prove the general validity of the Hubbert model but , here , we can report that there are many more cases of global peaking for minerals production .
After an exhaustive examination of the USGS database of the world mineral production ( Kelly 2006 ) we found at least 11 cases of minerals that show a global “ bell shaped ” curve with a clear peak .
Peaking was evident by visual examination and it was confirmed by fitting the data using a bell shaped function .
We used both gaussian and logistic derivative functions , finding very similar results .
Both kinds of curves can be used to fit the Hubbert curve as shown by Bardi ( 2005 ) and by Staniford ( 2006 ) .
In addition , we found several more cases of minerals that may have recently peaked or be near peaking , although that is not completely certain yet .
The USGS data were not just examined for the presence of production peaks , but also analyzed in terms of the amount of mineral extracted so far and extrapolated into the future .
In its basic form , the Hubbert model states that the production curve is symmetric , that is the production peak occurs when approximately half of the extractable resource has been extracted .
The concept of “ extractable resource ” is ultimately defined by the area under the extraction curve at the end of the cycle ; it is extractable what is actually extracted .
However , in the initial phases of the extraction cycle , it is possible to estimate this quantity as the “ ultimate recoverable resources ” ( URR ) .
According to BP ( 2007 ) in the case of crude oil , the URR is defined as “ an estimate of the total amount of oil that will ever be recovered and produced .
It is a subjective estimate in the face of only partial information . ”
This estimate is even more subjective in the case of minerals other than oil for several reasons .
One is that the knowledge of the world resources may be much more uncertain than in the case of oil .
Another difficulty may be the lack of reliable historical data .
Finally , minerals , unlike oil or gas , often appear as “ graded ” resources , that is as deposits of different concentration .
So , it is difficult to determine a cutoff point of what exactly is extractable and what is not .
Nevertheless , the USGS database reports values for the “ reserves ” of each mineral considered .
The concept of “ reserves ” is defined by the USGS ( 2007 ) as “ That part of the reserve base which could be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination .
The term reserves need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative . ”
Conversely , about the “ reserve base ” the USGS says that “ The reserve base includes those resources that are currently economic ( reserves ) , marginally economic ( marginal reserves ) , and some of those that are currently subeconomic ( subeconomic resources ) . ”
Obviously , the reserve base is much larger than the reserves in the USGS estimations .
From these data , the URR for each mineral resource can be estimated as the cumulative production up to now plus the remaining extractable amount .
The latter can be taken as equal to the reserves or to the reserve base .
We tried both possibilities and we found that in all cases the area under the extrapolated bell shaped curve is in much closer to the amount obtained using the “ reserves ” rather than the reserve base , as we ’ll show in the following .
Note , anyway , that a discrepancy in this comparison does not , in itself , invalidate the Hubbert model : it may simply indicate that the estimations of reserves are approximate or wrong .
We examined 57 cases of mineral extraction from the USGS data .
Of these , we found 11 cases where a clear production peak can be detected .
These cases are listed in table 1 .
The table contains also the URR derived as the sum of the amount of the already extracted resource ( up to 2006 ) and the amount of the reserves listed in the USGS tables .
This value can be compared to the amount that the logistic or gaussian fitting of the curve provides .
Table 1
For 4 minerals ( Mercury , Lead , Cadmium and Selenium ) we find a good agreement of the URR determined from the logistic fitting with the URR determined from the USGS data ( cumulative production so far plus reserves ) .
For 5 minerals ( Tellurium , Phosphorus , Thallium , Zircon and Rhenium ) the URR obtained from fitting is still acceptably close to the USGS data , although smaller .
The URR derived from the USGS data are significantly higher only for Gallium and Potash .
This discrepancy can be due to the high uncertainty of the data for gallium , and for potash because of market reasons described in the USGS data sheet ( USGS 2006 ) .
If the “ reserve base ” is used for the estimation of the URR , for all these minerals the results are always much larger than those derived from the fitting of the experimental data .
We show now some examples of peaking .
We start with the earliest global peak that can be found in the USGS tables , that of mercury ( Fig. 1 ) .
Figure 1 , click to enlarge
Here , there is some dispersion in the data , but the fitting is reasonably good and there is no doubt that a global peaking has taken place in the mid 1960s .
The total amount of mercury mined from 1900 to the present date is approximately 540,000 tons .
According to the USGS data , the world reserves of mercury are reduced today to 46,000 tons which , added to the amount mined so far , provide a total amount of extractable mercury ( URR ) of approximately 590,000 tons .
Considering that some mercury mining took place before 1900 , this value is in very good agreement with the value obtained by the logistic fit ( 580,000 tons ) .
Another historical peaking is that of lead ( fig 2 ) , that peaked in 1986 .
Figure 2 , click to enlarge
The fitting is better than in the case of mercury and the data for the URR calculated from the fitting ( 330 million tons ) is in good agreement with the amount calcolated from the USGS data ( 290 million tons ) .
A more recent example of peaking is that of zirconium mineral concentrates , ( mainly zircon , ZrSiO4 ) , which is the main source of zirconium and zirconium oxide , two important materials , often used as components of high temperature resistant materials ( Fig. 3 ) .
Figure 3 , click to enlarge
There is no doubt that the initial nearly exponential growth of production started slowing down in the 1970s and that growth stopped in the 1990 to decline afterwards .
The fit of the data gives the date of the peak as 1994 .
According to the USGS data , the URR for this mineral should be about 670 million tons .
The fitting of the production curve produces a smaller value , around 390 million tons .
Note that the USGS reserves are reported in terms of tons of ZrO2 , whereas “ zirconium mineral concentrates ” are a mix of several minerals , mainly zircon ( ZrSiO4 ) and baddeleyte ( ZrO2 ) .
A further element of uncertainty , although only a minor one , is the lack of production data for the United States for some years in the USGS data .
Taking into account these uncertainties , the agreement can be considered acceptable as an order of magnitude .
Selenium , a metal important for the semiconductor industry , also peaked in 1994 according to a logistic fitting ( Fig. 4 ) .
Figure 4 , click to enlarge
The Selenium URR calculated from the value of the USGS reserves is in good agreement with the area of the fitting curve .
There is also the case of an even more recent peak ; that of gallium .
Gallium is another metal important for the semiconductor industry .
According to a logistic fit of the data , it peaked in the year 2000 ( Fig. 5 ) .
Figure 5 , click to enlarge
In this case , the area under the fitting curve is much smaller than that calculated from the USGS reserves data .
In this case , the uncertainty in the estimation of the reserves is very high , one reason being that Gallium is produced only as a byproduct of the extraction of other minerals .
In principle , the peaks that we have reported could be interpreted as due to factors other than depletion .
Economists tend to distinguish between demand and supply and the decline of production of minerals might be seen as the result of cheaper or safer substitutes entering the market , that is to a reduction of the demand .
It would be tempting to attribute the decline in production of mercury to this factor .
Mercury is a toxic metal which has been substituted with various other materials and devices and it is now slowly disappearing from the market .
But most of the legislation forbidding the use of mercury came much later than the mercury peak ( 1962 ) and , as we saw , mercury peaked almost exactly at the “ midpoint ” of the available reserves , as predicted by the standard Hubbert model .
A similar case , reduction in the demand , can be made for the peaking of lead , another poisonous metal .
But for many applications , for instance car batteries , no substitute has been found so far for lead .
Moreover , also in this case peaking took place almost exactly at midpoint of the estimated resources .
Perhaps the only case were the a decline of production can be attributed to market factors is that of potash ( K2O ) that peaked at a value of cumulative production considerably lower than midpoint and where market factors were indeed reported as the cause of the decline ( USGS 2006 ) .
In all the other cases shown in table 1 , there is no evident cause that could lead us to think that the decline in production can be attributed to a reduction in demand .
For instance , some of the materials listed are important for the semiconductor industry ( gallium , tellurium , selenium ) , others for the metallurgic industry ( zirconium , molybdenum ) , and others for agriculture ( phospate rock ) .
No obvious substitutes exist for these materials .
Therefore , the peaking and decline of the minerals that we have examined must be interpreted as due , at least in part , to factors related to a reduced supply , in turn related to depletion .
Other minerals examined in the USGS database show a clear slowdown of the rate of increase of production , but it is difficult to prove that a peak has occurred .
That depends strongly on the data for the last few years and the data reported by the USGS ( Kelly 2006 ) under the label “ Minerals yearbook ” arrive only up to 2004 .
The USGS reports another set of data under the label “ Mineral Commodities Summaries ” , which are updates for the last two years ; available at present up to 2006 .
Unfortunately , in some cases these sets of data are inconsistent with each other .
For instance , Vanadium world production appears to be peaking around 2002 from the “ minerals yearbook ” , but the data in the “ mineral commodities summary ” show a sudden jump in production in 2005 and 2006 that brings it well above the earlier peak .
The data for vanadium in the successive editions of the “ summary ” are not consistent with each other , for instance in 2007 the worldwide production for 2005 has been changed to 58,200 tons from the 40,200 tons listed in the tables of the year before .
The reasons for this correction are not explained but seem to be related to uncertainties in reporting from countries such as China .
Several minerals in addition to vanadium show similar sudden jumps in production that lead the production curve to abandon the tendency to peaking of a few years before .
One such case is that of iron ore ( Fig. 6 ) which shows a true “ hockey stick ” in the production data .
Figure 6 , click to enlarge
Here , it is difficult to say whether the rapid rise in the past few years is due to inconsistencies in reporting or to an actual increase of production that may be related to the quickly growing Chinese economy ( Pui Kwan Tse , 2005 ) .
Probably , both factors are playing a role and the sudden rise in production may be due to the fact that the Chinese economy is , at least in part , “ out of sync ” with the rest of the world .
In any case , we will be able to assess the situation for vanadium , iron ore , and other similar cases only after more data will be available and when their consistency will be assessed by the USGS .
Some minerals in the USGS database show a continuous growth in production that , visually , appears to be nearly exponential .
Gordon and coworkers ( Gordon 2006 ) have recently examined five metals that show this behavior : copper , zinc , tin , nickel and platinum .
They did n’t use the Hubbert model , but tried to extrapolate the demand for these metals in relation to the expected growth of the world ’s population .
They reported that “ no immediate concern ” exists for the availability of metal stocks , but that “ the virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern ‘‘ developed world ’ ’ quality of life for all Earth ’s peoples under contemporary technology .
Taking copper as an example , up to 2006 the experimental data can , indeed , be fitted using an exponential function , but a logistic function provides the same degree of fitting ( fig . 7 )
Figure 7 , click to enlarge
If we extrapolate the two models a few decades in the future we see the scenarios of Fig. 8 , with copper peaking around 2040 according to the logistic fitting .
Figure 9 , click to enlarge
The results of the fitting are in agreement with the USGS estimation of copper reserves .
This amount is about 0,5 - 1 Gtons , even less than the value that can be estimated from the logistic model ( 2 Gtons ) .
Our analysis is therefore in agreement with that of Gordon , but it provides a more detailed picture of what we may expect in the future .
Other metals showing an apparent exponential production growth up to now can be examined in this way .
The result is that most minerals should be peaking in the coming decades .
Obviously , all the considerations made so far depend on the assumption that the peaks shown in table 1 are ultimate global peaks .
It is a reasonable assumption , but also debatable , especially for those minerals which have peaked most recently .
Some minerals are highly sensitive to market cycles and show several peaks .
Gold is a case in point : the historical data show a peak in 2001 , but the peak may be just one of a series of peaks observed in the history of gold production .
Although the minerals reported in table 1 appear to be scarcely sensitive to these cycles , we can be absolutely certain of the “ ultimate ” peak only after the extraction ( or production ) cycle has been completed .
That , for the time being , is possible at the global level only in the case of whale oil ( Bardi 2006 ) and perhaps of mercury ( fig. 1 ) .
Nevertheless , the set of experimental data reported here and their analysis provide impressive evidence of the soundness of the Hubbert approach .
We see , therefore , that peaking and decline is a common feature of the worldwide production of most minerals , as the Hubbert model predicts .
We cannot exclude that the recent generalized rise in prices of all minerals will start a new wave of investments , but , so far , the predictions of the “ functional model ” do n’t seem to be fulfilled .
We need also to consider that the costs of extraction are not just monetary but involve energy costs as well .
This fact introduces a further factor that may hasten peaking and decline .
The energy involved in the extraction of a mineral commodity , say , copper , does not just depend on the energy needed to extract it from the ore and refine it .
It depends also on the energy needed for extracting oil ( or coal , or gas , or uranium ) and turning it into power and machinery useful for extracting copper .
Since fossil fuels are being depleted , more energy is needed for their production and the result is a further increase in the energy needed for the extraction of all minerals .
The whole world extractive system is connected in this way .
This connection may explain why the peaking of most mineral commodities appears to be clustered in a period that goes from the last decades of the 20th century to the first decades of the 21st century , the period when difficulties in the production of fossil fuels started to be felt worldwide .
This connection may also explain why several minerals are peaking for values of the cumulative extraction that are lower than what would be derived from the USGS estimation of the available reserves .
Unless new and inexpensive sources of energy become available , we may never able to exploit the abundant “ reserve base ” of most minerals , and not even the reserves as they are estimated today .
In the end , “ Peak oil ” seems to be just one of several cases of worldwide peaking and decline of a depletable resource .
The bell shaped curve is valid globally and for most minerals , not just for oil and for regional cases .
In a few years , it is likely that many more resources will be observed peaking and declining .

PRINCETON , New Jersey ( Reuters ) - Societies should not rely on market forces to protect the environment or provide quality health care for all citizens , a winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize for economics said on Monday .
Professor Eric Maskin , one of three American economists to receive the award , said that he “ to some extent ” takes issue with free - market orthodoxy championed by U.S President George W. Bush and some other western leaders .
“ The market does n’t work very well when it comes to public goods , ” said Maskin , a slight , soft - spoken 57 - year - old who lives in a house once occupied by Albert Einstein .
Maskin , together with Leonid Hurwicz of the University of Minnesota , and Roger Myerson of the University of Chicago , received the prize for their pioneering work on mechanism design theory which examines whether trading mechanisms are the best ways of allocating resources .
In its statement with the award , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the market ’s efficiency may be undermined because consumers are not perfectly informed , competition is not completely free , and “ privately desirable production and consumption may generate social costs and benefits . ”
“ Markets work well with goods that economists call private goods ” like cars or other consumer durables , Maskin said in his office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey .
“ If I buy a car , I use the car , you do n’t and the market for cars works pretty well .
But there are many other sorts of goods , often very important goods , which are not provided well through the market .
Often , these go under the heading of public goods , ” he said .
“ How do we ensure in the case of public goods that they are provided at all , and that they are provided at the right level , taking into account citizens ’ preferences ? ” he said .
A clean environment , for example , is not a private good in that “ my enjoyment of it does n’t preclude yours , ” he said .
“ So the theory of mechanism design asks what sort of procedures or mechanisms or institutions could be put in place which allow us to choose the right level , ” he said .
Those mechanisms could include taxes to allow the more efficient provision of public goods , he said .
Not enough coverage , pro-impeachment Dem launches KucinichTV Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Largely ignored by the mainstream media , a dark - horse Democratic presidential candidate has decided to create his own coverage with a new online TV station set to launch Wednesday .
While the media seems more focused on Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's alien encounters than his universal healthcare proposal or warnings about the march to war with Iran , the feisty Ohio Democrat is using the Internet to side - step the normal gatekeepers of presidential campaign coverage .
KucinichTV will feature a live town hall meeting at 9 p.m.
Wednesday as part of a series of broadcasts planned for the next 10 weeks , the campaign says .
Kucinich did receive a burst of coverage when his resolution aimed at impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney provoked several hours of unexpected action on the House floor .
Republicans joined with Kucinich and his allies to defeat the Democratic leadership 's attempt to kill the bill , but it has been referred to committee where it is expected to languish .
On KucinichTV.com , the congressman lists the details of his impeachment measure , which he says is necessary to prevent Cheney from plunging the country into another war with Iran .
Kucinich first introduced his impeachment resolution in April , accompanied by a lengthy list of alleged Cheney crimes , including pushing false intelligence in the run up to Iraq .
A recent American Research Group poll found 70 percent of Americans believe Cheney has abused his power as vice president , and 43 percent believe he should be impeached .
The same poll found 55 percent of voters believe Bush has committed an impeachable offense , although only about one in three believe he should be impeached .
Wednesday night 's Webcast will unveil the campaign 's " New Constitutional Convention Initiative " that aims to spark debate on a variety of issues , according to an e-mail to supporters from Kucinich 's campaign manager Michael Klein .
The campaign plans to " outline the ongoing assaults on the constitution . "
Participants will " discuss in detail what can be done collectively and individually to restore crucial constitutional principles , " and Kucinich hopes the event will " provide a venue which will lead to a coordinated and sustained national effort to renew the Constitution and restore accountability in government , " Klein wrote .
Featuring a live Web cast hosted by UStream is Kucinich 's latest attempt to engage voters directly .
Last week , so many supporters flooded a Kucinich - hosted conference call on impeachment that switchboards were overloaded .
Kucinich also has been using his YouTube page to air " campaign updates " that look like regular newscasts but were produced by the campaign .
And he began promoting his " Text Peace " initiative early in the campaign .
Not only has a large chunk of the universe thought to have been found in 2002 apparently gone missing again but it is taking some friends with it , according to new research at The University of Alabama in Huntsville ( UAH ) .
The new calculations might leave the mass of the universe as much as ten to 20 percent lighter than previously calculated .
The same UAH group that found what was theorized to be a significant fraction of the " missing mass " that binds together the universe has discovered that some x-rays thought to come from intergalactic clouds of " warm " gas are instead probably caused by lightweight electrons .
If the source of so much x-ray energy is tiny electrons instead of hefty atoms , it is as if billions of lights thought to come from billions of aircraft carriers were found instead to come from billions of extremely bright fireflies .
" This means the mass of these x-ray emitting clouds is much less than we initially thought it was , " said Dr. Max Bonamente , an assistant professor inUAH's Physics Department .
" A significant portion of what we thought was missing mass turns out to be these ' relativistic ' electrons .
" Traveling at almost the speed of light ( and therefore " relativistic " ) , these feather weight electrons collide with photons from the cosmic microwave background .
Energy from the collisions converts the photons from low - energy microwaves to high - energy x-rays .
" The discovery was made while trying to analyze the makeup of warm , x-ray emitting gas at the center of galaxy clusters - the largest cosmological structures in the universe .
In 2002 the UAH team reported finding large amounts of extra " soft " ( relatively low - energy ) x-rays coming from the vast space in the middle of galaxy clusters .
This was in addition to previously - discovered " hot " gas in that space , which emits higher energy " hard " x-rays .
Although the soft x -ray - emitting atoms were thought to be spread thinly through space ( less than one atom per cubit meter ) , they would have filled billions of billions of cubic light years .
Their cumulative mass was thought to account for as much as ten percent of the mass and gravity needed to hold together galaxies , galaxy clusters and perhaps the universe itself .
When Bonamente and his associates looked at data gathered by several satellite instruments , including the Chandra X - ray Observatory , from a galaxy cluster in the southern sky , however , they found that energy from those additional soft x-rays does n't look like it should .
" We have never been able to detect spectral emission lines associated with those detections , " he explained .
" If this ' bump ' in the data were due to cooler gas , it would have emission lines .
" The best , most logical explanation seems to be that a large fraction of the energy comes from electrons smashing into photons instead of from warm atoms and ions , which would have recognizable spectral emission lines .
Finding these electrons , however , is like finding " the tip of the iceberg , " said Bonamente , because they would not be limited to emitting only the soft x-ray signal .
The signal from these electrons would also make up part of the previously observed harder X - rays , which would reduce the amount of mass thought to make up the hot gas at the center of galaxy clusters .
To further complicate the issue , the energy from these electrons might also " puff up " the cluster .
Previously , astrophysicists used the energy coming from inside these clusters to calculate how much mass is needed to reach the equilibrium seen there ; too much mass and the cloud would collapse ; too little and the hot gas cloud would expand .
Since the energy coming from these hot clouds can be accurately measured , it was thought the mass could be calculated with reasonable confidence - for astrophysics .
Instead , says Bonamente , if a significant portion of the total x-ray energy comes from fast electrons , " that could trick us into thinking there is more gas than is actually there . "
" It means we need to revise how we calculate both the gas mass and the total mass , " he said .
" We have to follow the evidence and , if that leads us to confusion , well that 's OK .
" If part of the hard x-ray energy comes from electrons and photons , it might also shift what we think is the mix of elements in the universe .
Outside of the excess soft x-rays , the x-ray energy coming from galaxy clusters has emission lines which are especially prominent around iron and other metals .
Non -thermal x-rays from electrons colliding with photons might mask those emission lines , like thick snow can mask the height of fence posts .
" This is also telling us there is fractionally more iron and other metals than we previously thought , " said Bonamente .
" Less mass but more metals . "
Results of this research by Bonamente , Jukka Nevalainen of Finland 'sHelsinki Observatory and UAH's Dr. Richard Lieu were published Oct. 20 in the " Astrophysical Journal .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. destroyer has entered Somali territorial waters in pursuit of a Japanese - owned ship loaded with benzene that was hijacked by pirates over the weekend , military officials said Monday .
The destroyer USS Porter , shown in 2006 , sank pirate skiffs tied to the stern of the hijacked vessel .
The guided - missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke entered Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu , U.S. officials said .
In recent years , warships have stayed outside the 12 - mile limit when chasing pirates .
The ongoing operation was confirmed to CNN by two military officials familiar with the details .
Gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian - flagged Golden Mori off the Socotra archipelago , near the Horn of Africa , said Andrew Mwangura , a spokesman for Kenya 's Seafarers ' Assistance Programme .
The Golden Mori radioed for help Sunday night .
The Burke 's sister ship , the USS Porter , opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to its stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel .
When the shots were fired , it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene .
U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive .
Do n't Miss Pirate attacks increase worldwide
Benzene , which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen , is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics .
U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for several years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia , where a U.N. - backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near - anarchy .
In June , the destroyer USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia , but the American vessel had to turn away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters .
In May , a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast .
But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore .
The pirates are often armed with automatic rifles and shoulder - fired rockets , according to a recent warning from the agency .
" To date , vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding , while those that slow down are boarded , taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment , often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks , " it advised .
The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden , between Somalia and Yemen , after Sunday 's hijacking was reported .

All About Pirates • Somalia
When Dan Kindlon watches the Tigers play softball , he sees the legacy of feminism for girls .
“ My daughter ’s concentrating on catching the ball , and this other girl just slams into her , slides under , ” he recalls .
“ Julia got hurt a little bit , she got scraped up , but it was an experience that used to be exclusively the province of men and boys — to get knocked down , and then you ’ve got to pick yourself back up and get back in the game , brush your tears off , and ignore the blood .
She was kind of proud of herself afterwards .
It was a character - building experience that very few girls growing up in an earlier generation had a chance to have .
Now almost all of them have that chance . ”
Kindlon is a clinical psychologist and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard School of Public Health .
The more he coached his youngest daughter ’s team , the more he understood he was observing a new generation of girls and young women .
“ People who say that girls are n’t competitive and do n’t enjoy winning have never gone to a game and watched ! ” he says with a laugh .
“ My own daughters are so different from the girls I grew up with , in terms of the things they think they can do . ”
Linking those observations with accumulating data that show girls outperforming boys in grades , honors , and high - school graduation rates — and with the historic reversal in U.S. college enrollments ( 58 percent today are women , the 1970 percentage for men ) — convinced Kindlon that today ’s American girls are profoundly different from their mothers .
“ They were born into a different world , ” he says of girls and young women born since the early 1980s .
He began to think of them as “ alpha girls . ”
These girls — Kindlon uses the term because his research focuses on female development up to age 21 , the period covered by pediatric medicine — were not the self - loathing , melancholic teens at risk portrayed in such former bestsellers as Schoolgirls : Young Women , Self - Esteem and the Confidence Gap ( Peggy Orenstein ) , Failing at Fairness : How America ’s Schools Cheat Girls ( Myra and David Sadker ) , and Reviving Ophelia : Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls ( Mary Pipher ) .
Girls today “ take it for granted that it is their due to get equal rights , ” Kindlon says .
“ They never had to fight those battles over fertility control , equal educational and athletic access , or illegal job discrimination . ”
As a result , “ girls are starting to make the psychological shift , the inner transformation , that Simone de Beauvoir predicted ” in 1949 when she wrote , in The Second Sex , “ sooner or later [ women ] will arrive at complete economic and social equality , which will bring about an inner metamorphosis . ”
Recognizing that a new psychology was necessary to describe his daughters ’ generation , Kindlon studied more than 900 girls and boys across the United States and Canada and wrote about his findings in Alpha Girls : Understanding the New American Girl and How She Is Changing the World ( 2006 ) .
This new “ girl power ” is characterized by what Kindlon calls an “ emancipated confidence ” that is raising self - esteem , reducing depression , and altering gender roles among girls and young women .
“ Alpha girls ” did not appear overnight , however .
A century of social and economic change first tipped and then leveled the playing field , creating the circumstances for unprecedented gains for women in education and the labor force .
These gains appear across socioeconomic strata , but they are less widespread among low - income and minority girls .
To rectify the disparities , some “ alphas ” are creating innovative programs as part of a “ girls ’ movement ” to make such progress available to all young women .
Of course , once alpha girls enter the workforce and begin families , they will no doubt encounter the same tradeoffs their mothers did ; how they will cope with these challenges is uncertain , but they are already changing wage and marriage patterns in unexpected ways .
Alpha Psych 101
“ The psychological demons that used to affect girls and women in this country just do n’t affect today ’s girls in the same way , ” Kindlon asserts .
In the 1980s and early ’90s , Carol Gilligan ( formerly Graham professor of gender studies at Harvard Graduate School of Education and now a professor at New York University ) and other feminist psychologists wrote that girls in their teens compromise their authenticity to fit gender roles , thereby “ losing their voice . ”
In 1992 , influential American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) research on late - 1980s data on girls born in the 1970s found that girls ’ self - esteem plunged in middle school , compared to boys ’ , and that classroom sexism ( such as teachers ’ calling on boys more than girls , or more competitive than cooperative learning ) was a cause .
The AAUW report recognized positive trends , such as young women ’s ascent in college enrollment , while recommending correctives for the continuing shortfalls .
Alpha girls are created in large numbers when the society that they are born into has sufficient equal opportunity , Kindlon says : “ It was n’t until the early to mid ’ 80s — when schools really started to get serious about Title IX , when women first began to outnumber men in college , when women began moving into leadership roles , such as Congress , in significant numbers — that societal conditions had changed enough to permit the alpha girl explosion . ”
He set out to discover how Beauvoir ’s “ inner metamorphosis ” has changed girls ’ psychology in the years since the AAUW report .
He knew that past and recent research in a variety of fields had already revealed gender differences in mental illness : girls and women have twice men ’s risk for depression and anxiety disorders , while boys and men are twice as likely to suffer substance - use disorders and schizophrenia .
Some theories attribute this depression / anxiety gender gap , which appears in adolescence , to differences in the biology of sex hormones ; other explanations focus on “ gender socialization . ”
Investigators have located numerous gender - related risk factors for depression , including passive - feminine sex - role identification , helpless coping styles , and low self - esteem .
Body dissatisfaction is also key : in adolescence , boys gain muscle while girls gain fat — just as body - image pressures intensify .
To assess the psychological and social health of a new generation of girls , Kindlon designed the Adolescent Life Survey to measure 19 dimensions of teen experience ( from mental health to career and family aspirations ) and in 2005 surveyed 700 girls and 228 boys in the sixth through twelfth grades in a range of urban , suburban , and rural U.S. and Canadian schools .
He then interviewed the top 113 high - school girls , born for the most part between 1984 and 1988 .
These were alpha girls who had attained a 3.8 or better grade - point average and at least one leadership position , pursued 10 or more hours of extracurriculars weekly , and scored high on measures of “ achievement motivation . ”
Kindlon found signs of a new “ alpha psychology ” among all the girls .
There were no sex differences in depressive symptoms , no drop in self - esteem across the six grades , and no lack of confidence .
By tenth grade , in fact , the girls he surveyed had higher self - esteem than boys , and alphas had significantly higher self - esteem than non-alphas .
Lower socioeconomic status tended to lower self - esteem scores for both sexes , irrespective of race or ethnicity , but Kindlon interviewed many “ inner - city alphas ” — the phenomenon is not confined to “ elites . ”
( Consistent with previous research , he did find higher rates of anxiety among girls than boys — perhaps because girls “ want to get things done , ” he speculates , although he notes that biological factors could be involved .
In either case , he cautions against overemphasizing the anxiety scores , because boys may underreport their own anxiety . )
“ Loss of voice ” may be a thing of the past , as Kindlon suggests , but gender pressures persist , says Wendy Luttrell , Aronson associate professor in human development and education : “ We ca n’t talk about how girls are doing today without talking about boys and girls in relation to each other . ”
As a feminist ethnographer who analyzes gender , race , and class in educational settings , she believes kids today , in fact , are still “ incredibly constrained ” by gender .
She recently observed such forces in action at the close of her youngest daughter ’s summer college - prep program .
The karaoke competition between sex- segregated groups was “ a Saturday Night Live mimicry of what gender roles in contemporary society look like , ” she reports .
The girls performed “ sexy - but - cute Britney Spears acts , ” while the boys presented aggressive , sexualized , hip - hop dance numbers .
“ Each group played off the extreme of the other , ” she notes , wishing the hypermasculine and hyperfeminine performances had been far less stereotypical , with “ both boys and girls crossing what we consider to be ‘ male ’ and ‘ female ’ roles . ”
The alpha generation may yet fulfill that wish .
“ Girls are now able to play more roles , ” says Kindlon .
Alpha girls do n’t identify with a passive - feminine sex role , yet maintain “ female ” skills like social networking .
They also know how to do things that only men and boys traditionally did , such as “ channel their aggression in a competitive situation — not to get too mad , but to get mad enough so you can play harder — and to compete and to enjoy winning . ”
Fathers play a big part in this psychology , Kindlon adds .
He has found that alphas ’ dads are more involved in their daughters ’ lives than non -al phas ’ dads .
They can pass along “ male ways of being , ” such as rougher play and greater risk - taking , and “ male ways of thinking . ”
This “ hybrid ” self , an “ androgynous ” personality incorporating aspects of both parents , is a cornerstone of alpha psychology , he believes .
The more androgynous girls in his study had higher self - esteem , were less anxious or self - conscious , and engaged in less promiscuous sex and substance abuse .
Because they can choose from what feminist psychologists call “ separate ” ( traditionally masculine ) or “ connected ” ( traditionally feminine ) styles of being in the world , they have a psychological advantage .
“ Girls are better adapted , ” he says .
“ They ’re more flexible and have more skill .
Boys have n’t changed as much — or have n’t been induced as much to play a variety of roles . ”
What girls are saying , adds Kindlon , is , “ I have flexibility that no other woman has ever had in history , or certainly not in any numbers , and I can play any role — ‘ Bring it on . ’”
As one “ hybrid ” alpha ( now at Harvard ) told him , “ I can wear high heels to my linear algebra class .
I can be sexy or I can be feminine , or I can also blow the boys away in this really tough class .
I can do anything .
I do n’t see it as inconsistent to be wearing high heels .
I do n’t feel like I ’ve got to dress down or dress like a man to do this class .
I can still be a woman and do all these other things . ”
The Rise of the Alpha Girl
Long-emerging changes in girls ’ access to higher education and career options have prepared the ground for girls ’ “ emancipated confidence . ”
In fact , aspects of alpha girlhood are n’t new .
“ Girls have been ahead of boys in pre-college education for well over 100 years , ” says Allison professor of economics Lawrence Katz : in high - school graduation rates and in constituting two - thirds of honors students .
“ What was striking in the past [ was ] that even though girls dominated boys through high school , boys were given greater opportunities to go on to college . ”
But as the women ’s movement dismantled labor - market barriers and an accelerating service economy expanded job opportunities in the 1970s , girls and young women expected and found greater economic benefits from going to college .
Add the Pill and later marriage and first birth ; subtract male incentives like the GI Bill and disproportionate family support ; multiply by behavioral differences between girls and boys — and you have the formula for exponential change , argue Lee professor of economics Claudia Goldin and Katz in a recent journal article , “ The Homecoming of American College Women : The Reversal of the College Gender Gap ” ( with Ilyana Kuziemko , Ph.D. ’ 07 ) .
“ It ’s never clear why the American press wakes up suddenly and says , ‘ Oh !
Where are the men on campus ? ’
The crossover point was way back in 1980 — 25 years ago ! ” says Goldin .
Headlines imply that male college attendance has dropped , yet there ’s been “ enormous growth in B.A. completion rates ” for both sexes , she notes .
The female rate of increase has been much higher , however , so the ratios of the 1960s and ’ 70s have flipped — to 58 percent female nationwide today .
What drove this dramatic catch - up and reversal ?
“ The playing field and the labor market are much more even , ” says Katz .
“ That ’s really what ’s changed . ”
Surprisingly , however , the rise of women in higher education began with college parity , early in the twentieth century .
From 1900 to the Crash of 1929 , women went to college in numbers equal to men .
A fraction went to the “ Seven Sisters , ” but the majority enrolled in public institutions , such as teachers ’ colleges and the large state institutions that accepted women .
Then the Great Depression drove a wedge into parity .
Unemployed men needed the college advantage , and school districts ’ new “ marriage bars ” against married female teachers made teaching degrees less valuable to women .
Male - to - female ratios peaked in 1947 , after World War II .
“ You get this huge spike of guys coming back from Europe and Asia , ” Goldin says , when there were “ two and a half men ” on college campuses for every woman .
The GI Bill enabled men from many age groups to attend college at the same time , bolstering male enrollment until after the Korean War .
More women went as well , because college benefits often included “ your M.R.S. , ” notes Goldin .
Then came Vietnam — and draft deferment .
Because more draftable men went to and stayed in college , male college graduation rates peaked for men born in the late 1940s .
Women also have “ a Vietnam effect , ” Goldin says : “ If boys go , girls go . ”
Women were catching up , but the gender gap in B.A. completion in 1970 still favored men , 57 percent to 43 percent .
By 1972 , girls in the top socioeconomic quartile achieved college parity despite the war .
In two decades , by 1992 , girls at every socioeconomic level had a substantial lead .
“ Families are not discriminating in resources for college in favor of boys as they may have done 75 years ago , ” says Katz .
And in the lower half of economic distribution , the female - to - male ratio today is considerably higher than in the upper half , a reversal of traditional patterns .
( The female advantage is larger among African Americans and Hispanics than among whites , but the decline in the male - to - female ratio of undergraduates during the past 35 years is not due primarily to changes in the ethnic mix of the college - aged population , write Goldin and Katz :
“ The bottom line is that the new gender gap favoring females is found throughout the socioeconomic distribution , ” and it is similar for whites , all ethnic and racial subgroups , and the entire U.S. population . )
Girls and young women today also invest in “ their own human capital ” through what they choose to study in high school and college , due to dramatic changes in the labor market .
Reflecting on college majors , Goldin says , “ The huge shift is out of education into business . ”
Until the 1970s , most female undergraduates concentrated in literature , languages , and education , because most of the job opportunities were in teaching .
In 1970 , for example , 56 percent of working 30 - to 34 - year - old college - educated women were teachers , compared to only 18 percent in 2000 .
By 2005 , 50 percent of business majors were women .
And “ psychology is the English of yesterday , ” adds Goldin : 78 percent of psychology concentrators today are women .
As their opportunities changed , girls took more high - school science and math , achieving virtual parity by 1992 in numbers of courses ( and narrowing the math - score gap ) , while remaining ahead in foreign languages .
Meanwhile , boys ’ progress relative to girls ’ was less dramatic , and even stagnating at lower socioeconomic levels .
In Goldin and Katz ’s “ cost - benefit analysis ” of college returns , girls and young women have lower “ nonpecuniary costs ” for college - prep and attendance than boys and young men , and they earn higher economic benefits from going to college ( women without college earn less than men without college ) .
Moreover , note Goldin and Katz , boys have more learning disabilities , suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at triple the rate of girls , engage in more criminal activity , and spend less time on schoolwork than girls .
School has also become harder and more competitive since 1983 , when the National Commission on Excellence in Education published A Nation at Risk , notes Dan Kindlon .
The girls born at that time and since “ were starting to make the psychological shift predicted by Beauvoir , so they rose to the challenge , ” he says .
“ Girls are doing the work and boys are n’t — boys are playing Grand Theft Auto . ”
Kindlon once asked his youngest daughter , “ ‘ Is it just that girls are smarter than boys ? ’
And at age 11 she said , ‘ No , they ’re not smarter , but they have more stamina , ’ which I think really does characterize it . ”
Yet college - bound girls , despite their hard work , face stiffer admissions competition than boys .
A U.S. News analysis of a decade of data from 1,400 colleges discovered that schools maintained gender balance by admitting girls at “ drastically different rates ” — on average 13 percentage points lower — than boys .
“ When a number of state universities started becoming incredibly female [ 70 percent or more ] , ” explains Katz , “ private universities started doing things that look like affirmative action for boys .
Admissions officers basically said , ‘ We were getting worried about the gender mix , so we shaded things . ’
They ’re bringing in on - the - margin guys who are less qualified than women in order to maintain some gender balance . ”
Fertility control , meanwhile , has helped women achieve their ambitions well beyond college .
As Goldin and Katz argue in another journal article , “ The Power of the Pill : Oral Contraceptives and Women ’s Career and Marriage Decisions , ” the birth - control pill , approved in 1960 but made available to college - age single women only in the late 1960s and early ’ 70s , allowed young women to delay both marriage and childbearing while they pursued graduate and professional school .
Women now earn the majority of M.D. , D.D.S. , and J.D. professional degrees , and the majority of all postgraduate degrees .
“ For the first time in history , females have complete fertility control , which means they are n’t getting pregnant , dropping out , having babies , ” notes neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine , a former Harvard Medical School resident and faculty member who is the author of The Female Brain and founder and director of the Women ’s Mood and Hormone Clinic at the University of California , San Francisco .
She believes that the “ alpha ” phenomenon also involves “ a paradigm shift in the way parents think about their girls ’ options in the world , ” in part because unwanted pregnancy is out of the picture .
“ There ’s a whole generation of girls whose creativity and intellect are being supported by their families .
Their mothers and fathers are cheering them on , coaching them , and setting the bar high , so that their ambition can soar and take them high . ”
With a level playing field , then , in family resources , higher education , economic opportunity , and fertility control , a critical mass of girls and young women have achieved — and are achieving — the historic potential of their sex .
Strong Women , Strong Girls ?
“ A lot of the hopes of the feminist movement and the girls ’ programming movement are being realized , but there ’s a tremendous amount of work still to be done , particularly for girls without educational or economic advantages , ” says Lindsay Hyde ’ 04 , founder and executive director of Strong Women , Strong Girls ( SWSG ) , a nonprofit organization that fosters high aspirations and success skills among low - income minority girls by involving them with strong female role models .
Hyde ’s inspiration was her own mother , a Miami single mom who cut the grass , tiled the bathroom floor , redid the electrical system , and “ demonstrated for me that women could really do anything ! ”
Keen to share her own experience with young girls , Hyde designed and taught a curriculum based on historic and contemporary women at the local elementary school during her last semester of high school .
When she could n’t find a girl - centered service opportunity at Harvard that fall , she used her curriculum to start a new afterschool program through Phillips Brooks House , beginning with six undergraduate women and 30 girls from the third , fourth , and fifth grades at Roxbury and Mission Hill elementary schools .
Seven years later , SWSG serves 400 mostly African - American and Latina girls at 32 schools and community centers in Boston and Pittsburgh , with 120 mentors from seven colleges and universities .
( For her work , Hyde recently received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 or Under , one of the five Jefferson Awards conferred annually by the American Institute for Public Service . )
To off set the effects of poverty , gender stereotyping , and low expectations that can undermine girls ’ academic confidence and direct them to narrow education and career options , SWSG combines the study of diverse female role models with team - mentoring , field trips , and community service .
Two or three undergraduate mentors lead 10 to 12 girls in weekly lessons built around a particular skill , such as critical thinking .
Sessions begin by reading the biography of a woman exemplifying that skill , such as Sally Ride , the first American female astronaut , in order to “ paint a picture of the steps she needed to take to go from being 10 years old to being an astronaut , because that ’s one of the hardest things for our girls to figure out , ” Hyde explains .
Girls then apply the skill - of - the - week in a hands - on project — using everyday objects such as paper plates and paper towel rolls to build space shuttles , for example .
Lessons conclude with journal writing , with prompts like , “ What are two ways that you ’ll use your critical thinking skills this week ? ” SWSG also teaches coping skills ( from healthy eating and exercise to stress management ) , and partners with sports - focused nonprofits to provide girls with a holistic experience .
During the last six weeks of the school year , the girls and their mentors create a service project for their community .
The volunteers , who serve as role models themselves , are a key element of the Strong Women , Strong Girls program .
These smart , successful young women from various backgrounds introduce their inner-city students to diverse cultures , ideas , and career paths .
“ The girls may see a woman who ’s an English major , who ’s really passionate about writing and poetry and literature , working with a woman who ’s a physics major , who ’s really passionate about science and electronics , ” says Hyde .
“ They look up to both women , who are doing very different things with very different interests and passions . ”
Many of these girls know few people who ’ve gone to college besides their mentors , notes Hyde , but “ they start to feel , ‘ Gosh , maybe college is something that I could do . ’”
To encourage this sense of familiarity , SWSG includes campus field trips .
“ We have some girls who now have been to Harvard three years in a row , and they really feel that it ’s a place that holds possibility for them to be there .
That ’s a tremendous change , to go from saying , ‘ I do n’t know anybody who ’s ever gone to college ’ to walking onto the Harvard campus and saying , ‘ I feel like I belong here .
I know where I ’m going , and this is a place that feels comfortable for me . ’ ”
The program works .
Most parents feel their daughters have learned new skills ( 94 percent ) , increased their self - esteem ( 88 percent ) , and strengthened their belief in themselves as a leader ( 80 percent ) .
The mentors also benefit : nearly 95 percent report greater self - confidence and empowerment .
At many SWSG partner colleges , there are waiting lists of volunteers .
Strong Women , Strong Girls is helping distribute the benefits of feminism , yet the young women who volunteer often “ come to the work with less of a politically oriented agenda and much more of a service - oriented agenda , ” reports Hyde .
Volunteers frequently tell her , “ I had positive experiences as a young woman , and I believe that it is incumbent on me to help other young women also have positive experiences . ”
As a result , more inner-city girls are breaking out of gender stereotypes and gaining the “ emancipated confidence ” of alpha psychology to expand their educational and career opportunities .
Having It All ?
“ The myth of having it all , and having it all at once , is what my generation is working to figure out — and we have n’t gotten it right yet ! ” says
Hyde , who was recently scouting wedding locations with her fiancé , Blair Baldwin ’ 02 , B ’09 .
In the course of graduating from college , working for a couple years , going back to graduate school , perhaps starting a company or nonprofit ( as she has done ) , and having a family , the question her cohort asks is , “ How am I going to fit in all of these great things that I want to do ? ”
Alpha girls want to do everything — have successful careers and marriage and children , in sequence or combination .
How will they handle the realities of the workplace and the tough choices their own mothers faced ?
“ It wo n’t be quite as easy as it was for them in high school and college , ” says Dan Kindlon .
“ They ’ll get slapped around a little when they get out into the world , ” he thinks , “ but they ’re ready for the challenge . ”
And as Hyde points out , “ Some of the structural challenges around balancing work and family — maternity - and paternity - leave policies , women ’s wages , and on - ramp / off - ramp opportunities in the workforce — have not caught up quite as fast as women ’s own belief in themselves and in their capacities . ”
In Kindlon ’s research , he found that financial success was a top priority for nearly all the alpha girls surveyed , and that almost a third were determined to get rich .
But they will encounter a persistent wage gap : in the United States , for each dollar earned by white men , women overall still earn only 77 cents , and African - American and Hispanic women earn even less , 64 cents and 52 cents , respectively .
A recent AAUW study found that even though women earn higher grades than men , this superior academic performance does n’t translate into higher — or even equal — compensation .
A year after college , women make 80 percent of the salaries of their male peers ; 10 years later , the gap widens .
But alphas are starting to reverse the wage gap for the first time in large cities like New York , Boston , and Chicago .
According to Queens College sociologist Andrew Beveridge , women between the ages of 21 to 30 working full time had median incomes as much as 17 percent higher than their male peers — because 53 percent of the women had college degrees compared to 38 percent of the men .
“ There are going to be more living college - educated women in this country in about five to 10 years than college - educated men .
Historically , that ’s unprecedented , ” notes Kindlon .
“ We ’re going to see some really interesting changes in the next 20 or 30 years . ”
Women ’s educational advantage will influence work , marriage , and family in unexpected ways .
African - American women now earn B.A.s at almost twice the rate of black males , for example , which is contributing to huge declines in their marriage rates , note Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz .
Although marriage among educated whites is occurring later and more permanently , many educated black women do n’t just delay marriage , they do n’t marry at all .
With potential black male partners facing jobless rates of up to 50 percent for high - school graduates and up to 72 percent for dropouts , and interracial marriage still a rarity , educated and employed black women often decide to raise their children out of wedlock .
Recent reports suggest that some professional black women are starting to enter interracial relationships , however , so the alpha generation may change these marriage patterns .
Meanwhile , Katz and Goldin believe the “ marriage gap ” reinforces an increasingly polarized and unequal socioeconomic environment for children .
“ The mothering piece is really the fault line when it comes to class and race , ” says ethnographer Wendy Luttrell , author of Schoolsmart and Motherwise : Working - Class Women ’s Identity and Schooling ( 1997 ) .
For middle - and upper - class girls and women struggling to balance rewarding work and family , “ the tradeoff is about being the perfect mom and doing the perfect job — about being able to do everything , ” she says .
But for poor and working - class , increasingly single , mothers , “ It ’s not about tradeoffs , it ’s about , ‘ How am I going to support my kids and keep them safe ? ’ ”
For these women , the challenge is meeting the double - duty demands of mothering and low - wage work , predominantly in service - sector jobs and often for professional women , who employ and rely upon low - income women ( disproportionately women of color and recent immigrants ) to do all kinds of family - care work , says Luttrell .
The current rhetoric about work - family conflicts emphasizes personal choices regarding working and / or mothering , “ but this overlooks the larger mother - care - work crisis caused by unequal opportunity , declining social services , and unjust policies that pit employment demands on wage - poor mothers against the care needs of their children . ”
Not all young women will choose to be mothers ( 26 percent of white women born in 1960 with a college degree are childless , for example ) , but the majority will .
With 72 percent of American mothers working outside the home , the work / family challenge is widespread .
“ From a women ’s rights point of view , that ’s still the biggest hurdle to overcome , ” notes Kindlon .
Work / family issues play a significant role in the wage gap .
Some companies avoid investing in training women who may take time off for maternity and childrearing , according to Burbank professor of political economy Torben Iversen .
Once career choices are taken into account , Iversen has found that “ statistical discrimination ” against women ( basing judgments about individuals from a group on average assumptions about that group ) is a major cause of the wage gap .
Katz believes that among college graduates , career “ choice ” is likely the largest factor causing the wage gender gap , while traditional sex discrimination remains substantial but is diminishing .
He suggests that behavioral differences play a secondary role : men tend to negotiate better salaries or bonuses , while women tend to accept what ’s offered , and men seem to thrive on “ pure competition ” more than women .
( Because studies have found that some employers “ penalize ” women who negotiate , female reluctance to negotiate may be self - protective against bias . )
According to the Harvard Crimson survey of the class of 2007 , such factors are still in play for recent alphas .
Women and men were heading to graduate school ( 22 percent ) and finding jobs ( 50 percent ) in equal numbers , but there was a significant gender gap in median starting salaries : men were contracted to earn $ 10,000 more .
“ That ’s entirely explained by which sectors they go into , ” says Katz : 58 percent of men chose finance , compared to 43 percent of women ( still a large percentage of women choosing a male - dominated field ) .
Eleven women planned to work at nongovernmental organizations , but no men , adds Goldin : “ Men chose to work 80 hours a week at Goldman Sachs and make $ 60,000 , not including bonuses . ”
However , within banking or consulting , they report , the wage gap disappears .
Goldin is concerned about the “ extremely large ” economic penalty for choosing to balance family and career down the line .
Female and male lawyers straight out of law school have similar salaries , she notes , but 10 years later their earnings are very different .
Many professions were structured for “ the Father Knows Best world , when every person in the labor market had a mirror image in the home , ” which freed time for the paid worker .
Hence “ rising to the top ” ( tenure , partnership , profit shares ) required enormous amounts of time — on average 80 hours a week .
For women , the traditional promotional clock often conflicts with their biological clock , and many who want children do n’t “ opt into ” the partner track , says Goldin , choosing instead less demanding — and less remunerative — corporate counsel , government , or nonprofit work , or having a small firm .
( Being slow to adapt to women ’s realities has cost law firms dearly , however , prompting restructuring that will benefit alpha girls .
To attract and retain female attorneys , some firms now offer flextime partner tracks ; “ lattice ” rather than “ ladder ” careers — climbing interspersed with slower childbearing periods ; on - site daycare ; flat - rate or project - based compensation rather than billable hours ; and part - time partnerships . )
The alpha girls Kindlon studied were aware that “ having it all ” is n’t easy .
Most knew their career path : medicine was at the top ( 25 percent ) , followed by STEM ( science , technology , engineering , math ) fields and art / music ( 13 percent each ) , business ( 12 percent ) , and politics / law ( 9 percent ) .
Medicine was the first choice , Kindlon believes , because most female physicians can and do practice part - time , allowing a lucrative , satisfying career with time for kids .
By specialty , the percentage of female residents in 2003 was highest for obstetrics / gynecology ( 71 percent ) , followed by pediatrics ( 65 percent ) , dermatology ( 57 percent ) , pathology and psychiatry ( 50 percent each ) , family medicine ( 49 percent ) , and surgery ( 24 percent ) .
How might subsequent choices influence alpha women ’s salaries ?
“ Women are using their market power not to maximize their earnings , but to get the job that allows more balance , ” says Katz .
They ’re forming group ob / gyn practices and earning $ 140,000 a year for 50 - hour weeks and not coming in at night , while men are making $ 180,000 for 60 hours and taking the emergency calls .
The work / family challenge involves more than wages , of course .
When young women face the reality of child - rearing , there may be a psychological penalty , says Louann Brizendine .
Her psychiatry - neurology residents are “ two years out from hanging up their shingle , ” she reports , “ and I do n’t see them giving a second thought to anything holding them back from what they want to do — up to age 27 or 28 . ”
The question of children looms ahead , but “ they go full steam with their ambition — the alpha female is out there doing her thing . ”
Then comes the critical , pivotal point of turning 30 , when “ you ’ve got about 10 years left to have kids ” — and alpha confidence falters .
“ All of a sudden my students start to think , ‘ How am I going to reserve part of my energy , my self , my creativity , and my time , to have kids ? ’
They get anxious . ”
Of course , with money for good daycare and good schools , professional women comfortably “ wrap together career and family , ” notes Goldin .
Many can even afford to “ opt out ” for a couple of years to be with their kids .
“ I have no crocodile tears for women at this level , ” she says .
It ’s the women in their early thirties who dropped out of high school ( 10 percent ) , or graduated but did n’t do any college ( 25 percent ) , about whom Goldin is concerned .
“ They are n’t going to do as well . ”
Strong Women , Strong Girls seeks to change those statistics for a future generation .
SWSG ’s Lindsey Hyde also supports flextime solutions in the present .
Her female staff find creative ways to balance work and family , and their partners and spouses are assuming more domestic responsibilities , too .
“ Women in my generation are asking their partners to be more involved , and considering that before entering a more serious relationship , ” she says .
“ Is this somebody who ’s going to support me in the choices that I make , whatever those choices may be ? ”
Alpha girls wo n’t make the same mistake their mothers made , says Kindlon — “ have a job and do 90 percent of the domestic stuff . ”
They ’ll tell their husbands or partners , “ We ’re going to split this .
If you ’re home , you ’re going to change diapers the same way I do .
If the house is dirty , either I ’ll get used to it , or you ’re going to help me out with it . ”
This generation wo n’t feel “ it ’s their work to do , as a lot of women today do ” ; as a result , men will pick up a bigger share and women ’s lives wo n’t feel as unbalanced .
“ It ’s very possible that my daughters will be the primary breadwinners in their homes , ” Kindlon speculates .
“ They ’re certainly not looking for a husband to provide for them ! ”
Single mothers already carry that responsibility , but more married mothers will , too .
In fact , “ if the college - educated person is making more money and has health benefits and the other person does n’t , who ’s going to cut back on the career ?
There ’s no question , I ’ve seen it .
I have nephews whose wives are working , and they ’re staying home with the kids , because money ’s behind it , and nothing ’s stopping that trend . ”
( Some estimates number U.S. stay - at - home dads at 2 million . )
“ The real fuel for the engine is going to be that women will have more money , so they ’ll have more of a say over what happens , ” he adds .
With parenting no longer “ women ’s work ” alone , perhaps a true work / life balance is possible for men and women .
For Hyde , a different responsibility is foremost .
“ One of the things that is really important for women of my generation to be cognizant of is that we have had tremendous opportunities and that it is incumbent on us to make sure that the young women — and young men — who are coming up behind us have access to those same opportunities .
As people who have been so privileged to live in this time period , we really do have a responsibility to continue to make change moving forward . ”

Click here to view a slideshow of the bridge community .
Another one showed up last night .
Around 10 — just before curfew — a car rolled in under the bridge and the newcomer got out with his wife .
She hugged and kissed him goodbye , pulled the car out along the road , and disappeared into a sea of headlights .
The new guy sits by the side of the Julia Tuttle Causeway , talking to a group of men huddled atop a collection of lawn chairs , buckets , and plastic crates facing the water , toward the Miami skyline .
" I can't believe this shit , " he booms .
Nearly six feet tall and 250 pounds , endowed with a voice like a fire engine , he has already earned his new nickname : Big Man .
The men listen with mild sympathy .
" They 're shocked ; the new guys are in shock , " explains Patrick Wiese , who has been living under the bridge since July .
Until last week , Big Man was serving a four - year sentence for cocaine possession .
A few days ago , he was looking forward to leaving prison and reuniting with his wife , until he got the news : Instead of going home , he'd be living under a bridge , a parole commission officer told him .
That 's because 23 years ago , when he was 19 years old , Big Man was charged with sexual assault on a minor .
( He claims the victim was his girlfriend and that it was consensual . )
" When they told me I was coming down here , my legs was shaking , " he says .
" Me and my wife drove around all day trying to find the place .
She was saying , ' Maybe you should go back to jail ; I do n't want you living under no bridge . ' "
In March , New Times revealed the Florida Department of Corrections was housing sex offenders under an overpass near the county courthouse ; the state responded by moving the men here .
The reason : A 2005 county ordinance prohibits sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of any school , so nearly the entire county has become off - limits to them .
The story was picked up by national media outlets , and for a few weeks the bridge was a source of widespread disbelief .
Statements were made , resolutions were passed , letters were sent — but nothing changed .
Since then , much to the relief of local politicians , no doubt , the situation seems to have quietly faded from public memory .
But the numbers kept growing .
More than 30 men have been sent to live here in the intervening months .
A few have since left — the majority of them arrested for minor violations of probation , two or three were able to move out , and two have disappeared .
But most — as of press time , at least 20 — remain under the bridge , even though many have families willing to house them .
Everyone agrees the situation under the Julia Tuttle has become untenable , but so far neither local politicians , nor the courts , nor the state legislature have been willing to do anything about it .
And so the men have begun to settle in .
From discarded wood , they 've built 15 - foot ladders to ascend the concrete embankment that leads to a small , flat space beneath the bridge , where they sleep .
A system of handmade pallets elevates them above the water that collects in their sleeping quarters when it rains ( luckily for them , there were n't any hurricanes this year ) .
One bridge dweller bought a generator ; the others are expected to pitch in for the privilege of electricity with whatever they can — money , food , beer , or labor .
Every night , work projects are afoot : cleaning the ground beneath the bridge , futzing with the generator , tending a grill large enough to cook for all of them at once .
At least six animals share quarters with the men — a Doberman , a pit bull , a Yorkshire terrier , and three cats .
" We are a colony , " Wiese explains , " and we gotta work it like that . "
Long before dawn , the men are up and packing .
Silently they stow their bedding , brush their teeth , and perform perfunctory toilet duty by the bay .
The minute their curfew ends , at 6 a.m. , they are gone .
The drivers pull out along the muddy grass by the causeway , through a break in the railing , and into the stream of traffic .
The walkers ascend the embankment by the bridge , step over the rail , and make their way along the causeway .
From the top of the bridge you can see them , every morning , their figures getting smaller and smaller until they vanish in the pale light of another day in Miami .
Two years ago , Miami Beach Mayor David Dermer successfully pushed an ordinance that prohibited sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of any school in his city — two and a half times farther than the state law 's distance , which already prohibited offenders from living within 1,000 feet of schools , daycare centers , and playgrounds .
The ordinance came at a time when states across the nation were cracking down on sex offenders in the wake of the horrific rape and murder of nine - year - old Jessica Lunsford in Homosassa , Florida , by John Couey , a 47 - year - old drifter with a criminal history of child molestation .
Mayor Dermer intended his ordinance to set the high water mark , and it did .
In a city surrounded by water and barely a mile wide at its thickest , the 2,500 - foot ordinance effectively made Miami Beach the first city in America to exile sex offenders — a fact Dermer has acknowledged proudly .
In an interview on NPR's Talk of the Nation , host Neil Conan asked Dermer point - blank : " What do you say to the communities where they move to ? "
For the only time in the otherwise exuberant conversation , Dermer sounded flustered .
" Well , those communities , " he said , " obviously if they have inquiry as to what we 're doing , we 're happy to assist them in any way . "
The point of the question was not lost on Miami - Dade politicians , who nervously watched Dermer 's actions from across a half - mile of water .
Where would sex offenders go if banned from Miami Beach ?
To the rest of the county , of course .
Within a year , the Miami - Dade County Commission unanimously passed a mirror ordinance , banning sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of any school .
How much of Miami - Dade County , exactly , does the 2,500 - foot ordinance cover ?
Pretty much all of it , according to a map produced by the county and distributed to police and newly released sex offenders .
It shows schools in the county — private , charter , and public — each with a colored blob around it representing the 2,500 - foot sex - offender no man 's land .
The blobs cover the map ; the only open patches are Miami International Airport , a few farm tracts in the Redland and near the Everglades , and , perhaps ironically , much of the well - to - do town of Pinecrest , which is protected from most sex offenders by property values instead of ordinances .
( Sex offenders , like any other kind of felon , overwhelmingly tend to be poor . )
It 's one thing to pass a law ; it 's another to make it work .
Even as county commissioners patted themselves on the back , state probation officers — who are responsible for overseeing all offenders released on probation — were already having a difficult time enforcing the state 's 1,000 - foot law , let alone Miami 's new 2,500 - foot ordinance .
At first , they simply rearrested sex offenders who could n't find a legal residence before their release date .
But a judge 's ruling in July 2006 led to an internal memo ending that practice .
Probation officers were in a bind :
The offenders had to be released — but to where ?
And so they began to crop up in strange places .
On January 4 , two homeless sex offenders living on bus benches in Broward County were arrested for disorderly conduct , according to DOC e-mails obtained by New Times .
" The offenders were charged with hanging their clothing , that had become wet during a rainstorm , over some bushes , " wrote a probation officer .
In another e-mail , a probation officer in Sanford , near Orlando , wrote to a colleague : " I hate to tell you , but this is Sex Offender Square ; there are approximately 11 of them living out there ....
The only way we could [ count them ] was to line them up , like at Publix deli . "
The storm came to Miami in August 2006 , when 66 - year - old sex offender Angel Sanchez was released after serving a year and a half for molesting a relative on at least two occasions , when she was nine and 13 years old .
Sanchez could n't go home .
But his social security income meant he could pay rent elsewhere .
Sanchez proposed nearly a dozen residences to his probation officer , Benito Casal , and Casal diligently checked them .
But each one violated the state ordinance .
When Sanchez got out of jail , Casal ordered him to live under the Dolphin Expressway overpass at NE 12th Avenue and 12th Street , across the street from the county courthouse .
A few months later , another sex offender fresh out of lockup was sent to join him .
Then , several weeks later , another .
The three men slept in cardboard boxes and on piles of rags in the parking lot .
Casal enforced their curfew — 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. — by briefly pulling into the lot before dawn every day to make sure the three were there .
New Times 's March 8 , 2007 story ( " Swept Under the Bridge " ) sparked a flurry of e-mails within the department of corrections .
" It was the only known location that sex offenders in Dade County could reside , " probation supervisor Patricia Nelson wrote in an incensed e-mail to probation officers and supervisors .
" We are instructing our offender [s ] to move from that location .
Where , we do not know , but [ they ] will have to find a location by curfew this evening or face arrest . "
Nelson 's e-mail did n't end there :
" We will then face the sentencing Court , who may reprimand us for arresting the offender and who will restore the offender to supervision , dismissing our violation .
We will then research a new address for compliance which will require a web search of Google Earth , the county website , GPS mapping , Children and Families Day Care website , and a personal visit to measure 1,000 ft. as the crow flies , 2,500 ft. for ordinance compliance , and about 2 - 3 hours of officer time and travel expense only to find that the location is not in compliance .
" Collectively , we have exhausted all efforts to locate affordable motels , rooming houses , street corners , abandoned junk cars , or any other location that could serve as a residence for sex offenders that are not in violation of the 1,000 foot law or any ordinance ....
We are requesting guidance and direction from the department , the Courts , the legislature , or anyone else who would address the homeless sex offender problem . "
That guidance would n't come anytime soon .
Meanwhile probation officers came up with a location for the offenders that state , county , and municipal ordinances could n't touch .
They were ordered to report to the Julia Tuttle Causeway or go to jail .
They complied .
On average , a new sex offender has arrived under the Julia Tuttle every week since April .
Enrique Ortiz was 13 years old when he acquired the status of sex offender for life .
According to state prosecutors , Ortiz , armed with a flare gun , forced his way into an apartment on the 900 block of NW 28th Street in which two preteens were present and , after stealing jewelry and clothing from their mother 's bedroom , forced them into a closet , where he allegedly forced one child to perform oral sex on him .
The case was far from straightforward .
After the crime , investigators combed the neighborhood and found Charles Jackson , who was in possession of a piece of the stolen jewelry .
Jackson said the ring had been given to him by Ortiz .
Jackson was not arrested , detained , or questioned further .
Instead police hunted down the adolescent Ortiz , arrested him , and charged him with 11 counts , including burglary , kidnapping , and sexual battery .
Ortiz , now 29 years old , says he 's innocent .
" Charles ?
He was the one who did it .
I was small ; he used me to go through the bars .
I broke in , yeah , but then I waited for him outside . "
Guilty or not , it was n't a sex offense that landed Ortiz under the bridge .
After spending eight years in jail for a burglary , he 'd lived in Miami since 2003 with a spotless record until , this past June , he was caught riding a scooter without a license in Miami Beach .
The officer , seeing Ortiz was a registered sex offender , took him to jail and , the cop claimed , found three Ecstasy pills on him — a violation of Ortiz 's probation .
The sentence : two years of state supervision , under the bridge .
When Ortiz arrived , he found the situation intolerable .
" I was like , ' You know what ?
Fuck this .
If I gotta be here , I 'm gonna live comfortable . ' "
The handsome Puerto Rican keeps his head and face clean - shaven , and he is always well dressed .
He has an easy , charismatic personality , and cuts a lean and muscular figure , walking around under the bridge as if it were the backdrop to a photo shoot : shirtless , his Yankees cap tilted to the side , implausibly still - club - worthy jeans sagging suggestively low at the waist .
" I 'm a beach boy , " he affirms with pride .
Ortiz is also tough .
He holds an unnervingly steady gaze , a look that can be commanding .
Quietly , subtly , he 's the boss .
( Sometimes not - so - subtly — he gave one of the guys a black eye recently when he thought the offender had n't been chipping in enough for electricity . )
Ortiz took charge and set about transforming the area into a livable space .
He claimed a hefty quarter of the concrete shelf below the bridge for himself .
He set up a sleeping area , a closet , and a 12 - foot living room , replete with an entertainment center , a pantry , and — the centerpiece — a big , comfy pink love seat .
Ortiz , who is gay , built wooden rafters not only on the ground but also among gaps in the cement ceiling , on top of which he stores his possessions , and below which his shirts hang neatly from wire hangers .
It was Ortiz who bought the generator , Ortiz who bought the lights , the wood , the TV set , and the water cooler buckets the men use as showers .
Ortiz is house fisherman and head chef .
Occasionally he has cooked meals for the entire encampment .
" When I first got here , nobody was motivated to do nothing but burn shit .
All they did was burn crap and wood and all that .
And drink .
Bonfires and drinking , and always in the darkness ... , " he says .
" Then I started saying , ' I want to build this and this and this ' ... I brought life to this place . "
On a trip to get water from a recently discovered spigot , Ortiz says , " It pisses [ probation officers ] off to see people like me .
You put a person in this type of predicament , and what you actually are trying to do is break their spirit .
Just like a dog — you put a dog in a cage , you break his spirit ... but little did they know they had somebody who was already adjusted to this situation .
I 've been on the streets since I was 12 ....
I live flexible to life , you know , because you never know where you 're going to end up . "
" The Bridge Man , " as the offenders call probation officer Benito Casal , noted with uncharacteristic alarm the rapidly increasing population .
In a July 7 e-mail to superiors , Casal wrote about showing up at the Julia Tuttle only to be accosted by a bridge dweller who demanded to know " ' who the hell was sending all these sex offenders here . '
He stated there are eight sex offenders residing under the bridge , and there is no more room here for them . "
Casal was further distressed by the presence of a couple with a young girl , who were there to fish .
Casal told the family that the people under the bridge were sex offenders .
Upset at the comment , the mother of one offender — who had moved to the bridge to take care of her son — lashed out at Casal .
The situation escalated , and he threatened to call police .
Eventually things quieted down , Casal wrote , but he ended his e-mail on an ominous note : " In dealing with the sex offenders in the Julia Tuttle Causeway , I have noticed some of them are becoming more hostile .
I believe this is because of their living conditions [ and ] the amount of sex offenders that are under the bridge ....
I believe the situation that presently exists in the Julia Tuttle Causeway is a recipe for disaster , and it is only a matter of time until a very serious incident occurs out there .
I am requesting that management advise the probation officers in Circuit 11 not to send any more homeless sex offenders to the Julia Tuttle Causeway . "
Since then , the number of sex offenders under the bridge has doubled .
Increasing numbers of inhabitants have , like Ortiz , been out of prison for years , living and working without incident , until they violated probation ( sometimes for something as simple as forgetting to re-register ) , were taken to jail , and then sent under the bridge .
Nearly half the men would be out of here in a heartbeat if residency restrictions did n't prohibit them from living with their families .
While still on probation , interior designer Ricardo ( not his real name ) lived in an apartment in Miami , traveled regularly for work , and lived without incident until he violated probation by staying away from Miami - Dade longer than a judge had allowed him .
He was sent under the bridge .
Now he sleeps in the back of his pickup , leaving every morning at 6 a.m. and driving to his sister 's house in Hollywood , where he showers , eats breakfast , and cleans up for a day of work .
He has maintained freelance work despite having to inform each of his employers of his offense , molesting a close relative .
Each evening he returns to his sister 's house for dinner , waiting as long as he can before going back to the bridge to climb into the bed of his trunk and sleep .
Another of Ricardo 's sisters agreed to speak about her brother .
" It was very hard for me , especially because I have children — my girl is 12 and my son is 10 , " she says , asking that her name be withheld .
" But I still think he has the right to be able to make it , and to get back into society to be a productive human being . "
When bridge dweller Kevin Morales was released from prison , his daughter — who was also his victim — sought permission from the judge to maintain a relationship with her father .
" I can see it from both ends , and I do n't think anybody could be more credible to talk about it than me , " says Sandy ( she declined to give her real name ) .
" If my father was n't a decent and hard - working man , and he did n't have his family to support him , I 'm sure he would have wanted to escape from that bridge .
But he 's not like that .
He wants to be a part of society and have a job and a family like everyone else . "
Offender Steven Gilley is joined every night by his brother , who sleeps under the bridge at least three times a week .
" My brother , he was a nerdy type — he 's not streetwise and all that , " he explains .
" My mama 's 72 years old and she was worried about him .
I said , ' Mama , I 'll take care of him . '
We already offered him a home , but they turned him down .
I got two kids , and I trust him .
And they love their uncle . "
The oldest offender is 82 - year - old Manuel Perea , an arrival of just a few weeks ago .
Perea , who is deaf , was sent to live under the Julia Tuttle after being arrested for his second sex offense , allegedly fondling three children while handing them a puppy on the street .
He was fitted with a GPS unit , but can barely hear someone screaming into his ear , let alone the soft beeping of the box .
About a third of the men are harnessed with GPS monitors — despite the fact that they have no regular access to electricity to charge the batteries .
If the generator is working , Ortiz usually obliges ; otherwise the men either allow their boxes to shut down — technically a violation of their probations that could land them in jail — or resort to more extreme measures .
One offender sometimes walks across the causeway to Wendy's , where he surreptitiously charges his box from a booth .
" What are you going to do with an 82 - year - old guy who 's a dirty old man ? " says his lawyer , Ted Mastos , a former circuit court judge and state prosecutor .
" The guy 's got a problem — he 's done it before .
He 's a problem , we recognize that , and that 's the reason we entered a plea .
But in our wildest dreams we never thought this would have happened ....
His son is a very responsible guy and he 's done yeoman service to try and find a place for his father , " Mastos says .
" And now an 82 - year - old man has to die under a bridge , and nobody cares . "
Manuel Perea walks a mile and a half along the causeway every night with slow , painstaking steps , carefully lifting his legs over the railing and descending under the bridge , politely waving a large wrinkled hand at the rest of the bridge dwellers as he passes by .
Each night he slowly unpacks his bedding , lays it out on a concrete block , and goes to sleep .
In the mornings , it takes him more than a half - hour to pack up the bedding .
" How the fuck can they put an 82 - year - old man down here ? "
Ricardo asks one night , as the old man walks by , waving as usual .
" That first night he got here , I hear beep beep beep ....
I go , ' Fuck , it 's the old man . '
He can't even hear the box when it 's right next to him . "
" It 's comedy , " Ricardo murmurs , watching the old man 's retreating shadow .
" It 's comedy and tragedy at the same time . "
State and local leaders have taken turns abdicating responsibility for the problem of homeless sex offenders — that is , sex offenders made homeless by local law .
Politicians have dumped it , whenever possible , back and forth onto one other like a game of hot potato .
Dermer set the tune , passing the potato unapologetically to the county , which promptly dumped it , piping - hot , into the lap of probation officers .
Behind the scenes , corrections officials tried on numerous occasions to get City of Miami and county officials to take responsibility for a situation that had resulted mostly from their own legislation .
On April 13 of this year , DOC secretary Jim McDonough sent a letter to Miami Mayor Manny Diaz and County Commissioners Bruno Barreiro and Rebecca Sosa ( the latter had cosponsored the 2,500 - foot ordinance , along with Commissioner Pepe Diaz ) , proposing the formation of a joint committee to address the problem .
The task force that eventually convened issued a memorandum addressing homeless released prisoners in general , but not sex offenders in particular .
In fact the problem of housing sex offenders is barely noted in the document , and no mention at all is made of the Julia Tuttle Causeway .
Ron Book , who chaired the task force , dismisses the idea that the 2,500 - foot ordinance has failed the county .
As for the men under the bridge , he answers , " I would say to you that is not the ideal solution , but ...
I 'm not sure that 20 is any demonstration of failure at all . "
Book is right :
There are other places sex offenders can live .
On Krome Avenue in Northwest Miami - Dade — past the vacant lots , junkyards , and farms — sits a small , rundown trailer park , inhabited mostly by Mexican families , laborers , and agricultural workers .
Three sex offenders are registered as living there .
Far from any school , park , playground , or daycare center , the location might seem ideal .
Except for one thing :
Every day , around 3 p.m. , a dozen women gather in front of the park to wait for a dusty yellow school bus to drop off their children .
They scream and squirm their way to their mothers ' sides and walk away with them , hand in hand .
Asked if the 2,500 - foot ordinance is pushing sex offenders into poor communities , Book pauses .
" I do n't have to like it , " he says .
" Look , I do n't have all the solutions . "
Commissioner Sosa refuses to revisit the ordinance .
" I feel that I helped create a solution , " she insists .
Asked if she knows how many men are living under the bridge , she answers , " Yes , many .
" I guess that at some point , the system will have to address that issue , " she concedes with vague cheerfulness .
" But I am not ready to address that issue .
Maybe another commissioner should address that issue ....
Your question is : Am I going to do something ?
The answer is no . "
Since tighter sex offender laws sprung up across the nation in the wake of Miami - Dade 's , a number of challenges have followed .
In January 2006 , public defenders and state prosecutors in Iowa joined forces and issued a statement calling for the repeal of the state 's 2,000 - foot residency restriction , which , they said , " does not provide the protection that was originally intended . "
In Florida , the ground is moving under our feet .
Weston , which has a 2,500 - foot ordinance , settled in a suit in September brought by Thomas Lacorraza , a 23 - year - old sex offender who was fined for living at his grandparents ' house after being released .
In the end , the city said he could stay .
Lacorraza 's lawyer , Chris Mancini , is currently representing another offender — 25 - year - old Lee Chang , convicted of having sex ( consensual , Mancini says ) with a girl in her early teens — who was told he could not live with his mother , and was sent instead to live under a bridge in Miramar , where he sleeps in his car .
In July , Fort Lauderdale probation officers came up with six different bridges to which they planned to assign sex offenders on a rotational basis .
" When you have bad laws , you see ridiculous outcomes , " says Mancini .
At least two challenges to Miami - Dade 's ordinance are already brewing .
On November 7 , the Public Defender 's Office filed a memo in support of a motion to declare the county ordinance unconstitutional and pre-empted by state law .
The ACLU is looking into challenging the law as well .
There is abundant evidence that residency restrictions do nothing to reduce sex crimes against children .
For one thing , the vast majority of sex offenses are not committed by strangers : According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , nine of 10 victims under the age of 18 know their abusers , and 34 percent were family members .
And while residency restrictions target those who have already offended , most sex offenses — 87 percent — are committed by individuals with no prior records .
On top of that , there is reason to believe that residency restrictions actually push sex offenders further underground .
" We know that criminals are more likely to resume a life of crime when they have instability in their life , when they lack social and family support , and when they lack employment , " points out Jill Levenson , an assistant professor of human services at Lynn University in Boca Raton .
Florida DOC statistics chart a steady increase in the number of sex offenders who have fled probation and whose whereabouts are now unknown .
Statewide , the number of absconders has tripled in the past three years , but in Miami - Dade , the increase is almost tenfold since the 2,500 - foot ordinance went into effect in 2005 .
In that year , the DOC recorded three absconders ; this year so far , at least 22 sex offenders have gone missing in Miami - Dade .
At least two of the those were assigned to the Julia Tuttle .
Carlos DeNacimiento , who pleaded guilty to raping a 10 - year - old girl , and Humberto Danetra , convicted of exposing himself to two 13 - year - old boys , were , like the others , assigned to live under the causeway upon their release from prison .
Unlike the others , they declined to do so .
Both offenders told their probation officers they would report to the location ; neither was seen again .
" Sometimes there 's a perception that those of us who oppose residency laws are advocating for sex offenders , " Levenson says .
" We 're all on the same side — which is the side of public safety . "
Around 7 p.m. on a recent Sunday , a car pulls in under the bridge and a rare thing happens : A woman steps out .
Bending down and reaching across the driver 's seat , she straightens up again with an armful of supplies — a small cooler , paper plates , and a package wrapped in plastic .
The bundle nearly reaches her chin .
It 's Big Man 's wife .
Since arriving a week ago , Big Man has made a place for himself under the bridge .
He sleeps on a mottled white sofa that abuts Ricky Ortiz 's side of the shelf .
He has set up his things — a few pairs of shoes , a stack of clean clothes , some toiletries , a microwave , and a tattered Bible .
Big Man's wife smiles as he climbs down the ladder , smiling back , and takes large , bounding steps toward her .
They embrace , and then his eyes move from hers to the food .
" Go heat it up in the microwave , " she tells him .
He relieves her of the bundle and dutifully mounts the ladder again .
" He done tore up three pairs of shoes , ' cause he gotta climb up and down this wall here , and that 's something he 's not used to — he 's a heavy man .
So I had to get some rubber shoes so he can go up and down , " she says , watching his clumsy ascent .
Big Man 's wife ( both requested that their names be withheld ) is neatly dressed , with an ample frame and a soft face .
One front tooth is capped in gold , and when she smiles , it flashes .
As soon as Big Man vanishes into the gloom above the embankment , her smile disappears with him .
" Look at this place ! " she says angrily .
" There 's no running water to take a shower ; there 's no toilets ....
My husband can't work now ; nobody 's going to hire him .
So I have to do the providing . "
She drives down from her job in Boca Raton almost every night to take care of her husband .
" I come down here , I do his laundry , make sure he 's got a hot meal — because he can't cook .
How 's he gonna eat ? "
Big Man emerges from the darkness and descends the ladder , paper plate in hand , gnawing on a chicken wing .
His wife eyes the food disapprovingly : " Look how my baby got to eat — everything dried out from the microwave . "
Later the couple climbs into her car and drives over to the water .
They reappear after 15 minutes , when Big Man hops out , grabs the cooler , and vanishes with his wife back into the shadows .
" Big Man 's getting cookie , " someone says cheerfully .
A few weeks ago , the generator conked out .
Wiese and Ortiz took it apart , piece by piece , until they had dismantled it entirely .
They put it back together , and it still did n't work .
Eventually Ortiz was able to make good on the manufacturer 's warranty and wrangle a new one , but on a recent night , most of the bridge is shrouded in darkness anyway ; everyone has run out of money to pay for gas .
The mood is glum .
Wiese sports a black eye that Ortiz gave him — a money dispute , Wiese says .
Big Man has finished off a decent amount of vodka , and the roar of his profanities echoes off the concrete from all directions .
" I 'm getting real tired of that guy , " one man mumbles wearily as he sits on a crate beside his tent , staring idly at a candle and drinking a Miller High Life .
" That 's my last one , " he says , nodding at the candle .
" When that bitch goes out ... "
On top of everything , another offender arrived tonight .
His parents had driven him under the bridge and spent the afternoon building him a little wooden house with a canvas roof .
He 's still in shock , the men say .
Hugo Chavez has slammed Venezuelans ' growing penchant for celebrating their daughters ' coming - of - age by stumping up for breast implants , Reuters reports .
The prez 's countrymen / women have apparently developed quite a taste for western - style consumerism , and in particular coughing thousands of dollars for Bulgarian airbags which they flaunt with unashamed pride as twin examples of their affluence .
What 's particularly offended Chavez , however , is that Venezuelans come of age at 15 , which means thousands of señoritas queuing up to go under the knife before they 've even grown out of their Barbies .
Chavez thundered on his weekly TV show : " Now some people think , ' My daughter 's turning 15 , let 's give her breast enlargements . '
That 's horrible .
It 's the ultimate degeneration . "
And speaking of Barbie , Chavez also had a pop at " Western - imposed consumerist icons such as Barbie dolls " .
Chavez hopes that Venezuelans will repent their spendthrift ways and has " told his supporters to give away any extra goods they do not need , urging them to leave out in town squares items such as fans or refrigerators " .
Some hope , we reckon , although we think we may have found a solution to the implant outrage .
Were Chavez - who recently announced the country would shift its time zone by half an hour , apparently just to piss off the US - simply to declare that all Venezuelan females become 18 on their 15th birthday , he might find the whole thing less morally repugnant . ®
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The conflict in Afghanistan has reached “ crisis proportions ” , with the resurgent Taliban present in more than half the country and closing in on Kabul , a report said on Wednesday .
Canadian soldiers from the NATO - led coalition unload supplies in the Taliban heartland of Sangisar in the Zhari district of Kandahar province , southern Afghanistan , November 18 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Finbarr O'Reilly
If NATO , the lead force operating in Afghanistan , is to have any impact against the insurgency , troop numbers will have to be doubled to at least 80,000 , the report said .
“ The Taliban has shown itself to be a truly resurgent force , ” the Senlis Council , an independent think - tank with a permanent presence in Afghanistan , wrote in a study entitled “ Stumbling into Chaos : Afghanistan on the brink ” .
“ Its ability to establish a presence throughout the country is now proven beyond doubt , ” it said .
“ The insurgency now controls vast swaths of unchallenged territory including rural areas , some district centers , and important road arteries . ”
Senlis said its research had established that the Taliban , driven out of Afghanistan by the U.S. invasion in late 2001 , had rebuilt a permanent presence in 54 percent of the country and was finding it easy to recruit new followers .
It was also increasingly using Iraq - style tactics , such as roadside and suicide bombs , to powerful effect , and had built a stable network of financial support , funding its operations with the proceeds from Afghanistan ’s booming opium trade .
“ It is a sad indictment of the current state of Afghanistan that the question now appears to be not if the Taliban will return to Kabul , but when , ” the report said .
“ Their oft - stated aim of reaching the city in 2008 appears more viable than ever . ”
TROOP BOOST
NATO has a little over 40,000 troops operating in Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force .
The United States and Britain are the largest contributors , with 15,000 and 7,700 soldiers , respectively .
Those numbers pale in comparison to Iraq where at the peak of operations there were nearly 200,000 troops on the ground and where around 160,000 remain .
While Iraq is showing the first signs of an improvement in security , Afghanistan ’s situation is becoming more precarious , Senlis argued , underlining the need for a rapid increase in troop numbers in a country that is larger than Iraq .
“ In order to prevent NATO ’s defeat at the hands of the Taliban , a rejuvenated ‘ coalition of the willing ’ is needed , ” the report said , calling the proposal ‘ NATO Plus ’ .
“ Every NATO state is mandated to contribute to this new force , with a firm level of commitment that will provide a total force size of 80,000 . ”
Bolstering NATO ’s presence in Afghanistan , and getting member countries to contribute more , is expected to be a major issue on the agenda at a NATO summit in Romania in April .
Before then , Britain , which is responsible for security in the restive south of Afghanistan , where violence has been greatest , is expected to unveil new security strategies , including a possible increase in troops and proposals to deter Afghan poppy farmers from selling their crop to the Taliban .
Senlis said that without the troop “ surge ” , and renewed efforts to win over the Afghan population and make reconstruction take hold , the country was in danger of falling back into the hands of the Taliban .

Drugs could be banned from certain situations , like exams for instance
According to the British Medical Association , we must at least start thinking about the ethics of altering the organ which is so central to our being before there is no turning back .
The theory is this : if people are already willing to undergo the risks of plastic surgery in search of the perfect body , who is to suggest they would not do the same to better their brains .
Scientists are painting a picture of a time when toddlers pop pills on the way to playgroup while employees are forced to quaff various cocktails to boost their productivity .
But sinister as that may sound , the benefits could be immense .
A world where everyone is that much brighter might not just make for more enlightened conversation , it could accelerate the quest for a cure for cancer or an end to famine .
" We need to balance the benefits against the risks , " says Dr Vivienne Nathanson , head of ethics at the BMA .
" We 're not making any recommendations - but we do want people to look up and engage with this issue before it becomes the norm and it's too late to do anything about it . "
Something fishy
This is no longer a theoretical debate : to a certain extent it is already happening .
Fish oil is already widely available and handed out to children by parents who have been told it could improve school performance by prolonging attention .
The original purpose of medicine is , after all , to heal the sick , not to turn healthy people into God
Francis Fukuyama
Philosopher
At one stage the government was thought to be considering giving it to all schoolchildren , but the Food Standards Agency then reported that the justification for doing so was limited : the evidence that fish oil works in this way is as yet thin .
A much touted trial of County Durham schoolchildren , in which all GCSE pupils were encouraged to take the supplement in the run up to exams last summer , seems to have been quietly forgotten .
The exam results improved , but they have done for the last five years and the percentage climb was actually smaller than the year before .
So parents , according to anecdotal evidence at least , are looking for something stronger .
Medicines such as ritalin , used to improve concentration in the growing number of children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder , can also improve brain function in children without such a diagnosis .
And it can be obtained on the internet .
Buying a brain
The BMA panel says we have to prepare for a time when these drugs are potentially as readily available as the fish oil supplements you now get from the supermarkets .
Safety concerns may not be enough to regulate supply , especially as advances mean side effects , at least in the short term , are increasingly limited , and these drugs may become a standard part of school life .
For those who can afford them .
Aside from the ethical considerations of pumping children full of drugs , questions of equality are raised , as equal access is unlikely .
But then what 's new , one might reasonably ask .
Richer parents are already able to spend over the odds to buy a property in the catchment area of a good school or to educate their offspring privately .
Extra tuition puts their children ahead , while private music , tennis and drama lessons enrich their lives .
MIND IMPROVING DRUGS INCLUDE : Methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) Donepezil ( Aricept ) Modafinil ( Provigil )
Drugs could be the obvious next step to secure that prestigious university place in an ever more competitive world .
And having glided from a top institution into the best jobs going , this generation might face a lifetime of medication .
Why you may not need much brain power to pack toothpaste caps , there are clear advantages for everyone in boosting the brain power of those in jobs with great responsibility .
A study of pilots for instance found those who had taken the Alzheimer 's drug Donepezil were much more adept at carrying out complex tasks in a flight simulator than those who had not .
Doctors on long shifts may be able to save more lives if their attention was improved by an effective stimulant , the BMA paper suggests , while such medication might even become compulsory for politicians if it were proven that it could lead to better reasoned decisions on issues of national importance .
All in the mind ?
But the power of these drugs and even more extreme techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation , which kick - starts certain parts of the brain , may be overestimated for healthy people .
After all , cognitive function is not the be all and end all .
Everyone knows an intelligent slacker or a lifelong underachiever .
Drugs or brain massage are never going to replace the necessity of hard studying for those who crave success , even if they make the process easier .
There may also be long term consequences .
Our brains currently have the power to filter out memories that are trivial or traumatic , but drugs may impair this , leaving us either plagued by nightmares or bored to death by insignificant incidents .
But most importantly , we need to work out how we feel about the moral dimension of this debate , the BMA insists , and the very question of making drugs available which make " normal " people become " better " people .
We may find we end up agreeing with the philosopher and ardent foe of mind enhancement , Francis Fukuyama , who wants such drugs strictly regulated .
" The original purpose of medicine is , after all , to heal the sick , " he says , " not to turn healthy people into God . "
Design patterns are useful .
They enable us as developers to encapsulate recurring interactions and refine them .
From simple pagination right up to Ajax requests , patterns allow us to codify common conventions .
Inevitably , conventions can lead to a cargo cult mentality .
Clients start to request Web 2.0 standards .
I have no idea what that means but it usually involves tagging , “ friends ” and gratuitous use of JavaScript .
This kind of copycat development is n’t so bad if you ’re ripping off a site like Flickr — the more sites like Flickr , the better .
The problems start when web apps start replicating bad design patterns as if they were viruses .
I want to call attention to the most egregious of these anti-patterns .
Allowing users to import contact lists from other services is a useful feature .
But the means have to justify the ends .
Empowering the user to import data through an authentication layer like OAuth is the correct way to export data .
On the other hand , asking users to input their email address and password from a third - party site like GMail or Yahoo Mail is completely unacceptable .
Here ’s why :
It teaches people how to be phished .
This issue was raised by at Fundamentos Web. — was quick to back Tantek ’s position .
While we ca n’t protect people from themselves , we have a duty not to deceive them into thinking that throwing passwords around like confetti is acceptable behaviour .
Oh , do n’t worry … the terms of service for Google accounts puts the responsibility in the hands of the user :
Your passwords and account security 6.1
You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services .
6.2 Accordingly , you agree that you will be solely responsible to Google for all activities that occur under your account .
… but this is n’t a question of legalities .
I was somewhat surprised , even shocked , to see 37 Signals highlight this anti-pattern on Facebook as a smart way to connect members of the site .
was quick to point out the problem :
The Facebook thing is n’t a smart way of connecting members , it ’s a horrible precedent that teaches users to be phished .
Unfortunately that kind of feature is so prevalent now that you ’d be foolish to launch a new social network without it , but from an ethical point of view it ’s distinctly unpleasant .
He ’s right .
The issue for us as developers is a moral question .
Do we blindly follow the dictates of clients looking to “ add value ” to their applications even when we know that the long - term effect is corrosive ?
I do n’t think we should .
We can collectively make a choice not to erode the long - term stability of our users ’ data .
Sure , the particular site you ’re working on might not have any nefarious plans and the next site might claim to be secure , but over time we ’re creating a climate conducive to cultivating honeypots .
Morality ( or ethics ) is not something that ’s usually discussed alongside Web development .
But pointed me towards this great quote from Jamais Cascio ’s talk at the Singularity Summity that illustrates the underlying truth :
To put it bluntly , software , like all technologies , is inherently political .
Even the most disruptive technologies , the innovations and ideas that can utterly transform society , carry with them the legacies of past decisions , the culture and history of the societies that spawned them .
Code inevitably reflects the choices , biases and desires of its creators .
So here ’s what I ’m going to do : even if it costs me a contract in the short - term , I will refuse to implement any kind of interface that involves asking the user for a password from a third - party site .
I urge you to do the same .
And if you feel equally strongly about this , make your thoughts known : blog about it , talk about it … you might even want to make your position clear in your terms and conditions .
As the Naked Yak blog so eloquently puts it :
With the endless possibilities of the social web it is easy to fall into the trap of going for broke , applying everything in life to a particular application or piece of software that seems to enhance it .
From now , I will always ask the question “ Will this have a positive effect on my world ? ” rather than “ What could I pull into this new tool ? ”
Update :
For all the people saying yeah , but no , but yeah , but we need access to users ’ data , please read the post again and this time , pay attention to the part about OAuth .
See also :
I do n’t know how much clearer I can make this : the end result of exporting data is desirable ; teaching users to hand over their passwords to any site that asks for them is not .
There is no excuse for asking for a third - party password on your website .
You ’re doing it wrong .
That authentication must happen on the third - party site .
A couple of weeks ago , Fred Wilson wrote , in The Mid Life Entrepreneur Crisis “ … prime time entrepreneurship is 30s .
And its possibly getting younger as web technology meets youth culture . ”
After some followup from Valleywag , he addressed the question at greater length in The Age Question ( continued ) , saying “ I do n’t totally buy that age matters .
I think , as I said in my original post , that age is a mind set . ”
This is a relief for people like me — you ’re as young as you feel , and all that — or rather it would be a relief but for one little problem :
Fred was right before , and he ’s wrong now .
Young entrepreneurs have an advantage over older ones ( and by older I mean over 30 ) , and contra Fred ’s second post , age is n’t in fact a mindset .
Young people have an advantage that older people do n’t have and can’t fake , and it is n’t about vigor or hunger — it ’s a mental advantage .
The principal asset a young tech entrepreneur has is that they do n’t know a lot of things .
In almost every other circumstance , this would be a disadvantage , but not here , and not now .
The reason this is so ( and the reason smart old people ca n’t fake their way into this asset ) has everything to do with our innate ability to cement past experience into knowledge .
Probability and the Crisis of Novelty
The classic illustration for learning outcomes based on probability uses a bag of colored balls .
Imagine that you can take out one ball , record its color , put it back , and draw again .
How long does it take you to form an opinion about the contents of the bag , and how correct is that opinion ?
Imagine a bag of black and white balls , with a slight majority of white .
Drawing out a single ball would provide little information beyond “ There is at least one white ( or black ) ball in this bag . ”
If you drew out ten balls in a row , you might guess that there are a similar number of black and white balls .
A hundred would make you relatively certain of that , and might give you an inkling that white slightly outnumbers black .
By a thousand draws , you could put a rough percentage on that imbalance , and by ten thousand draws , you could say something like “ 53 % white to 47 % black ” with some confidence .
This is the world most of us live in , most of the time ; the people with the most experience know the most .
But what would happen if the contents of the bag changed overnight ?
What if the bag suddenly started yielding balls of all colors and patterns — black and white but also green and blue , striped and spotted ?
The next day , when the expert draws a striped ball , he might well regard it as a mere anomaly .
After all , his considerable experience has revealed a predictable and stable distribution over tens of thousands of draws , so no need to throw out the old theory because of just one anomaly .
( To put it in Bayesian terms , the prior beliefs of the expert are valuable precisely because they have been strengthened through repetition , which repetition makes the expert confident in them even in the face of a small number of challenging cases . )
But the expert keeps drawing odd colors , and so after a while , he is forced to throw out the ‘ this is an anomaly , and the bag is otherwise as it was ’ theory , and start on a new one , which is that some novel variability has indeed entered the system .
Now , the expert thinks , we have a world of mostly black and white , but with some new colors as well .
But the expert is still wrong .
The bag changed overnight , and the new degree of variation is huge compared to the older black - and - white world .
Critically , any attempt to rescue the older theory will cause the expert to misunderstand the world , and the more carefully the expert relies on the very knowledge that constitutes his expertise , the worse his misunderstanding will be .
Meanwhile , on the morning after the contents of the bag turn technicolor , someone who just showed up five minutes ago would say “ Hey , this bag has lots of colors and patterns in it . ”
While the expert is still trying to explain away or minimize the change as a fluke , or as a slight adjustment to an otherwise stable situation , the novice , who has no prior theory to throw out , understands exactly what ’s going on .
What our expert should have done , the minute he saw the first odd ball , is to say “ I must abandon everything I have ever thought about how this bag works , and start from scratch . ”
He should , in other words , start behaving like a novice .
Which is exactly the thing he — we — cannot do .
We are wired to learn from experience .
This is , in almost all cases , absolutely the right strategy , because most things in life benefit from mental continuity .
Again , today , gravity pulls things downwards .
Again , today , I get hungry and need to eat something in the middle of the day .
Again , today , my wife will be happier if I put my socks in the hamper than on the floor .
We do n’t need to re-learn things like this ; once we get the pattern , we can internalize it and move on .
A Lot of Knowledge Is A Dangerous Thing
This is where Fred ’s earlier argument comes in .
In 999,999 cases , learning from experience is a good idea , but what entrepreneurs do is look for the one in a million shot .
When the world really has changed overnight , when wild new things are possible if you do n’t have any sense of how things used to be , then it is the people who got here five minutes ago who understand that new possibility , and they understand it precisely because , to them , it is n’t new .
These cases , let it be said , are rare .
The mistakes novices make come from a lack of experience .
They overestimate mere fads , seeing revolution everywhere , and they make this kind of mistake a thousand times before they learn better .
But the experts make the opposite mistake , so that when a real once - in - a - lifetime change comes along , they are at risk of regarding it as a fad .
As a result of this asymmetry , the novice makes their one good call during an actual revolution , at exactly the same time the expert makes their one big mistake , but at that moment , that ’s all that is needed to give the newcomer a considerable edge .
Here ’s a tech history question :
Which went mainstream first , the PC or the VCR ?
People over 35 have a hard time even understanding why you ’d even ask — VCRs obviously pre-date PCs for general adoption .
Here ’s another :
Which went mainstream first , the radio or the telephone ?
The same people often have to think about this question , even though the practical demonstration of radio came almost two decades after the practical demonstration of the telephone .
We have to think about that second question because , to us , radio and the telephone arrived at the same time , which is to say the day we were born .
And for college students today , that is true of the VCR and the PC .
People who think of the VCR as old and stable , and the PC as a newer invention , are not the kind of people who think up Tivo .
It ’s people who are presented with two storage choices , tape or disk , without historical bias making tape seem more normal and disk more provisional , who do that kind of work , and those people are , overwhelmingly , young .
This is sad for a lot of us , but its also true , and Fred ’s kind lies about age being a mind set wo n’t reverse that .
The Uses of Experience
I ’m old enough to know a lot of things , just from life experience .
I know that music comes from stores .
I know that you have to try on pants before you buy them .
I know that newspapers are where you get your political news and how you look for a job .
I know that if you want to have a conversation with someone , you call them on the phone .
I know that the library is the most important building on a college campus .
I know that if you need to take a trip , you visit a travel agent .
In the last 15 years or so , I ’ve had to unlearn every one of those things and a million others .
This makes me a not - bad analyst , because I have to explain new technology to myself first —
I ’m too old to understand it natively .
But it makes me a lousy entrepreneur .
Ten years ago , I was the CTO of a web company we built and sold in what seemed like an eon but what was in retrospect an eyeblink .
Looking back , I ’m embarrassed at how little I knew , but I was a better entrepreneur because of it .
I can take some comfort in the fact that people much more successful than I succumb to the same fate .
IBM learned , from decades of experience , that competitive advantage lay in the hardware ; Bill Gates had never had those experiences , and did n’t have to unlearn them .
Jerry and David at Yahoo learned , after a few short years , that search was a commodity .
Sergey and Larry never knew that .
Mark Cuban learned that the infrastructure required for online video made the economics of web video look a lot like TV .
That memo was never circulated at YouTube .
So what can you do when you get kicked out of the club ?
My answer has been to do the things older and wiser people do .
I teach , I write , I consult , and when I work with startups , it ’s as an advisor , not as a founder .
And the hardest discipline , whether talking to my students or the companies I work with , is to hold back from offering too much advice , too definitively .
When I see students or startups thinking up something crazy , and I want to explain why that wo n’t work , could n’t possibly work , why this recapitulates the very argument that led to RFC 939 back in the day , I have to remind myself to shut up for a minute and just watch , because it may be me who will be surprised when I see what color comes out of the bag next .

U.S. intelligence services attempted to influence political policy by releasing their assessment that concludes Iran halted its nuclear arms program in 2003 , said John Bolton , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
Der Spiegel magazine quoted Bolton on Saturday as alleging that the aim of the National Intelligence Estimate , which contradicts his and President Bush ’s position , was not to provide the latest intelligence on Iran .
“ This is politics disguised as intelligence , ” Bolton was quoted as saying in an article appearing in this week ’s edition .
Bolton described the report , released Monday , as a “ quasi- putsch ” by the intelligence agencies , Der Spiegel said .

The intelligence estimate said Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program four years ago but was continuing to develop the technical means that could be used to produce a bomb .
This contradicted Bush ’s assertion that Iran was actively trying to develop a nuclear weapon .
The hawkish Bolton has long criticized Mohamed ElBaradei , head of the Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency , who has said that there was no hard evidence that Tehran was pursuing nuclear weapons .
ElBaradei said the report “ somewhat vindicated ” Iran , which has denied allegations that it was secretly trying to build nuclear weapons .
It says its nuclear program is to generate electricity .
Following the Republican debate last week CNBC placed a poll on their website asking visitors to cast their vote on which candidate they thought won the debate .
After a few hours Ron Paul had accumulated 75 % of the votes .
CNBC promptly took down the poll and left an “ Open Letter to the Ron Paul Faithful ” in its place .
We all know that American journalism and mass media is heavily skewed and censored , but this sort of one - way media manipulation just irritates me … and I ’m not even a diehard Ron Paul supporter .
One of my good friends , Nick , is a diehard Ron Paul supporter , so he emailed the following letter directly to CNBC .
Even though this is off - topic for my blog , I feel strongly that Nick ’s letter should see the light of day beyond some CNBC executive ’s email trash bin .
Dear Old Media ,
In response to your “ Open Letter to the Ron Paul Faithful , ” you only gave half of the story .
While many of the claims you made were not outright false , your analysis of the situation is incomplete .
First , let ’s stop with the childish implications of “ hacking ” .
Nobody is hacking anything and you know it .
Millions of Internet transactions take place securely every day that would be much juicier targets for hackers than a silly Old Media poll for which there is no gain and which is censored as soon as Ron Paul pulls ahead , as many of them have been – this is not the first .
Just admit that several thousand real people took the time to go to your website and vote in your poll .
The Ron Paul Faithful will admit to organizing to vote in your poll .
You claim this amounts to “ … a well - organized and committed ‘ few ’ [ throwing ] the results of a system meant to reflect the sentiments of ‘ the many ’ … ”
Perhaps , though I hope for the future of this great country and its future generations that we are a well - organized majority .
That point aside , your claim is hypocritical because this is exactly what the Old Media and the “ legitimate ” polling organizations ( as you call them ) have been doing all along .
The Old Media is itself the well - organized minority that is throwing the results for the majority through censorship , misleading data and half - truths .
Take for example the amount of questions and response time that Ron Paul is granted during these debates .
He is consistently granted the least amount of time out of all the candidates , despite polling higher and raising more funds than many of them .
Let us also examine the “ legitimate ” polls that you reference to imply that Ron Paul ’s support ca n’t be so high .
As you well know , these phone polls are unscientific and biased .
You are claiming that the opinions of a few hundred Republicans with land - line telephones represent the opinions of the majority .
Furthermore , the polling companies regularly leave candidates like Ron Paul off their list of poll choices , naming only “ mainstream ” candidates to choose from .
These polls that you swear by and reference so often represent the opinions of the majority no better than the poll that you took down when you did n’t like the results .
So who is the well - organized minority that is trying to sway the majority ?
Is it really us , a sincere group of citizens trying to get the word out concerning our candidate ?
Or is it you , an Old Media giant and biased polling community who tries to enforce their personal choices of “ mainstream ” candidates on the citizens of this country ?
We were not given equal voice in your format so we organized and took voice in our format , the Internet .
We ’d do it again .
The Old Media seems to have forgotten the meaning of , and it ’s responsibility to , unbiased journalism .
If you are going to present an editorial as news because it is more entertaining , you must strive to give equal time to all opinions .
Otherwise , just go back to reporting the facts and keep your predictions and opinions to yourselves .
When a well - organized few has such an effect on the opinions of the many and on the outcomes of our political process , I get very worried .
You do the entire nation a great disservice .
Sincerely ,
The Ron Paul Faithful
Paul :
He does n't even understand the difference between non- intervention and isolationism .
I am talking isolationism .
I am isolationist .
I want to trade with people , talk with people , travel .
But I do n't want to send troops overseas using force to tell them how to live .
We would object to it here and they 're going to object to us over there .
As the expiration date on the 1998 Internet tax ban draws near , pressure is on the Senate to compromise over just how long it will be extended .
If the moratorium is not extended , prices for Internet service nationwide could jump — as high as 17 percent , some ISPs claim — once November 1 rolls around .
" In a little over a month , Americans will be forced to pay more to access the Internet , receive e-mails on their BlackBerries and use the Internet on their cell phones if the Democratic leadership refuses to allow the Senate to debate and pass this legislation , " Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) proclaimed during hearings yesterday .
McCain is co-sponsor of a version of the bill that would make the moratorium permanent .
There is another version , the Internet Tax Freedom Extension Act of 2007 , sponsored by Senators Tom Carper ( D - DE ) and Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , that would extend the ban until October of 2011 .
The ban was originally instituted in 1998 and prohibited local and state governments from collecting tax on various types of Internet connection services ( ISPs , etc. ) .
This was done out of concern that a tax on Internet connections , particularly broadband , would significantly slow its adoption rate in the US and keep certain citizens disconnected for good .
The moratorium was extended in 2004 for three more years ; that act represented a compromise between those who wanted to extend it permanently and those who wanted a shorter extension .
At that time , however , taxes on VoIP services were approved due to growing concern over losing tax revenue from Internet - based phone services .
Naturally , ISPs favor a more permanent ban , as lower fees paid to the government would mean broader adoption and hence greater revenues .
In May , Verizon VP of State Tax Policy Annabelle Canning testified in favor of a permanent ban : " At a time when state and local economic development experts are touting broadband as critical to economic competitiveness , new taxes on Internet access could have a chilling effect on broadband investment , " said Canning .
The National Governors Association , on the other hand , favors a shorter extension along with a clause that would grandfather in states that had already been allowed to collect Internet taxes in 1998 — without such a clause , the Association argues that those states will lose up to $ 120 million per year in tax revenues under McCain 's proposal .
At this point , the deadline is only several weeks away and things look to be moving in the same direction as they were in 2004 .
No one could agree on whether to extend the moratorium permanently or temporarily , so they did so temporarily .
We get the feeling that such a " compromise " will happen this time around as well , and Congress will have to deal with the argument all over again in four years .
This is an amazing piece of technology , presented at a TED conference .
I really ca n’t explain it better than the video below .

Condoms have a long history in Japan , beginning with the earliest versions which were made from leather (! ) , tortoise shells (!! ) or even horns ( !!!)... is this where the expression " Are you horny ? " came from ?
Thankfully , condom technology has advanced to the point where 580 million condoms are sold each year in Japan and competition within the industry is , er , stiff .
Indeed , Japan boasts more condoms used per person per year than any other country .
To get ahead in the race for safe sex supremacy , Japanese consumers are being treated to innovative market thrusts that are by turns interesting , unusual and downright weird .
So , leave that poor turtle alone and come with us ( ahem ) , as we count down The Top 10 Weirdest Japanese Condoms !
10 ) Astrology Condoms , for those with Crystal Balls
This cute condom package evokes traditional Japanese themes to create a modern day version of the Floating World .
No telling if the actual condoms are styled to resemble the pair of piscine prophylactics on the package - or , for that matter , if they 're fish - flavored .
Hopefully not , on both counts .
( condom via Bibi's Box )
9 ) Candy is Dandy , but Condoms are a Girl 's Best Friend
The obvious thing to do , then , is to combine the best attributes of both ... but maybe it 's best to get your legal department 's OK before running off thousands of Kit Sack condoms .
Sure , have a break ... wait a minute , these are condoms !
And no , I refuse to make any " Hershey Highway " references , so let 's not even go there .
( condom via boingboing )
8 ) Fe + Male Condoms , for the Gender - Ambivalent or the Iron - Poor
Okamoto condoms is one of Japan 's leading brands , so you 'd think they 'd invest in an English - speaking copyeditor to proofread their new products .
These Fe + Male condoms are a case in point ... are they for males , females , Iron Man or what ??
My wife 's multivitamins have Fe+ on the bottle , so are these condoms iron - enriched as well ?
And if so , is there a problem with rusting ?

7 ) Designer Condoms by Radical Suzuki
Is that a Suzuki in your pocket , or are you just happy to see me ?
In the bedroom or in your wallet , count on Tokyo Art Condoms by Radical Suzuki to make a good impression - not just a circular one .
These look so good it seems a shame to rip them open .
Not only are the packages appealing , the condoms themselves are attractively tinted and pleasingly flavored in peach , melon and plain .
Plain ?

6 ) I thought Anime Otaku do n't get Dates ...
But on the off chance a fateful meeting of obsessed otaku - tachi or carnal cosplayers turns into something romantic , whip out your Gundam condoms !
Available in 4 different package designs , each featuring a different " condomonster " .
Gundam condoms ( try saying that six times quickly ) show that when nerds eventually do it , they do it in style !
( condom via Dannychoo )
5 ) Grace Condoms , for when Company comes ...
Advertisers have tried to give an upscale aura to condoms before , but are we really ready to see a box of them displayed alongside lamps , plants and other household brick - a- brack ?
Will the boss and his wife ( or her hubby ) be impressed with your good taste when they arrive for dinner & drinks ?
If not , could it lead to your dis - grace ?

What Really Slows Windows Down
The follow up experiment testing more software with improved benchmarks .
If you want to know what applications are slowing down your machine , check out this post .
Preamble
A week ago , I performed a study demonstrating how certain applications can slow down Windows .
If you did n’t catch it , I ’ll sum things up now .
I took a clean Virtual PC install of Windows XP Pro ( SP2a ) and installed Microsoft Boot Vis on it .
For those not in the know , Boot Vis is a tool that lets you time how long windows takes to start up .
It does a lot more , but I was n’t interested in any of that for the experiment .
I ’ve had a lot of feedback via email over it : mostly praise and suggestions for the next round - up .
Lots of people complained about me using Virtual PC .
The reason I chose it at the time is because I know from experience that VMWare is about 1000 times heavier on the host OS .
It installs drivers and system services all over the place and is generally unpleasant unless you need to use it all the time .
Most of the suggestions that filtered into my inbox were for other antivirus systems .
I ’ve added a bevy of different applications and I ’ve also re-benched Norton InternetSecurity , considering this did worst of all the applications tested last time .
Searching on places that the old article got linked from , I saw that Norton got quite a bad ( but not unexpected ) deal , so I wanted to make sure that this was n’t unjust .
The Host System
Some people also commented that it would make more sense if they knew more about the physical setup I ’ve been running the tests on .
So for them , here ’s what my PC is :
AMD 64 X2 4800 +
64 X2 4800 + 2 Gig DDR RAM
2x 36 Gig WD Raptors in RAID0 ( system OS )
Raptors in ( system ) 2 x 120 Gig Seagate Barracudas in JBOD ( one for VM , other as the scratch disk )
( one for , other as the scratch disk ) 3 x 300 Gig Maxtor DM10s in RAID5 ( nothing to do with any of this = ] )
The more astute will have noticed that I ’ve got two cores ( effectively two processors ) .
For both the experiments I set the affinity of all the host OS programs to one core and set the VM onto the other core .
The VM also had 512 megs ( of 2048 ) RAM dedicated to it .
I also used two HDs for the system .
One was a read only base - image of Windows and the other was used as the “ scratch ” disk – in short where all the changes were made .
There were also a lot of people saying that the figures I was providing did not reflect accurately on what really slows windows down .
I think that ’s slightly fair although it ’s also a fair assumption that if something is bogging down the start up , it ’s going to continue its reign of terror all the way through your lovely Windows session .
The New Benchmarks
So alongside the same boot time test with BootVis , I needed to decide on a way of testing how fast the computer was when it was all up and running .
I chose the two most effected subsystems of the computer : the processor and the storage .
The CPU gets used up when an application is running , therefore I only expected this to be a limiting factor on those applications which either run all the time in the background or modify system settings .
The algorithm I ran was one to find all the prime numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 .
Not mega - maths , just something to give me a good result in a nice range .
I expected the storage readings to be a lot more varied .
These were going to be effected by the applications that monitor what you ’re doing on the PC , mainly anti-virus and anti-spyware applications .
A “ good ” ( I should say : secure ) anti-virus application will check every disk operation to make sure that there is no bad activity .
The problem comes where doing this costs you CPU cycles and also a massive amount of disk performance .
The algorithm for this test made a new file and wrote a line to it .
Then it would close it ( allowing any application to be notified of a change ) , open it back up and write an extra line ; repeating that last step 10,000 times .
I understand that this is not “ normal usage ” but the results speak for themselves .
I compiled these algorithms in C++ ( so no additional framework was needed ) .

Norton Internet Security 2007
I got an email from Symantec ’s PR people just before I was about to publish this article .
Understandably they were upset about the last article and wanted to help as much as they could .
I ’ll let you draw your own conclusions over motives etc but they were kind enough to furnish me with a copy of NIS2007 which , at the time of writing , is unavailable in the UK from their online store .
They ’ve asked me to run the benchmarks
My first impressions of this were that it was a much smother install process than the previous version ( which occasionally decided to stall for a time ) and it did not require a reboot after installing , something that strikes me as slightly odd if a lowly graphics package reckons it needs a restart post - install .
I restarted it all the same .
It ’s certainly no less graphical than previous versions but they have attempted a “ Web 2.0 ” style for the interface .
Is n’t it strange how these things come around ?
The VM did seem a lot faster than it had done on a few tests but I ’ll let the next page speak the figures .
I included NIS2006 alongside to allow a direct comparison ( plus to give it another chance ) .
I ’ve also had the chance to squeeze in more than I would have , had the article gone out when I ’d first intended .
The Contenders
I ’ve tried to repeat as few tests as possible so that I could put my time into doing new things that people wanted benchmarking …
If I ’ve still missed something off , contact me and I ’ll see about adding it either to this list , or the next one like it .
I ’ll say now ( and probably again later ) : this took a lot of time .
Anti-virus Suites
I concentrated on these last time as they were the worst offenders , but some missed the chance to have a go and therefore I ’m giving these lucky packages a chance to show how slow they can really make your computer crawl .
Anti-virus
The classic systems that ran the world before security became silly .
Some have added features like mail - scanning , but nothing fancy like a firewall .
Anti-Spyware & Firewalls
These are standalone applications specifically for one job .
Only … Erm …
Two can survive .
You should note that Ad - Aware does not run all the time like most anti-malware applications ( unless you purchase it ) and therefore it was only functioning as a post- active system .
Prevention is the best policy .
Office
There ’s been a lot of emphasis over Foxit PDF Reader over the last couple of days .
It ’s time to see how they compare here .
Browsers
I did n’t count browsers significantly large enough to affect the system , so they were left out of the last test .
I ’ve included them in this on demand .
Media
I covered some codecs last time and they generally performed well .
This time I ’ve covering some of the players that you might use with them
Messengers
There were also a lot of messenger utilities in the last roundup but it turns out you can never have enough messengers so here are a few more by popular demand .
CD , DVD & Virtual Drive Applications
Here ’s anything to do with burning , cloning , imaging and mounting “ removable media ” .
Other Things
Here are the things that I decided I could n’t be bothered to add extra things to bulk out a group were unique enough to stay on their own .
Black Viper ’s Services Tweaks Adding 5000 images into the My Photos section of My Documents
Results and Conclusions
Most people wo n’t find anything too shocking here .
One of the most surprising things to be gleaned from here is the blatant time and effort Symantec have gone to improve their product from the 2006 version .
This wo n’t help you if you own that version , but it should give you a good idea what to expect from Symantec in the future if you ’re determined to stick with their product line .
Overall
Here ’s the table of results for all three sections ranked by their overall performance degradation .
The control times where :
Boot Time : 70 seconds
70 seconds Prime : 26 seconds
26 seconds FileIO : 25seconds

Boot Delay
The boot delays were quite a lot smaller than last time , likely to be attributable to VMWare having a better grasp on its file system than Virtual PC , but the same names were at the top of this test .
Prime Delay
I was n’t expecting too much of a result from here .
The prime delays would have come on systems where there were applications hogging resources .
FileIO Delay
The only applications this was going to affect were the system - monitors ; those applications that require 100 % attention on the file system , namely the security products .
Conclusions
Well it ’s clear to see what sort of application has most effect on Windows .
Antivirus programs tether the performance of your computer alongside that of one three years its elder .
If you really need an antivirus system , make sure you follow these benchmarks but also make sure you check how good the one you ’re looking at really is .
Nod32 gets good security reviews and seems to leave the system fairly nippy
The new version of Norton has shocked me a little .
Every year since their Norton AntiVirus 2002 , they ’ve added more and more “ bloat ” .
They call them features , and looking at the box , you ’d agree .
Features have traditionally come at a price though .
If you ’re scanning more things , it ’s going to take it more time .
NIS2007 seems to do all the work of 2006 but with significantly less load on the FileIO .
I ’m not shouting “ go out and buy it ” because of the massive boot delay and there are still better products .
If you ’re looking for the best of the best antivirus products you should look at their detection rates .
There ’s no point in having something , no matter how expensive , if it cannot keep you protected .
Here is an excellent roundup of anti-virus systems .
Really ?
Such a thing exists ?
I think not .
The Patriots are 13 - 0 this year .
That means there is no blueprint for beating the Patriots .
Rodney Harrison said it best , we have n’t lost yet so keep bringing the same blueprint .
I thought that was perfect .
Keep in mind , I ’m a Cowboys fan and I ca n’t stand the Patriots .
So , all that teams have right now is a blueprint for things you can hopefully do to disrupt the Patriots and make it a ball game and give your team a chance to win .
Four teams so far have given the Patriots a ball game and it gets closer to their first loss each time .
The Cowboys had a lead on them late into the 3rd quarter , the Colts had a 10 point lead with 10 minutes to go in the game , the Eagles led into the 4th quarter and last night , the Ravens straight gave that game away with 45 seconds to go .
What is pretty obvious in all situations is that the Patriots defense is n’t nearly on the same level that their offense is .
So , here is the formula for giving the Patriots a ball game and giving yourself a chance to win .
1 . Play downright physical on both sides of the ball and smack them right in the face .
You especially need to figure out a way to apply as much pressure as possible on Tom Brady and introduce him to the grass often .
2. Limit the amount of possessions the Patriots have .
Because they are so efficient on offense , you must limit how often they get the ball .
A great running attack is a perfect way to do this but you must be able to execute on offense .
Also , you must protect the ball .
Turnovers and penalties will kill you against the Patriots .
Nothing too crazy but it seems like the teams that have come “ close ” have kind of followed that game plan .
Based on their remaining schedule , it does n’t look like they are going to lose in the regular season but you never do know .
Right now , it appears the Patriots and Cowboys are on a collision course for the one of the most anticipated potential Super Bowl matches in years .
I ’ve discovered a way to bring a new perspective to your life .
To explain it , I have to tell a little story .
Driving home Friday night , I was remembering a time years ago , when my daughter Lauren ( now six years old ) was in her first year .
An old friend of mine was coming to town , and we went with my wife to see a Glen Phillips solo acoustic concert down near San Diego .
We were very excited to see the show .
But for some reason , we could n’t get a babysitter .
So we decided to take Lauren .
Since it was just an acoustic show , we hoped that she ’d sleep peacefully on my lap .
If , during the show , she got upset , I would take her out to the car .
Thereafter , my wife and I would take turns watching her in the car .
Lauren was asleep when the concert began — but she awoke , crying , five seconds into the first song .
It was louder than we had thought it would be .
I hurriedly took her to the car , which was parked on the street about half a block away .
Once I had her out there , I never brought her back inside the club .
Although part of me wanted to be back inside watching the concert , I was also having fun being with my daughter — at times talking to her when she was awake , and at times watching her sleep .
Plus , I wanted to let my wife see the whole concert .
I figured there was no reason to interrupt her enjoyment if I was having a perfectly good time .
It was n’t so much that I preferred to be with my daughter than to watch a concert .
I just did n’t mind staying out with her in the car .
Thinking about this the other night , I asked myself : Patrick , if you could go back to that night , right now , and either stay out in the car with Lauren , or be inside and watch the concert — which would you do ?
And of course the answer was obvious .
The night it happened , I did n’t mind being in the car with my daughter .
But if I could go back now , there ’s no question that I would want to be there .
Not only would I stay in the car with her —
I would make the most of the experience , realizing that I had a precious chance to see her at that age again .
I would try to commit every moment to memory .
And then I realized : some day , years in the future , I might be asking the same question about my life today — this very minute .
If you could have this moment back to live over again , what would you do ?
The rest of that evening , I pictured myself as having been sent into my body from the future , to relive the moments I was experiencing .
And I saw everything differently .
I sat on the couch and watched television with my arm around my wife — all the while imagining myself as an old man , transported back in time to relive that moment .
And all of a sudden , what otherwise might have seemed like a mundane moment seemed like a privilege .
I felt like the luckiest guy in the world , just sitting there with my wife .
I ’ve tried the trick all weekend , and it really changes your outlook .
Just sitting around with a sleepy child in your arms is great any way you look at it .
But if you picture yourself as someone whose child has grown up — if you imagine yourself as an older man , who would give the world to be back in that chair with that child in his arms — it makes you realize how important the moment is .
And you appreciate it more .
Like any epiphany , I know that this will pass , to be remembered only from time to time .
I hope I remember it often , when routine is wearing on me .
But there are times I actively need to forget it , because this outlook promotes a sort of hedonism .
For example , right now , I need to clean the house — but that ’s not really what I would choose to do if I were sent here from the future .
Oh , well .
I ’m going to clean up anyway .
I think the guy from the future would understand — sometimes , you just gotta do what you gotta do .
I can hear my future self in my head right now .
He says to make a nice cup of coffee and put on some music while I do it , and take some breaks to play with the kids .
Enjoy the chores as well as the easy and fun moments , I hear him saying .
Some day , you ’ll miss even the chores .
Some day , you ’ll miss almost everything about your life the way it is right now .
Police carried out a controlled explosion
Reaction to car bomb
A controlled explosion was carried out on the car , packed with 60 litres of petrol , gas cylinders and nails , in Haymarket , near Piccadilly Circus .
An ambulance crew saw smoke coming from the green Mercedes , near the Tiger Tiger nightclub at 0130 BST ( 0030 GMT ) .
London 's Park Lane was later cordoned off while a suspicious vehicle was investigated .
Scotland Yard , Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur urged people to be " alert and vigilant " and to report any suspicions to the police .
Disruption would be kept to a minimum , he said , although the police were reviewing the safety of a number of big public events set to take place in the capital over the weekend .
" I want to reassure Londoners that we are doing everything possible to make them safe , " he added .
Earlier , a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said that Park Lane was closed at Marble Arch to Hyde Park Corner and a 200 m cordon was in place .
Sources close to the investigation said the Park Lane closure was linked to the discovery of a vehicle at an underground car park .
A police robot was being used to investigate the vehicle .
" International elements " were believed to be involved with the Haymarket bomb , Whitehall sources told the BBC .

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , head of Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism command , said : " It is obvious that if the device had detonated there could have been serious injury or loss of life . "
The ambulance had been called to the nightclub - where up to 1,700 people were inside - when they spotted smoke , now believed to be vapour , inside the car .

Bomb experts manually disabled the " potentially viable explosive device " .
Scotland Yard declined to comment on reports that a mobile phone was found in the Mercedes that may have been intended to trigger the explosion .
One report claimed that a quick - thinking officer disconnected the mobile phone before bomb squad officers arrived .
Mobile phones have been used to detonate bombs in Iraq and Indonesia and in other terror attacks , such as the 2004 Madrid bombings .
The car bomb has echoes of other terrorist plots .
Five men were jailed for life in April for a UK bomb plot linked to al - Qaeda that targeted a shopping centre and a nightclub with a giant fertiliser bomb .
And Dhiren Barot was jailed for life last November for conspiring to park limousines packed with gas canisters underneath high - profile buildings before detonating them .

DAC Clarke told a press conference that it was too early to say who was responsible but the incident " resonated " with previous terrorist plots .
" The threat from terrorism is real .
It is here , enduring .
Life must go on but we must all stay alert , " he said .
Mr Clarke also specifically mentioned nightclubs as a potential target .
Following Friday 's discovery police patrols in central London were stepped up " to provide a visible reassurance " , rather than in response to a specific threat .
Officers will visit licensed premises to reiterate ongoing crime prevention and safety advice , said a police spokesman .
The Muslim Council of Britain , the largest organisation representing Muslim groups in the UK , urged people to help the police find the perpetrators .
Secretary - General Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari , said : " It is now a duty upon all the rest of us to help the police so that they can bring whoever was involved in this plot swiftly to justice " .
Alert
Speaking in Downing Street after a private meeting with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the new Home Office minister for security , Admiral Sir Alan West , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith urged members of the public to report anything suspicious to the police .
Mr Brown said Britain faced " a serious and continuous threat " .
He added the public " need to be alert " at all times .

Eyewitness accounts
The BBC's Andy Tighe said the timing was significant coming a day after Mr Brown became prime minister , and with the second anniversary of the 7 July bombings approaching .
Earlier reports said bouncers from a nearby nightclub saw the car being driven erratically before it crashed into a bin .
They claimed the driver then got out and ran off .
A police source said the bomb was a " big device " and had posed a real and substantial threat to the hundreds of revellers leaving the area 's bars and nightclubs .
Dozens of forensic officers examined the scene and the car was taken to the Forensics Explosives Laboratory in Kent for further tests .
The current terrorism threat level has been classed as severe - one level lower than the highest " critical " - since 14 August 2006 .
Intelligence sources said they were keeping an open mind on who was responsible for the car bomb .
The BBC 's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the incident had " come from nowhere " and that the driver of the car was now Britain 's " most wanted " .
He said CCTV was the key to finding the " first clue " as to who was behind the attempted bombing .
Police have urged anyone with information to phone the confidential Anti-Terrorist hotline number on 0800789321 .
James Randi is a magician , skeptic and debunker who has made short work of countless frauds , fruitcakes and sincere claimants to paranormal power .
The Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge traditionally offers the titular award to those who can demonstrate proof of such skills under rigorous test conditions .
Recently , however , Randi 's foundation has moved beyond the strictly supernatural , targeting claims made by fans of ultra-expensive audio gear .
In this latest funhouse , Michael Fremer , audiophile and Stereophile editor , accepted a challenge , with the backing of Pear Cables , to prove that the firm 's $ 7,000 leads are better than standard - fare one can pick up at Best Buy .
It 's not gone well for the challengers , with Pear backing out and Fremer frustrated by the all - too - public negotiations between Randi and himself .
Do n't let it happen to you .
Whether you 're psychic or merely a subjectivist in matters of science , here are 10 tips for dealing with Randi and claiming your dough .
__• __Do n't claim the prize does n't exist .
This makes you look stupid .
The million dollars , plus a dusty film of interest , is real and stashed in a Goldman Sachs escrow account .
__
• Do n't ridicule Randi.__ Randi has seen you coming .
The old man never got a degree , but he knows more about the workings of science than half the Ph.D.s in America .
Randi will make faster work of you than Chuck
Norris if you underestimate him .
__
• Do n't claim the testing will be rigged .__
Anyone remotely familiar with how scientists guard against their own bias and expectation will know that these double - blind experiments are designed to be transparent and rigorous , using the same empirical principles as seen in any kind of research .
Reporters and observers would relish the chance to spot a methodological flaw or sleight of hand .
__
• Do n't lose your temper .__
Do n't get into preliminary cockfighting .
Randi is a master at delivering insults and responding to communications in such a way as to make you look foolish .
Before test protocol negotiations have even begun , anything you say will already have been used against you .
The Million Dollar Paranormal
Challenge is as public a spectacle as there is , and the chances are that between you and him , only one of you has a half - century 's experience as a professional showman .
__
• Do n't forget what you 're getting yourself into : __ boring , exhaustive testing by people who think you 're full of shit .
If you go into it thinking it 's going to be a cute studio one - shot in front of Johnny Carson , imagine what happened to Uri Geller happening to you twenty times .
If you can't pull off your trick / power / feat with statistically significant results outside of Randi 's lair , going inside of it is simply idiotic .
__
• Do n't bother trying to work the protocol in your favor , with plans to back out honorably if the testing scenario is n't to your taste .__
Before you even start , you 'll get to determine what will constitute success , and both sides agree to the rules , details of which are open for negotiation .
You 'll even get to practice " unblinded " to warm up — a dowser , for example , will do a few rounds knowing exactly where the water is — meaning that there 'll be no point where you can say you 've been fiddled .
__
• Do n't start what you can't finish .__
The only thing that stinks worse than bullshit is chickenshit .
The test is rigged one way and one way only : if you get involved , backing out under any circumstances whatsoever makes you look silly .
You cannot subvert this principle , even if you think you 're in the right : Randi has a script , you do not .
No - one will believe you if your powers are found to be inoperable in the presence of clipboards .
No - one likes a quitter .
__
• Do n't forget the failures of those that have gone before .__
Singularly inaccurate TV psychic Sylvia Browne accepted and subsequently fled from Randi 's challenge , and it was n't pretty .
Compare the swagger and brio of Pear Cables ' leap into the ring with the quiet brevity of its reversal : a masterclass in how to turn your own product into an international joke .
Almost all candidates back out at the negotiation stage ; only a few dozen have reached preliminary tests , and all those have failed to proceed to the final tests .
__
• Do n't come flying out of obscurity expecting to get a shot at the lucre .__
Go to the trouble of having some articles written about you , or of having someone with academic credentials say what you do is for real .
After years taking on all - comers , the foundation 's interest is now homed in on the many high - profile paranormalists it considers to be in need of debunking .
__
• Do have paranormal powers .__
In fact , fulfilling this one suggestion lets you ignore all the others , and all but guarantees the cash will be yours .
What are you waiting for ?
Who done it ?
Sometime late in 2005 , the CIA destroyed videotapes showing hundreds of hours of interrogations of two top Al Qaeda suspects -- while continuing to imply to the 9/11 commission and the courts that no such interrogation tapes had ever existed .
What was on those tapes that made CIA officials so eager to destroy them , instead of just selling them to the producers of “ 24 " and retiring in comfort ?
And who authorized ( or knew of ) their destruction ?
Not our national Decider , who insists , via White House spokeswoman Dana Perino , that he did n’t decide anything whatsoever , because he has “ no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction . ”
That ’s in contrast to former White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers , who apparently knew all about the tapes but did n’t bother to share the news with her boss .
Advertisement
Unidentified administration sources assure us , though , that Miers recommended that the CIA preserve the tapes .
( It ’s not hard to imagine her words : “ Gee , if these interrogation tapes just happened to be lost or destroyed , it would sure make it tough for anyone to bring future war crimes or torture prosecutions against anyone in this administration , so I hope the CIA will take really good care of those tapes . ” )
Over at the CIA , another unidentified “ former official ” said no one at the White House ever ordered the CIA not to destroy the tapes -- at least not in so many words : “ They never told us , ‘ Hell , no , ’ ” he told the New York Times .
And current and former officials said that the CIA ’s acting general counsel , John Rizzo , was in on the whole discussion about the tapes .
Meanwhile , still another anonymous “ official ” asserted that Rizzo was out of the loop and “ angry ” at the tapes ’ destruction .
When it was his turn to pass the buck , current CIA Director Michael V. Hayden helpfully reminded Congress that he was n’t even at the CIA in 2005 and therefore had no idea who ordered that the tapes be destroyed , though he naturally intends to look into it .
As the president told ABC News , “ It will be interesting to know what the true facts are . ”
Uh-huh .
But in many ways , the question of who ordered that the tapes be destroyed completely misses the point .
It probably wo n’t be all that difficult to answer that question -- congressional inquiries are fairly good at that sort of thing .
We may even see some prosecutions come out of this , because the tapes were , arguably , crucial evidence in criminal prosecutions and other legal proceedings .
Those who want heads to roll for this will probably get their way .
Advertisement
But so what ?
In this case , as blogger and Georgetown professor Marty Lederman reminds us : “ The cover - up is not worse than the crime , and they knew it .
Those tapes must have depicted pretty gruesome evidence of serious criminal conduct . ”
Waterboarding ?
For sure , according both to press accounts and to former CIA operative John Kiriakou .
Other “ enhanced ” forms of interrogation that , to the unenhanced eye , would look indistinguishable from plain torture ?
It ’s a pretty good bet .
If I had to guess , the tapes were destroyed because obstruction - of - justice charges are no big deal compared to war crimes charges .
After we find out who authorized the destruction of the tapes , the true who - done - it will remain :
Who gave the CIA the green light to use interrogation methods that the agency surely suspected were criminal ?
Who decided to let the U.S. adopt the interrogation methods of a hundred tin-pot dictators ?
Answering that one will be far more uncomfortable .
It would be nice to find a scapegoat ( Aha !
It was Dick Cheney ! ) , but the unpleasant truth is that the blame is pretty widespread .
So ... who really done it ?
Advertisement
Cheney , presumably , and the sinister little gnomes on his staff , and the checked - out Decider , who either knew and did n’t care , or did n’t care to know .
And the CIA leadership and a whole cadre of operatives , who were willing to try a long list of discredited shortcuts they could borrow from our enemies .
And blame the conservative punditocracy , which eagerly defended enhanced interrogation methods .
And let ’s not forget the GOP leadership in Congress , which gave the administration a whole book of blank checks .
But save some blame for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who apparently uttered not a word of dismay when briefed in 2002 on enhanced interrogation methods that included waterboarding , and for quite a few other congressional Democrats as well , who thought that ignoring and overlooking administration criminality was a legitimate form of congressional oversight .
And we can blame ourselves too , collectively .
After all , we ’re the nation that made “ 24 " a hit show .
How does a democracy come to adopt a policy of torturing detainees ?
To paraphrase Hillary Clinton , it takes a village .

While playing
Thief 3 some more I had a rather amusing AI mishap : A couple of NPCs went absoloutely sideways and started killing everyone .
All that glitters is not gold .
Some of it is money and gems .
The setup was this : I ’m in some guy ’s jewelery shop , minding my own business and robbing the place .
Then the owner gets home , and a couple of big goons are with him .
From the sounds of it , he was involved with some underhanded deal with these guys and he tried to cheat them .
He was supposed to hang on to some gems for them , but he was “ skimming ” the gems by ( I think ) cutting them .
I do n’t know .
The goons are quite upset .
The jeweler is unarmed and in a bad way .
He ’s trying to talk his way out of things and he ’s not doing very well .
The conversation seems to hint that I might want to intervene .
One of the goons says , “ Sorry , but now we gotta kill ya .
So unless you gots any friends hidin ’ around here , this is it for you . ”
Odd thing to say .
I can only assume this is the game ’s way of suggesting I might want to help this guy , but I ’m not going for it .
If you make a deal with dangerous criminals , cheat them , and then get caught , then you deserve whatever fate you get .
From my hiding place in the shadows I could drop one of the goons with an arrow , but then the other one would come after me .
That is just too much trouble to save the life of a moron .
As the goons kill the jewler , he starts screaming for help .
I decide to clear out .
As I ’m backing out of the room I bump something off a shelf and make some noise .
The goons hear it and start hunting for me .
An open doorway leading outside is on the opposite side of the room .
I ca n’t make it there without the goons seeing me .
However , I do have a noisemaker arrow , which is sort of a string of firecrackers on the end of an arrow .
It draws the attention of people nearby .
The goons are about to discover my hiding spot , so I fire the noisemaker out of the room .
They hear the loud noise and go charging out into the streets …
… where they proceed to go completely nuts .
They charge into the intersection outside and start slaughtering peasants in the street .
The game auto - generates street traffic , so as they kill someone a new citizen is created nearby .
( This happens off - screen , I never see them appear )
This provides a steady stream of victims for the two killers .
My character is great at stealth kills , but nearly helpless in a stand - up fight .
One town guard is usually more than I can handle .
But these two guys are big , strong , and carry big swords .
Whenever a member of the city watch shows up to help he just ends up on the growing pile of bodies .
These guys are unstoppable .
I did n’t think to get a picture while this was going on , so the screenshot does n’t really give the full effect .
Whenever I look away the game does a bit of cleanup and removes some of the older bodies , so the pile is never bigger than five or six people .
However , the real death toll must have been a few dozen .
These guys were at it for a long time .
What a mess .
I ’ve been thinking about this , and I ’m still not entirely sure what made these guys go on the killing spree .
Obviously it could have been a bug or a fluke or sloppy scripting , but I ’m more inclined to think that the peasants that brought this on themselves , as the result of a chain of various behaviors .
I obviously do n’t have the source code , but I think that peasants become fearful when they see a character who has recently killed someone .
( This is usually the player . )
When they become scared they say things like , “ I ’m going to go find a town guard ! ”
Then they run off to tell a guard about the actor that scared them .
The guard will come and attempt to kill that actor .
Perhaps the noisemaker brought some peasants and the goons together , the peasants got spooked and decided to fetch the guards , which obliged the goons to kill them .
Once this got started it would have fed on itself , since new peasants would get spooked by the pile of corpses in the street and forced the goons to kill them as well .
If this is what happened then it ’s an amusing case of unwanted emergent behavior .
In Rehoboth , Mass. , Joyce Amaral collected 1,800 golf balls from her property abutting Middlebrook Country Club , then lugged them into court when she sued the club .
Ms. Amaral ’s house was hit so regularly , her landscapers wore hard hats .
Balls set off the burglar alarm and dented her car .
Image Pete Cuppels , Middlebrook Country Club owner , said the ruling could be like the Roe v. Wade of golf law . 
Credit ... Erik Jacobs for The New York Times
Although the club existed decades before the house was built , a court ruled that the balls — and the golfers looking for them — were a trespass .
The parties settled this month , with the club agreeing to shorten the No. 9 hole , which should keep the Amaral property out of the line of fire .
But Pete Cuppels , the club ’s owner , said the settlement would probably put his low - cost nine - hole course out of business .
“ I ’ve already had to take $ 50,000 from my retirement account to pay for legal fees , both the plaintiff ’s and mine , ” Mr. Cuppels , 68 , said .
“ We modified the hole before the settlement , and we ’ve already seen a big drop in return business .
I feel worse that my name is on a ruling that could be like the Roe v.
Wade of golf law .
If the precedent is that golf course owners are responsible for every crooked shot hit by a novice or a good golfer , we ’re all in trouble . ”
Most courts , however , instead rule that homeowners assume risk when they move adjacent to a golf course , said Dalton B. Floyd Jr. , a South Carolina lawyer whose practice regularly involves golf - related litigation and who has been a consultant to the Professional Golfers Association of America .
“ The golf course owners have a duty to exercise ordinary concern , ” Mr. Floyd said .
“ And in some instances , there may be a design problem that can be corrected by moving tees , greens , trees or using nets .
There are always exceptions , and sometimes it can get very serious .
But it is also part of golf that the golfer does n’t always know where that ball will end up . ”
Project Censored is a media research group out of Sonoma State University which tracks the news published in independent journals and newsletters .
From these , Project Censored compiles an annual list of 25 news stories of social significance that have been overlooked , under - reported or self - censored by the country 's major national news media .
Between 700 and 1000 stories are submitted to Project Censored each year from journalists , scholars , librarians , and concerned citizens around the world .
With the help of more than 200 Sonoma State University faculty , students , and community members , Project Censored reviews the story submissions for coverage , content , reliability of sources and national significance .
The university community selects 25 stories to submit to the Project Censored panel of judges who then rank them in order of importance .
All 25 stories are featured in the yearbook , Censored : The News That Did n't Make the News .
Here are the Top 25 Censored News stories of 2007 :

Until then fundamentalists had mostly avoided any close study of geology , because a literal reading of the Bible was too difficult to reconcile with the accepted age of the earth .
But “ The Genesis Flood ” served as their version of “ The Feminine Mystique , ” a generational manifesto that liberated them to explore .
In the decades since , a small band of geologists , including Whitmore , have set to work improving on the Morris - Whitcomb model using the modern tools of their field : close examination of rocks and fossils combined with computer models .
Now the movement can count hundreds of scientists with master ’s or Ph.D. degrees in the sciences from respectable universities .
The change started in part when Christian colleges that used to resist mainstream science started premed programs , which meant they needed trained biologists and chemists .
Eventually they added courses in physics , chemistry and geology .
Most geologists teaching at Christian colleges in the United States today say they do not believe in a young earth ; they typically argue that a “ day ” in Genesis does not necessarily mean a literal 24 - hour day , or that there could have been long gaps between the days .
But the young - earthers treat the words of Genesis as irrefutable fact .

Their ideas are being showcased in the new Creation Museum in Petersburg , Ky. , opened in May by a creationist group called Answers in Genesis , whose headquarters are nearby .
With its wide - open spaces and interactive exhibits , the place feels like a slick museum of natural history , updated for the Hollywood age .
Many of the exhibits were designed by Patrick Marsh , who helped create the “ Jaws ” and “ King Kong ” attractions at Universal Studios in Florida .
Giant dinosaurs guard the courtyard entrance , promising fun and adventure .
Inside , a replica of the ark leads you from seaboard to bottom deck , a rumbling theater replicates the flood , James Cameron - style .
Lifelike models of Adam and Eve ( who looks like the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen ) frolic in a lush garden among the animals , including several dinosaurs .
The museum expected about 250,000 visitors in the first year .
Instead , despite its $ 20 entry fee , it has had that many in six months , according to Michael Matthews , the museum ’s content manager .
Almost every day , minivans and buses from Christian schools fill the parking lot , sometimes after 10 - hour road trips .
The museum ’s target group is the 45 percent of Americans who , for 25 years , have consistently agreed with the statement in a Gallup poll that “ God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so . ”
The museum sends the message that belief in a young earth is the only way to salvation .
The failure to understand Genesis is literally “ undermining the entire word of God , ” Ken Ham , the founder of Answers in Genesis , says in a video .
The collapse of Christianity believed to result from that failure is drawn out in a series of exhibits : school shootings , gay marriage , drugs , porn and pregnant teens .
At the same time , it presents biblical literalism as perfectly defensible science .
A fossil shows a perch eating a herring , evidence , they claim , of animals instantaneously trapped by catastrophic events after the flood .
In a video , geologists use evidence from Mount St. Helens to show how a mud flow can cut a deep canyon in a single day .
“ This is what I see based on science , ” said Andrew Snelling , one of the many creationist geologists at the conference in July who consulted with the museum .
At the conference , participants got together to tackle some difficult questions :
How is radioisotope dating flawed ?
How was the Grand Canyon formed ?
If all those animals died in one cataclysmic event , why do their fossils appear in such distinct order ?
Their discussions recall a pre-Darwinian age , before science and faith became enemies .
The old - earthers see their discipline as more pure than intelligent design ; the intelligent - design people focus on a notion of a mystery “ designer , ” without specifying who that might be and what the mechanisms are .
To the young - earth creationists , this is both unscientific and dubiously religious .
“ We do n’t subscribe to this idea of the ‘ God of gaps , ’ meaning if you ca n’t explain something , then blame God , ” Whitmore told me before describing a method that hardly seemed more scientific .
“ Instead , we think : ‘ Here ’s what the Bible says .
Now let ’s go to the rocks and see if we find the evidence for it . ’ ”
Two Brown University economists have , for the first time , quantified the substantial effects of winning early in the race for the presidential nomination .
In a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper , Brian Knight and graduate student Nathan Schiff demonstrate that voters in early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire have up to 20 times the influence of voters in later states in the selection of candidates .
We love the Daily Show on VideoSift .
The Comedy Central video embeds have been consistently some of the most popular voted content here .
So , it ’s with a lot of regret - after an extensive community discussion - that we have decided to ban the submission of all Comedy Central videos .
The Internet does not respect national borders and your recent decision to block access to non-US viewers means that 30 % of the members on VideoSift see a frozen screen when trying to view content from The Daily Show , The Colbert Report , South Park and other CC programs .
I ’m sure you have very good reasons for taking this action - exclusive distribution deals with overseas TV networks , advertisements not meant to be globally broadcast etc. - but we ask you to reconsider your decision – and not just for the obvious reasons .
Programs like the Daily Show do more to create goodwill toward the US than the current US administration has ever done .
If the Daily Show can relentlessly skewer its nation ’s politicians without fear of retribution - it gives hope to those living under despotic regimes that democracy is n't quite dead in the US .
Those of us living overseas see Jon Stewart as a face of America - and we like an America that is self - deprecating and willing to highlight her many mistakes .
It makes it so much easier to forgive that way .
Of course , you own the content , and who are we to tell you how it should be distributed ?
Comedy Central has no obligation to send a political message to the rest of the world .
But there is another reason to allow international viewing that has more commercial appeal .
When you block dependable access to your videos , you are driving people to illicit sources for their favorite content .
( You Tube , Bittorrent etc. )
We would try to monitor contraband submissions on our site , but for you , policing this across the Internet will be like trying to drain the ocean with a teaspoon .
Comedy Central , please think globally and give us our Daily Show !
Respectfully yours , The Rest of the WorldPS .
While you ’re at it – can you prevent your videos from “ expiring ” after a few weeks ?

Researchers writing in BMC Genomics reveal that the grapevine 's gene expression analysis reveals two distinct molecular and functional phases that correspond with the green and red grape stages .
Researchers have reported the first biochemical evidence that reactive oxygen species accumulate during the color transition .
Stefania Pilati and fellow researchers from the IASMA Research Center , San Michele all 'Adige , Italy , investigated ripening Pinot Noir grapes ( Vitis vinifera L. ) to identify fruit ripening genes and investigate seasonal influences .
They found a core set of more than 1,400 ripening - specific genes that fluctuated similarly across three growing seasons and a smaller gene group strongly influenced by climatic conditions .
During the green berry ( pre-véraison ) phase , numerous genes involved in hormonal signalling and transcriptional regulation were modulated , suggesting large - scale cellular metabolism reprogramming .
Auxin , ethylene and light played pivotal roles .
During the following ripening ( post - véraison ) phase , genes for cell - wall organization and biogenesis , carbohydrate and secondary metabolisms , and stress response came into play , whereas photosynthesis was strongly repressed .
These transcriptional events tally with the processes of berry softening and accumulation of sugar , colour and aroma compounds , which ultimately determine berry and wine quality .
At véraison , the intervening point when grapes slow down their growth and change colour , this study highlighted an oxidative burst involving hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , and an extensive modulation of the enzymatic anti-oxidative network .
Meanwhile , Laurent G. Deluc and colleagues from the University of Nevada , Reno and the Boston University School of Medicine , USA , took a closer look at the V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon variety , surveying seven different stages of grape berry development .
The team mapped pronounced differences throughout development in messenger - RNA ( mRNA ) expression for genes that play key functional roles in a host of processes .
These included organic and amino acid metabolism , photosynthesis , circadian cycles and pathogen resistance .
In particular , the researchers recorded changes associated with transcription factor expression patterns , abscisic acid ( ABA ) biosynthesis , and calcium signalling genes that identified candidate factors likely to participate in véraison , or aroma compound production , and in pathway regulation and sequestration of flavonoid compounds .
Some mRNAs were observed to decrease or increase specifically throughout ripening and sugar metabolism gene expression pattern analysis revealed an alternative and previously uncharacterised pathway for glucose and triose phosphate production invoked from véraison to mature berries .
Despite the grapevine 's importance , genetic cues underlying the biochemical and physical changes during berry and flavour development have lain undiscovered - until now .
" The large number of regulatory genes we have identified represents a powerful new resource for dissecting the mechanisms of fruit ripening control in non-climacteric plants " , Pilati and co-workers say .
Meanwhile , the second team say they have identified " a set of previously unknown genes potentially involved in critical steps associated with fruit development that can now be subjected to functional testing " .
Oh , we piss people off .
The schedule for the next few months is posted on flyers outside the theater , and on December 15 , we ’re doing It ’s a Wonderful Life .
There was already some internal conflict about it , and some anonymous wag wrote on one of the flyers : “ It ’s not a bad movie , you S.O.B.s !!! ” With three lines under S.O.B.s , so we ’ll know they mean business .
Yeah , some people do n’t like Bad Movie Night so much .
Me , I do .
It ’s my baby .
I did n’t create the show that honor goes to Jim Fourniadis and Ty McKenzie but I was there on the first night : Red Dawn , March 27 , 2005 .
Coincidentally , I broke up with my girlfriend of seven years earlier that afternoon .
As a result I almost did n’t go to the show at all , but I was looking forward to it , and the point of the breakup had been ( among other things ) so I could go do the stuff I wanted , and Bad Movie Night was very much the stuff I wanted to do .
I became a frequent co-host , eventually weaseling working my up to de facto curator .
It ’s still the most fun thing I do on a regular basis .
Held every Sunday night at 8 pm at the Dark Room ( 2263 Mission between 18th and 19th in San Francisco ) , Bad Movie Night is easily described as Mystery Science Theater 3000 live : we heckle a movie .
Three hosts sit in the front row with microphones , and the audience is invited to participate as well , to hoot and holler and shout their own comments .
I ’m the primary host on the first , third and occasionally fifth Sundays , introducing the movie and working one of the mics , and Jim handles the second and fourth .
The great personal irony is that I fracking hate loud audiences at movies .
Cannot stand ’em .
If one other person is in the auditorium , it ruins my night .
It partially accounts for why I go to maybe a half - dozen mainstream movies over the course of a given year , and even then I try to wait until I ’m fairly confident the crowd has thinned out .
Vash and I waited until after The Simpsons Movie had dropped out of the Top 10 , and we went on a Sunday morning , when we figured that most people would be going to see the newer , shinier movies .
There were all of two other people in the theater , and they did exactly what I hate having to deal with when I ’ve paid ten bucks for a ticket : they repeated dialogue in a dull monotone ( “ you ca n’t kill him if he ’s wearing people clothes ” ) and commented on the action ( usually thrilling recaps along the line of “ He got hit on the head . ” ) .
At least the IMAX 3D showing of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , also on a Sunday morning after the show had dropped out of the Top 10 , was in a theater large enough for me to pretend that the few other patrons did n’t exist .
And , in fairness , that is n’t just the case with mainstream movies : I no longer see Alfred Hitchcock movies or just about any American movie made before 1993 at the Castro Theater .
Which is a damned shame , because the Castro is a gorgeous old - school movie palace built in 1922 , with a gigantic screen and beautiful architecture and a guy playing a Wurlitzer before most shows .
It ’s quite possibly the most ideal environment for watching a movie , especially a classic movie which was intended to be shown in such an ornate setting .
Problem is , the rest of the audience goes to these old movies to laugh at the old hairstyles and clothes and gender roles and how everybody smokes and drinks all the time , and by god they do not shut up .
After the second time I saw Vertigo there and the audience giggled through the part where …oh , hell , though every part , I ’d had enough .
The rooftop chase which opens the movie was treated like it was the funniest thing since the mirror scene in Duck Soup .
For Bad Movie Night , though ?
The rowdier the crowd , the better .
Context is everything .
Two of our best nights in terms of audience participation were Snakes on a Plane and the Medialoper favorite Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Okay , yeah , Snakes on a Plane was a gimme , but Sgt. Pepper ?
Who would have guessed ?
Packed house , and they had a blast .
We encourage brown - bagging , and a good half of them were thoroughly drunk by the time of the “ ahhh - ahhhhhhh - ahhhhh ” singalong in “ A Day in the Life . ”
When they chanted “ Jump ! Jump ! Jump ! ” at the climax of the song ( as Peter Frampton ’s character tries to commit suicide before being saved by Billy Preston and his magical gold - lame suit ) , it was one of the proudest moments of my life .
I tend to think of myself of as a writer first and a performer second , but it arguably all falls under the subtext of entertainer whether someone is reading my writing or listening to me read it aloud or I ’m acting in a play or hosting a show or even if they ’re enjoying someone else that I ’ve introduced , the last thing I want is for them to be bored , and little makes me happier than people having fun on my watch .
Pleasure is too damned fleeting , and I like facilitating it .
Since Mystery Science
Theater 3000 is one of my favorite teevee shows , getting to do Bad Movie Night involves no small amount of wish fulfillment .
I try to work in as many running gags from MST3 K as I can , even if most of the time the audience does n’t know it ’s a reference .
During mundane actions , for example : “ Nobody will be admitted during the thrilling parking scene ! ”
Okay , so it loses something in the transition , kinda like the jokes on the covers of Rhino VHS editions of the series ( a design motif they wisely abandoned for the DVD editions ) .
It helps if you imagine it in a Tom Servo voice , I suppose .
We ’ve developed our own share of recurring jokes in the two years and change that the show ’s been running .
There ’s the obscure “ Skull Films ! ” , born when we watched an episode of Quincy as part of Bob Crane Double Feature Night , or “ Boing… boing …. boing , ” which harkens back to the endless credit sequence of Tanya Roberts riding horseback in Sheena , Queen of the Jungle .
( I ’ll let you do the math on that one . )
For no reason whatsoever , Jim Fourniadis saying “ la pelicula es rojo ” cracks me up every freakin’ time .
Existing lines like “ Dick Laurant is dead ” from Lost Highway and “ I wish I could quit you ! ” from Brokeback Mountain are also popular .
Early on , I suggested movies which MST3K would have done if they could have .
One of our first features was Starship Invasions , referenced in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide as a possibility for the seventh season , though they were never able to get the rights .
It was also obvious that they wanted to do Road House so bad they could taste it , and while it was n’t an option on their budget ( which was limited to movies in the Comedy Central or Sci - Fi Channel libraries ) , it is on ours .
We fear no copyright .
( Of course , we respect and admire and fully support copyright and think it ’s swell and would n’t want to steal food from the artists ’ mouths by showing movies we do n’t own the rights to , because that would be wrong , and I certainly do n’t mean to imply that we charge people five dollars a head to watch Little Man without the Wayans clan being properly compensated .
And , in fact , that ’s not what they ’re paying five bucks for at all .
They ’re paying five bucks for the popcorn , or to hear Jim play the banjo on the nights that he ’s hosting , or to watch whatever the dancing monkey act is that I do on my nights .
That we happen to project a movie is just one of those things done for …um … texture .
Yeah , texture .
Are you going to tell me there ’s a copyright on texture ?
What kind of fascist dictatorship is this ?
Smash the state ! )
For as much fun as doing the show itself is , sometimes making the schedule is just as fulfilling , especially lacking the constraints that MST3K faced .
Mike Nelson ’s gotten around those issues nicely with his Rifftrax series , and not coincidentally , one of his first movies was Road House .
I had the good fortune to see Rifftrax Live earlier this year , featuring Nelson , Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett riffing on the Sylvester Stallone arm - wrestling epic Over the Top .
It was like going to church .
Nah , that analogy ’s no good , since I hated going to church as a kid .
It was like seeing God .
I ’m an atheist , but still , it fits .
I ’m mostly left up to my own devices when making the schedule , though Jim often gives me suggestions ; this Sunday ’s feature , Electric Dreams , was his idea , as well as Elvis month in February .
My criteria for choosing movies tends to be based on how well - known they are , how much they cost , how recently they were made , and whether or not I can shoehorn them into a theme .
Like , this month ’s theme is “ Vaporware Cinema : The Way Computers Never Were . ”
We started off with Hackers , and the last two movies of the month will be WarGames and The Net .
None of these were made after 1997 nor were all that expensive , but Hackers drew a large crowd ( aided by the presence of geek icons Annalee Newitz and Charlie Anders as my guest co-hosts ) , and WarGames is getting terrific buzz .
Say what you will about the Boomers , but my fellow Gen - X ’ers are no less nostalgic for our youth , and I ’m more than happy to exploit that .
But , really , what I like doing most are recent , big - budget movies .
Why ?
Because they ’re recent , big - budget movies .
That ’s enough of a crime .
They ’re product , they ’re commerce , and they ’re inescapable .
Millions of dollars are wasted on making them and even more are wasted on promoting them .
I find that offensive .
I do n’t watch commercial teevee or listen to commercial radio , and yet when I went to work every morning this past Summer I could n’t not be aware of Transformers or Spider - Man 3 or Pirates of the Caribbean : At World ’s End because of the ads plastered everywhere .
( All three of those movies are being covered in January for “ Summer Megabudget Movies ” month , along with our annual kick - off showing of Snakes on a Plane . )
I highly resent being unable to go about my daily life without having these fracking gazillion - dollar videogames shoved down my throat .
( Do n’t even get me started on the posters for Mr. Woodcock which recently blanketed San Francisco .
Just … do n’t .
And , Susan ?
The crush is over .
Seriously .
You lost me with this one . )
So the only possible recourse is to ridicule them at Bad Movie Night .
Of course , I suppose I could just not watch them at all , not do them at Bad Movie Night , but …naah .
That ’s crazy talk .
Occasionally people will suggest cult movies like Repo Man or Forbidden Zone .
To me , that ’s missing the point .
I have a lot more respect for a weird , low - budget movie that at least tries to be different and original than a big Hollywood blockbuster .
And sometimes there are movies that I do n’t want us to do ; Velvet Goldmine recently found its way onto the schedule despite my objections , and the second movie we did was Herk Harvey ’s Carnival of Souls , a film which in spite of its nonexistent budget achieves everything it set to out to do and which I admire a great deal .
The thing is , we ’re doing the movies in question no harm whatsoever .
I know that .
One night of being mocked at an obscure black - box theater with a seating capacity of forty - nine is not exactly going to topple Michael Bay ’s empire , nor cause irreparable damage the art of cinema .
Hamlet survived being done during the final season of MST3 K , after all , so Lady in the Water is fair game .
Some people got persnickety about us doing that movie , calling it “ personal ” and “ misunderstood . ”
Yeah , right .
Lady in the Water cost seventy - five million dollars .
Frack it .
Believe it or not , I love movies .
I consider myself a film buff , a film geek , and I even have an otherwise useless piece of paper in a box somewhere which proves I receieved a Bachelors Degree in Cinema from San Francisco State University , 1997 .
Among the reasons I chose to major in Cinema was that I knew it would hold my interest and that I ’d be able to complete the damn degree , because I like reading and writing and thinking about movies .
In recent years I ’ve read The Man Who Heard Voices ( the book about the making of Lady in the Water ) without having seen the movie , as I also did with with Final Cut ( about the making of Heaven ’s Gate ) , The Devil ’s Candy ( detailing the production of the The Bonfire of the Vanities , which as far as I ’m concerned was doomed when an executive declared Melanie Griffith to be sexier than Uma Thurman ) , and so on .
I even keep up with movie news .
I like to know who ’s doing what .
When I see a movie poster I always read the credits , to see whose contract specified their name had to be in a box or how many people produced the latest Robin Williams comedy .
( License to Wed clocked in with four executive producers , four people simply listed as producer , two co-producers , and one line producer .
I ’ll bet it was the best - produed movie ever ! )
That stuff ’s like porn to me .
I read an interesting article today about the pre-production of the upcoming Disney movie Enchanted .
It looks horrible , and I have no intention of seeing it outside of the Bad Movie Night context , but I enjoyed reading about it .
Whenever someone says wow , you must have seen every movie ever made !
because of my rather vast repository of useless cinema knowledge , I tell them the truth : no , I have n’t seen every movie made nor would I want to , but I ’d love to read about them .
What ’s lasted with me the most from film school was the concept that , like any other art form , movies are a reflection of the time they were made .
Even if it ’s a period piece , it still reflects the values and mores of the contemporary filmmakers .
( This is among the reasons why I do n’t think remakes are a bad thing , but that ’s another discussion entirely . )
Nicholas Meyer explains this brilliantly in his commentary on the Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan DVD , defending Merritt Buttrick ’s preppy sweater - around - the - neck look .
But it ’s why I like to do recent big - budget movies , beyond the practical reality that we get a lower turnout for old movies nobody ’s heard of : they ’re a mirror to our current society .
I like to spit in that mirror , to say “ Frack you ” for making it impossible to live in this country without constantly being marketed to .
Yeah , I ’d know about these movies anyway because I make the conscious choice to read about them , but that ’s a choice .
Bad Movie
Night , among other things , is my way of taking back just a little bit of that power .
It ’s nowhere near as lofty as culture jamming , nor as visible as spoofs on Saturday Night Live or Mad Magazine ( they still do movie spoofs , right ? ) , but it ’s a great way to spend a Sunday evening .
Some of our detractors , our loyal opposition , say they do n’t condone Bad Movie Night because they love movies .
To which I say : what ’s your point ?
I do n’t doubt that those people love movies ( not to mention take pride in their hallowed , self - appointed positions as defenders of cinema ) , but as I established before , the fact I do Bad Movie Night does n’t mean I hate movies .
If I hated movies , I would n’t devote so much time and energy to it , writing up blurbs and resizing graphics and all the other little things I do for the show every week , let alone having to actually watch the movies .
Allow me to explain 
You know what I hate ?
Babies and children .
Seriously .
With all due respect to my readers who have reproduced ( because your kids are the exception , of course ) , I can not stand those tiny hellspawn .
More than once I ’ve asked to be seated at a restaurant as far away as I can from people with babies , and as I write this at Borders I ’m occasionally hissing at the couple who snagged the table near the power outlet before I could get there .
Do they need that particular table ?
Did they plug in a laptop or even a cell phone ?
No , and I almost would n’t mind except that they also have a baby in a stroller , which means everything they do is intended to piss me off .
I cannot begin to describe the level of stress I ’ve felt since a family with a one year - old and a five year - old moved in upstairs last December .
My home used to be a place of solace .
No more , because of the constant running and screaming and crying and thumping , from seven in the morning onwards .
Every day I hope that my landlord will tell me those people have decided to move away .
Actually , that ’s not true ; I ’ve abandoned hope , since it was killing me .
Now I ’ve realized that I have to either learn to accept it , or be chased away from the apartment which has been my home since 1995 .
All of which is to demonstrate the originally stated point : I hate kids .
And yet , I do n’t do a show involving kids , do I ? No .
Because I do n’t like them , and I do n’t want to be around things I do n’t like .
I had to keep reminding myself watching Children of Men ( and especially reading the book ) that mass infertility would be a bad thing .
I do love movies , though .
I hate the theatrical moviegoing experience , I hate the advertising , I hated that in practically every frame of the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre the pretty , pretty people were bathed in golden light like a fracking Gap ad .
But I love movies .
I get a great deal of pleasure out of Bad Movie Night , and for many movies that ’s the only way I ’ll ever see them .
I otherwise would never sit down and watch Transformers or Basic Instinct 2 or especially The Passion of the Christ .
Whooboy , that one ruffled some feathers , lemme tell ya .
The turnout was low and a lot of regulars gave me static about for weeks before and afterward , but I consider it one of our best nights .
No movie has deserved it more .
In the end , you only bust the chops of those you love .
It ’s like a Friars Roast , and again , when it ’s all over the movie is unharmed .
( Unlike kids would be if I had to work with them every week . )
Lofty ideals of spitting in metaphorical mirrors aside , it ’s just a good time .
Movies are entertainment by definition , whether it ’s Friday the 13th Part III : 3 - D or Shoah , and Bad Movie Night takes the passive element out of them .
The audience is the real show .
One member of our loyal opposition described Bad Movie Night as “ making us all that much more stupid . ”
Man , if that is n’t the perfect mission statement , I do n’t know what is .
About the author : Robert Anton Wilson was the author of the legendary The Illuminatus !
Trilogy .
He died earlier this year .
In Burlington , North Carolina in 1990 , a group of decent , Christian , hard - working folks who called themselves the Truth Tabernacle Church held a trial featuring the well - known elf Santa Claus as defendant .
They charged Mr. Claus , represented in court by a stuffed dummy , with all sorts of high crimes and misdemeanors .
They charged him with paganism .
They charged him with perjury for claiming to be Saint Nicholas .
They even charged him with encouraging child abuse by appearing in whiskey ads .
Worse yet , they found him guilty on all counts , for basically being a jolly old elf — i.e. , a pagan god trying to steal Christmas from Christ .
It was n't the first time Mr. Claus got the boot from a Christian congregation .
Pope John XXIII threw the suspiciously merry old clown out of the Roman Catholic church back in the late 1960s .
The Jehovah 's Witnesses have always denounced Santa for his unsavory pagan past .
( They also recognized Christmas trees as phallic symbols long before Freud . )
Many fundamentalists believe that all pagan gods are basically one false god — the same demon in different disguises — and they think the disguise is thin in the case of this particular elf .
It only takes a minor letter switch , they point out , to reveal Santa Claus as SATAN Claus .
I sort of think the fundies have it right for once .
Santa not only has an unsavory pagan ancestry but a rather criminal family history all around .
Let me Illuminize you ...
As Weston La Barre pointed out a long time ago in his classic Ghost Dance : The Origins of Religion , you can find remnants of a primordial bear - god from the bottom of South America up over North America and over the North Pole and down across most of Europe and Asia .
This deity appears in cave paintings from southern France carbon - dated at 30,000 BC .
You can find him and her ( for this god is bisexual ) disguised in Artemis and Arduina and King Arthur , all unmasked via canny detective work by folklorists -- and etymologists , who first spotted the bear - god when they identified the Indo - European root ard , meaning bear .
You can track the bear - god in dwindling forms in a hundred fairy tales from all over Europe and Asia .
And you can find the rituals of this still - living god among the indigenous tribes of both American continents .
And Santa , like Peter Pan and the Green Man of the spring festivals , and the Court Jester — and ( in an odd way ) Chaplin 's beloved Little Tramp — all have traits of the god that walks like a man and acts nasty sometimes and clownish sometimes and who was ritually killed and eaten by most of our ancestors in the Stone Age , who then became one with their god and thus also became ( if the ritual worked ) as brave as their god .
See Sir James Frazer 's The Golden Bough for the gory details .
And I swear the same god - bear tromps and shambles through every page of Joyce 's masterpiece of psycho- archeology , Finnegans Wake .
If you do n't believe me , consult Adaline Glasheen 's Third Census of Finnegans Wake .
Most folklorists recognize " the cannibal in the woods " as a humanized relic of the bear - god .
The heroine , in 101 tales , meets him while on a mission of mercy .
He generally sets the heroine to solve three riddles , and when she succeeds , instead of eating her he becomes her ally and helps her reach her goal .
One variation on that became The Silence of the Lambs .
Another became Little Red Riding Hood .
What ?
Hannibal Lecter another of Santa 's uncouth family ?
Yes , indeedy .
In some rustic parts of Europe and probably in Kansas , Santa retains traces of his carnivorous past .
Children are told that if they are " good " all year , Santa will reward them , but if they are " bad " he will EAT THEM ALL UP .
Yeah , the Boogie Man , or Bogie , or Pookah , or Puck , are all of somewhat ursine ancestry , although other animal - gods got mixed in sometimes .
As Crazy Old Uncle Ezra wrote in Canto 113 , " The gods have not returned .
They have never left us . "
Jung might state the case thusly : Gods , as archetypes of the genetic human under - soul ( or " collective unconscious " ) , cannot be killed or banished ; they always return with a new mask but the same symbolic meaning .
Related example : Young ladies in ancient Greece were often seduced or raped by satyrs ; in the Arab lands , we note a similar outbreak of randy djinn ; it India , it was devas .
In the Christian Dark Ages , it began happening to young men , too , especially to monks .
They called the lascivious critter an incubus .
Now it 's happening all around us , and the molesters come from Outer Space .
The sex - demon , like the Great Mother and the Shadow and our ursine hero , and the three brothers hunting the dragon ( recognize them in Jaws ?
Spot them doing their Three Stooges gig ? ) — these archetypal forces always come back under new names .
Sir Walter Scott called them " the crew that never rests . "
And the bear - god seems wakeful elsewhere .
He has appeared prominently in other bits of pop culture — the movies Legends of the Fall and The Edge ( both of which , curiously , star Anthony Hopkins , who also starred as Hannibal Lecter ) and snuck into Modern Lit 101 not only via Joyce but also via Faulkner 's great parable " The Bear . "
He also pops up to deliver the punch line in Norman Mailer 's Why Are We in Vietnam ?
We will see more of him , methinks .
Meanwhile , Santa , the Jester / Clown / Fertility God aspect of Father Bear , is doing quite well also , despite getting the bum 's rush by some grim , uptight Christers .
He has quite successfully stolen Xmas from X and brings pagan lust and pagan cheer to most of us , every year , just when we need it most — in the dead of winter .
His beaming face appears everywhere and if we have a minor cultural war going on between those who wish to invoke him via alcohol and those who prefer their invocations per cannabis , we all share the pagan belief , at least for part of a week , that the best way to mark the solstice and the year 's dying ashes is to form a loving circle and all get bombed together .
As a pagan myself , I would n't have it any other way .
MIAMI -- Green Bay Packers rookie Najeh Davenport pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he broke into a university dormitory and defecated in a woman 's closet .
Davenport , a running back who helped Miami win the 2001 national championship , was not in the courtroom .
His written plea on a second - degree felony count of burglary and a misdemeanor count of criminal mischief was entered by his attorney , Richard Sharpstein .
Arraignment on the charges was postponed until August 5 .
According to police , Davenport crept into a dorm room at Barry University around 6 a.m. on April 1 .
A woman sleeping in the room , Mary McCarthy , told police she was startled by a strange sound and saw Davenport squatting in her closet .
Davenport then allegedly defecated in a laundry basket , McCarthy told detectives .
Davenport signed a multiyear contract with Green Bay and reported to training camp last week .
New Jersey filed a federal lawsuit today charging the Bush administration is illegally trying to change the rules of a health insurance progam New Jersey and virtually every other state uses to provide coverage to 6.6 million children in working poor families .
The Bush administration 's action constitutes " illegal rulemaking " and an " an arbitrary and capricious exercise " by the U.S. Department of Health because it imposes strict limits on the state 's implementation of the program , according to a copy of the New Jersey lawsuit filed this morning .
The lawsuit injects New Jersey into a national fight over funding for the states ' Children 's Health Insurance Program , a Clinton - era effort to provide insurance to children in working families who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but were not covered by private insurance through their work .
" This same Administration previously signed off on our decision to cover the 10,000 kids they are now seeking to kick out of SCHIP , and the lawsuit we filed today demonstrates that we will simply not let that happen , " Corzine said .
The lawsuit said the imposition of " the illegal benchmarks ... would be devestating to the thousands of innocent children in New Jersey and nationwide , " saying they would lose or be denied health insurance coverage .
Congress has reauthoritzed the $ 35 billion program , but President Bush has said he will veto the bill .
Corzine said last week the federal limits on the program , called Family Care in New Jersey , would cost the state as much as $ 70 million .
He said it is " morally reprehensible to turn children lose from this program . "
The filing of New Jersey 's lawsuit comes on the same day that seven other states announced they would pursue legal challenges to the Bush Administration 's directive .
Those states are Arizona , California , Illinois , Maryland , New Hampshire , New York and Washington .
10 Weird Psychology Studies : Vote Now For Your Favourite !
Psychologists are skilled at inventing unusual tests of human thought and behaviour , but some research is pretty weird .
Over the past few months I ’ve been examining some of the weirdest studies around .
There ’s research into psychic dogs , invasions from Mars , the antidepressant properties of semen , pigeon - guided missiles and men ’s urination .
Have a read and then vote below for the study to be crowned PsyBlog ’s official ‘ weirdest ’ study .
Here ’s a weird study that sometimes gets a mention in ethical discussions about psychology , and it ’s not hard to see why .
Middlemist , Knowles and Matter ( 1976 ) designed an experiment to test how the speed and flow of men ’s urination in a public lavatory was affected by invasions of personal space .

Would you believe that people who live with each other for 25 years actually develop similar facial features ?
I do n’t just mean that people tend to choose partners who resemble them , rather that over time together couple ’s features actually converge .
It ’s weird , but there ’s evidence for it from a singular study carried out by the noted psychologist Robert Zajonc and colleagues .

On February 2 , 2001 distinguished sleep and dream researcher Professor J. Allan Hobson had a stroke in his brain stem .
For 10 days Hobson could neither sleep nor dream .
Then he realised the stroke was localised to the exact part of the brain he had been studying experimentally in his sleep research with cats .
Call it poetic justice , or just sheer bad luck , either way Hobson approached the experience like a scientist and decided to document it , just as he had with the cats , but this time from the inside .

Back in 1994 a television company claimed a dog called ‘ Jaytee ’ could psychically sense when its owner returned home .
And they had some evidence to back up their claim .
One TV crew was sent out with Jaytee ’s owner while she walked around her home town and the other stayed at home with Jaytee .
The cameras showed that just as the dog ’s owner turned to go home , Jaytee got up and went to the porch and remained there until she returned .

Do we learn to laugh when tickled or is it an innate response ?
That is the question psychologist Professor Clarence Leuba set himself to examine using his own children , no less , as experimental subjects .

On October 28 , 1938 many Americans believed they were being invaded by Martians .
This was the result of a Halloween stunt orchestrated by Orson Wells in which he adapted H. G. Wells ’
‘ War of the Worlds ’ to the radio and broadcast the play as though it was actually happening .
For Professor Howard Cantril of Princeton University and colleagues , this provided the perfect opportunity to investigate the anatomy of panic .

Here are a couple of studies you can replicate yourself – if you ’ve got the nerve .
In the first you could be risking bodily harm from enraged motorists , while the second has a twist in the tail .

Cat or dog ?
If I have to choose , I choose dog .
It seems , if pushed , most academic research psychologists choose dog as well .
I say that because there are quite a few studies about how we interact with dogs but hardly any ( none ? ) about cats .
So , here ’s my five favourite studies on the psychology of human - dog interaction .
( I know it ’s cheating a bit to include 5 studies here , but …what the hell ! ) »

Check out Hillary Clinton ’s “ Christmas card ” ad :
Hillary Clinton as Santa Claus giving us all presents .
Ummm , except for the fact that all of her “ presents ” are paid for with someone else ’s money .
A Brief History of Boxes
In the days of old , working on your computer meant working inside a limited contained box .
You could run programs but only one at a time , because running two at the same time would require two computers .
This was the status quo for years .
It ’s just how computers worked .
Then a new technology changed everything .
Multitasking .
Now you could buy one computer and your operating system would allow you to run multiple programs at once .
No longer were you tied to one box at a time .
You could have one for your word processor , one for your spreadsheet , and one for solitaire .
It was a spectacular invention , one that we quickly took for granted .
Relatively few computer users today even know what it ’s like to use a computer without this ability .
As time went on , new operating systems began to develop substantial user bases .
The competition between them grew , and most applications were tied to a particular operating system .
You were limited to one operating system at a time , and if you wanted to run two at once you would need two computers .
Then came modern virtualization , which shattered this barrier .
Now you could have one or more giant boxes on your computer containing a full operating system , each with different applications running .
These boxes could sit side by side .
Some people are already taking it for granted .
Soon grade school children will be using virtualization without even knowing that there was a world before it .
But up until now , working in a virtualized environment meant working in a big box on your screen .
Sure you could have several going at once , but you realistically could only interact with one at a time .
These boxes represented screens , and you can only fit so many screens on a single screen at once before you start feeling really cramped .
Shattering the box
Earlier this year , we released VMware Fusion 1.0 for the Macintosh .
This was our first virtualization product for the Mac and it has been met with high praise .
And jealousy .
VMware Fusion managed to change how users thought about virtualization .
Thanks to Unity , you were no longer forced into having a big box on your screen .
With the click of a button , the applications inside your virtual machine would appear outside of the box , sitting alongside your other applications .
The Mac users loved this and Windows and Linux users were left feeling like they missed out .
I ca n’t recall how many times I ’ve been asked if Workstation is going to include Unity in Workstation .
The answer is yes .
Well , eventually .
I ’m working on adding Unity support to the Linux codebase , which may in time be part of Workstation or Player .
This will allow your Windows and Linux programs to intermingle with the click of a button .
As of right now , here are the current state of things :
Unity Today
Unity today works in Linux on my system .
It ’s known to work in Metacity but has n’t been thoroughly tested in other window managers yet .
The basic things you ’d expect all work for the most part .
The rest will come later .
What I have working today
So far , the very basic window management works today , for the most part .
It ’s usable just enough to go “ Oh neat ” and to play a game of solitaire .
Many things do not work today , though .
Virtual desktops do not work .
If you move windows to other desktops , you ’ll have problems .
Multiple monitors might work but probably wo n’t .
Alt - dragging or otherwise moving a window in a way other than by using the titlebar will cause us to get out of sync .
If you attempt to drag a window off - screen , the window manager may block it , but the events will still be sent to the guest .
This could cause the window to get “ stuck . ”
Minimizing a window using the taskbar may cause visual oddities .
Partially obscured windows may look wrong when in Compiz ’s Expose mode or similar modes where all windows are displayed at once .
There ’s no proper start menu integration .
Exit Unity mode to launch new applications or press the Windows key or Control - escape while in a guest application to bring up the guest start menu .
These issues are being addressed .
In many cases where windows become “ stuck , ” simply leaving Unity and then going back into it should fix the problem .
Going forward …
There ’s a lot we have in the works for Unity , and while I cannot yet talk about it all , the end result should be just awesome .
I ’m hoping to have a video demoing it at some point .
P.S. For those who notice the borders and VMware logo badges on the Windows windows in the screenshot and find them annoying , you will be able to disable them .
The idea is to allow you to easily determine the guest windows from the host windows when the OS and theme are the same .

elevator camera obscura
The elevator in my apartment building opens to the outside , and on clear , sunny days , a brief picture of the world snaps into focus on its brushed metal interior .
The narrowing elevator doors focus the image , counteracting the blurring of the vertically brushed metal ; in one dimension , a mirror , and in the other , a camera .
I 'd like to thank the tender ministrations of the Northern California Kidney Stone Center and the resulting painkillers for allowing me spend a happy afternoon attempting to capture the effect .
I tried using a fancy DSLR , but none of the photos really came out ; the short video embedded below works quite well , though .
KAGUYA ( SELENE )
World ’s First Image Taking of the Moon by HDTV
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and NHK ( Japan Broadcasting Corporation ) have successfully performed the world 's first high - definition image taking by the lunar explorer " KAGUYA " ( SELENE , ) which was injected into a lunar orbit at an altitude of about 100 km on October 18 , 2007 , ( Japan Standard Time .
Following times and dates are all JST . )
The image shooting was carried out by the onboard high definition television ( HDTV ) of the KAGUYA , and it is the world 's first high definition image data acquisition of the Moon from an altitude about 100 kilometers away from the Moon .
The image taking was performed twice on October 31 .
Both were eight - fold speed intermittent shooting ( eight minutes is converged to one minute . )
The first shooting covered from the northern area of the " Oceanus Procellarum " toward the center of the North Pole , then the second one was from the south to the north on the western side of the " Oceanus Procellarum . "
The moving image data acquired by the KAGUYA was received at the JAXA Usuda Deep Space Center , and processed by NHK .
The satellite was confirmed to be in good health through telemetry data received at the Usuda station .

This is a still image taken out from the first moving image shooting when the KAGUYA flew from the northern area of the " Oceanus Procellarum " ( * 1 ) to the center of the North Pole .
As the altitude near the North Pole is high , the angle of the coming sunlight was lower , thus the shade of the crater topography looks long in the image .
The moving image was taken at 4:07 a.m. on October 31 , 2007 ( JST ) by eight - fold speed intermittent shooting ( eight minutes is converged to one minute ) from the KAGUYA , and the data was received at the JAXA Usuda Deep Space Center on the same day .

Print This Email This UPDATE : DNI denies promotion for former FEMA flack
The fomer FEMA flack who orchestrated a fake press conference last week has lost his shot for the top PR job in the Department of National Intelligence .
CNN reported earlier Monday that John " Pat " Philbin , the Director of Public Affairs responsible for FEMA 's recent faked news conference , was all set to accept a his promotion , until his new boss realized that hiring a spokesman with a penchant for fiction might not be the best idea .
" We do not normally comment on personnel matters , " DNI spokesman Ross Feinstein told the Associated Press .
" However , we can confirm that Mr. Philbin is not , nor is he scheduled to be , the director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence . "
Philbin 's promotion was " put on hold " while Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell could review his record , a DNI spokesman told the Associated Press earlier in the day .
A press release described Philbin 's new job as director of public affairs in the DNI 's office as an " amazing opportunity to head the communications shop . "
The release was sent to reporters before Philbin was kicked to the curb .
The PR man has come under fire for organizing a press conference to respond to the California wildfires that featured FEMA employees -- including Philbin himself -- posing as journalists , AP reported .
No actual reporters attended the conference , but several listened in via conference call , where they were unable to ask any questions .
McConnell offered Philbin his new job before the press conference fiasco .
It is unclear how long his review will take .
As TPM Muckraker notes , the delayed -- possibly rescinded -- promotion " does n't augur well for the man whose old FEMA online bio page has been speedily expunged from the site . "
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on October 28 , 2007 .

An international team of astronomers , led by Professor Svetlana Berdyugina of ETH Zurich 's Institute of Astronomy , has for the first time ever been able to detect and monitor the visible light that is scattered in the atmosphere of an exoplanet .
Employing techniques similar to how Polaroid sunglasses filter away reflected sunlight to reduce glare , the team of scientists were able to extract polarized light to enhance the faint reflected starlight ' glare ' from an exoplanet .
As a result , the scientists could infer the size of its swollen atmosphere .
They also directly traced the orbit of the planet , a feat of visualization not possible using indirect methods .
Hot Jupiter
The transiting exoplanet under study circles the dwarf star HD189733 in the constellation Vulpecula and lies more than 60 light years from the earth .
Known as HD189733b , this exoplanet was discovered two years ago via Doppler spec-troscopy .
HD189733 b is so close to its parent star that its atmosphere expands from the heat .
Until now , astronomers have never seen light reflected from an exoplanet , although they have deduced from other observations that HD189733 b probably resembles a ' hot Jupiter ' - a planet orbiting extremely closely to its parent star .
Unlike Jupiter , however , HD189733 b orbits its star in a couple of days rather than the 12 years it takes Jupiter to make one orbit of the sun .
Two half - moon phases
The international team , consisting of Svetlana Berdyugina , Dominique Fluri ( ETH Zurich ) , Andrei Berdyugin and Vilppu Piirola ( Tuorla Observatory , Finland ) , used the 60 cm KVA telescope by remote control .
The telescope , which belongs to the Royal Swedish Academy of Science , is located at La Palma , Spain and was modernised by scientists in Finland .
The researchers obtained polarimetric measurements of the star and its planet .
They discovered that polarization peaks near the moments when half of the planet is illuminated by the star as seen from the earth .
Such events occur twice during the orbit , similar to half - moon phases .
The polarization indicates that the scattering atmosphere is considerably larger ( >30 % ) than the opaque body of the planet seen during transits and most probably consists of particles smaller than half a micron , for example atoms , molecules , tiny dust grains or perhaps water vapour , which was recently sug -gested to be present in the atmosphere .
Such particles effectively scatter blue light - in exactly the same scattering process that creates the blue sky of the earth 's atmosphere .
The scientists were also able for the first time to recover the orientation of the planet 's orbit and trace its motion in the sky .
" The polarimetric detection of the reflected light from exoplanets opens new and vast opportunities for exploring physical conditions in their atmospheres " , Pro-fessor Svetlana Berdyugina said .
" In addition , more can be learned about radii and true masses , and thus the densities of non-transiting planets . "

It 's taken as a given that we now deal with more information than previous generations ever imagined , living lives in which " number of clicks " is a meaningful measure of time .
As Spanish productivity guru Balthasar Gracian says :
There is more required nowadays to make a single wise man than formerly to make Seven Sages , and more is needed nowadays to deal with a single person than was required with a whole people in former times .
Except he wrote that in the 17th century .
I first heard about Balthasar Gracian 's The Art of Worldly Wisdom from an old friend - the mother of a girl I grew up with .
Later , I went into a pretty good bookstore with a couple of college buddies and asked the guy behind the counter if they had any copies .
He got very excited and said , " Gracian 's Manual ?
Why , that 's been an underground classic for four hundred years ! "
I 'm continually surprised at how much it remains underground , since it 's really quite useful in almost every way .
It 's a collection of aphorisms - short little bits of advice - so maybe it 's just permanently unfashionable .
Gracian was a Jesuit scholar , army chaplain , philosopher , raconteur and novelist , and his most famous little book is something like a cross between D.T. Suzuki 's digestible Zen Buddhism , Machiavelli 's political scheming , Dale Carnegie 's personal diplomacy , Schmidt & Eno's Oblique Strategies and Sun Tzu's advice on overcoming conflict .
If you 're interested in increasing your mindfulness and basically putting things in order , there are worse books to keep on your nightstand .

In an extraordinary sentencing , Montana Judge James Haynes has sentenced Robert Stearns to 225 years for three felony counts of indecent exposure .
It is clear that Stearns deserved a heavy sentence .
He was on parole for indecent exposure when he exposed himself to women in December 2006 .
It is equally clear that he is a sick individual .
However , Haynes put his sentence at over three times the average for most murders by having the 75 year sentences run consecutively rather than concurrently .
Even 75 years would have been a radical departure from sentencing norms .
Most courts would have imposed a 5 - 10 year sentence for such conduct .
An appeal is obviously in order .
In 1978 , Stearns was charged with an attempted sexual assault on a 63 - year - old woman and was on parole for a 1997 conviction of two counts of indecent exposure and one of sexual intercourse without consent .
Obviously , this history should have pushed the sentence dramatically higher .
However , he was sentenced on indecent exposure violations .
Given his past conduct , this might have pushed the sentence about ten years but 225 years is akin to a serial killer .
However , his best bet may in the state courts .
The U.S. Supreme Court has recently gutted the protections under the Eighth Amendment for excessive sentences .
This should be such a case for federal review , but the Court has allowed effective life sentences for property offenses under three - strike laws .

It 's things like this that really make me appreciate our field of candidates .
Cubans in Miami are steaming mad at former Gov. Mitt Romney for shooting his mouth off in stumbling Spanish , mispronouncing names and erroneously associating a notorious Fidel Castro - spewed Communist catch phrase with freedom fighters .
Politicians in South Florida have lashed out at the former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential hopeful for describing the socialist saying “ Patria o muerte , venceremos ” as “ inspiring ” and for claiming the phrase was swiped from liberty - seeking Cubans by leftist admirers of Castro .
The phrase , which means “ Fatherland or death , we shall overcome , ” was bellowed as a political speech sign - off by the dictator for decades .
At another point in the speech to the Miami - Dade Republican Party , Romney bungled the names of prominent Cuban GOP politicians , referring to Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio as “ Mario . ”
Romney also garnered criticism for his hard - line stance on immigration and ending the talk with the phrase “ Libertad , Libertad , Libertad , ” a revolutionary saying made famous in the gangster movie “ Scarface , ” which many Cubans feel plays on cultural stereotypes .
But it was the former Bay State governor ’s use of an infamous Fidel Castro line that sparked the most controversy .
“ Hugo Chavez has tried to steal an inspiring phrase - Patria o muerte , venceremos , ” Romney said .
“ It does not belong to him .
It belongs to a free Cuba . ”
But scholars and prominent Cubans contend the saying has always been a Communist rallying cry and that it represents the very essence of Fidel Castro ’s oppressive regime .
I like Jonathan Schwartz a lot , but I think that unless some drastic changes are made to Java , the move to JAVA as Sun 's ticker symbol is going to be as relevant as changing it to COBOL .
I 'm using Java less and less as time goes by , not more - the heyday of the language and platform has come and gone , and IMHO , it 's going to continue to fade from relevance with increasing speed .
That does n't mean I do n't use Java every day still .
There 's tons of servers out there with services I rely on whose back end is running on a Java server of some sort .
And my phone has at least a dozen must - have apps and games that are all written in J2ME ( Google Maps , Instango Jabber client , MidpSSH , MobiTV , Opera Mini , Tetris , Lumines , various GameJump games , and more ) .
Lately I 've been playing Scrabulous , which is actually a Java Applet - first one I 've used in a long time .
But in general Java is yesterday 's technology .
As a user , Flash has supplanted Java in the browser , we 've all seen that happen .
On my Linux box , I use several C# applications and none that use the JVM ( I used to use Azureus , but lately it 's been freaking out and crashing (!!) so I gave up on it ) .
On my server I only use a LAMP stack and would never consider a Java server - side app ( like for my blog or Jabber server ) - I just do n't want to waste my server 's resources on a bloated JVM .
As a developer , nowadays I would never consider Java for anything besides a very focused set of server processes to which it was well suited .
The pain of dealing with Java , and the time / effort it takes to develop using it just is n't worth it to me .
Yes , at one point Java was definitely a god-send .
It rescued me from the Microsoft hell I was dealing with at the time ( this is back in 1999 ) and opened up a whole new world of options , as well as lead me to Unix , etc .
But many years have passed since then , and sadly Java has n't progressed , and instead has become more and more obtuse and bloated with each passing year .
At one point I thought I hated programming because I was just so sick it ...
It turns out I do n't hate programming , I just hate programming in Java .
In fact , I 'd say that many of today 's current hot trends in programming are a direct result of a backlash * against * everything that Java has come to represent : Lengthy code and slow development being the first and foremost on the list .
In Java you generally need hundreds of lines of code to do what modern scripting languages do in dozens ( or less ) .
The general up tick in interest in Ruby , Python and PHP during the 2000s all has its roots in programmers who had to work on one Java project too many , and were desperate to find something more efficient and less painful to use .
You all know the story - less XML and cleaner , leaner code - and once you 've experienced it , believe me , you wo n't go back .
I 'd even speculate that the recent interest in Erlang is driven by these same forces .
The same people who swore they 'd never use Java again if they could help it are looking for a good replacement for it on the server .
The one spot where the JVM has no real peers is in long running server - side processes that need to execute hard - coded business logic as scalably as possible .
Despite the fact that the JVM is a resource hungry beast that 's ponderously slow to start up and happy to eat as much memory as you can throw at it , it 's still the only real game in town for this type of application ... for now .
The reason people are looking at Erlang is not because its beautiful syntax , great documentation , or up - to - date libraries .
Trust me .
It 's because the Erlang VM can run for long periods of time , scaling linearly across cores or processors filling the same niche that Java does right now on the server .
Really , that right there should be a clear indicator of how ill regarded Java development has become that people are willing to embrace the insanity that is Erlang in order to avoid using it .
So what 's the solution ?
Well , this is the problem .
People have been tinkering with Java for years now , and there 's still no hope in sight .
There 's something about the Java culture which just seems to encourage obtuse solutions over simplicity .
As a Java developer , I was always so amazed at how difficult it was to use the standard Java Class Libraries for day - to - day tasks .
Every app out there ends up having to include 20 MB of . jars in order to get even the simplest functionality working because Java libraries are so low - level and incomplete .
Having to write a loop to pull in bytes and assemble them into a StringBuffer myself if I want to get a web page is not only a pain , it 's also incredibly short of implementing the HTTP standard compared to something like libcurl .
Why is this sort of basic functionality missing from Java 's standard install ?
This is the sort of overhaul I 'm talking about .
Adding closures or not in the next version of Java is just a new coat of paint on a burning barn .
Clean out the damn libs and make the language cleaner and leaner again is what 's needed .
I 'd love to go back to the days of knowing that I only had to think about the JVM to roll out an app on various platforms and / or servers .
And I loved the general security that the JVM 's sandbox gave as well ( who knows what sort of zero - day buffer overflow flaw is waiting in PHP ready to be discovered and exploited tomorrow ? )
But unless I know that I wo n't have to deal with libraries that barf on the smallest XML problem , or the need to write 200 lines of code to do simple Date calulations , it 's not going to happen .
For me or for many other developers out there .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 25 — Once again defying a veto threat from President Bush , the House on Thursday passed a bill to provide health insurance for 10 million children .
But supporters did not have enough votes to override the promised veto .
The bill was approved by a vote of 265 to 142 , less than the two - thirds needed to override a veto .
Last week , when the House considered a similar bill vetoed by Mr. Bush , supporters fell 13 votes short of the number needed to override .
The roll calls are not directly comparable because several lawmakers were absent on Thursday , many of them helping constituents cope with the California wildfires .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the latest vote was “ a step forward ” toward the goal of insuring millions of children from low - income families .
But the gains were not immediately evident in the roll call .
Of the Republicans who voted against the bill last week , none voted for the new version .
And one Republican who supported the old bill , Representative Vernon J. Ehlers of Michigan , voted against the new one , citing concerns that the measure had been brought up on short notice , without enough input from Republicans .
The Washington Post , God bless its Iraq - war - loving red soul , buried one of the most important war stories of the day in a little blurb hidden at the bottom of page 3 .
Namely , that Republican foreign policy expert , Senator Dick Lugar ( R - IN ) , blasted George Bush , the surge , and the overall chances for success in Iraq last night in a long , detailed speech on the floor of the US Senate .
The reason the Lugar speech mattered is n’t because substantively Lugar is correct .
It mattered because Lugar is the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He is also considered by many , me included , to be the top Republican foreign policy expert in the Senate .
Add to that the fact that Lugar does n’t make speeches like this – public criticism of the president , or of anyone , is n’t Lugar ’s thing .
And he certainly does n’t make such criticism when the atmosphere surrounding the issue is already superheated – i.e. , Lugar would n’t risk fanning the flames unless the situation were dire .
Lugar ’s speech could very well be a turning point for how Congress address ’ the war in the future .
Republicans are already sounding the alarm that come this September , they want to see us announce a plan to draw down our troop levels ( lest the GOP lose the next elections too ) .
Lugar just gave the mushy middle the reason , and the cover , to stand up and say “ enough . ”
The importance of his speech cannot be understated .
And it most certainly does not deserve being treated as a blurb buried on the bottom of the page .
You can read the text of Lugar ’s speech here .
Campaigners reacted with anger today to a ruling that residents of private care homes are not covered by human rights law .
The decision , which could affect up to 300,000 residents in the UK , came in the case of an 83 - year - old Alzheimer 's patient whose lawyers argued that her threatened eviction from a private home would violate her right to family life .
The House of Lords , by a 3 - 2 majority , rejected the argument the home was carrying out a public function by caring for people referred by a council , and was therefore bound by the Human Rights Act .
Kate Jopling , head of public affairs at Help the Aged , said today 's decision was " a sickening blow to older people and their families " .
" The vast majority of vulnerable older people receive their care from the private or voluntary sectors .
Today they remain without protection from abuses of their most basic human rights , " she said .
The charity called on the government to rectify the situation with legislation to give elderly or vulnerable people in private care homes the same protection as those in council - run homes .
" The legal system has failed vulnerable older people .
The government must not , " Ms Jopling said .
The patient , identified only as YL , has lived at the home since January last year when she was placed there by her local authority , Birmingham council .
The home , which cannot be named for legal reasons , is run by Southern Cross Healthcare , which wants to remove the woman because of disagreements with her relatives .
The central issue in the case was whether the act should protect residents who have been placed in the care of private sector providers but funded by local authorities .
Civil rights group Liberty , was represented in the case .
Its lawyer , Anna Fairclough , said they were very disappointed by the decision .
" It is open to parliament to be the last court of human rights and enact specific care home legislation to prevent local authorities from contracting out of dignity for Britain 's elderly , " she said .
Baroness Ashton , the minister for human rights , said she too was disappointed by the ruling and planned to sit down with all interested parties in the case next week , to discuss their options .
Andrew Dismore , MP , said the decision was contrary to what parliament intended when the Human Rights
Act was passed .
He urged the government to back his private members bill , the human rights ( meaning of public authority ) bill , to correct the position - or to urgently promote its own legislation .
Sir Bert Massie , the chairman of the Disability Rights Commission , described the current position as untenable .
" Many local authorities rely on care placements in the private sector .
This ruling will cement a fundamental inequality in disabled and older people 's rights - those in care homes run by local councils have legal rights to human dignity , those ' contracted out ' will not , " he said .
The British Institute of Human Rights accused the House of Lords of undermining the fabric of human rights protection in the UK .
" We know only too well that horrible human rights abuses occur in care home settings .
This case was an opportunity for the House of Lords to say once and for all that private and voluntary sector care homes ' stepping into the shoes ' of the state have a responsibility to protect their residents against human rights abuses .
The House of Lords failed in this task , " a spokesperson said .
" The responsibility now clearly lies with government to remedy this loophole . " '
A spokesperson for Southern Cross Healthcare said they were delighted by the ruling .
" The fact that the House of Lords has decided that private care providers should not be public bodies for the purposes of the Human Rights
Act does not in any way deflect from our determination to ensure that the privacy , dignity and safety of all our service users is protected at all times and Southern Cross as a company remains committed to that aim . "
In confronting international terrorism , President George W. Bush and Congress have abandoned the Founding Fathers ’ suspicion of unchecked power in favor of the French Revolution ’s Jacobins .
Their creed , voiced by Louis de Saint Just , proclaimed , “ No liberty for the enemies of liberty . ”
Accordingly , suspected enemies were routinely imprisoned without trial based on edicts of the French Terror .
President Bush has echoed the militant Jacobins : “ We must not let foreign enemies use the forums of liberty to destroy liberty itself . ”
He has similarly detained suspected unlawful enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay indefinitely on his say - so alone .
In so doing , President Bush has suspended the Great Writ of habeas corpus , with the consent of Congress in the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , by denying enemy combatant suspects an opportunity to challenge the factual or legal foundations for their detentions before an independent and impartial federal judiciary .
Congress should restore habeas corpus at Guantanamo Bay and renounce the Jacobins ’ creed .
An attempt in the Senate recently failed , but should be renewed .
The Founding Fathers enshrined the Great Writ in the Constitution to prevent the president from judging the lawfulness of his own detentions .
Making proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature , they worried that the president would be tempted to cast political or personal enemies into dungeons or to detain in furtherance of a political agenda absent checking by independent judges .
A narrow exception was made “ in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion [ when ] the public Safety may require it , ” neither of which fits September 11 , 2001 , or the threat of international terrorism .
Proponents of suspending habeas corpus for Guantanamo detainees proclaim their faith in the inerrancy of the United States military in capturing enemy combatants .
They contend that habeas corpus would be superfluous because only vile terrorists apprehended on the battlefield are being detained .
In support , they summon former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld and Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem , deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Mr. Rumsfeld characterized the detainees as “ the worst of the worst . ” Rear Adm.
Stufflebeem chorused : “ They are the bad guys .
They are the worst of the worst , and if let out on the street , they will go back to the proclivity of trying to kill Americans and others . ”
Members of Congress have scoffed at habeas corpus premised on their trust in President Bush — like the Queen of Hearts in “ Alice in Wonderland ” — to target only the guilty for detention .
But based on the government ’s own enemy combatant status determinations compiled by Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) , the probability of error is great .
Restoring habeas corpus is necessary to avert unjust life sentences and the corresponding creation of poster children for al Qaeda ’s recruiters .
Seton Hall law professor Mark Denbeaux and lawyer Joshua Denbeaux examined the CSRT records for 517 detainees released in 2005 .
They revealed that 55 percent of the detainees had not committed a hostile act against the United States or its coalition allies .
That finding discredits the idea that the detainees are “ the worst of the worst . ”
Moreover , “ hostile act ” was defined to include the following loosely incriminating circumstances :
“ The detainee fled , along with others , when the United States forces bombed their camp .
The detainee was captured in Pakistan , along with other Uighur fighters . ”
Only 8 percent of detainees were characterized by the CSRTs as “ fighters for ” al Qaeda .
Of the remainder , 40 percent had no connection to al Qaeda and 18 percent were unaffiliated with either al Qaeda or Taliban .
The definition of “ enemy combatant ” was elusive : “ [ A ] n individual who was part of or supporting the Taliban or al Qaeda forces , or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners . ”
Definitional vagueness invites error , a hazard compounded by the routine blending of terrorists into civilian populations .
Former Secretary Rumsfeld acknowledged : “ The circumstances in which individuals are apprehended on the battlefield can be ambiguous .
. ..
This ambiguity is not only the result of the inevitable disorder of the battlefield ; it is an ambiguity created by enemies who violate the laws of war by fighting in civilian clothes . ”
Only 5 percent of the detainees were apprehended by the United States .
The overwhelming percentage was captured by either Pakistan or the Northern Alliance , neither of which fields highly trained military units or other safeguards against mistaken identification .
The probability of wrongful detentions rocketed when the United States distributed flyers in impoverished Afghanistan wracked by ethnic , tribal and clan rivalries promising rich bounties for the capture of persons identified as enemy combatants .
One flyer , smacking of a Donald Trump infomercial , made economizing on the truth by Afghans irresistible : “ Get wealth and power beyond your dreams . …
You can receive millions of dollars helping the anti-Taliban forces catch al Qaeda and Taliban murderers .
This is enough money to take care of your family , your village , your tribe for the rest of your life .
Pay for livestock and doctors and school books and housing for all your people . ”
CSRTs are no substitutes for review of enemy combatant determinations by federal courts .
The military tribunals rely on secret evidence that cannot be rebutted by the detainee ; and , the CSRTs are biased instruments of the executive branch .
Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham testified before the House Armed Services Committee : “ When we found no evidence to support an enemy - combatant determination , we were told to leave the hearing open .
When we unanimously held the detainee not to be an enemy combatant , we were told to reconsider .
And ultimately when we did not alter our course … a new panel was selected that reached a different result . ”
Contrary to President Bush and Congress , the Great Writ of habeas corpus has a major mission at Guantanamo Bay : averting life imprisonments for the innocent unworthy of a civilized people .
Congress should restore the Writ forthwith .

Why did Bush do it ?
Why did he suddenly barge into the legal process and erase the entire 30 - month sentence of Scooter Libby ?
For , from his own statement , Bush found the act deeply distasteful .
In that statement , Bush calls Libby ’s crimes “ serious convictions of perjury and obstruction of justice . ”
He praises Patrick Fitzgerald as “ a highly qualified professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged . ”
Bush indicated no disagreement with the verdict .
“ [ A ] jury of citizens weighed all the evidence and listened to all the testimony and found Mr. Libby guilty of perjury and obstructing justice our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth .
And if a person does not tell the truth , particularly if he serves in government and holds the public trust , he must be held accountable . ”
“ I respect the jury ’s verdict , ” Bush added .
Bush went on to detail the punishments that will stand .
“ My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby .
The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged .
The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect .
The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer , public servant and private citizen will be long - lasting . ”
This reads like the preamble to Judge Reggie Walton ’s imposition of the two - and - a - half - year prison sentence .
Yet this is contained in Bush ’s explanation for wiping out Libby ’s entire sentence .
It is mystifying .
Why did Bush do it ?
Why did he intervene at all ?
Why now ?
Why not let Scooter go to jail and commute the sentence at Christmas , if he thought it excessive ?
The suddenness of Bush ’s action is easiest explained .
Hours before he tossed his commutation statement to the press , the court had turned down Libby ’s last request that he be allowed to stay out of prison as his appeal is heard .
Bush ’s need to act was obvious .
Scooter was on his way to prison .
But why did Bush rush to spare him even one day behind bars ?
Three explanations come to mind .
The first is that Bush capitulated to intense pressure from the neoconservative commentariat led by the Wall Street Journal and the Weekly Standard .
To these folks , Scooter is no felon .
Scooter is a hero .
In the neocon network , Scooter was the pivot man in the veep ’s office moving the cherry - picked intel on Saddam ’s WMD , Saddam ’s nukes , and Saddam ’s ties to 9/11 and al - Qaeda to a collaborationist press as determined as he was to smash Iraq and Iran , secure Israel , and control the Middle East .
So what if Scooter lied to cover up the White House campaign to carve up Joe Wilson ?
If Scooter did it , good Straussian that he is , he did it for the highest of motives in the noblest of causes .
To the neocons , Scooter is , in Ahmed Chalabi ’s phrase , “ a hero in error , ” one of the boys .
And as they saved him from the slammer , they will not stop until they secure him a pardon  to which Bush has now opened the door .
The second explanation is that Vice President Cheney went to Bush , closed the door , and asked , as a personal favor , that he spare Cheney ’s faithful friend and loyal aide the disgrace and pain of prison .
And Bush did this distasteful and shameful act at the behest of a vice president to whom he feels an immense debt .
The third explanation is that Cheney , and perhaps the president , fears that if Scooter goes to prison , and is staring at disgrace and 30 months away from friends and family , he may think he has been abandoned by people whose secrets he kept at the cost of reputation and freedom .
An idle mind being the devil ’s workshop , Scooter might sit down and write a book , or phone “ Bulldog ” Fitzgerald and tell him he just remembered something .
Whatever the motives of President Bush , this was a radical not a conservative act .
Whoever pressured Bush to wipe out Scooter ’s sentence was more a friend of Scooter than a friend of Bush .
For the president has damaged his reputation as a just ruler , so Scooter could elude what other men have to face .
Will the student deferments for these fellows never end ?
The act reeks of cronyism .
The perception is that Scooter Libby got preferential treatment , a get - out - of - jail - free card because he was chief of staff to Cheney and assistant to Bush .
That perception is correct .
Because of whom he knew , Scooter got preferential treatment , big - time .
The Godfather took care of the consigliere .
Nothing new .
After all , one recalls that the attorney who rustled up a pardon for Marc Rich from Bill Clinton was also a Beltway hustler by the name of Scooter Libby .
The insiders take care of their own .
And that is how the game is played in the big city .
Carlson Signed Off on a Recent Friday by Thanking ' All Eight ' of the People Who Watch His Show
Jon Ponder Byon
11/15/2007 , 3:00 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
I happened to catch the end of Tucker Carlson 's show on MSNBC a couple of Fridays ago , and heard him sign off with this :
CARLSON : That does it for us .
Thank you for watching , as always .
We mean that sincerely to all eight of you .
All eight of you ?
It 's not often you hear a cable host admit his ratings suck .
I knew someone at TVNewser would pick this up , and , sure enough :
A TVNewser tipster tells us " MSNBC management [ is ] infuriated " at Tucker 's flippant sign - off .
And Tucker underestimates his viewership by a factor of 10,000 .
His 10 - day average in the A25 - 54 demo is 80,000 .
He finished in third [ behind other shows in the same time slot ] on seven of those days , and fourth , behind Headline News , on three days .
In the background , of course , is the ratings success of " Countdown , " Keith Olbermann 's groundbreaking show at 5 p.m.
Olbermann has surprised nearly everyone in the cable news business by creating a rating success with news slanted to the left and commentary that often excoriates George Bush and his regime .
" Countdown " has been on for more than four years so it was just a matter of time before the executives at MSNBC noticed ( or could no longer deny ) that Olbermann 's show is the most successful live show in their line - up .
Now it seems they 're ready to copy Olbermann 's success by bringing on another liberal host ( which would make a grand total of two in all of TV land ) .
On the Monday after Carlson 's sad little sign off , the New York Times reported that MSNBC was in talks with Rosie O'Donnell to host a show on the network .
The Times suggested O'Donnell would replace Dan Abrams in the 6 p.m. slot --- against Larry King on CNN --- but I had my doubts .
Abrams recently returned to the air full time after a stint as the network 's general manager .
His show is n't doing that much better than former GOP congressman Joe Scarborough 's did in the same hour .
( Scarborough was moved to Don Imus ' old early morning slot . )
But Abrams is smart , polished and occasionally funny , plus he 's a lawyer and the next time a huge scandal with legal dimensions pops up --- and we are long overdue --- his show will get numbers .
MSNBC 's talks with Rosie fell through --- a fact that was a devastating blow to at least one group --- television trivia buffs .
She would have been the fourth person in the NBC news family named O'Donnell , which has to be a record of some sort .
Can you name the other three ?
( Answers below . )
As a former regular viewer of " Crossfire , " CNN 's battle - of - the - talking - points show which Carlson co-hosted for a number of years , I was surprised when MSNBC announced they were giving him his own hour --- a misguided attempt to attract viewers from Fox , I suspected --- and I 've been surprised ever since that they have kept him on the air .
There have been stories floating around in media circles for a while now that Carlson 's agent has been pitching him to host game shows ( and who can forget his stint on " Dancing with the Stars " ) , so maybe Tucker sees the writing on the wall and is preparing to exit gracefully when the inevitable happens .
If MSNBC wants to hire a liberal host to replace Carlson ( or whomever ) , here are a few people they should consider :
Stephanie Miller , who does a hilarious morning drive political show here in Los Angeles --- with the proviso that she must stay in LA .
Rachel Maddow , the Air America host who already has an on - air deal with the network .
Randi Rhodes , also on Air America , who is as smart and incisive on her feet as anyone in the media ( and whose producers often link to our stories at Pensito Review on her website ) .
Phil Donahue , who was fired by MSNBC because of low ratings and because he criticized Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war .
{ED NOTE UPDATE : Actually , our understanding is that Donahue 's ratings were the highest on the news channel at the time that he was cancelled .
The cancellation , was related to his politics , not to his ratings.}

Wexler Blog Radio Appearance Announced Thursday Night
( WASHINGTON , DC )
In only five days over 100,000 people have already signed - up to join Congressman Robert Wexler ’s ( D - FL ) call for impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney .
The overwhelming response to Wexler ’s advocacy for hearings illustrates the incredible passion that exists throughout the country , and demonstrates the true momentum that exists in favor of Congress holding impeachment hearings .
On Friday , December 14 , Wexler launched www.WexlerWantsHearings.com and asked Americans to join his efforts to convince Congress to hold impeachment hearings .
The online effort followed the release of an op - ed written by Wexler and two of his colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee , Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) and Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) , in which they argue that it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to hold hearings based on the significant allegations made against Vice President Cheney .
“ The tremendous response to my call for impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney confirms that Americans desperately want the Bush Administration and Vice President Cheney to be held accountable . ”
Wexler said .
“ I have been overwhelmed by the netroots support for my push for impeachment hearings and for my website “ “ WexlerWantsHearings .Com .
After only five days – over 100,000 people have signed up to show their support for impeachment hearings . ”
Despite the major media blackout WexlerWantsHearings.com has become a major topic of discussion throughout liberal and progressive blogs , driven in part by the lack of coverage by the mainstream media .
Wexler will appear on Blog Radio on Thursday , December 20 at 9:00 p.m. ( EST ) and 6:00 ( PST ) to discuss his efforts to convince Congress to hold impeachment hearing .
Wexler will appear on Progressive Radio with host Kenneth Quinnell and can be listened to on http://www.blogtalkradio.com/fpc
( a link will be also posted at www.wexlerwantshearings.com and www.wexlerforcongress.com).
On www.WexlerWantsHearings.com,
Wexler outlines the reasoning behind his support for hearings : “ Our Constitution mandates that the House of Representatives hold Presidents and Vice - Presidents accountable when they commit High Crimes …
Accountability and the rule of law are not partisan ; they are American .
They supersede politics and strategy .
We must hold all of our leaders accountable .
No exceptions , ” Wexler states on the video .
A copy of the online op - ed by Wexler , Gutierrez , and Baldwin , entitled “ A Case for Hearings ” , is available at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com and is also attached below .
In the editorial , the three Members of the Judiciary Committee declare that serious charges have been made against Cheney “ relat[ing ] to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens . ”
The Members of Congress further state that “ the worst legacy of the Clinton impeachment “ “ where the GOP pursued trumped up and insignificant allegations – would be that it discourages future Congresses from examining credible and significant allegations of a constitutional nature when they arise . ”

A Case for Hearings
By Representatives Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) .
On November 7 , the House of Representatives voted to send a resolution of impeachment of Vice President Cheney to the Judiciary Committee .
As Members of the House Judiciary Committee , we strongly believe these important hearings should begin .
The issues at hand are too serious to ignore , including credible allegations of abuse of power that if proven may well constitute high crimes and misdemeanors under our constitution .
The charges against Vice President Cheney relate to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens .
Now that former White House press secretary Scott McClellan has indicated that the Vice President and his staff purposefully gave him false information about the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson as a covert agent to report to the American people , it is even more important for Congress to investigate what may have been an intentional obstruction of justice .
Congress should call Mr. McClellan to testify about what he described as being asked to “ unknowingly [ pass ] along false information . ”
In addition , recent revelations have shown that the Administration including Vice President Cheney may have again manipulated and exaggerated evidence about weapons of mass destruction — this time about Iran ’s nuclear capabilities .
Some of us were in Congress during the impeachment hearings of President Clinton .
We spent a year and a half listening to testimony about President Clinton ’s personal relations .
This must not be the model for impeachment inquires .
A Democratic Congress can show that it takes its constitutional authority seriously and hold a sober investigation , which will stand in stark contrast to the kangaroo court convened by Republicans for President Clinton .
In fact , the worst legacy of the Clinton impeachment “ “ where the GOP pursued trumped up and insignificant allegations – would be that it discourages future Congresses from examining credible and significant allegations of a constitutional nature when they arise .
The charges against Vice President Cheney are not personal .
They go to the core of the actions of this Administration , and deserve consideration in a way the Clinton scandal never did .
The American people understand this , and a majority support hearings according to a November 13 poll by the American Research Group .
In fact , 70 % of voters say that Vice President Cheney has abused his powers and 43 % say that he should be removed from office right now .
The American people understand the magnitude of what has been done and what is at stake if we fail to act .
It is time for Congress to catch up .
Some people argue that the Judiciary Committee can not proceed with impeachment hearings because it would distract Congress from passing important legislative initiatives .
We disagree .
First , hearings need not tie up Congress for a year and shut down the nation .
Second , hearings will not prevent Congress from completing its other business .
These hearings involve the possible impeachment of the Vice President “ “ not our commander in chief “ “ and the resulting impact on the nation ’s business and attention would be significantly less than the Clinton Presidential impeachment hearings .
Also , despite the fact that President Bush has thwarted moderate Democratic policies that are supported by a vast majority of Americans — including children ’s health care , stem cell research , and bringing our troops home from Iraq — the Democratic Congress has already managed to deliver a minimum wage hike , an energy bill to address the climate crisis and bring us closer to energy independence , assistance for college tuition , and other legislative successes .
We can continue to deliver on more of our agenda in the coming year while simultaneously fulfilling our constitutional duty by investigating and publicly revealing whether or not Vice President Cheney has committed high crimes and misdemeanors .
Holding hearings would put the evidence on the table , and the evidence “ “ not politics “ “ should determine the outcome .
Even if the hearings do not lead to removal from office , putting these grievous abuses on the record is important for the sake of history .
For an Administration that has consistently skirted the constitution and asserted that it is above the law , it is imperative for Congress to make clear that we do not accept this dangerous precedent .
Our Founding Fathers provided Congress the power of impeachment for just this reason , and we must now at least consider using it .
_______
We have already reached 100,000 supporters .
Thank You .
Now We Need Each of You To Send an Email to Ten More People to Get 250,000 Signed Up at WexlerWantsHearings.com by the End of the Year .
I can guarantee that your 100,000 voices calling for impeachment hearings will now be heard in Congress .
Together , through our new Quarter Million Person Challenge , let ’s now set a new goal of 250,000 Americans signing up to demand action .
It has been just 5 days since I called for impeachment hearings for Vice - President Dick Cheney and already over 100,000 people – including you – have answered that call by adding your name as an impeachment supporter at www.WexlerWantsHearings.com.
This is a truly remarkable response that demonstrates the power that average , everyday Americans can have when we come together to pursue justice and accountability .
Never mind that the national media ignored my call and rejected an op - ed that I wrote along with my Judiciary Colleagues Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) .
The Netroots and citizen activists like yourself are spreading our message and demanding action .
Quarter Million Person Challenge
Our movement continues to grow by the hour and the day .
But , with the media blackout , I need your help to grow our effort .
With 100,000 supporters already signed - up , if each of you e-mail ten of your friends ( a “ Chain - ey letter ” ) about www.WexlerWantsHearings.com and the need for Cheney impeachment hearings we will reach over a million Americans and perhaps we can reach a new goal of 250,000 signers by the end of the year !!
Join Me Thursday Night on Blog Radio to Discuss Our Next Steps
On this Thursday at 9:00 p.m. ( EST ) and 6:00 ( PST ) , please join me as I appear on live on the Internet to discuss my efforts to convince Congress to hold impeachment hearing .

More on the Media Blackout
The New York Times , Washington Post , LA Times , USA Today , and Boston Globe have all rejected our op ed ( though the Miami Herald just put an edited version in its “ Letters to the Editor ” section ) .
We have heard from the editors of some of these publications and they are telling us that they are getting overwhelmed with phone calls and letters of complaint .
( Well done everybody ! )
In short – we need to keep the pressure on if this news will spread far beyond the Netroots community .
With warm regards ,
Congressman Robert Wexler

Russian President Vladimir Putin is making an astonishing bid to grab a vast chunk of the Arctic - so he can tap its vast potential oil , gas and mineral wealth .
His scientists claim an underwater ridge near the North Pole is really part of Russia 's continental shelf .
One newspaper printed a map of the " new addition " , a triangle five times the size of Britain with twice as much oil as Saudi Arabia .
Scroll down for more
The dramatic move provoked an international outcry .
The U.S. and Canada expressed shock and environment campaigners said it would be a disaster .
Observers say the move is typical of Putin 's muscle - flexing as he tries to increase Russian power .
Under current international law , the countries ringing the Arctic - - Russia , Canada , the U.S. , Norway , and Denmark ( which owns Greenland ) - are limited to a 200 - mile economic zone around their coasts .
Scroll down for more ...
A UN convention says none can claim jurisdiction over the Arctic seabed because the geological structure does not match the surrounding continental shelves .
But Russian scientists have returned from a six - week mission on a nuclear ice - breaker to claim that the 1,220 - mile long underwater Lomonosov Ridge is geologically linked to the Siberian continental platform - and similar in structure .
The region is currently administered by the International Seabed Authority but this is now being challenged by Moscow .
Experts estimate the ridge has ten billion tons of gas and oil deposits and significant sources of diamonds , gold , tin , manganese , nickel , lead and platinum .
A Russian attempt to claim Arctic territory was rejected five years ago , but this time Moscow plans to make a far more serious submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf .
A British diplomatic source warned
that Russia was planning to secure its grip on oil and gas supplies " for decades to come " .
Scroll down for more ...
He said : " Putin wants a strong Russia , and Western dependence on it for oil and gas supplies is a key part of his strategy .
He no longer cares if it upsets the West . "
The U.S. state department said the Russian claim was completely unacceptable .
" It 's an extraordinary idea and I can't believe it will go anywhere , " an official said .
A Canadian official called the move a complete surprise .
Green groups warned that the Kremlin claim could devastate one of the world 's last unspoilt areas .
John Sauven , director of Greenpeace UK , said : " We think nations should stop searching for new sources of fossil fuel and focus instead on the alternatives - renewables , energy efficiency and decentralised energy systems .
" Only then will disputes over natural resources become a thing of the past . "
Ted Nield , of the Geological Society in London , branded Russia 's claim nonsensical .
" The notion that geological structures can somehow dictate ownership is deeply peculiar , " he said .
" Anyway , the Lomonosov Ridge is not part of a continental shelf - it is the point at which two ocean floor plates under the Arctic Ocean are spreading apart .
" It extends from Russia across to Canada , which means Canada could use the same argument and say the ridge is part of the Canadian shelf .
" If you take that to its logical conclusion , Canada could claim Russia and the whole of Eurasia as its own . "

YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THE DEBATE ?
Fitness make it
Randy Pausch , a Carnegie Mellon University computer - science professor , was about to give a lecture Tuesday afternoon , but before he said a word , he received a standing ovation from 400 students and colleagues .
He motioned to them to sit down .
" Make me earn it , " he said .
They had come to see him give what was billed as his " last lecture . "
This is a common title for talks on college campuses today .
Schools such as Stanford and the University of Alabama have mounted " Last Lecture Series , " in which top professors are asked to think deeply about what matters to them and to give hypothetical final talks .
For the audience , the question to be mulled is this :
What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance ?
It can be an intriguing hour , watching healthy professors consider their demise and ruminate over subjects dear to them .
At the University of Northern Iowa , instructor Penny O'Connor recently titled her lecture " Get Over Yourself . "
At Cornell , Ellis Hanson , who teaches a course titled " Desire , " spoke about sex and technology .
At Carnegie Mellon , however , Dr. Pausch 's speech was more than just an academic exercise .
The 46 - year - old father of three has pancreatic cancer and expects to live for just a few months .
His lecture , using images on a giant screen , turned out to be a rollicking and riveting journey through the lessons of his life .
He began by showing his CT scans , revealing 10 tumors on his liver .
But after that , he talked about living .
If anyone expected him to be morose , he said , " I 'm sorry to disappoint you . "
He then dropped to the floor and did one - handed pushups .
Randy Pausch and his three children , ages 5 , 2 and 1 .
Clicking through photos of himself as a boy , he talked about his childhood dreams : to win giant stuffed animals at carnivals , to walk in zero gravity , to design Disney rides , to write a World Book entry .
By adulthood , he had achieved each goal .
As proof , he had students carry out all the huge stuffed animals he'd won in his life , which he gave to audience members .
After all , he does n't need them anymore .
He paid tribute to his techie background .
" I 've experienced a deathbed conversion , " he said , smiling .
" I just bought a Macintosh . "
Flashing his rejection letters on the screen , he talked about setbacks in his career , repeating : " Brick walls are there for a reason .
They let us prove how badly we want things . "
He encouraged us to be patient with others .
" Wait long enough , and people will surprise and impress you . "
After showing photos of his childhood bedroom , decorated with mathematical notations he 'd drawn on the walls , he said : " If your kids want to paint their bedrooms , as a favor to me , let 'em do it . "
While displaying photos of his bosses and students over the years , he said that helping others fulfill their dreams is even more fun than achieving your own .
He talked of requiring his students to create videogames without sex and violence .
" You 'd be surprised how many 19 - year - old boys run out of ideas when you take those possibilities away , " he said , but they all rose to the challenge .
He also saluted his parents , who let him make his childhood bedroom his domain , even if his wall etchings hurt the home 's resale value .
He knew his mom was proud of him when he got his Ph.D , he said , despite how she 'd introduce him : " This is my son .
He 's a doctor , but not the kind who helps people . "
He then spoke about his legacy .
Considered one of the nation 's foremost teachers of videogame and virtual - reality technology , he helped develop " Alice , " a Carnegie Mellon software project that allows people to easily create 3 - D animations .
It had one million downloads in the past year , and usage is expected to soar .
" Like Moses , I get to see the Promised Land , but I do n't get to step foot in it , " Dr. Pausch said .
" That 's OK .
I will live on in Alice . "
Many people have given last speeches without realizing it .
The day before he was killed , Martin Luther King Jr. spoke prophetically : " Like anybody , I would like to live a long life .
Longevity has its place . "
He talked of how he had seen the Promised Land , even though " I may not get there with you . "
Dr. Pausch 's lecture , in the same way , became a call to his colleagues and students to go on without him and do great things .
But he was also addressing those closer to his heart .
Near the end of his talk , he had a cake brought out for his wife , whose birthday was the day before .
As she cried and they embraced on stage , the audience sang " Happy Birthday , " many wiping away their own tears .
Dr. Pausch 's speech was taped so his children , ages 5 , 2 and 1 , can watch it when they 're older .
His last words in his last lecture were simple : " This was for my kids . "
Then those of us in the audience rose for one last standing ovation .

Earlier this year three Americans won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for laying the foundations of " mechanism design theory . "
The work of Leonid Hurwicz , Roger Myerson , and Eric Maskin was noted for its help in implementing efficient voting , trading , and regulatory schemes .
The official press release made it quite clear that although the Invisible Hand works well in the simplistic world of Adam Smith , it does n't always succeed in our complex real world , with its private information , transaction costs , and externalities .
According to the official statement , mechanism design theory is essential to " distinguish situations in which markets work well from those in which they do not . "
The press largely followed this lead ; the Washington Post 's headline read , " 3 U.S. Economists Share Nobel for Work on Flawed Markets . "
Such doubts about the market economy are unfounded .
Like most of the important results in mainstream economics , the prize - winning work in mechanism design is very elegant mathematically , and offers many counterintuitive results — yet it has precious little bearing on the case for ( or against ) laissez - faire capitalism .
Those who think otherwise are relying on a simplistic and naïve view of how the market and government actually operate .
Before arguing this point , we should first review some basics .
Mechanism Design Theory
A mechanism is a specification of the strategies available to every agent in an economy , along with the outcome that occurs under every combination of strategies the agents might choose .
The information available to an agent may be hidden from others , and an agent 's actions may affect not only his own welfare but also that of other agents .
Because of these two facts , the situation is far more complicated than the simple economic models of perfect competition .
As Myerson puts it , " Mechanism theory shows that incentive constraints should be considered coequally with resource constraints in the formulation of the economic problem . "
Although much of mathematical economics remains mercifully confined to the ivory tower , the apparently abstract approach of mechanism design has actually been used to refine voting procedures in NCAA football rankings , to match organ donors with recipients , and to improve trading rules on stock exchanges .
Because at least some of this impact has occurred in purely private settings , this is prima facie evidence that mechanism design theory is actually useful .
An Auction Example
In the classroom , the quickest way to convey the essence of mechanism design is to explain the different outcomes from various auction rules .
To this end , imagine two auction bidders competing for a painting .
Jim values the painting at $ 100 , meaning he would consider himself better off if he acquired the painting for under $ 100 , but would n't want to pay more .
The second bidder , Sally , values the painting at $ 200 .
Mainstream economists argue that a well - designed auction should ensure that Sally wins the painting .
Because she values it more than Jim , she could make him an offer for it ( of $ 150 , say ) and both parties would be happier .
So if the auction rules permit Jim to walk away with the painting , it would constitute a Pareto - inefficient outcome ; consequently mainstream economists would n't endorse such rules in the stipulated environment .
To see the importance of the rules of the game , suppose that the painting is auctioned off according to a first - price rule , where the person writing the highest ( secret ) bid wins the painting and pays his or her bid .
In this case , Sally might incorrectly estimate that Jim values the painting at no more than $ 50 , and so bid only $ 51 .
But since Jim in reality values the painting at much more than that , he might bid a higher amount and win .
Because of strategic considerations , we see that a first - price auction may be inefficient when bidders do n't know everyone else 's valuation .
But this problem is avoided in a second - price auction in which the high bidder gets the painting , but only pays the bid of the second - highest bidder .
It can be easily shown that bidding one 's true valuation is a " weakly dominant strategy " in a second - price auction where each person has a private valuation of the object .
Under this rule , Jim would never regret writing $ 100 on his slip of paper , nor would Sally ever regret writing $ 200 on hers .
Even if Sally thought Jim valued the painting at $ 50 , it would be foolish for her to write less than $ 200 , because lowering her bid does n't help her any , and it might allow Jim to win .
This simple auction example has illustrated the essence of mechanism design theory , in particular the important principle of incentive compatibility .
Because of private information and selfish motivations , the institutional framework is very important — the " right " rules lead to " optimal " outcomes while bad rules lead to economic inefficiency .
Mechanism Design No Criticism of Private Property
For those who equate " the free market " with " atomistic individuals who reduce everything to money , " it is obvious why the insights of mechanism design appear to impugn pure capitalism , and to justify enlightened government tinkering with spontaneous outcomes .
Yet this view relies on a false caricature of the market economy , and a naïve faith in political action .
First , the market economy is not characterized by the " rational fools " ridiculed by Amartya Sen .
To oppose government intervention in private property is not to don a top hat and send the crippled to be quartered and sold on the market for body organs .
For example , people living in a purely free - market society could quite consistently give to charities , make " investments " with no rate of return such as the X - Prize , and even feed and house their children without charging them the market rate for boarders .
Those who think these are " exceptions " to capitalism do n't understand what capitalism is ; in their view , nobody should ever spend money on a sports car because cheaper modes of transportation are available and hence more " profitable . "
When we reflect that the free market is far more nuanced than the mainstream model of perfect competition , it becomes clear that the insights of mechanism design are comparable to , say , Henry Ford 's innovations with the assembly line , or Peter Drucker 's recommendations for better corporate management .
Successful entrepreneurship upsets the status quo ; this is the market in action , not evidence of " market failure . "
To the extent that mechanism design in the past shed light on inadequacies in auction rules and other organizational proceedings , it merely showed the ability of a free society to constantly improve .
In the second place , even if we concede that Pareto - inefficient outcomes can occur in a free market , as demonstrated in certain mathematical models , it does n't follow that therefore the government ought to " fix it . "
To rush to this judgment assumes away all of the problems of government failure .
In particular , this conclusion only holds if we assume that ( a ) the politicians are smart enough to set up the model correctly , with all of the relevant information to plug into the parameters , and then derive the " optimal " policy , and ( b ) the politicians are noble enough to ignore their campaign donors and actually implement this ideal policy .
I am personally not convinced on either account .

The naïvete of mechanism design is epitomized in Myerson 's superficially very evenhanded evaluation of the socialist calculation debate , where he concludes that socialism does well from an adverse - selection viewpoint , but poorly from a moral - hazard viewpoint ( see pages 5 and 6 of this pdf ) .
Ah , this nuanced conclusion seems far more robust — far more scientific — than the verbal dogmatism of Mises in the original debate !
Wait a second .
Let 's look at the alleged advantages of socialism a little more closely :
Under socialism , there is no problem getting the manager to reveal type honestly , because he is willing to report his type honestly when we just pay him a flat wage no matter what he reports .
If we want to give him strict incentives to guide social decision - making about the project , the state could pay the manager ε( R — I ) if the project succeeds , but make him pay εI if the project fails .
For any ε>0 , this payment plan would give the manager a positive incentive to recommend the project only when its expected social profit is positive … .
This example is interesting for Tirole … because he is assuming that competition among investors in the financial market always lets the manager borrow at an interest rate such that investors get expected profit equal to zero given their information about the manager .
With access to such competitive lenders , low - type managers would want to imitate high - type managers to get their favorable terms of credit .
But under socialism , the monopolistic state lender can fully exploit the high - type manager , and then the low type would not want to borrow at all .
So we find that socialism may actually have an advantage here , because socialism can flatten the manager 's incentives to eliminate his temptation to lie about his chances of success .
As I say , Myerson is not one - sided in this treatment ; after discussing the merits of socialism , he goes on in the next section to describe a model where
socialism looks rather less appealing from the perspective of this moral - hazard model , as it forces us to admit either inequality or coercion or productive inefficiency into our imagined socialist paradise .
Indeed , our simple model does not do badly as a source of theoretical insights into the flaws of Soviet communism , and it formalizes some of Hayek 's informal intuitive arguments :
" To assume that it is possible to create conditions of full competition without making those who are responsible for the decisions pay for their mistakes seems to be pure illusion . "
One can understand why modern mainstream economists pooh - pooh the supposedly dogmatic assertions of Mises and even Hayek , in contrast to the generalized models of mechanism design that allow for a full analysis of different economic institutions .
Yet we must go back to the first block quote above , and ask whether Myerson 's qualified defense of socialism really has anything to do with Mises 's original critique .
Once we understand exactly what Myerson is talking about , it 's clear that he completely misses the Austrian claim .
Of course , this alone does n't mean the Austrians were right , but it does mean that the adverse - selection model that interested Tirole would n't have been too intriguing to Mises .
In the model to which Myerson alludes above , he is assuming that there are " high - type " and " low - type " managers .
The managers can borrow a certain amount , I , in investment funds from the state and earn return R on a project if successful , or earn 0 if the project fails .
The high - type manager is more likely to succeed , and the numbers are such that the state only wants the high - type managers to start these projects .
The problem is that the type is known only to the managers themselves .
Yet using the payment scheme explained by Myerson above , the high - type managers have the incentive to borrow funds and carry out the project , while the low - type managers do n't .
What 's more , the state can cajole the high - type managers into stepping forward for a relative pittance , compared to the high incomes earned in private markets .
There are several problems with this analysis .
For example , it assumes that the people who would squander state funds know that they 're second - rate managers ; yet surely the thousands of failed entrepreneurs in a capitalist economy show the weakness in that assumption .
Another problem is that the analysis ignores the " Who guards the guardians ? " issue ; why should we trust the state rulers to employ Myerson 's payment scheme , rather than some other politically motivated one ?
These objections ( some of which , I concede in fairness , spill over into the " moral hazard " discussion ) are all incidental .
In light of Mises 's critique of socialism , the fundamental shortcoming of Tirole 's adverse - selection model of socialist managers is that it takes for granted accurate profit and loss accounting .
That is , Myerson simply assumes that there is some project with a return R and a cost I .
Yet without a true market in capital goods , no one — not the state planners , nor the individual managers who may very well know their own aptitudes — can reduce the benefits and costs of an investment project down to two numbers .
The high - type manager might know , " If the state lends me 500 worker - hours , six tons of steel , 80,000 gallons of fuel , etc. etc. etc. , then I can produce so many kilowatt - hours of electricity . "
Yet this knowledge alone does n't indicate whether the project is worthwhile , whether it represents a proper use of scarce resources .
This point is crucial , so let me elaborate .
Myerson 's recommended compensation scheme only works if we can reduce all of the heterogeneous inputs and outputs to their market values .
In terms of direct utility from this collection of goods , the high - type manager might actually prefer some small percentage of the inputs ( e.g. , 0.01 % of the labor hours , steel , fuel , etc. ) to the same percentage of the output ( e.g. , 0.01 % of the electrical output ) .
So the purist can't even say that Tirole and Myerson have put the capital - goods pricing problem to one side , and successfully dealt with the adverse - selection problem .
Their " solution " itself relies on being able to motivate high - type managers with compensation packages that have positive market values , something that the manager would only recognize if there is a market for capital goods .
Granted , the proponent of mathematical economics could say , " C'mon Murphy , every model has to make some simplifying assumptions .
Yes , Tirole and then Myerson assumed away the issue of market prices for capital goods , in order to focus on the problem of managers who know their own types .
On that score , socialism works . "
But is it really fair to say that Mises overstated his case — and I have heard game theorists say just that — because in a model where we assume away his concerns , then his objections fall apart ?
Conclusion
Notwithstanding the official press release and subsequent media coverage , the goal of mechanism design is , generally speaking , to study how best to harness markets .
As Hurwicz himself said in a famous passage , " [ W ] hat economists should be able to do is to figure out a system that works without shooting people . "
It 's true that Hurwicz 's definition of coercion is much narrower than the typical libertarian's , but , even so , Austrian economists should not dismiss this field simply because of a few misleading stories in the media .
Mechanism design poses no threat to the free market .
As a Deep South community bayed for justice , attention focused on a group of misfit teenagers , heavy metal fans accused of killing the children in a Satanic ritual .
The case became a sensation at a time when a ' Satanic panic ' over cults was gripping 1990s America .
All three were found guilty .
Jason Baldwin , then 16 , and Jessie Misskelley , 17 , got life sentences .
Damien Echols , 18 , was put on death row , where he remains .
Now evidence , including DNA samples , has emerged to suggest the real killers are still at large and that three innocent men have been behind bars for almost 15 years .
' No reasonable juror would convict ... knowing what we know today , ' said defence lawyer Dennis Riordan .
The facts were simple enough .
The victims - Christopher Byers , Steve Branch and James Moore - were last seen riding their bikes on 5 May , 1993 .
Their bodies , tied with shoelaces , were discovered a day later near the Arkansas town of West Memphis , close to the Mississippi river .
They were only a few miles from home .
Police were shocked by the terrible knife wounds and signs of torture and concluded that some sort of cult ritual had occurred .
Attention quickly focused on the town misfits .
Under pressure , Misskelley confessed to the killings and all three were found guilty .
Now lawyers for Echols have lodged new evidence seeking to prove his innocence .
The case against the West Memphis
Three appears to have been more about rushed police work and hyped - up paranoia over non-existent Satanism than evidence .
The suspects were just unfortunate to be social outcasts and to like rock music .
First there was Misskelley 's confession .
Despite coaching by investigators , Misskelley - who was mentally retarded and had a drug problem - described the murders incorrectly .
He described sexual abuse that forensics proved had not happened .
He said the murders were in the morning , when the victims were in school , and that they were tied with ropes , not shoelaces .
Much of his confession seemed to be suggested by police interrogators .
The prosecution 's assertion that a Satanic ritual had taken place has also now been discredited .
The key expert witness on cults , Dale Griffis , had claimed in court that the marks on the bodies were clearly Satanic .
However , it was later proved that Griffis had got his ' PhD in cult studies ' from a fake Californian university that was later closed for being a ' diploma mill ' .
' Apart from being a travesty of justice , this is not a Satanic murder .
There is no ritual , ' said John Douglas , a veteran of the FBI who is working with the defence team .
The wounds that police claimed were ritually inflicted , including sexual mutilation , have also been shown to have been caused by wild animals , probably stray dogs , clawing at the bodies after death .
' To sell that to a jury was unconscionable .
They are scratch marks from some kind of animal , ' said Dr Richard Souviron , a forensics expert in bite marks .
Defence lawyers have tested two hairs found at the scene .
One was found entangled in one of the ligatures tying up one of the boys .
It has been matched with DNA samples from Terry Hobbs , a stepfather of one of the victims .
Another hair , found on a tree stump , has been linked by DNA sampling to David Jacoby , a friend of Hobbs who was with him on the day of the murder and provided him with an alibi .
No DNA evidence of any kind has been found at the scene to match any of the West Memphis Three .
Douglas , who pioneered the profiling of serial killers at the FBI , also believes they do not match the psychological profile of whoever carried out the crime .
He said the way the boys were killed , and their bikes , clothes and bodies hidden , suggested a sophisticated adult who knew the victims .
Sympathy for the Three is growing across America .
Marilyn Manson and Eddie Vedder of the band Pearl Jam have joined the campaign to overturn the verdicts .
A film is also being made about the case .
Called Devil's Knot , it is being co-produced by Clark Peterson , who made Monster , starring Charlize Theron .
' This is one of the great crime stories of modern history , and the new evidence makes it all the more compelling , ' Peterson said .
But for the moment the fate of the West Memphis Three still lies with the Arkansas attorney - general 's office .
It was last week examining the evidence and appeared in no rush to make a judgment .
' This process will likely take months , and possibly years , ' said a spokesman .

What are these ?
Written by Adrian Holovaty on December 12 , 2007
It 's here !
At long last , the print copy of the Django Book has shipped .
I received my author copies late last week and am still poking at them to make sure that , yes , a tangible book with my name on the cover has actually been printed , on real paper , by a real publisher .
Early drafts of the book have been available free at djangobook.com for more than a year , and co-author Jacob and I are grateful to all of the readers who submitted corrections and suggestions .
Jacob is going to update the site soon with the final text of the book ( which will be available free under an open - source license ) , and we plan to revise the online text over time with corrections and additions .
There 's something nice about having a paper copy , of course .
The book is available on Amazon , and I 'm told the big brick - and - mortar bookstores should begin stocking it soon .
Looks like it 's gotten some buzz already , as it was the number one best - selling " Software Development " book and number four best - selling " Internet " book .
Not bad at all !
What I 'm most proud of is not the fact that the book itself is doing well , but the larger fact that demand for information about the framework is high .
Now that the Django Book is finally in the can , I 'm mulling the idea of writing another book -- this time , a book about online journalism .
In the past two years , I 've been to ( way too ) many journalism - related events and conferences trying to spread the good word about " journalism via computer programming , " and I 've detected a strong , I daresay furious , demand , from journalists at all levels in the org chart , for information about this new form of journalism .
Higher - ups want to know why they should employ programmers ; middle managers want to know how to find them and how to treat them ; and working journalists want to learn these skills and strategies .
The problem is that I can't point them anywhere for in - depth information .
This book would attempt to solve that .
I want to take a shot at writing a manual , a manifesto , a practical guidebook to this emerging discipline of database - driven Web journalism .
It would be a combination of high - level strategy and low - level technique , probably split cleanly into two parts ( one for the suits , one for the non-suits ) .
That 's about all the thought I 've given to this idea .
What do you think ?
If you 're a journalist ( or even not ) , is this something you'd be interested in ?
The Bush White House has already issued new rules on an important environmental matter .
The federal Office of Surface Mining last month announced regulations that it says clarify the rules on so - called mountaintop mining , in which the tops of Appalachian mountains are dynamited away to get at coal seams beneath .
The new rules allow mining companies to continue to dump the excess rock and soil into valleys and streams .
Earlier this summer , the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers issued regulatory guidance to field officers that officials say brings some certainty to wetlands standards , after a confusing 2006 Supreme Court ruling .
But critics say the move will lead to the destruction of thousands of acres of wetlands .
The government guidance will be reviewed early next year after a period of public comment .
THE E.P.A. is currently contemplating a rule that would modify the Clean Air Act ’s procedures for measuring emissions from new power plants in areas with the cleanest air , including park and wilderness areas .
Democrats in Congress and environmentalists say it would allow soot and smoke from coal - burning plants to muddy the air in and around many national parks .
The agency is also working on two other major air quality rules to be issued next year , regarding ozone and airborne lead particles .
The E.P.A. also recently issued a study concluding that the health and environmental dangers from toxins emitted from oil refineries are low enough that no further controls are needed .
The administration is pursuing some actions that are widely seen as pro-environment as well , including the creation of a marine reserve in the Hawaiian Islands and a multibillion - dollar program for enhancement of national parks .
On health care , the administration issued guidance last month that will make it more difficult for states to expand the Children ’s Health Insurance Program to cover children in middle - income families .
The policy has no expiration date , but Congress could override it and allow states to apply for waivers to set more generous coverage standards .
The administration is also preparing new regulations likely to be published next year on airline security , mine - worker protections and automobile safety and fuel efficiency , White House aides said .
At the time , FBI agents were investigating White and Hawkins , suspecting that they were involved in pay - to - play in Philadelphia - raising campaign funds for Mayor Street and others in order to win municipal contracts for favored donors .
Later FBI agents in the case infamously placed a bug in Street 's office , but it was discovered before it recorded anything .
A new breed of ape
Ubuntu 7.10 , codenamed Gutsy Gibbon , emerged from the jungles last month and has been beating its chest ever since .
Touted as the easiest - to - use desktop Linux distro yet , 7.10 hopes to bring the power of Linux to the masses .
Linux has traditionally been used by software developers and hardcore tech enthusiasts , of course , but the operating system is increasingly being adopted by a more mainstream audience .
Ubuntu is already the most popular desktop Linux distribution because it offers impressive ease of use , and it 's quickly approaching feature parity with other platforms ( it also offers a few unique advantages of its own ) .
Ars tested Ubuntu 7.10 and its new features extensively on several different computers , including the Dell Inspiron 1420n that we recently reviewed with Ubuntu 7.04 .
The verdict : it 's impressive .
How impressive ?
Read on for our take on installation and new features like the graphics configuration tool and Ubuntu 's Firefox improvements .
Installing Ubuntu 7.10
Ubuntu 7.10 can be installed with the Ubuntu 7.10 LiveCD , a complete Ubuntu Linux environment that runs entirely from a CD .
The installer uses an intuitive wizard - style graphical user interface and includes adequate partitioning tools .
The LiveCD environment can be used to test Ubuntu 's hardware compatibility and also makes it possible to surf the web , use an instant messaging application , or play solitaire during an Ubuntu installation .
I tested the Ubuntu 7.10 installer on several computers and did n't encounter any noteworthy problems .
On my desktop computer , which uses three monitors and two graphics cards , I had to unplug two of the three monitors in order to get the LiveCD environment to display properly .
Aside from that , I have been able to install Ubuntu 7.10 on all of my systems without the need for additional workarounds .
For screenshots and detailed instructions on how to use the LiveCD installation tool , refer to the community documentation for the installer .
Updating from Ubuntu 7.04 to Ubuntu 7.10
Ubuntu includes a software update manager that enables users to obtain important security updates and software upgrades .
The updater leverages the APT package management framework , the same system that Ubuntu uses to install new software from remote repositories .
The package management system also makes it possible to upgrade directly from one version of Ubuntu to another .
This slightly experimental feature has been unreliable in the past , but is considerably more robust in recent versions .
I tested the upgrade tool on a Dell 1420n laptop that came preloaded with Ubuntu 7.04 .
Ubuntu 's upgrade tool is almost entirely automated and requires virtually no user intervention .
Before starting the upgrade , I allowed the update manager to perform all pending 7.04 updates .
Then I clicked the " Upgrade " button next to the 7.10 release notification box in the update manager .
Upgrading from Ubuntu 7.04 to Ubuntu 7.10
After displaying the release notes , the distribution upgrade tool gave me one final prompt before starting and informed me that 1,275 packages would be upgraded and 146 new packages would be installed .
The dialog window predicted that the upgrade would take just over two hours .
It took approximately one hour for the tool to automatically download all of the packages from the repository and it took another hour for all of the packages to install .
During the installation process , the upgrade tool requested permission to replace system configuration files that had been modified .
At the very end , the updater offered to uninstall obsolete packages , then prompted for a reboot .
The entire process was smooth and intuitive .
This is the first time that upgrading from one version of Ubuntu to another has worked for me , and the result was quite satisfying .
I only encountered one minor problem : when I rebooted after the upgrade , Ubuntu failed to properly detect my display settings and I was dropped into the Bulletproof - X configuration system so I could set my correct resolution .
When I installed Ubuntu 7.10 directly from the CD on the same hardware , it correctly detected my monitor settings , so the failure to properly detect my graphics hardware after the update was likely a result of a bug in the update process .
Aside from that glitch , everything else worked properly .
The other day in #haskell a few people were trying to figure out how to generate the list of all sublists of a given list .
Various people tried various kludgy things involving inits and tails and concatMap , none of which quite worked correctly , until :
13:26:10 > filterM ( const [ True , False ] ) " 123 " 13:26:11 [ " 123 " , " 12 " , " 13 " , " 1 " , " 23 " , " 2 " , " 3 " , " " ] 13:26:29 o_O
( lambdabot was n’t working so Baughn had temporarily run another one under the nick Baughnie . )
Anyway , this was sort of like that moment from Monty Python ’s Holy Grail when the townspeople are trying to guess “ what also floats in water ” , and King Arthur suddenly says , “ a duck ” .
To someone more well - versed in the ways of Haskell , Cale ’s code is probably unremarkable ; to me , it seemed like magic : although I ’m quite comfortable with monads I had never seen filterM before , and had no idea how this worked ( although clearly , it did ) .
So , I looked up filterM using hoogle :
filterM :: Monad m => ( a -> m Bool ) -> [ a ] -> m [ a ]
-- This generalizes the list - based filter function .
Here ’s where I did something interesting , and I ’m glad I did : instead of just clicking on “ Source ” to see the implementation , I decided to see if I could deduce the implementation of filterM , given only this information .
I ’d like to take you on a journey through my thought process : I learned a lot from this exercise and I think that anyone at about the same level of Haskell - fu as me ( i.e. comfortable with the type system and monads , but still picking up idioms and bits and pieces of useful library functions , etc. ) probably can too .
Ready ?
First , let ’s recall the implementation of filter :
filter :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] filter _ [ ] = [ ] filter p ( x : xs ) | p x = x : filter p xs | otherwise = filter p xs
Pretty straightforward : recursively take each element of the list , and prepend it to the result if and only if applying the predicate p to it returns True .
So now let ’s write filterM .
Note the type is almost the same as the type of filter , except that the predicate returns a Bool value inside a monad , and the resulting list is supposed to be inside the same monad .
The first case is easy , and follows directly from the type :
filterM ' p [ ] = return [ ]
If the second argument ( of type [ a ] ) is an empty list , this is the only possible implementation ( other than undefined ) : first of all , we know nothing about the type a , so there ’s no way we can generate anything other than an empty list if we ’re not given any values of type a in the first place ; second , we want the result to be a list inside a monad , but we do n’t know anything specific about the monad , so all we can do is return .
Now , for the recursive case .
Since this is supposed to be similar to filter , we ’ll first assume that we should do something with the first element , recurse on the rest , and combine them somehow .
First things first :
filterM ' p ( x : xs ) = let rest = filterM ' p xs in ...
Of course , rest has type m [ a ] .
OK , now what should we do with the first element , x ?
Let ’s look at the types : x is of type a , and the other thing we have ( p ) is of type ( a -> m Bool ) .
It ’s pretty obvious what we should do : apply p to a , and get something of type m Bool .
Then we can pull out a Bool value using do - notation and call it b :
filterM ' p ( x : xs ) = let rest = filterM ' p xs in do b p x ...
Now , what to do with b ?
Well , by analogy with filter , we should probably use it to decide whether to prepend x to rest !
The only difference is that rest is of type m [ a ] so we ca n’t just prepend x like x : rest .
We ’ll have to use liftM to apply ( x : ) inside the monad :
filterM ' p ( x : xs ) = let rest = filterM ' p xs in do b p x if b then liftM ( x : ) rest else rest
And we ’re done !
Here ’s the whole implementation , for reference :
import Control .
Monad -- for liftM filterM ' :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> m Bool ) -> [ a ] -> m [ a ] filterM ' p [ ] = return [ ] filterM ' p ( x : xs ) = let rest = filterM ' p xs in do b p x if b then liftM ( x : ) rest else rest
Does it work ?
* Main > filterM ' ( const [ False , True ] ) [ 1,2,3 ] [ [ ] , [ 3 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 1 ] , [ 1,3 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] * Main > filterM ' ( x -> if even x then Just True else Nothing ) [ 2,4..8 ]
Just [ 2,4,6,8 ] * Main > filterM ' ( x -> if even x then Just True else Nothing ) [ 2,4,6,7,8 ]
Nothing
Sure seems to !
A quick look at the actual library code shows that we did things a little differently , but filterM ’ is essentially the same as filterM ( I leave a formal proof as an exercise = ) .
All with nothing more than the type and a vague statement of purpose !
Of course , this is not the only implementation that fits the type — and I ’m not just talking about things like filterM ’ = undefined ; there are other implementations whose most general type is the same as filterM .
But it ’s still amazing to me how much information is to be found just in types .
And now I understand how filterM ( const [ True , False ] ) works … do you ?
( Hint : how does ( const [ True , False ] ) match the type a -> m Bool ?
How does sequencing work in the list monad ? )
Froomkin :
" The bottom line is this , " Bush said .
" Congress 's failure to fund our troops on the front lines will mean that some of our military families could wait longer for their loved ones to return from the front lines .
And others could see their loved ones headed back to the war earlier than they need to .
That is unacceptable to me , and I believe it is unacceptable to the American people . "
There 's so much to unpack just in that one paragraph alone .
For one , strictly speaking it's not Congress that would be failing to fund the troops , it would be Bush 's veto .
Bush of course has promised to veto the bill precisely because it requires him to withdraw troops sooner than he wants , not later .
And the American public is overwhelmingly in favor of such a withdrawal .

( CNN ) --
The photographer who took images of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto moments before her assassination Thursday told CNN he was " surprised " to see her rise through the sunroof of her vehicle to wave to supporters after delivering her speech .
Getty Images photographer John Moore captured Benazir Bhutto waving , moments before he heard gunshots .
" I ran up , got as close as I got , made a few pictures of her waving to the crowd , " Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore told CNN 's online streaming news service , CNN.com Live , in a phone interview Thursday from Islamabad , Pakistan .
" And then suddenly , there were a few gunshots that rang out , and she went down , she went down through the sunroof , " he said .
" And just at that moment I raised my camera up and the blast happened .
...
And then , of course , there was chaos . "
Watch Moore describe Bhutto's final moments »
Moore said he was about 20 yards away from Bhutto's vehicle when he took his photographs .
Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital , where she was pronounced dead .
Moore said he had been following Bhutto 's story since her return to Pakistan in October .
He was present October 19 when a terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi killed 136 people .
In the aftermath of that attack , " the rallies had been very small , " because of high security , Moore said .
However , the Rawalpindi rally was announced beforehand , he observed .
" Whoever planned this attack -- they had time on their hands to plan everything properly , and you saw the results today , " he said .
Between 5,000 and 8,000 were at the Rawalpindi rally , which was held at a parkground , he said .
" We [ the news media ] all expected it to be filled ... but there were less people there than most of us expected to see , " he said .
" When I talked with a number of people , they said that people were just afraid to come out , for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi . "
Moore said he himself expected there could be another attack following the Karachi massacre .
He said he stayed away from gates at the Rawalpindi parkground , where police were searching people , because he suspected that 's where a bomb would go off .
Moore said it was obvious that Bhutto enjoyed being with her supporters .
" She was clearly in her element , " he said .
" She just wanted to get close to the people , and obviously whoever was after her -- they saw that coming . "

By deciphering the text , victims get to see more explicit images
Spammers have created a Windows game which shows a woman in a state of undress when people correctly type in text shown in an accompanying image .
The scrambled text images come from sites which use them to stop computers automatically signing up for accounts that can be put to illegal use .
By getting people to type in the text the spammers can take over the accounts and use them to send junk mail .
Text chat
The scrambled text systems used to defeat automatic sign - ups are known as Captchas or " Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart " .
Typically they feature a disfigured word or one overlaid with artefacts that make it difficult for anyone but a human to decipher .
Many computer criminals have been trying to crack these systems to get at the net - based resources , such as e-mail accounts or blogging tools , they are designed to protect .
" The free e-mail services , so far , have been extremely successful at using Captchas to recognise a human being or an automatic program , " said Raimund Genes , chief technology officer at Trend Micro .
The Windows game uses humans to crack anti-spam security
The novel system for getting round Captchas uses images of a woman called " melissa " who invites victims to decipher the scrambled text .
Entering the correct text produces another image and another chunk of scrambled text .
Mr Genes said the Captchas seen with the first versions of the malicious program are all taken from the sign - up system for Yahoo webmail .
In the past many viruses have tricked people into opening booby - trapped attachments with the false promise of seeing explicit images , said Mr Genes , but this was one of the first to actually show people more images if people respond .
Because of the effectiveness of this technology , we have begun to see scammers adapt their tactics
Yahoo
Mr Genes said the program could prove because " the average male e-mail user would want to see more " .
So far the two security firms who have spotted the program , Trend Micro and Panda Security , have not seen many copies of it in the wild suggesting few people have been caught out .
Mr Genes said it was very likely a proof of concept program that might find wide use in the future .
" Maybe they are trying it out to slip under the radar , " he said .
" More and more malware does not want to get any publicity , it wants to be silent and hidden . "
The virtual stripper program arrives on machines that are already infected with malicious software , said Mr Genes .
The program comes to life when the Internet Explorer browser is used on infected machines .
The Captcha - busting program can run on Windows 98 , ME , NT , 2000 , XP , and Server 2003 .
Mr Genes recommended that people run anti-virus , anti-spyware and web watching programs to avoid infection and to install updates as soon as they become available .
A Yahoo spokesperson said : " Yahoo began deploying Captcha more than six years ago to help combat the ability for malicious programs to send spam .
" Because of the effectiveness of this technology , we have begun to see scammers adapt their tactics , where human beings solve the puzzles the viruses cannot . "
The company added : " Yahoo is continuing to innovate in our defenses against this type of abuse .
We have a number of mechanisms to help us detect and respond to abuse . "
Exposure to phthalates , a common chemical found in everything from plastics to soaps , already has been connected to reproductive problems and now , for the first time , is linked to abdominal obesity and insulin resistance in adult males , according to a study by the University of Rochester Medical Center .
The research adds to the growing suspicion that low - dose exposures to phthalates and other common chemicals may be reducing testosterone levels or function in men , and thereby contributing to rising obesity rates and an epidemic of related disorders , such as Type 2 diabetes , said lead author Richard Stahlhut , M.D. , M.P.H. , a Preventive Medicine resident at the University of Rochester .
The study was published today in the online edition of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
" Substantial declines in testosterone levels and sperm quality have been observed in the United States and other countries over the last several decades which and it urgently requires explanation , " Stahlhut said .
" While we can't say yet that phthalates are a definite cause , I am certain they are on the list of chemicals that demands careful study . "
Phthalates have been widely used for more than 50 years , but only recently implicated as a possible health risk in people .
Animal studies have shown consistently that phthalates depress testosterone levels .
Recent human studies have found that phthalates are associated with poor semen quality in men and subtle changes in the reproductive organs in boy babies .
This connection between phthalates and testosterone helped to establish a basis for the study , Stahlhut said .
Stahlhut 's group hypothesized that phthalates might have a direct link to obesity , since low testosterone appears to cause increased belly fat and pre-diabetes in men .
They analyzed urine , blood samples and other data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .
The NHANES is a large , multi-ethnic , cross-section sampling of the U.S. population acquired routinely by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Researchers reviewed data from 1999 to 2002 , the most recent years that phthalates levels were available .
Of the adult men available in NHANES , 1,451 had data on phthalate exposures , obesity and waist circumference .
Of these men , 651 also had fasting glucose and insulin levels required to calculate insulin resistance .
The analysis found that , as expected , several phthalate metabolites showed a positive correlation with abdominal obesity .
Indeed , men with the highest levels of phthalates in their urine had more belly fat and insulin resistance .
Researchers adjusted for other factors that could influence the results , such as the mens ' age , race , food intake , physical activity levels and smoking .
The phthalate family of chemicals is used in a variety of products from cosmetics , shampoos , soaps , lotions , lubricants , paint , pesticides , and plastics .
Phthalates soften plastic tubing , PVC , and are also used in the coating of some timed - release medicines .
More than 75 percent of the United States population has measurable levels of several phthalates in their urine , according to the study .
" Unfortunately , there 's still a lot to learn about phthalates , " Stahlhut said .
" The more difficult issue is what combinations of common low - dose chemical exposures might be contributing to these problems . "
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Thousands of people demonstrated outside a big U.S. Army base on Sunday to demand the closure of a defense department training school they say promotes torture and murder in Latin America .
Long - shot Democratic presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich joined the annual protest outside the Fort Benning Army base in Georgia to shut down the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation .
Protesters say it teaches security personnel from Latin American countries to use repressive tactics and that graduates have overthrown legitimate governments , citing a coup against Chile President Salvador Allende in 1973 as an example .
“ Over the course of several decades people trained here have murdered and tortured hundreds if not thousands of people , ” protester Bob Goodman of the Georgia Coalition for Peace and Justice said in an interview .
But a spokesman for the institute , the defense department ’s main Spanish - language training facility , denied it was involved in immoral activity and said promoting democracy was at the core of its mission .
“ It ( the accusation ) was never true and saying so with no evidence is a moral slander on the people who work there .
This is a U.S. army school that has to follow the doctrines and rules that apply to the U.S. army , ” said Lee Rials , spokesman for the institute .
Goodman said 20,000 people attended the two - day protest .
Monica Manganaro , a spokeswoman for Fort Benning where the institute is located , said there were 11,200 demonstrators and 11 people were arrested and charged with criminal trespass .
On its Web site , the institute , formerly known as the School of the Americas , said it taught a range of professional courses and has “ developed and implemented meaningful and effective training in democracy , ethics and human rights . ”
( AOL Autos ) --
Not too long ago , uttering the phrase " diesel engine " was enough to elicit a wince from car buyers whose memories of previous - generation diesels often consisted of knocking engine noise , that distinctly - diesel fragrance , and plumes of blue smoke curling from the tailpipe .
Mercedes '
Bluetech diesel engines are part of the new wave of " clean diesel " cars going on sale in the United States .
No more , however .
Most of the new generation of diesel engines are being touted , and rightly so , as " clean diesel " power plants .
They run on the ultra - low - sulfur diesel fuel that became available in the United States in October of 2006 .
Experts predict that diesel sales will increase by about 300 percent over the next 10 years .
That 's partly because diesel engines generally deliver anywhere from 20 to 40 percent better fuel economy than gasoline - powered engines , depending on the vehicle and engine size .
So , these days , diesel engines are one of the contenders in the so - called green - driving sweepstakes : the efforts of automakers to find the best solution to the problems of high - carbon fuel emissions .
As more and more consumers become more environmentally conscious , the decision to go with greener fuel sources is n't just altruism , it 's also good business .
According to the Clean Diesel Fuel Alliance , the use of ultra - low - sulfur fuel in the newer clean - diesel engines will result in significantly improved air quality .
Annual emission reductions will be equivalent to removing the pollution from more than 90 percent of today 's trucks and buses , when the current heavy - duty vehicle fleet has been completely replaced in 2030 , says the organization .
One automaker at the forefront of the clean - diesel movement is Mercedes - Benz .
Last year , Mercedes launched four new clean - diesel vehicles -- the ML320 CDI mid-size SUV ; the R320 CDI six - passenger luxury CUV ; the Mercedes E320 BLUTEC full - size luxury sedan and the GL320 CDI full - size SUV .
Next summer , for the 2009 model year , Mercedes is offering BLUETEC diesel - powered versions of its popular M- , R- and GL - Class SUVs .
The E320 BLUETEC boasts 40 percent better fuel mileage than a comparable gasoline - powered model , and its EPA city / highway rating of 27/37 mpg means it can cruise more than 700 miles on a single tank of fuel , said Patrik Borenius , manager of advanced product planning for Mercedes .
With a city / highway rating of 21/28 mpg , the R320 CDI gets 32 percent better fuel economy , while the ML320 CDI sport utility ( rated at 21/27 mpg ) provides a 26 percent improvement .
Both CDI models have a cruising range of over 600 miles before refueling .
" The new clean - diesel engines provide three key benefits , " Borenius said .
" It 's a more fuel - efficient technology , so the customer gets better gas mileage ; it offers environmental benefits by producing less carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses , and it's one of the answers to the energy issue , in terms of reducing our dependence on foreign oil . "
In April , the E320 BLUETEC was named the " 2007 World Green Car " at the 2007 New York International Auto Show .
Given that Chrysler was owned by Daimler for nearly a decade , it should not come as a surprise that , during that period , Mercedes and Chrysler shared diesel technologies .
So it 's also not surprising that Chrysler is now working some BLUETEC magic of its own .
The 2007 Dodge Ram 2500 and 2007 Dodge Ram 3500 heavy duty trucks -- powered by the Cummins 6.7 - liter Turbodiesel engine -- are Chrysler 's first BLUETEC Vehicles .
The Cummins 6.7 - liter Turbodiesel engine also delivers better fuel economy when compared to equivalent gasoline engines , says Chrysler .
And earlier this year , at the Washington Auto Show , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , together with the Department of Energy , tapped the new 2007 Dodge Ram Heavy Duty as the cleanest mass - production diesel - engine pickup truck on the market .
In addition to the Ram , current Chrysler clean - diesel - powered models include the Dodge Sprinter , with a 3.0 - liter Common - rail Direct Injection ( CDI ) turbodiesel ; and the Jeep Grand Cherokee , featuring a new 3.0 - liter V - 6 turbodiesel engine .
In Europe , diesel - powered models account for more than half of Chrysler 's sales .
Indeed , across the pond , diesel versions of numerous Chrysler vehicles continue to be popular , including the 2008 Chrysler 300C , Chrysler PT Cruiser , Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Compass , as well as the newer 2007 Dodge Caliber and 2007 Jeep Wrangler .
In fact , every Chrysler vehicle sold in Europe except the Dodge Viper offers a diesel engine as an option .
" Clearly we can't control what our customers want to buy .
And we can't just put products out there , with all expense associated with developing and producing them , if we do n't already think the consumer wants them , " said Don Altermatt , director of diesel engines engineering for Chrysler LLC .
" And right now , with all the concern about the environment , and fuel prices up over $ 3 a gallon again , and oil at around $ 100 a barrel , we are clearly hearing from our customers that they want something cleaner and more fuel - efficient .
So , to that end , if this is what the customers want , and we give it to them , that 's good for us , too . "
Volkswagen of America is another player in the diesel sweepstakes .
Presently , the VW Touareg V10 TDI , powered by a clean - diesel plant -- equipped with a standard diesel particulate filter ( DPF ) -- is available in 45 states .
Next year it rolls out the 2009 Jetta TDI Sedan and SportWagen , which will be powered by the 2.0L Clean Diesel TDI .
" Volkswagen has a 30 year track record of diesel importation to the U.S. , " said Keith Price , Volkswagen of America 's public relations manager / product and technology .
That track record dates back to the VW Rabbit Diesel in 1977 , when VW sold a modest 12,393 units of that vehicle in the U.S .
" And moving forward , we think that the now - widely available ultra - low - sulfur diesel fuel , combined with our new clean - diesel emissions - control technology , will address the perceived or real obstacles to more U.S. drivers going diesel , " Price said .
The perception issue is a real one : Many consumers are still wedded to the outdated notion that all diesel engines are dirty and noisy .
" But today 's clean - diesel engines are as clean as gasoline - powered engines , " says Chrysler 's Altermatt .
" The standards have really improved , and that 's partly due to the input from the government , in terms of implementing stricter emissions standards .
But we 've developed diesels in a responsible manner .
And in addition to now meeting those higher standards , these engines often provide the customer with engine performance that is the equivalent of gas engines , and sometimes better .
And in many cases , the vehicles powered by diesel engines are more fun to drive , because they have better low - end response .
" So we do have some work to do in terms of changing old perceptions about diesels , " he said .
" But the more of these that come into the market , the easier it will be to help people realize that diesel is now a very clean , viable alternative to regular gasoline . "

TORONTO -- Todd Bertuzzi's on - ice attack on Steve Moore
might have been ordered by former Vancouver Canucks coach Marc
Crawford , according to a report aired on CBC's " The National ' '
Wednesday night .
Bertuzzi grabbed Moore from behind during a 2004 game , punched
him on the side of his head and then landed on top of Moore ,
driving his head into the ice .
The bloodied Colorado player was
removed on a stretcher .
Moore sustained a broken neck and a concussion .
He filed a
lawsuit against Bertuzzi , the Canucks and their parent company in
Ontario in February .
A statement of claim filed in court by Moore 's lawyer and
obtained by CBC alleges that Crawford pointed to Moore 's name and
number on a board in the Canucks ' locker room during the second
intermission of that game and said " ... [ Moore ] must pay the
price . "
In an accompanying document , Moore 's lawyer claims Crawford's
statement was disclosed by Bertuzzi while under oath , and by
Canucks general manager Dave Nonis .
A month earlier , during a Feb. 16 game in Denver , Moore checked
Canucks forward Markus Naslund and that led to talk of retribution
against him , culminating with the Bertuzzi hit a month later .
Crawford , now Los Angeles ' coach , did n't want to talk about the
report after the Kings ' 4 - 1 loss to Phoenix on Wednesday night .
" I do n't think this is the forum to be talking about that , " he
said .
" We 've got enough of our own issues here with the Los
Angeles Kings .
Those are the things that I 'm concerned about .
I'm
not concerned about anything that 's said otherwise . ''
Bertuzzi , who signed a two - year , $ 8 million contract with
Anaheim in July , refused to comment when approached after the
Ducks ' 4 - 1 win over Buffalo on Wednesday night .
The NHL gave Bertuzzi a 17 - month suspension for the Moore hit .
He gave up about $ 502,000 in salary , and missed 13 regular - season
games and the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2004 .
He also was prevented
from playing hockey overseas during the lockout season .
Bertuzzi was later charged with assault causing bodily harm .
He
pleaded guilty and was given a conditional discharge and one year 's
probation .
NEW ORLEANS 
People who eat several fast - food meals a week are significantly heavier than those who do n't eat fast food very often , according to a new study released Monday .
Each additional fast - food meal packs on pounds , so someone who consumes one fast - food meal a week is on average 1 ½ pounds heavier than someone who eats no fast food , says Kelley Borradaile , an obesity researcher at Temple University in Philadelphia .
She presented her research at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society .
" These results largely confirm commonly held perceptions about the relationship between fast food consumption and body weight , " she says .
Borradaile and colleagues analyzed national survey data on about 4,600 adults who reported their height and weight and eating habits in 2006 .
Respondents said they purchase about five meals outside of their home a week , either take - out or dining out .
Other research shows a similar trend .
About 252 meals per person were purchased away from home in 2007 , according to NPD Group , a leading market research firm .
The Temple study found fast - food places are the top choices for breakfast and lunch ; casual dining restaurants and fast - food are top picks for dinner .
Among the findings reported Monday :
• The weight of people who consumed three to six fast - food meals a week was significantly greater than those who consumed no fast food or ate one to two such meals a week .
• Every additional fast food meal during the week was associated with a 1 ½ pound higher body weight .
" We do n't know if this is a direct cause - effect relationship , " Borradaile says .
" There may be other factors at play here , including sedentary lifestyles of people who tend to eat fast food . "
• About 50 % of respondents say they would be more likely to order healthful items if they were offered as part of a value / combo meal , and 41 % would like to have nutritional information on menus .
" These data reveal some important clues about what factors may help people make healthier choices at restaurants , " researcher Gary Foster says .

Among the findings reported Monday :
The weight of people who consumed three to six fastfood meals a week was significantly greater than those who consumed no fast food or ate one to two such meals a week .
It came in a shot glass with a frosty liquid on the bottom and a viscous layer of pale green absinthe on top .
Where the two met , they curdled .
If it did that in the glass , what would happen once it hit my stomach ?
Unfortunately , I can tell you : it was like drinking tomato sauce after eating ice cream .
No one else had ordered absinthe that night , which was a good thing since I got the last shot that was left .
They had run out of it over the weekend , Tony Rweyemamu , the bartender , told me .
That 's when people drink it , he said , usually a quick shot between beers or other mixed drinks , to speed up the lubrication process .
Jans Ende , a bartender at the Met , a private club , said he was n't serving it as much anymore .
'' It 's not that good , '' he said .
'' It 's not the legend that absinthe was . ''
Unless you happen upon a bottle that has been preserved , it is impossible to know exactly how it is different , or even whether it was good in its day .
Before the general ban early in the 20th century , absinthe had been produced for more than a century .
As Barnaby Conrad III states in '' Absinthe : History in a Bottle ' ' ( Chronicle , 1988 ) , it was created in Switzerland and originally issued as a tonic for French soldiers to fight fevers .
It was so popular that it became an everyday drink for soldiers and civilians .
Which is n't to say that it was good , but it was cheap -- as cheap as wine , at least , and with much more bang for the franc .
Early in the 20th century , though , absinthe became the scapegoat for many social problems .
The French government 's anti-absinthe campaign included claims that it caused impotence .
When people died of syphilis , doctors would name absinthe abuse as the cause of death to save them the embarrassment of the illness .
Switzerland , Belgium and the United States were the first to ban absinthe .
Eventually , the French government prohibited absinthe in 1914 , and the Pernod company developed pastis to replace it .
Pastis was still flavored with anise but not wormwood , but it is much different from absinthe in subtle but significant ways .
Its alcohol content is much lower , and it has a less complex flavor .
It ca n't be substituted for absinthe in cocktails .
Its greatest similarity , really , is that it is affordable , as absinthe once was .
Today 's absinthe , however , is the wealthy urbanite 's drink .
Classic absinthe , with sugar and water , averages $ 9 ; cocktails cost more .
When I ordered it at Three Three Three in Shoreditch , where many young artists live , the bartender made sure I knew it was expensive before she poured .
Just when you think studios could n’t act worse … they just keep on surprising you !
I ’ve just been notified by YouTube that 20th Century Fox has just filed a copyright infringement notice with them to have our review of the ass awful film “ Reno 911 : Miami ” taken off their site and deleted .
And before you ask … yes … the review was a negative one .
It is curious that they are claiming copyright infringement .
As most of you know , in our video reviews we will cut in clips from the trailers of the movies we ’re discussing .
Trailers that are made publicly available by the studios for anyone , anywhere to download at anytime .
on top of that , according to Stanford ’s website , “ Fair Use ” of material is covered under the category of “ COMMENTARY AND CRITICISM ” .
The site states :
“ If you are commenting upon or critiquing a copyrighted work –for instance , writing a book review — fair use principles allow you to reproduce some of the work to achieve your purposes . “
Let me repeat that I did n’t take clips from a pirated version of the movie …
I used the clips , in a legitimate “ fair use ” exercise , from a source that the studio themselves made fully and publicly available to everyone .
And yet they pulled my review of their terrible movie off of YouTube .
Fox knows full well that this has nothing to do with copyright infringement .
The review is ancient history , and I could care less about it .
But the principle here of a billion dollar studio using its legal department to have legitimate negative reviews of their movies taken off the internet is outrageous .

The Pirate Bay is one of the most popular file - sharing websites in the world and much of the content reachable via the site is pirated .
Here the founders of the site and those that keep it running talk about what they do , why they do it and how hard it is to stop them .
In times when the laws of many nations criminalise the swapping of pirated content , be it music , movies or software , the continued existence of The Pirate Bay might seem to be an anomaly .
Those behind the site say they do not fall foul of those laws because it acts as a search engine and does not directly host any of the content
But although it may not break Swedish laws that has not prevented the authorities from trying to close it down .
Last year police raided the building and seized its servers .
But what the authorities did not expect were the public protests that followed .
In the main the protesters were angry about the US film industry telling their parliament what to do .
They believed that senior US politicians forced their government to shut The Pirate Bay down , even though it was not doing anything illegal under Swedish law .
And that really sparked public debate .
The raid happened during an election year and file - sharing became a mainstream issue - it spawned a dedicated political party that quickly became Sweden 's third largest outside of parliament .
" You could argue that this is stealing , " says Rick Falkvinge , Pirate Party leader .
" The point is it does n't matter . "
" If you are to enforce copyright in the digital age , where a lot of this takes place in private communications , if you are to enforce that you need to monitor all private communications , and that 's not worth it to society or politically . "
' Okay to copy '
Three days after The Pirate Bay was shut down it came back to life and now Sweden 's pirates say they can not be stopped .
This is partly because now The Pirate Bay servers have moved abroad .
The site 's controllers say that they do not even know where they are .
At least one server stayed in Sweden and it is in the vaults of a bank in Stockholm , where it is hoped it will remain safe .
I still go to the movies , I still spend money on the movies .
Everybody does it so everybody wants to download movies
Peter Sunde , The Pirate Bay
The re-location of the servers is all part of the cat and mouse game the site plays with police .
Fredrik Neij and Peter Sunde make up half of team behind The Pirate Bay .
Their weapons are standard laptops , hardwired to the net because they do not trust wireless connections .
Fredrik does all the technical stuff : the server maintenance , the upgrading , the hardware and Peter works with the media and does a bit of programming on the site .
Neither one sheds a tear for makers of movies , music and software .
Says Peter : " I think it 's okay to copy .
They get their money from so many places that the sales is just one small part .
" Take the latest Bond movie .
What car was it ?
Oh , it 's a BMW .
His phone is a Sony Ericsson .
I do n't think that 's a coincidence .
I think they got a load of money for having those products in the movie . "
Both Fredrik and Peter use their site to download content .
" I do n't care , " says Peter .
" That 's the big thing , I do n't care .
If I want it , I take it , ' cause I can .
It might be moral to some people but I think it 's up to me to decide .
" Why should they [ take action against me ] ?
I still go to the movies , I still spend money on the movies .
Everybody does it so everybody wants to download movies .
The public opinion is it should be legal . "
Nor does Peter feel obliged to pay for what he is downloading .
" I do pay for it by listening to music , by bringing the music to my friends , they bring it to their friends and they go to concerts , I go to concerts , " he says .
" The actual product does n't have to cost anything in order to make money . "
Targeting the file - sharers
Unsurprisingly , that is not a view shared by the entertainment industry , as Jo Oliver from the International Federation for the Phonographic Industry explains .
" It 's just not practical to give away a creation for free , " she insists .
" There are people that need to be paid , who have worked on those recordings .
We 'll see what happens in the criminal trial in Sweden next year .
Hopefully that will lead to the closure of The Pirate Bay , but that remains to be seen .
Jo Oliver , IFPI
" Copyright is the mechanism and the law to make sure that that investment is rewarded and therefore that there will be more money to foster new artists , bring new content to the public .
" That 's how it works . "
For those not persuaded , legal action awaits .
The UK music sharing site OiNK has recently been taken down as has the popular TV Links sharing site .
There have also been wins for the industry in France , where the president is pressing for file - sharers to be tracked and disconnected should they persist .
" We do n't want The Pirate Bay to continue to operate in its current form just simply because of the damage that it 's causing , " says Jo Oliver .
" There is a Swedish criminal action underway .
We 'll see what happens in the criminal trial in Sweden next year .
Hopefully that will lead to the closure of The Pirate Bay , but that remains to be seen . "
Nobody is crying that people who used to go around selling ice to people do not have a job anymore because of the fridge
Peter Sunde , The Pirate Bay
The future
Rough waters may lie ahead for The Pirate Bay - but even if the legal challenge succeeds , not all are sure anything will change .
At least one national newspaper reporter thinks politicians have little appetite here to start changing Sweden 's laws , just to close down the site .
" In Sweden , surprisingly many people have been file - sharing , " explains Mats Carlbom , a Swedish political reporter .
" And it 's not only young people , obviously .
Maybe over a million , maybe two million people have been file sharing .
" The politicians have n't solved the problem .
That 's why I think the whole issue is put on hold .
They do n't know how to tackle this problem . "
As Swedish society ponders the way forward , Fredrik is busy shoring up defences .
He is working on a new system of sharing files .
He says it will be faster , more reliable , and make users harder to track .
The open source version , he says , cannot be brought up or brought down by commercial interests .
They are both taking the music and film industries to court for what they claim are illegal attacks on their site .
And if The Pirate Bay is outlawed they will just move abroad and run it from another country .
The ship , they claim , can no longer be sunk .
" Nobody is crying that people who used to go around selling ice to people do not have a job anymore because of the fridge , " says Peter .
" It would be stupid but it is the same thing .
" Technology has changed .
You can't go back , there 's no way to go back .
And I do n't think there 's a will to go back . "
They are almost all locations that are centered around an institution , like a university or military academy where many people are housed very close to their classes or jobs and the concentration of people and buildings conspires to reduce the amount of spaces that could be used for roads and parking of automobiles .
In one of the recent threads , I asked for good local statistical sources and got a few gems , including the Bikes at Work census data commute - to - work mash - up by zipcode .
So I ran a quick search on the highest walk to work locations in the US for towns over 1000 population .
The results were surprising to me in the lack of diversity :
So I raised the threshold to at least 20,000 residents .
Location POP % Walk to work
Ithaca city , New York 29006 43.33 %
Athens city , Ohio 21192 42.39 %
State College , Pennsylvania 38420 41.8 %
North Chicago , Illinois 36001 29.06 %
Oxford city , Ohio 22087 28.86 %
Fort Bragg , North Carolina 29246 26.13 %
Cambridge , Massachusetts 101355 25.76 %
Fort Hood , Texas 33595 23.87 %
College Park , Maryland 24590 23.28 %
Pullman city , Washington 24740 22.53 %
And again , with few exceptions , we find the pattern of high walking rates and major institutions of higher learning , military bases and areas of mixed use development .
So I then raised the threshold again to over 250,000 residents :
Location POP % Walk to work
Boston , Massachusetts 589141 13.36 %
Washington , DC 572059 12.27 %
New York City , New York 8008278 10.72 %
Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 334563 10.02 %
San Francisco , California 776733 9.82 %
Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 1517550 9.22 %
Newark , New Jersey 273546 8.03 %
Seattle , Washington 563375 7.72 %
Baltimore , Maryland 651154 7.28 %
Minneapolis , Minnesota 382452 6.85 %
While all of these cities have colleges and universities and other major institutions , they are part of a very large mix and cannot alone account for why these cities are on the list .
Even controlling for population density does not account for this distribution .
It 's clear that these are cities that grew to sizable populations before the automobile , which may explain why these major cities are on this list instead of Los Angeles , Phoenix , Atlanta , Houston and Dallas .
Surprising are two cities you might have expected to make this list : Chicago and Portland .
They are n't that far off , but while both cities are getting a lot of credit for their green initiatives they do n't seem to encourage walking to work as much as these cities above .
An even better question to assess walkability than % that walk to work would be the % that walk to the grocery store or pharmacy .
We looked at Walkscore as a metric before and found it had flaws , but was generally useful .
From this very high level look at this census data and Walkscore , it would seem that there are two major factors that influence the walkability of a city or town .
1. Major Institutions : Colleges , Military Bases where people live in dorms / barracks close to their employment / education as well as dining / entertainment / social destinations
2. Pre-Auto City / Village Design : Places created before / without the need for automobiles with close mixed uses of residential / commercial / workplace / dining/grocery/education/entertainment .
The keys to both seems to be co-location of people 's housing with the various destinations that they need / desire .
But there is a choice here that seems like one worth considering in greater depth .
If we want to create a post - carbon society , creating more walkable communities seems like a major priority .
But what kind of walking towns do we want ?

SCHULZ AND PEANUTS : A BIOGRAPHY
By David Michaelis
( Harper , 655 pages , $ 34.95 )
The comic strip " Peanuts " was more than a decade old when I started reading it as a kid in the mid-1960s .
At that time , " Peanuts " was becoming a force of pop culture , with best - selling books and a newly burgeoning merchandising empire of plastic dolls , sweatshirts , calendars and television specials .
The overwhelming commercial success of the strip often overshadows its artistic triumph , but throughout its 50 - year run , Charles Schulz wrote and drew every panel himself , making his comic strip an extremely personal record of his thoughts .
It was a model of artistic depth and integrity that left a deep impression on me .
While growing up , I collected the annual " Peanuts " books and used them as a personal cartooning course , copying the drawings with the idea of someday becoming the next Charles Schulz .
At that time , most of the strip went over my head , and I certainly had no understanding of how revolutionary " Peanuts " was or how it was changing the comics .
" Peanuts " pretty much defines the modern comic strip , so even now it 's hard to see it with fresh eyes .
The clean , minimalist drawings , the sarcastic humor , the unflinching emotional honesty , the inner thoughts of a household pet , the serious treatment of children , the wild fantasies , the merchandising on an enormous scale -- in countless ways , Schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow .
David Michaelis 's biography , " Schulz and Peanuts , " is an earnest and penetrating look at the man behind this comic - strip phenomenon .
With new access to Schulz 's personal files , professional archives and family , Mr. Michaelis presents the fullest picture we have yet of the cartoonist 's life and personality .
Born in 1922 , Schulz always held his parents in high regard , but they were emotionally remote and strangely inattentive to their only child .
Schulz was shy and alienated during his school years , retreating from nearly every opportunity to reveal himself or his gifts .
Teachers and students consequently ignored him , and Schulz nursed a lifelong grudge that so few attempted to draw him out or recognized his talent .
His mother was bedridden with cancer during his high - school years , and she died long before he could prove himself to her -- a source of endless regret and longing for him .
As a young adult , he disguised his hurt and anger with a mild , deflecting demeanor that also masked his great ambition and drive .
Only a few days left to Double your gift
One summer evening when I lived in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , I was snipping basil from the potted herb garden that I kept on the stoop in front of my brownstone apartment .
Kids were playing on the sidewalk , their high - spirited shouts echoing through the dense , humid air .
I absently popped a basil leaf in my mouth , savoring its flavor .
Photo : iStockphoto
One kid took note .
“ Oooh ! ” he shouted .
“ He ate a plant ! ” Suddenly , seven or eight ten - year - olds were pointing and gaping at me .
I had done something exotic , strange , suspect even : I had eaten plant matter .
For me , the story illustrates how far we in the so - called advanced economies have traveled from our agricultural roots .
In 1930 , 20 percent of Americans owed their livelihoods to farming .
Today , fewer than 2 percent do .
Nearly 40 percent of food is consumed outside the home .
In essence , we ’ve entered a post - agricultural age .
Knowledge about food production , which used to come from direct experience in the field or in the kitchen , now comes from food - industry marketing execs and government directives .
Where does our food come from ?
For most Americans , the answer is simple enough : supermarkets and restaurants .
In a nation in which almost nobody farms and few regularly cook , that ’s a fair response .
Of course , such skim - level reasoning hides vast social , ecological , and economic chains that ultimately tether us to the earth .
People can blithely devour , say , Chicken McNuggets dipped in ketchup , without ever thinking about the lot of factory - farmed chickens , working conditions in slaughterhouses or on farms , or the chemicals used to fertilize fields and kill weeds and pests .
Happily , a cottage industry has emerged within the publishing world to right the matter .
Eric Schlosser , in his groundbreaking Fast Food Nation , brought an investigative reporter ’s zeal to tracing the holy trinity of American eating — burger , fries , and a Coke — back to the far - flung fields , factories , corporate marketing meetings , and laboratories from which they hail .
Fast Food Nation , a best seller soon to hit the big screen as a fictionalized film , reminded many Americans that what ’s on their plate has a history worth thinking about .
And it taught New York book editors that food politics can sell .
This year has been a watershed in the food - politics publishing boom .
No fewer than four books released in 2006 tread down the path broken by Schlosser .
The best - known , Michael Pollan ‘s best - seller Omnivore ’s Dilemma , is probably also the best .
The author provides an exhaustive “ natural history of four meals . ”
Broadening Schlosser ’s mandate , Pollan trains a hungry eye not just on industrially produced fare , but also on the alternatives that have arisen over the past few decades .
He subjects the various U.S. food chains not just to a cold reporter ’s eye , but also to his gourmand ’s palate .
He reminds us that the industrialization of the food supply has caused more than just environmental and bodily damage .
It ’s also ruined many people ’s ability to take real pleasure in food .
Pollan ’s analysis implies something hopeful , though : that by reclaiming the pleasures of the table , we can reverse much of the environmental and social wreckage we create in feeding ourselves .
Hedonism , he implies , always suspect in the vague but persistent Puritanical strain that runs through American culture , may be socially useful after all .
For Peter Singer and Jim Mason , the veteran animal - rights polemicists , the pleasure principle does n’t matter much .
They ’ve come out with The Way We Eat : Why Our Food Choices Matter , a book similar in ambition and scope to Omnivore ’s Dilemma .
But if Pollan returns again and again to aesthetics — parsing , say , the subtle differences in flavor between a grain - fed Whole Foods organic chicken and a pasture - raised one slaughtered on the farm — Singer and Mason focus solely on ethics .
What are the costs , and who ( or what ) pays them , when I choose between , say , a meal based on meat procured at Wal - Mart or made from tofu bought at Whole Foods ?
As a framing device , the authors devote major sections to three families : one that eats the “ standard American diet ” of industrially produced fare ; another made up of “ conscientious omnivores ” who eat “ humanely produced ” meat and mostly organic vegetables ; and ( clearly closest to the authors ’ hearts ) a family of strict vegans .
Singer and Mason tag along with each family on grocery - shopping ventures and hang out in the kitchen to cook and eat .
Then they trace the major food items to their origins , exhaustingly documenting the production conditions .
While the wealth of information on display here is impressive — anyone who takes the ethics of eating seriously will want to own this book — the authors ’ lack of regard for aesthetics and pleasure occasionally leads them into odd territory .
At one point , they applaud an effort to conjure up “ animal - free meat , ” which they describe as a “ vast lump of meat , hundreds of feet across , growing in a culture fed on algae . ”
They fret that with current technology , “ producing muscle tissue in a laboratory equates to $ 5 million per kilogram , ” but hold out hope that one day such a process will be economical enough to “ supply the entire world with meat . ”
They award the project their highest accolade : “ we can see no ethical objection to it . ”
Yet the moral calculus here seems shaky .
Do we really want food corporations leaching cells from animals and creating “ food ” in vast petri dishes ?
To remedy the ravages of industrial food production , Singer and Mason prescribe more industrial food production .
The pasture - based , agrarian approach to meat championed by Pollan , predicated on moderation , seems to me more morally robust — and certainly more palatable .
Another book released this year , Samuel Fromartz ’s Organic , Inc. : Natural Foods and How They Grew , focuses on the rapidly growing organic - food industry .
Unfortunately for Fromartz , Omnivore ’s Dilemma , which came out a couple of months earlier , covers much of the same ground .
But Organic , Inc. remains worth a read .
A veteran business reporter , Fromartz knows how to lay out an industry ’s history in compelling fashion .
His chapter on California ’s organic baby - lettuce business — responsible for those bags of pre-washed , flavorless salad greens now found everywhere from Whole Foods to Wal - Mart — should be required reading for anyone interested in the commodification of organic .
Fromartz details how the baby lettuce craze started when Berkeley restaurateur Alice Waters ate a peppery mesclun salad in Nice in the early ’ 80s .
Her will to recreate that experience in Northern California helped catalyze what ’s now a $ 2.5 billion industry .
Fromartz describes how the mass production of baby lettuce drove prices down , making the product widely accessible but compromising its flavor and driving many small producers out of business .
These same processes , though , provided opportunities for new growers who sell direct to consumers in local markets , competing with the California giants based not on price but on flavor .
Thus Waters ’ vision of peppery Nice - style greens lives on in niches — for those who can afford it .
In Organic , Inc. ‘s most important chapter , Fromartz profiles Pennsylvania farmers Jim and Moie Crawford , one of the great success stories of the U.S. farmers ’ market movement .
The Crawfords were among the back - to - the - landers who pioneered the practice of selling directly to consumers .
Fromartz is excellent at teasing out the incredible amount of drive , tenacity , and innovation it takes to create a successful local - oriented farm business — and conveying how even the best - established operations rest on shaky economic ground .
After 35 years of farming and now approaching 60 , the Crawfords are still waking up at 3:30 a.m. to make the two - and - a - half hour trek to their Washington , D.C. , farmers ’ market stand .
And they still have yet to build a comfortable retirement fund .
Such are the sacrifices , Fromartz implies , needed to create a robust local food economy in a market dominated by giant retailers and megafarms .
Of all the food - politics books released in 2006 , the one with the most impact may end up being the one that seems the least significant .
Eric Schlosser himself , teaming up with journalist Charles Wilson , has come out with Chew on This : Everything You Do n’t Want to Know About Fast Food .
Like fast - food marketing execs , Schlosser and Wilson know that the easiest way to affect U.S. eating habits is to focus on the young and impressionable .
The fast - food industry has pursued this goal by directing hundreds of millions of marketing dollars toward the young .
Schlosser and Wilson have responded by repackaging Fast Food Nation to appeal to young readers .
Their goal : to make kids who have been drawn in by the fast - food industry ’s well - engineered aromas “ turn and walk out the door ” without ordering .
Chew on
This is a tour de force of agitprop , backed by 30 pages of footnotes and the reportorial integrity that made Fast Food Nation impervious to the industry ’s attempts to discredit it .
I have no idea how kids will respond , but I found the book ’s straight - talk style and simple , jokey prose irresistible .
Under assault by Schlosser and other sources , the industry has strained over the past few years to burnish its image .
Parts of McDonald ’s website these days read as though they were written by the Sierra Club .
Chew on
This shreds this empty rhetoric like a factory cutter preparing iceberg lettuce for its place on a million Big Macs .
I hope the book finds a wide audience among kids — and their parents and teachers too .
Despite the publishing blitz , it remains unlikely that many Americans know or care much about where their food comes from .
But these books may represent stirrings of a new , or at least long - repressed , hunger — a desire to reconnect to the sources of our subsistence .
The more we know about how our food is produced , the less likely we ’ll be to accept the slop cooked up by industry — or the environmental and social damage caused in the process .
People looking to walk into an Apple retailer and buy an iPhone with cash will be out of luck .
The company is now accepting only credit or debit card payments for the devices so they can track who purchases the phone , according to an employee at the Apple Store in New York 's SoHo neighborhood .
The new policy is Apple 's attempt to prevent people from purchasing and then unlocking and reselling iPhones , a situation that has been a problem for the company .
Apple wo n't let anyone without a credit card or debit card in their name purchase iPhones , according to an unidentified Apple Store employee in a phone interview .
" We need to track the purchases of the iPhone [ because ] we have people buying the phones , unlocking the phones and selling them , " she said .
A report by the Associated Press last week said Apple was limiting the purchases to two devices and allowing users to purchase them only with credit or debit cards .
According to store employees , the two - device limit has always been in place , but the noncash policy is new .
Apple 's public relations team did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the new policy .
However , it 's no secret the company is trying to stem the tide of unlocked and resold phones , now totaling about 250,000 .
Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook mentioned that number last week in a quarterly results conference call as the difference between the number of handsets sold -- approximately 1.4 million -- and those actually connecting via AT&T Wireless , the iPhone 's exclusive U.S. carrier .
If one analyst 's estimate is correct , those unlocked phones are costing Apple millions of dollars .
Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster said that he believes Apple receives US $ 18 per iPhone per month from AT&T Wireless , based on iPhone - related revenue Apple reported in its latest quarterly earnings , totaling more than $ 4.5 million in lost revenue .
Microsoft was considered to have escaped lightly after the European Commission found it guilty in 2004 of bundling its media player software with Windows to the detriment of competition .
It was ordered to sell a second version of Windows in Europe without its media player , but the new version was priced the same , few PC makers stocked it and the product effectively bombed in the market .
People continued to buy the original version of Windows , complete with the media player , and the remedy did little to help Microsoft 's rivals .
With its fresh antitrust suit filed with the Commission this week , browser maker Opera Software is hoping for a tougher penalty to rein in what it sees as Microsoft 's illegal bundling of its Internet Explorer ( IE ) browser with Windows .
One legal expert said that this time around , Microsoft might not be so lucky .
" The landscape has changed quite a bit between Microsoft and the European Commission since the last ruling .
If there 's a replay of what led up to the 2004 ruling , and Microsoft takes similar positions regarding bundling , then I would n't be surprised if the Commission comes down harder now , " said Chris Norall , a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Morrison & Foerster .
Opera argues that because each version of Windows comes with only IE preinstalled , Microsoft has an unfair advantage against rivals like Opera and Firefox .
That has helped it maintain a consistent market share on Windows PCs of around 80 percent , Opera contends .
The Norwegian company now wants the Commission to come up with a tougher remedy to overcome Microsoft 's advantage .
If the Commission agrees that the bundling of IE is just as illegal as the bundling of Windows Media Player was in 2004 , its remedy this time " will be tougher , it will have teeth , " said Norall , whose law firm is not involved in the Microsoft case .
One possible outcome would be to make Microsoft offer a second version of Windows without Windows Media Player , and to sell it at a lower price than the " complete " version of Windows .
That may give PC makers more incentive to offer it .
Opera 's preferred solution , however , is simply to force Microsoft to pre-load other browsers with Windows when it ships .
" In our minds , the best solution would be one version of Windows with a must - carry type of provision , " said Jason Hoida , Opera 's deputy general counsel .
Microsoft is likely to fight that remedy fiercely .
It says it will cooperate with the Commission 's investigation , but argues , as it has before , that consumers benefit from bundling its browser with Windows .
What 's more , it notes , PC makers and consumers are free to install any other browser if they wish .
Microsoft 's position my be strengthened by the popularity of rival browsers in Europe , notably Firefox , which has reached a market share of close to 40 percent in some key markets , such as Germany , studies have shown .
If Microsoft can argue that rivals to IE are gaining market share , it could help it persuade the Commission that antitrust intervention is not necessary .
Opera responds that the growth of other browsers has been levelling out .
" Firefox has attracted a lot of users , especially in the open - source world , but it has not been climbing consistently , " said Hakon Wium Lie , Opera 's chief technology officer .
In addition , he said , Opera 's complaint is focussed on Windows PCs , where IE 's share is higher , and not that of Linux or Macintosh computers .
However , it is uncertain that the Commission will exclude Linux and Macintosh computers when it considers the relevant market in this case .
Opera 's position may be helped by the previous antitrust judgment against Microsoft .
Three months ago the Court of First Instance endorsed the legality of the Commission 's 2004 ruling when it threw out Microsoft 's appeal .
The Commission will examine the new complaint " in light of the case law set in the Court of First Instance judgement , " Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said Thursday .
Opera expects the case to move along faster than the seven years it took to reach the 2004 decision , since the Commission has already deemed Microsoft to be a monopolist , and because Microsoft opted against a further appeal against that decision .
" There is an unappealed judgment , so we hope this will go faster , " Hoida said .
Thomas Vinje , a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Clifford Chance , which is representing Opera in this case , said : " The complaint is very short .
It does n't have far to look for a relevant legal precedent . "
In addition to the bundling charge , Opera also complains that Microsoft does not follow Web standards , putting rival browsers at a disadvantage .
The issue is significant because if all Web browsers do not use the same standards , Web site developers are likely to design their Web sites to work with the most widely used browser , which is Internet Explorer .
That gives people a disincentive to use other browsers .
Microsoft often takes part in debates over Web standards , and says it will implement them , but ultimately does not , Opera 's Lie said .
He pointed to CSS , XHTML and DOM as areas where Microsoft does not comply with or is inconsistent .
The Opera complaint is the second against Microsoft filed to the Commission since the 2004 ruling .
In February 2006 , the European Committee for Interoperable Systems ( ECIS ) complained that Microsoft is foreclosing the market for productivity software with its Office package .
Some expect more complaints to follow .
" The bundling issue is going to come up each time Microsoft adds a new feature to Windows .
Will there be more complaints ?
Yes , " said Norall .
From another part of today 's WSJ :
UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser al - Suweidi said last week he could start tracking a currency basket including the euro , but would only act along with other Gulf Cooperation Council members , including Saudi Arabia , that have ambitions to someday create a regional monetary union .
Bloomberg news service , meanwhile , reported Abdul Rahman al - Attiyah , secretary - general of the GCC , said proposals for revaluing the regional economic bloc 's currencies will be considered when GCC heads of state meet at a Doha , Qatar , summit Dec. 3 - 4 .
" This case will be presented to the leaders for them to study , " he was quoted as saying .
Officials in Saudi Arabia , the region 's biggest economy , however , were quoted saying they had no intention of dropping their dollar link for a basket of currencies .
Gulf countries , including the UAE , Qatar and Saudi Arabia , are under mounting social and economic pressure to drop their dollar links .
Amid a superheated , oil - fueled economic boom in the region , demand for everything from construction material to housing has stoked inflation .
Meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of foreign laborers , many of them from Southeast Asia , have seen the value of the remittances they send home each month shrink .
Here is a chart of various inflation levels in the region :
The weekly dollar chart says sell me :
This is a bear market chart .
Prices are making lower lows and lower highs .
Prices are also continually breaking previous support levels .
If this happens -- one of these countries breaks their dollar peg -- the chances are better than 50 % it would start a run on the dollar ( in my opinion ) .
It would cause a short - term dislocation in the market .
It would be very , very , bad .
Richard Brunstrom asked the authority to back his calls to scrap current laws , legalise most drugs and bring in a new system to control them .
While it agreed to support the report - to go to the Home Secretary as part of UK - wide consultation - it did not say current laws should be scrapped .
A senior police officers ' body called legalisation " a counsel of despair " .
Mr Brunstrom called the fight against drugs unwinnable but said he did not want " an anarchic free - for - all " .
He said there was a battle with " the flat earthers " who refused to look at the evidence suggesting drugs laws need a radical change .
I think he's not just thinking outside the box , he 's just simply wrong
Albert Owen MP
The chief constable said his report was not a " crusade or proactive - it is a response based on a degree of radicalism " .
The authority agreed that his report should go to the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly Government , which is about to conduct its own drugs consultation .
It also said there should be a review of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 , with the possible replacement of a Misuse of Substances
Act regulating all drugs , including nicotine and alcohol based on a new hierarchy of harm .
The authority further agreed to consider affiliation with the lobby group Transform Drug Policy Foundation .
Before the meeting , Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood told BBC Wales ' Politics Show that Mr Brunstrom was right to raise the issue .
' Not fit for purpose '
Ms Wood , a former probation officer , said she agreed with the chief constable that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was " not fit for purpose " .
She also agreed with his view that the UK 's drugs strategy was " unwinnable " .
" I 've seen myself how people are just recycled through the system , " she said .
Richard Brunstrom says he does n't want ' an anarchic free - for - all '
" I think Richard Brunstrom is doing some thinking outside the box on this , which is long overdue , " she added .
But Anglesey MP Albert Owen had said he hoped the authority would reject Mr Brunstrom 's recommendations .
" I think he 's not just thinking outside the box , he 's just simply wrong , " he said .
" We should have a three - pronged attack which is education , crime enforcement , which is prohibition of hard drugs and also rehabilitation . "
' Counsel of despair '
Last week Mr Brunstrom 's views were criticised by Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami who said claiming legalising heroin was the only way forward was " blinkered and dangerous " .
Alyn and Deeside AM Carl Sergeant said a more sustainable solution would be to tackle the causes of drug abuse .
Earlier , a spokeswoman for Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) which represents 44 UK police authorities , said Mr Brunstrom was entitled to his personal views .
" Acpo does not agree with the repeal of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 or the legalisation of drugs - this is arguably a counsel of despair . "
She added : " Moving to total legalisation would , in our view , greatly exacerbate the harm to people in this country , not reduce it .
" It simply does not make sense to legitimise dangerous narcotic substances which would then have the potential to ruin even more lives and our neighbourhoods . "

While in private business , Mitt Romney utilized shell companies in two offshore tax havens to help eligible investors avoid paying U.S. taxes , federal and state records show .
Romney gained no personal tax benefit from the legal operations in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands .
But aides to the Republican presidential hopeful and former colleagues acknowledged that the tax - friendly jurisdictions helped attract billions of additional investment dollars to Romney ’s former company , Bain Capital , and thus boosted profits for Romney and his partners .
Romney has based his White House bid , in part , on the skills he learned as co-founder and chief of Bain Capital , one of the nation ’s most successful private equity groups .
His campaign cites his record while governor of Massachusetts of closing state tax loopholes ; his involvement with foreign tax havens had not previously come to light .
In the Cayman Islands , Romney was listed as a general partner and personally invested in BCIP Associates III Cayman , a private equity fund that is registered at a post office box on Grand Cayman Island and that indirectly buys equity in U.S. companies .
The arrangement shields foreign investors from U.S. taxes they would pay for investing in U.S. companies .
Romney still retains an investment in the Cayman fund through a trust .
Campaign disclosure forms show the investment paid him more than $ 1 million last year in dividends , interest and capital gains .
In Bermuda , Romney served as president and sole shareholder for four years of Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors Ltd .
It funneled money into Bain Capital ’s Sankaty family of hedge funds , which invest in bonds and other debt issued by corporations , as well as bank loans .
Like thousands of similar financial entities , Sankaty maintains no office or staff in Bermuda .
Its only presence consists of a nameplate at a lawyer ’s office in downtown Hamilton , capital of the British island territory .
“ It ’s just a mail drop , essentially , ” said Marc B. Wolpow , who worked with Romney for nine years at Bain Capital and who set up Sankaty Ltd. in October 1997 without ever visiting Bermuda .
“ There ’s no one doing any work down there other than lawyers . ”
Investing through what ’s known as a blocker corporation in Bermuda protects tax - exempt American institutions , such as pension plans , hospitals and university endowments , from paying a 35 % tax on what the Internal Revenue Service calls “ unrelated business income ” from domestic hedge funds that invest in debt , experts say .
Kevin Madden , Romney ’s campaign spokesman , said there was nothing improper about the Bermuda arrangement , or in Romney ’s investment in the Cayman fund .
In neither case , Madden said , did Romney gain the ability to defer or avoid paying U.S. taxes .
“ I would disagree that these could be described as tax loopholes , ” he said .
“ These are perfectly normal and perfectly legal arrangements that American companies put together to be successful in the market . ”
The Cayman fund is registered at P.O. Box 908GT on Grand Cayman Island , corporate records show .
Like the Bermuda company , it maintains no office or staff overseas .
Romney first purchased a 3.25 % share of the Cayman fund , and was listed as a “ general partner ( passive ) ” before his retirement from Bain Capital in late 2001 , records show .
He put his financial assets into a blind trust in January 2003 , when he took office as Massachusetts governor .
Brad Malt , who controls Romney ’s financial trust , said Bain Capital organized the Cayman fund to attract money from foreign institutional investors .
“ This is not Mitt trying to do something strange , ” he said .
“ This is Bain trying to raise some number of billions from investors around the world . ”
The privately held Cayman fund does not disclose its total investment pool .
But Securities and Exchange Commission records show it has invested through a Delaware partnership in a California - based network of healthcare centers , a Texas real estate group , a New Jersey phosphate manufacturer and numerous other companies .
Romney is the wealthiest candidate running for president , with a personal fortune of up to $ 250 million , according to financial disclosure forms he filed in August .
His financial trust retains investments in at least 32 Bain and Sankaty equity , hedge and debt funds , among other assets , the documents disclosed .
Under his retirement agreement , Romney retains a share of the profits at Bain Capital , as well as the right to make new investments in Bain funds through his trust , until February 2009 .
Malt said he had repeatedly increased Romney ’s stake in the Cayman fund since 2003 .
He said he was unaware of the specific figures , but added that he knew he “ wrote a lot of checks , ” and that it paid a return of 20 % to 30 % a year .
Malt said he was “ pretty confident ” that he had invested in additional offshore funds for Romney since taking over the trust .
“ I do n’t care whether it ’s the Caymans or Mars , if it ’s organized in the Netherlands Antilles or the Jersey Islands , ” he said .
“ That means nothing to me .
All I care about is whether it ’s a good fund or a bad fund .
It does n’t affect his taxes . ”
Connections with offshore companies became a presidential campaign issue in April , when the Washington Post reported that Democratic candidate John Edwards had worked as a paid advisor to the Fortress Investment Group .
Fortress incorporated hedge funds in the Cayman Islands , allowing its partners and foreign investors to avoid or defer paying U.S. taxes .
The disclosure embarrassed Edwards , who has called for reducing financial inequalities in America and who had sharply criticized corporations that utilize offshore tax shelters .
Eugene Steuerle , co-director of the Urban - Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute , a nonpartisan Washington - based think tank , said he was troubled by the growing use of offshore jurisdictions , even for legitimate purposes .
“ There ’s clearly something wrong when you have to use post office boxes to conduct business , ” he said .
“ You ideally want a world where setting up shell corporations would n’t be necessary . ”
But offshore companies are now “ part and parcel ” of America ’s booming private equity and hedge fund business , said Kurt Schacht , managing director of the Centre for Financial Market Integrity at the CFA Institute , which represents chartered financial accountants , in Charlottesville , Va .
He defended the practice .
“ I do n’t think they ’re loopholes , ” he said .
“ It ’s not like they ’re trying to break the law .
It ’s just taking advantage of what ’s available under current tax laws . ”
As a presidential candidate , Romney regularly touts his successful business background .
But he rarely describes his unusual experience in the rarefied world of international high finance .
After starting as a management consultant , Romney helped found Bain Capital in 1984 .
Initially launched as a venture capital fund to provide seed money to start - up companies , Bain Capital quickly evolved into a leveraged - buyout shop .
Romney and his partners borrowed money to buy dozens of troubled companies , and then charged high fees to revamp management , consolidate operations and , in some cases , lay off workers .
To cash out and pay the underlying debt , they resold the companies or took them public as quickly as possible .
Romney took a leave of absence from Bain Capital in February 1999 to take over the scandal - marred 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics .
By then , Bain Capital already had opened its first offshore entities .
According to a report by Fitch IBCA , a major credit - rating service , Bain Capital managed more than $ 5.5 billion in assets by mid-1999 .
The total included $ 2 billion managed by Sankaty Advisors , which included at least two Bermuda - based subsidiaries set up during Romney ’s tenure .
Public documents do not disclose how much of the $ 2 billion was channeled through Bermuda .
The Sankaty funds are named for a red-and - white lighthouse on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket .
Romney legally remained the top executive at Bain Capital during his leave of absence .
On Feb. 20 , 2001 , a Bain filing to the SEC described Romney as “ sole shareholder , a director and president of Sankaty Ltd. and thus . . . the controlling person of Sankaty Ltd . ”
The company , it added , was organized “ under the laws of Bermuda . ”
Today , Bain Capital manages $ 60 billion in assets , according to a spokesman .
The total includes $ 23 billion in Sankaty debt and credit funds .
Half a dozen Sankaty affiliates now are active in Bermuda , corporate registry records show .
The Sankaty debt hedge funds are organized as partnerships in Delaware that produce taxable business income by investing in fixed - income bonds and other debt instruments .
Under tax law , even tax - exempt U.S. institutions may face a 35 % tax if they invest directly in such hedge funds .
By investing instead through a Bermuda corporation , the taxes are legally blocked , experts say .
In Congress , both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee held hearings in September that examined whether the use of such offshore blocker corporations allowed tax - exempt U.S. organizations to improperly engage in business .
“ A lot of people are looking at this , ” said a Senate investigator , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to deal with the media .
“ It grates that these people are only using these offshore arrangements to avoid paying taxes . ”
Janne Gallagher , vice president and general counsel of the Council on Foundations , a nonprofit membership group of 2,100 charities and grant - making foundations , said the practice was “ pretty prevalent ” in her field as portfolio managers sought to spread risk through hedge funds .
“ It ’s a substantial tax , and that ’s what generally has led people to invest in these offshore blockers , ” she said .
“ I think everyone would prefer not to if they could avoid the consequence . ”
Rep. Sander M. Levin ( D - Mich . ) introduced legislation that would allow tax - exempt institutions to make such investments without going offshore .
The bill passed the House but has drawn little support in the Senate .
As governor , Romney helped raise at least $ 300 million in much - needed state revenue by closing what he called tax loopholes .
Critics called the strategy a backdoor way to raise taxes , and Romney failed in an effort to give state officials the authority to penalize corporations that lowered their tax bills by moving their profits out of state .
As a presidential candidate , Romney calls for lowering the corporate tax rate , lowering income taxes and eliminating taxes on interest , dividends and capital gains for those earning less than $ 200,000 .
He does not discuss the use of offshore tax havens on his campaign website .

Times staff writer Walter F. Roche in Washington contributed to this report .
The number of young people who do not consider themselves Christians is growing , as is the hostility toward Christianity expressed by the next generation of non-Christians , claims a new book from David Kinnaman of Barna.org .
Money quote :
The study shows that 16 - to 29 - year - olds exhibit a greater degree of criticism toward Christianity than did previous generations when they were at the same stage of life .
In fact , in just a decade , many of the Barna measures of the Christian image have shifted substantially downward , fueled in part by a growing sense of disengagement and disillusionment among young people .
For instance , a decade ago the vast majority of Americans outside the Christian faith , including young people , felt favorably toward Christianity ’s role in society .
Currently , however , just 16 % of non-Christians in their late teens and twenties said they have a " good impression " of Christianity .
And so the polarization grows .
Here 's one reason :
Interestingly , the study discovered a new image that has steadily grown in prominence over the last decade .
Today , the most common perception is that present - day Christianity is " anti-homosexual . "
Overall , 91 % of young non-Christians and 80 % of young churchgoers say this phrase describes Christianity .
As the research probed this perception , non-Christians and Christians explained that beyond their recognition that Christians oppose homosexuality , they believe that Christians show excessive contempt and unloving attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
One of the most frequent criticisms of young Christians was that they believe the church has made homosexuality a " bigger sin " than anything else .
Moreover , they claim that the church has not helped them apply the biblical teaching on homosexuality to their friendships with gays and lesbians .
There 's a reason the gay question looms so large .
It is very hard to know what we now know about gays and still treat them as the moral pariahs and " disordered " threats to society that Benedict XVI and James Dobson do .
And when Christians are known by their fear rather than by their love , the reputation of the faith suffers .

The GOP would - be- presidents took the stage tonight in an attempt to achieve several objectives .
First they wanted to sell the notion that President Bush ’s surge is working .
Secondly , they wanted to insist that leaving Iraq would somehow dishonor the troops .
Lastly , they wanted to turn on Ron Paul and try to torpedo his candidacy .
Facing daunting tasks of a news channel that is at the heart of the machine , Faux News , Paul had to deal with being virtually ignored in comparison to the anointed candidates such as Giuliani , McCain and Romney .
Heck , he got one for every two questions to the other second tier candidates such as Huckabee and Brownback .
Besides the stacked deck , Dr. Paul also faced the attacks of the Fox News staff , disguised as questions .
The first question posed to Dr. Paul was a purposeful misquote , where he was asked about an alleged quote where he said that people should be allowed to carry firearms on airplanes and that by doing so , maybe the terrorists on 911 would have thought twice .
Of course this is not what Dr. Paul had said .
He had stated that if the airlines had not been required to submit to the government they could have protected their own customers .
The question was designed to give a question to Paul that he would have to correct instead of actually answering .
The second question though revealed the unbelievable bias of Fox News .
In response to a question about Iraq and troops , Paul reiterated that we needed to pull the troops home , period .
He has consistently said that we need to address the entire foreign policy and start protecting our own borders and our own country .
In response to the false notion that there would be a “ bloodbath ” if we just pulled out , Paul quickly reminded everyone that the same people speculating that there would be a bloodbath are the same people who said Iraq would be a “ cakewalk ” and a “ slam dunk . ”
He then correctly pointed out the faulty logic that says we need to stay for stability when it is widely reported that our presence on the Arabian Peninsula is what prompted the attacks of 911 .
The response from Chris Wallace was to pose his own follow up question which was , “ So you are saying you would take your marching orders from al Qaeda ? ”
Are you kidding me ?
The inherent bias in the question was disgusting during a debate forum and Chris Wallace revealed himself as nothing but a whore for the machine and not a credible newsperson .
Thankfully , Dr. Paul was up to the task by responding that he would take his marching orders from the Constitution .
The other candidates of course tried to turn on Paul immediately , crying about that we “ broke ” Iraq , so we must fix it .
What was far more egregious though was the notion that bringing home the troops would somehow dishonor their service .
Can you imagine if any democrat had intimated that somehow a soldier ’s effort could be dishonored ?
Facing the attacks ,
Paul responded that the American people did n’t break anything ; the neocons did by hijacking our foreign policy and that if something is not working you do not continue to sacrifice American lives , you fix the problem .
The last question Paul faced , and that ’s right America , three questions in an hour and a half from my count , was in response to another silly hypothetical posed by Fox News .
This hypothetical was designed to generate responses about blowing Iran up .
It had Iran on the verge of a nuclear weapon , refusing to cooperate with the world , and threatening Israel .
Fox started the answers with Paul , conceivably to try and get his opinions ganged up on again .
Paul again showed diplomacy and a respect for the constitution by saying he would have to go to the congress and would try and negotiate as opposed to finding scenarios where war is the only option .
The post - debate coverage started with Rudy on Hannity and Colmes where Giuliani mocked Ron Paul and suggested that he and Mike Gravel have their own debates .
Dr. Paul ’s great offense to King Rudy ?
He simply disagreed with the other candidates on the majority of issues , so therefore , he should be ridiculed .
The phrase , “ except for Ron Paul ” was uttered countless times in post - debate coverage as the machine tried to sell you on the two sides theory .
The notion that there are only two sides , republican and democrat and you must line up on one .
People like Ron Paul keep messing that notion up .
Please see my article from the other day for a more detailed account of this :
http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_anthony__070903_the_ghosts_inside_th.htm
Ron Paul must really be scaring the machine candidates for this concerted effort to tank his candidacy .
Whenever he was asked a question , it seemed that other microphones were elevated so the snickering could be heard .
Yet after every response , the audience erupted in applause for the straight - talking Congressman from Texas .
McCain seemed desperate to sell the notion that the surge is working .
Giuliani could not answer a simple question about his tattered family values record .
He went back to his great job as mayor of New York and ignored his three wives and hypocrisy during the Clinton debacle ; as well as his ties to organized crime .
Romney had a horrific debate and was not a standout .
Once again we had a platform full of people who think that killing more American kids brings them honor ; as long as it was not their kids .
That repulsive notion alone should give all Americans pause in considering any of these candidates .
Only Ron Paul said that we should respect the constitution and protect this country first .
In return he was ambushed by the network that hosted the debate and his challengers .
He was mocked for suggesting that maybe we should listen to the American people who want the troops home .
Even the words used by Fox and the candidates framed the debate .
Whenever a withdrawal was spoken of , it was referred to as retreat or surrender .
Whenever keeping troops in it was referred to as “ victory . ”
The president ’s surge was applauded and the groundwork was laid for continuing the war for untold years .
The only sane voice once again was Ron Paul .
He faced unethical follow up questions from the moderators and was largely ignored .
When he was paid attention , they tried to mock him .
Through it all , he stuck to his principles because that is what guides him .
When you believe in what you run on you do not need to write it down and read it off of cue cards .
Ultimately Ron Paul might be too libertarian for my liking , but when placed in front of the other GOP hopefuls who are fighting over who can blow up the rest of the world most effectively , he is the only light left in a party that continues to fade into darkness .

Do tachyons exist ?
There was a young lady named Bright , Whose speed was far faster than light .
She went out one day ,
In a relative way , And returned the previous night ! — Reginald Buller
It is a well known fact that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light .
At best , a massless particle travels at the speed of light .
But is this really true ?
In 1962 , Bilaniuk , Deshpande , and Sudarshan , Am. J. Phys. 30 , 718 ( 1962 ) , said " no " .
A very readable paper is Bilaniuk and Sudarshan , Phys . Today 22 , 43 ( 1969 ) .
Here is a brief overview .
Draw a graph , with momentum ( p ) on the x -axis , and energy ( E ) on the y - axis .
Then draw the " light cone " , two lines with the equations E = ±p .
This divides our 1+1 dimensional space - time into two regions .
Above and below are the " timelike " quadrants , and to the left and right are the " spacelike " quadrants .
Now the fundamental fact of relativity is that
E² − p² = m²
where E is an object 's energy , p is its momentum , and m is its rest mass , which we 'll just call ' mass ' .
In case you 're wondering , we are working in units where c=1 .
For any non -zero value of m , this is a hyperbola with branches in the timelike regions .
It passes through the point ( p , E ) = ( 0 , m ) , where the particle is at rest .
Any particle with mass m is constrained to move on the upper branch of this hyperbola .
( Otherwise , it is " off shell " , a term you hear in association with virtual particles — but that 's another topic . )
For massless particles , E² = p² , and the particle moves on the light - cone .
These two cases are given the names tardyon ( or bradyon in more modern usage ) and luxon , for " slow particle " and " light particle " .
Tachyon is the name given to the supposed " fast particle " which would move with v > c.
Tachyons were first introduced into physics by Gerald Feinberg , in his seminal paper " On the possibility of faster - than - light particles " [ Phys . Rev. 159 , 1089 –1105 ( 1967 ) ] .
Now another familiar relativistic equation is
E = m [ 1−(v/c ) ² ]−½.
Tachyons ( if they exist ) have v > c .
This means that E is imaginary !
Well , what if we take the rest mass m , and take it to be imaginary ?
Then E is negative real , and E² − p² = m² < 0 .
Or , p² − E² = M² , where M is real .
This is a hyperbola with branches in the spacelike region of spacetime .
The energy and momentum of a tachyon must satisfy this relation .
You can now deduce many interesting properties of tachyons .
For example , they accelerate ( p goes up ) if they lose energy ( E goes down ) .
Furthermore , a zero-energy tachyon is " transcendent " , or moves infinitely fast .
This has profound consequences .
For example , let 's say that there were electrically charged tachyons .
Since they would move faster than the speed of light in the vacuum , they should produce Cherenkov radiation .
This would lower their energy , causing them to accelerate more !
In other words , charged tachyons would probably lead to a runaway reaction releasing an arbitrarily large amount of energy .
This suggests that coming up with a sensible theory of anything except free ( noninteracting ) tachyons is likely to be difficult .
Heuristically , the problem is that we can get spontaneous creation of tachyon - antitachyon pairs , then do a runaway reaction , making the vacuum unstable .
To treat this precisely requires quantum field theory , which gets complicated .
It is not easy to summarize results here .
But one reasonably modern reference is Tachyons , Monopoles , and Related Topics , E. Recami , ed. ( North - Holland , Amsterdam , 1978 ) .
But tachyons are not entirely invisible .
You can imagine that you might produce them in some exotic nuclear reaction .
If they are charged , you could " see " them by detecting the Cherenkov light they produce as they speed away faster and faster .
Such experiments have been done but , so far , no tachyons have been found .
Even neutral tachyons can scatter off normal matter with experimentally observable consequences .
Again , no such tachyons have been found .
How about using tachyons to transmit information faster than the speed of light , in violation of Special Relativity ?
It 's worth noting that when one considers the relativistic quantum mechanics of tachyons , the question of whether they " really " go faster than the speed of light becomes much more touchy !
In this framework , tachyons are waves that satisfy a wave equation .
Let 's treat free tachyons of spin zero , for simplicity .
We 'll set c = 1 to keep things less messy .
The wavefunction of a single such tachyon can be expected to satisfy the usual equation for spin- zero particles , the Klein - Gordon equation :
(□ + m² ) φ = 0
where □ is the D'Alembertian , which in 3+1 dimensions is just
□ = ∂² /∂t² − ∂² / ∂x² − ∂² / ∂y² − ∂² /∂z² .
The difference with tachyons is that m² is negative , and so m is imaginary .
To simplify the math a bit , let 's work in 1+1 dimensions with co-ordinates x and t , so that
□ = ∂² /∂t² − ∂² /∂x² .
Everything we 'll say generalizes to the real - world 3+1 - dimensional case .
Now , regardless of m , any solution is a linear combination , or superposition , of solutions of the form
φ ( t , x ) = exp ( −iEt + ipx )
where E² − p² = m² .
When m² is negative there are two essentially different cases .
Either | p | ≥ | E | , in which case E is real and we get solutions that look like waves whose crests move along at the rate | p/ E | ≥ 1 , i.e. , no slower than the speed of light .
Or | p | < | E | , in which case E is imaginary and we get solutions that look like waves that amplify exponentially as time passes !
We can decide as we please whether or not we want to consider the second type of solution .
They seem weird , but then the whole business is weird , after all .
(1) If we do permit the second type of solution , we can solve the Klein - Gordon equation with any reasonable initial data — that is , any reasonable values of φ and its first time derivative at t = 0 .
( For the precise definition of " reasonable " , consult your local mathematician . )
This is typical of wave equations .
And , also typical of wave equations , we can prove the following thing : if the solution φ and its time derivative are zero outside the interval [ −L , L ] when t = 0 , they will be zero outside the interval [ − L− | t | , L + | t | ] at any time t.
In other words , localized disturbances do not spread with speed faster than the speed of light !
This seems to go against our notion that tachyons move faster than the speed of light , but it 's a mathematical fact , known as " unit propagation velocity " .
(2) If we do n't permit the second sort of solution , we can't solve the Klein - Gordon equation for all reasonable initial data , but only for initial data whose Fourier transforms vanish in the interval [ −| m | , | m | ] .
By the Paley - Wiener theorem this has an odd consequence : it becomes impossible to solve the equation for initial data that vanish outside some interval [ −L , L ] !
In other words , we can no longer " localize " our tachyon in any bounded region in the first place , so it becomes impossible to decide whether or not there is " unit propagation velocity " in the precise sense of part ( 1 ) .
Of course , the crests of the waves exp ( −iEt + ipx ) move faster than the speed of light , but these waves were never localized in the first place !
The bottom line is that you can't use tachyons to send information faster than the speed of light from one place to another .
Doing so would require creating a message encoded some way in a localized tachyon field , and sending it off at superluminal speed toward the intended receiver .
But as we have seen you can't have it both ways : localized tachyon disturbances are subluminal and superluminal disturbances are nonlocal .

We have another cool new CSS feature to talk about : animation specified in CSS .
There is a lot of ground to cover here , so we ’ll start with the basics first .
The simplest kind of animation that we ’ve added support for is called a transition .
Normally when the value of a CSS property changes , the rendered result is instantly updated , with the element in question changing immediately from the old property value to the new property value .
Transitions describe how to instead execute an animation from the old state to the new state over time .
Transitions are specified using the following properties :
transition - property – What property should animate , e.g. , opacity .
transition - duration – How long the transition should last .
transition - timing - function – The timing function for the transition ( e.g. , linear vs. ease - in vs. a custom cubic bezier function ) .
transition – A shorthand for all three properties .
Here is a simple example :
div { opacity : 1 ; - webkit - transition : opacity 1s linear ; } div:hover { opacity : 0 ; }
This div will fade out when hovered over .
In browsers that do not support this animation , there will be graceful degradation , as the div will simply fade out immediately .
Each of these properties supports a comma separated list of values , like CSS3 multiple backgrounds , which allows different transitions for individual properties to be described in a single style rule .
Each value in the list corresponds to the value at that same position in the other properties .
For example :
div { - webkit - transition - property : opacity , left ; - webkit - transition - duration : 2s , 4s ; }
In the above style rule , opacity will animate over 2 seconds , but left will animate over 4 seconds .
Some very complex properties can actually be animated .
Take , for example , the new - webkit - transform property .
Here ’s an example of a simple spin effect using - webkit - transform and - webkit - transition .
< div style= " - webkit- transition : - webkit-transform 3s ease - in " onclick = " this.style.webkitTransform='rotate ( 360deg ) ' " >
This div will do a spin when clicked !
</div>
This div will do a spin the first time it is clicked !
Borders can also be animated .
The following box has a simple border animation where the border will both grow in thickness and change color when the box is hovered .
This div will acquire a slightly thicker blue border when hovered .
Note with the hovering examples that the animation will reverse itself when the mouse moves out of the div .
Any time the property changes value , the animation will simply start again with the current position as the from value and the new value as the destination .
The transition properties of the source state are used to figure out how to animate to the new target state .
The key points to understand about transitions are :
(1) They are implicit animations .
Scripts and stylesheets can be written as normal , and the animations will simply happen implicitly as the properties change values .
(2) They degrade gracefully .
Browsers that do not support transitions simply wo n’t animate , but otherwise all code and style rules can remain the same .
Here are more detailed descriptions of the properties .
All of these properties can take multiple comma-separated values .
transition - property
Values : none | all | < property >
Initial Value : all
Description : Specifies what property triggers an animation .
A value of none means there is no transition .
A value of all means that every animatable property triggers an animation .
Otherwise an animation will only trigger when the exact specified property changes value .
transition - duration
Values : < time >
Inital Value : 0
Description : Specifies how long the transition should take .
The default is 0 .
transition - timing - function
Values : ease | linear | ease - in | ease - out | ease - in - out | cubic - bezier ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 )
Initial Value : ease
Description :
The transition - timing - function property describes how the animation will proceed over time .
Keywords can be used for common functions or the control points for a cubic bezier function can be given for complete control of the transition function .
To specify a cubic bezier function , you give an X and Y values for 2 of the control points of the curve .
Point P0 is implicitly set to ( 0,0 ) and P3 is implicitly set to ( 1,1 ) .
These 4 points are used to compute a cubic bezier curve .
The timing function keywords have the following definitions :
linear –
The linear function just returns as its output the input that it received .
default ease –
The default function , ease , is equivalent to cubic - bezier ( 0.25 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 1.0 ) .
ease - in – The ease - in function is equivalent to cubic - bezier ( 0.42 , 0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) .
ease - out – The ease - out function is equivalent to cubic - bezier ( 0 , 0 , 0.58 , 1.0 ) .
ease - in - out – The ease - in - out function is equivalent to cubic - bezier ( 0.42 , 0 , 0.58 , 1.0 )
cubic - bezier – Specifies a cubic - bezier curve whose P0 and P3 points are ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) respectively .
The four values specify points P1 and P2 of the curve as ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) .
In future posts I ’ll go into transitions in more detail and also talk about another feature we ’re adding : explicit animations .
We are also preparing a more detailed proposal ( full of intimidating spec language ) that covers our thoughts on transforms , animation and other advanced visual effects .
[ 1 Dec 2008 – updated timing function values to reflect new implementation .
‘ default ’ is now called ‘ ease ’ .

Olbermann indicts an ' unhinged , irrational Chicken Little of a president ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 6 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann offered a special comment on Thursday about George W. Bush 's " cataclysmic deceptions about Iran . "
He began by presenting two alternative explanations of Bush 's apparent concealment of the intelligence -- made public earlier this week -- that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
" We have either a president who is too dishonest to restrain himself from invoking World War III about Iran at least six weeks after he had to have known that the analogy would be fantastic , irresponsible hyperbole , or we have a president too transcendentally stupid not to have asked , at what appears to have been a series of opportunities to do so , whether the fairy tales he either created or was fed were still even remotely plausible . "
It is clear , Olbermann stated , that Bush was informed by National Intelligence Director McConnell last August that that claims about an Iranian nuclear weapons program were " crap . "
And yet he still told the country on October 17 that " if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have the knowledge to make a nuclear weapon . "
" A bright man or an honest man , " said Olbermann , " would have realized no later than the McConnell briefing that the only true danger about Iran was the damage that could be done by an unhinged , irrational chicken little of a president shooting his mouth off , backed up only by his own hysteria and his own delusions of omnicience . "
Olbermann then pointed out that Vice President Cheney had been briefed in full as long as two weeks ago and yet had seemingly " never bothered to mention it to his boss . "
Recalling widespread suspcions that Ronald Reagan was merely the " front man " for behind - the - scenes manipulators , Olbermann suggested that " it is inescapable that Dick Cheney is either this president 's evil ventriloquist -- or he thinks he is . "
However , Olbermann continued , even the possibility that Cheney may have " cut [ him ] out of the loop " does n't let Bush off the hook .
Referring to an analysis by Dan Froomkin of the Washington Post , Olbermann pointed out that throughout last spring and early summer , Bush repeatedly warned of Iranian " pursuit " of nuclear weapons .
Then suddenly , between August 6 and 9 , Bush 's language subtly altered and he began referring merely to technology or knowledge " that could lead to nuclear weapons . "
" And we are to believe , Mr. Bush , that nobody told you any of this until last week ? "
Olbermann concluded .
" Your insistence that you were not briefed on the NIE until last week might be legally true ... but ethically it is a lie .
...
You have been yelling threats into a phone for nearly four months after the guy on the other end had already hung up . "
" Instead of sharing this good , calming news with the people you have obviously forgotten you represent , you merely fine - tuned your terrorizing of those people to legally cover your own backside .
...
Hanged by your own words and convicted by your own lies , you , sir , have no business being president . "
The " Newsbusters " blog offers a critique of Olbermann 's comment , describing his accusations as " name - calling , " characterizing his comparison of Bush to failed presidents of the 19th century as " bizarre , " and calling his suggestion that President Reagan had been merely a front man " a conspiracy theory . "

The following video is from MSNBC 's COUNTDOWN with Keith Olbermann , broadcast on December 06 , 2007
The present military build - up in the Gulf would allow the US to mount an attack by the spring .
But the sources said that if there was an attack , it was more likely next year , just before Mr Bush leaves office .
Neo -conservatives , particularly at the Washington - based American Enterprise Institute , are urging Mr Bush to open a new front against Iran .
So too is the vice - president , Dick Cheney .
The state department and the Pentagon are opposed , as are Democratic congressmen and the overwhelming majority of Republicans .
The sources said Mr Bush had not yet made a decision .
The Bush administration insists the military build - up is not offensive but aimed at containing Iran and forcing it to make diplomatic concessions .
The aim is to persuade Tehran to curb its suspect nuclear weapons programme and abandon ambitions for regional expansion .
Robert Gates , the new US defence secretary , said yesterday : " I do n't know how many times the president , secretary [ of state Condoleezza ]
Rice and I have had to repeat that we have no intention of attacking Iran . "
But Vincent Cannistraro , a Washington - based intelligence analyst , shared the sources ' assessment that Pentagon planning was well under way .
" Planning is going on , in spite of public disavowals by Gates .
Targets have been selected .
For a bombing campaign against nuclear sites , it is quite advanced .
The military assets to carry this out are being put in place . "
He added : " We are planning for war .
It is incredibly dangerous . "
Deployment
Mr Cannistraro , who worked for the CIA and the National Security Council , stressed that no decision had been made .
Last month Mr Bush ordered a second battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS John Stennis to the Gulf in support of the USS Eisenhower .
The USS Stennis is due to arrive within the next 10 days .
Extra US
Patriot missiles have been sent to the region , as well as more minesweepers , in anticipation of Iranian retaliatory action .
In another sign that preparations are under way , Mr Bush has ordered oil reserves to be stockpiled .
The danger is that the build - up could spark an accidental war .
Iranian officials said on Thursday that they had tested missiles capable of hitting warships in the Gulf .
Colonel Sam Gardiner , a former air force officer who has carried out war games with Iran as the target , supported the view that planning for an air strike was under way : " Gates said there is no planning for war .
We know this is not true .
He possibly meant there is no plan for an immediate strike .
It was sloppy wording .
" All the moves being made over the last few weeks are consistent with what you would do if you were going to do an air strike .
We have to throw away the notion the US could not do it because it is too tied up in Iraq .
It is an air operation . "
One of the main driving forces behind war , apart from the vice - president 's office , is the AEI , headquarters of the neo-conservatives .
A member of the AEI coined the slogan " axis of evil " that originally lumped Iran in with Iraq and North Korea .
Its influence on the White House appeared to be in decline last year amid endless bad news from Iraq , for which it had been a cheerleader .
But in the face of opposition from Congress , the Pentagon and state department , Mr Bush opted last month for an AEI plan to send more troops to Iraq .
Will he support calls from within the AEI for a strike on Iran ?
Josh Muravchik , a Middle East specialist at the AEI , is among its most vocal supporters of such a strike .
" I do not think anyone in the US is talking about invasion .
We have been chastened by the experience of Iraq , even a hawk like myself . "
But an air strike was another matter .
The danger of Iran having a nuclear weapon " is not just that it might use it out of the blue but as a shield to do all sorts of mischief .
I do not believe there will be any way to stop this happening other than physical force . "
Mr Bush is part of the American generation that refuses to forgive Iran for the 1979 - 81 hostage crisis .
He leaves office in January 2009 and has said repeatedly that he does not want a legacy in which Iran has achieved superpower status in the region and come close to acquiring a nuclear weapon capability .
The logic of this is that if diplomatic efforts fail to persuade Iran to stop uranium enrichment then the only alternative left is to turn to the military .
Mr Muravchik is intent on holding Mr Bush to his word : " The Bush administration have said they would not allow Iran nuclear weapons .
That is either bullshit or they mean it as a clear code : we will do it if we have to .
I would rather believe it is not hot air . "
Other neo-cons elsewhere in Washington are opposed to an air strike but advocate a different form of military action , supporting Iranian armed groups , in particular the Mujahideen-e Khalq ( MEK ) , even though the state department has branded it a terrorist organisation .
Raymond Tanter , founder of the Iran Policy Committee , which includes former officials from the White House , state department and intelligence services , is a leading advocate of support for the MEK .
If it comes to an air strike , he favours bunker - busting bombs .
" I believe the only way to get at the deeply buried sites at Natanz and Arak is probably to use bunker - buster bombs , some of which are nuclear tipped .
I do not believe the US would do that but it has sold them to Israel . "
Opposition support
Another neo-conservative , Meyrav Wurmser , director of the centre for Middle East policy at the Hudson Institute , also favours supporting Iranian opposition groups .
She is disappointed with the response of the Bush administration so far to Iran and said that if the aim of US policy after 9/11 was to make the Middle East safer for the US , it was not working because the administration had stopped at Iraq .
" There is not enough political will for a strike .
There seems to be various notions of what the policy should be . "
In spite of the president 's veto on negotiation with Tehran , the state department has been involved since 2003 in back - channel approaches and meetings involving Iranian officials and members of the Bush administration or individuals close to it .
But when last year the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , sent a letter as an overture , the state department dismissed it within hours of its arrival .
Support for negotiations comes from centrist and liberal thinktanks .
Afshin Molavi , a fellow of the New America Foundation , said : " To argue diplomacy has not worked is false because it has not been tried .
Post - 90s and through to today , when Iran has been ready to dance , the US refused , and when the US has been ready to dance , Iran has refused .
We are at a stage where Iran is ready to walk across the dance floor and the US is looking away . "
He is worried about " a miscalculation that leads to an accidental war " .
The catalyst could be Iraq .
The Pentagon said yesterday that it had evidence - serial numbers of projectiles as well as explosives - of Iraqi militants ' weapons that had come from Iran .
In a further sign of the increased tension , Iran 's main nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , cancelled a visit to Munich for what would have been the first formal meeting with his western counterparts since last year .
If it does come to war , Mr Muravchik said Iran would retaliate , but that on balance it would be worth it to stop a country that he said had " Death to America " as its official slogan .
" We have to gird our loins and prepare to absorb the counter - shock , " he said .
War of words
" If Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and / or innocent Iraqi people , we will respond firmly "
George Bush , in an interview with National Public Radio
" The Iranians clearly believe that we are tied down in Iraq , that they have the initiative , that they are in position to press us in many ways .
They are doing nothing to be constructive in Iraq at this point "
Robert Gates
" I think it 's been pretty well - known that Iran is fishing in troubled waters "
Dick Cheney
" It is absolutely parallel .
They 're using the same dance steps - demonise the bad guys , the pretext of diplomacy , keep out of negotiations , use proxies .
It is Iraq redux "
Philip Giraldi , a former CIA counter - terrorism specialist , in Vanity Fair , on echoes of the run-up to the war in Iraq
" US policymakers and analysts know that the Iranian nation would not let an invasion go without a response .
Enemies of the Islamic system fabricated various rumours about death and health to demoralise the Iranian nation , but they did not know that they are not dealing with only one person in Iran .
They are facing a nation "
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei

Mentos offers schools free mints and a teaching pack
At Wisbech in Cambridgeshire , pupils in a chemistry lesson are carrying out an experiment involving dropping Mentos mints into a large plastic bottle of cola .
The result is a huge explosion with fizzy drink rocketing into the sky .
It is good fun and the secondary school pupils are impressed .
One boy said : " I ca n't believe it went that high . "
Another pupil said : " The bubbles which got inside the texture of the Mentos made carbon dioxide and that 's what made it go up . "
Enjoying science
The experiment started as an internet craze last summer .
It is thought that sales of the sweets went up by 15 % as a result .
The Mentos project called Put the Fizz into Science now offers schools free mints , a teaching pack and a chance to win £ 2,000 of science equipment .
Mentos said the project had been extremely well received by teachers across the UK and that it had been oversubscribed .
" The Mentos project aims to support the science school curriculum and encourage children to enjoy science , " a spokesman said .
Earlier this year the government banned the advertising of food and drink that is high in fat , salt and sugar during children 's television programmes .
If I can make sure the first brand experience of a seven - year - old is extremely positive , they are going to understand that it 's positive probably for the rest of their life
William Anderson , Schools Consortium
As a result companies are looking for alternative ways to interest younger customers .
But there are concerns about classroom advertising .
The National Union of Teachers launched a consultation on commercialism earlier this year called Growing up in a Material World .
It reckons advertisers spend around £ 300 million a year targeting the classroom .
Marketing expert and businessman William Anderson , who set up the Schools Consortium which brokers deals between brands and schools , has no doubt of the value to advertisers .
" Business gets to build a relationship with consumers of tomorrow , " he said .
" If I can make sure the first brand experience of a seven - year - old is extremely positive , they are going to understand that it 's positive probably for the rest of their life .
" Brand relationships are established very young . "
Nuclear waste
Some experts have expressed concerns about the way one industry in particular is funding a mass programme of teaching aids in schools about the benefits of nuclear power .
A series of films funded by the nuclear industry and a regional development agency have been widely shown in schools and viewed by thousands of children on GCSE science courses .
In the film on nuclear waste , all bar one of the speakers worked for the nuclear industry .
One worker says : " I do get paid well .
The industry expects high professional standards of its employees so naturally that comes with the appropriate awards . "
It 's a blatant piece of propaganda , that 's not an educational tool
John Large , independent nuclear consultant
Another is asked whether he is happy working with very dangerous highly radioactive waste .
" I 'm really happy .
Basically we are working with high level waste back there but it 's immobilised in a glass matrix so it 's basically safe , " he says .
Much of the film seemed to be geared to encouraging recruitment into the industry .
Independent nuclear consultant John Large works for both the nuclear industry and environmentalists .
He thinks it is less about science , and would be more suitable for a careers lesson trying to connect with younger viewers .
" It 's a blatant piece of propaganda , that 's not an educational tool .
That 's just propaganda , that 's glitz .
" One suspects a bit of an agenda here to try and connect things that children are used to in technology like Playstations and this sort of technology . "
' Unbiased '
The film on nuclear waste has proved contentious as pro-nuclear propaganda .
Film maker Energy Foresight 's programme manager Derek Wordley said : " There are people out there who at the very word nuclear will pull back and withdraw .
" If they [ children ] are biased against it by perhaps uninformed or perhaps political viewpoints , then that is surely not a good thing .
" We are aiming here to provide unbiased material which can be used to educate the children . "
The film was also aired twice on BBC2's Learning Zone where programmes are recorded for use in schools thereby ensuring their wider use .
A spokesman for BBC Learning said it had been a mistake to broadcast the nuclear waste programme and it had not been cleared before transmission .
Once it had been vetted , BBC Learning placed an immediate bar on repeat transmissions , as it judged some elements unsatisfactory .
But due to an administrative error it was aired again 18 months later .
BBC Learning said firmer controls were being put in place and offered an assurance it would not happen again .
It also said it was not practice in the past to closely vet funding packages behind acquired programmes but it now plans to look more closely at this .
Energy Foresight is currently asking for more financial support from industry to roll out another series of similar videos to half of all secondary schools by 2010 .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said there were no guidelines or standards for teachers and schools to follow when using this material , other than their own judgement .

H.Res. 847 ( 110th ) was a simple resolution in the United States Congress .
A simple resolution is used for matters that affect just one chamber of Congress , often to change the rules of the chamber to set the manner of debate for a related bill .
It must be agreed to in the chamber in which it was introduced .
It is not voted on in the other chamber and does not have the force of law .
Resolutions numbers restart every two years .
That means there are other resolutions with the number H. Res. 847 .
This is the one from the 110th Congress .
This simple resolution was introduced in the 110th Congress , which met from Jan 4 , 2007 to Jan 3 , 2009 .
Legislation not enacted by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books .

An object handed in to Florida police and identified as a surface - to - air missile launcher was actually a carrying case for an anti-tank weapon .
Police in Orlando were initially quoted as saying the object was a launcher - a story carried by media organisations , among them the BBC News website .
But it was in fact a case for a TOW - a " tube - launched , optically - tracked , wire - guided missile " , experts say .
The man who handed it under a gun amnesty was given a pair of trainers .
He told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he found the 4ft ( 1.2 m ) object while tearing down a shed .
He handed it in on 17 August .
Orlando police were running a no-questions - asked scheme called " Kicks for Guns " where anyone surrendering a firearm would get trainers or $ 50 ( £ 25 ) .
The prospects for a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict remain poor , largely because of Israeli rigidity as well as Palestinian policies and internal conflicts .
The United States has failed to use its considerable influence with Israel to seek the necessary changes in Israeli policies , instead providing almost unconditional support .
The consequences have been disastrous for the Palestinians , for Israeli security and society , and for critical U.S. national interests in the Middle East .
A major explanation for the failure of U.S. policies is the largely uninformed and uncritical mainstream and even elite media coverage of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the United States .
In contrast , the debate in Israel is more self - critical , vigorous , and far - ranging , creating at least the possibility of change , even as U.S. policy stagnates .
A comparison of the coverage of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict by the two most prestigious daily newspapers in the United States and Israel — in particular the breakdown of the peace process in 2000 and the ensuing Palestinian intifada , the nature of the Israeli occupation , the problem of violence and terrorism , and the prospects for peace today — underscores these differences .
While the New York Times has muted the alarm over the dangers of the United States ’ near - unconditional support for Israeli policies toward the Palestinian , Haaretz has sought to sound the alarm .

Ron Paul can’t catch a break .
He gets repeatedly disrespected by the media , he gets more contributions from the military than any other Republican presidential candidate but is slimed as a defeatist , and he does well in polls but ca n’t get taken seriously .
And now conservatives are turning against him because he ’s ginning up too much support .
Conservative website / blog hub Redstate is banning Ron Paul supporters .
Says some fascist webmaster dude named Leon : “ Effective immediately , new users may * not * shill for Ron Paul in any way shape , form or fashion .
Not in comments , not in diaries , nada .
If your account is less than 6 months old , you can talk about something else , you can participate in the other threads and be your zany libertarian self all you want , but you cannot pimp Ron Paul . ”
The reason ?
Swear to god : Leon thinks Ron Paul supporters are actually liberals in disguise .
That ’s just ridiculous .
There are conservative supporters of Ron Paul , there are some liberal supporters of Ron Paul , and ( whouda thunk it ? ) there are libertarian supporters of Ron Paul .
In addition , there are some people who do n’t claim a political identity or do n’t follow politics regularly that have been driven to Ron Paul ’s minimalism by the overreach and incompetence of the Bush Administration .
But there are n’t any fakers , as far as I can tell .
I ’ve met a number of earnest Ron Paul supporters , but I ’ve never met a Hillary Clinton supporter or Barack Obama supporter who went undercover at conservative sites and pimped Ron Paul to amuse themselves or to sow chaos .
To assume that Ron Paul ’s support is really a bunch of liberals in disguise is a particularly odd blend of denial and paranoia .
And just look at the picture above .
Who is Leon kidding ?
President Bush ’s plan to send additional troops to Iraq is facing public opposition from a slice of the American population that rarely speaks out : the military rank and file .
A group of service members came to Capitol Hill on Tuesday armed with signatures from more than 1,000 military personnel who oppose the war .
“ We will not be silent while thousands die , ” said Sgt. Liam Madden , a 22 - year - old active - duty Marine and Iraq war veteran who is helping lead the effort to organize resistance to the war from inside the military .
Madden and other service members leading the campaign , which they are calling Appeal for Redress , urged Congress to stop the troop escalation and find a way to begin bringing forces home from Iraq .

When the campaign began three months ago , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow dismissed the first signatories as “ 65 people who are going to be able to get more press than the hundreds of thousands who have come back and said they ’re proud of their service . ”
The 1,000 signatories still represent a tiny fraction of the military personnel who have served in and around Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
But according to the group , those who have signed the appeal include about 100 officers .
Approximately 70 % of the signatories are active - duty military , while the rest are reservists or members of the National Guard , said Madden , who added that the group would not reveal the names of the signatories to protect them .
The Appeal for Redress reads simply : “ As a patriotic American proud to serve the nation in uniform , I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq .
Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price .
It is time for U.S. troops to come home . ”

Madden and other leaders of the campaign arrived on Capitol Hill as members of Congress moved closer to challenging Bush ’s plans to send 21,500 more troops to Baghdad and Al Anbar province .
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said senators plan to introduce a resolution opposing the plan today or Thursday , with a vote planned for next week after the president ’s State of the Union speech Tuesday .
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said a House vote on a resolution would soon follow .
Democrats also announced Tuesday that newly elected Virginia Sen. Jim Webb , a pugnacious war critic whose son has served in Iraq , would deliver the party ’s response to the State of the Union .

Today , a group of antiwar members of the House , led by California Reps .
Lynn Woolsey ( D - Petaluma ) , Maxine Waters ( D - Los Angeles ) and Barbara Lee ( D - Oakland ) , plan to introduce legislation outlining a detailed plan to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq over the next six months .
The servicemen who came to Capitol Hill were greeted Tuesday by other newly energized antiwar lawmakers , including Reps. Dennis J. Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) and Jim McGovern ( D - Mass . ) .
They were also joined by the antiwar group Military Families Speak Out , which says it has more than 3,200 members .
And drawing a deliberate link to another controversial war , a group of Vietnam veterans , several in green jungle camouflage jackets , also stood with the current military members outside the Cannon House Office Building across the street from the Capitol .

“ The movement in the military is growing just as the movement grew in the military 30 years ago , ” said David Cline , president of Veterans for Peace , a St. Louis - based group founded more than two decades ago .
Madden and other members of the Iraq war opposition have been careful to avoid the more extreme actions of some of their antiwar forebears who openly challenged their officers in Vietnam .
But they have said they were inspired by how soldiers helped build public opposition to the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
“ If the war is to end , there needs to be a movement from within the military that is heard from , ” Madden said Tuesday .

Mrs Hill says her husband was willing to give - in to the demands
Margaret
Hill , the daughter of an expatriate worker , was grabbed from a car on her way to school in the oil city of Port Harcourt .
Her mother , Oluchi , told the BBC that the kidnappers had called her demanding a meeting in a town in the Niger Delta .
She said they then allowed her to speak to her daughter who was crying .
Margaret was snatched by gunmen at 0730 ( 0630 GMT ) on Thursday after they smashed a window of her car as it stood in traffic .
They say I can bring my husband to swap with the baby
Oluchi Hill
Oil rich city 's woes Oil worker recalls kidnap
Her father Mike Hill , who has lived in the country for 10 years , runs a bar in Port Harcourt .
The region 's main militant group - the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) - has offered to help find the girl , according to the AP news agency .
" We will join in the hunt for the monsters who carried out this abduction and mete out adequate punishment for this crime - We abhor all forms of violence against women and children , " the group said in an e-mail sent to AP .
Mrs Hill , a Nigerian national , said the kidnappers told her to meet them in a town in Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta region , but that neither she nor the police had been able to locate it .
" They say I can bring my husband to swap with the baby , " she said .
" He wanted to go down for his baby but the police commander told him not to . "
The kidnappers then threatened to kill Margaret if Mr Hill did not come within three hours , she said .
After the deadline had expired , Mrs Hill said Margaret was being fed just " bread and water " .
" The people who are holding her just called again and they were threatening to kill the baby , " Oluchi Hill was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
" They accused me of trying to play games with them . "
The UK's Foreign Office has called for the " immediate safe release " of the girl .
' Big business '
The BBC's Alex Last in Lagos says Mr Hill is ill and had been due to fly to the UK for medical treatment .
He says that no hostages had ever been killed by Nigeria 's oil militants and that most situations are resolved after a ransom is paid .
MEND Formed early 2006
Close links to militant Mujahid Dokubo - Asari's Niger Delta Volunteer Force Split into two rival groups late 2006 Demand 100 % control of Nigeria 's oil wealth Demand release of impeached Bayelsa governor on trial for money laundering Operate from creeks of Niger Delta Communicate with media by e-mail
Nigeria 's shadowy militants
Mend has said it had nothing to do with that attack .
Our correspondent says there are a plethora of armed gangs operating in the Niger Delta and kidnapping for ransom has become big business .
More than 100 foreign oil workers have been taken hostage in the region this year .
Mend called off its ceasefire on Tuesday , saying it has been kept on the sidelines of government - led talks about the future of the Niger Delta .
Although the Delta accounts for more than 90 % of Nigeria 's income , the region remains highly impoverished , a situation the militants say they want to change with their campaign .
· Rival ahead for first time in New Hampshire · Campaign team planning to step up attacks on rival
Hillary Clinton 's campaign for the White House suffered a serious setback yesterday when her main Democratic rival , Barack Obama , took a poll lead for the first time in New Hampshire , a key early state .
The latest ratings , part of a trend that has seen him narrow the gap over the last month , has rattled the Clinton team .
In a sign of its unease , Bill Shaheen , a co-chairman of her campaign , yesterday raised Obama 's drug - taking as a teenager , even though he had admitted to it in his autobiography .
In an interview with the Washington Post website , Shaheen said the Republicans will target Obama 's background .
" It 'll be , ' When was the last time ?
Did you ever give drugs to anyone ?
Did you sell them to anyone ? " '
Shaheen said .
Obama 's campaign manager David Plouffe said it was " an increasingly desperate effort to slow her slide in the poll " .
The poll in New Hampshire marks a dramatic change in a state where Clinton has enjoyed leads of between 10 and 20 points in more than 50 polls carried out this year .
That advantage has disappeared with less than four weeks left , in what is now shaping up as a tight , unpredictable race .
A Rasmussen poll yesterday put Obama on 31 % to Clinton 's 28 % .
Two weeks ago , Clinton had a 7 % lead .
Her downward trend was reflected in two other polls published yesterday .
A WMUR / CNN poll put Clinton on 31 % , down five points since last month , and Obama on 30 % , up eight points , while a poll by Suffolk University in Boston put her on 33 % , down one point , to Obama 's 26 % , up four , since last month .
The WMUR / CNN polling was carried out between December 6 and 10 , the period that included huge media exposure for Obama as a result of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire alongside Oprah Winfrey .
The poll put John Edwards on 16 % .
Edwards has concentrated on Iowa in the hope that a win there can help him close the gap in New Hampshire .
Advisers to Bill Clinton , who has been campaigning for his wife this week in Iowa , were expressing concern over the performance of the campaign team , in particular a failure to respond aggressively to attacks by Obama .
Hillary Clinton 's team is now planning to concentrate on Obama over the next week .
It is a risky tactic - negative campaigning is often effective but can also turn off potential supporters .
The first caucus , in Iowa , is on January 3 with the first primary , in New Hampshire , on January 8 .
In past elections Iowa and New Hampshire have often proved decisive in determining the final outcome .
The Democratic candidates are to hold their last debate today before the Iowa caucus .
The Republicans held their debate , also in Iowa , yesterday .
It was a dry , dull , safe affair .
Mike Huckabee , who has enjoyed a late surge in recent weeks , was at the centre of controversy over earlier remarks aimed at Mitt Romney , a Mormon .
Huckabee , a Baptist minister , said : " Do n't Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers ? "
Huckabee has played up religion during his campaign in an appeal to evangelical Christians , who make up about 40 % of Republicans in Iowa .
Romney told NBC's Today show that " attacking someone 's religion is really going too far " .
Radio - controlled bombs used to be the biggest killer of American troops in Iraq .
Now , they ’ve been rendered all - but - useless .
Good news , right ?
Like so much else in Iraq , it ’s not quite that simple .
Since the Iraq insurgency began , mobile phones , garage - door openers , and remotely - driven kids ’ toys have all been used to trigger improvised explosive devices from afar .
In response , the U.S. military has cobbled together an arsenal of radio - frequency jammers , to interrupt the deadly signals before they can set off the bombs .
At first , the jammers had all kinds of troubles .
Each type of jammer would only cover a relatively small slice of the spectrum .
And they ’d drive friendly radio and robots haywire .
But those problems have largely been fixed , troops across Iraq report .
The newer jammers have effectively killed off radio - controlled IEDs in major chunks of the country .
The explosive cat - and - mouse game continues , though .
The American have built up high - tech bomb - stoppers .
So the insurgents have gone ever lower - tech than before .
They ’ve largely turned towards so - called “ command wire ” IEDs to attack U.S. targets .
Pairs of insulated copper threads , some not much thicker than a hair , are buried under the Iraqi dust , and strung out for as long as a kilometer .
At the end , an insurgent triggerman waits – sometimes in a buried bunker .
It ’s a more crude approach to killing , of course .
But , barring a lucky find of wires , “ there ’s no way for us to defeat it , ” says one bomb technician .
And those wires are getting attached to bigger and bigger bombs .
( Check out the picture , above , of a cement - mixer - turned - shaped - charge . )
Do away with one problem , and you now have to cope with the blowback from your success .
I worry that ’ll be the case on the political scene , as well .
Sunni political and tribal leaders are increasingly throwing in their lot with U.S. forces here against Al - Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgent types .
But , to get them to come over to our side , the American military has fed them a steady diet of anti-Shi'ite propaganda .
Arrests and killings of Shi’ite militants are announced from loudspeaker blasts ; President Bush ’s bellicose rhetoric towards Shi’a Iran is reported on friendly radio programs .
But the majority of this country is Shi’ite .
Are we setting ourselves up as the enemies of the majority here ?
Are we priming the pump for an all - in sectarian battle royale ?
It seems like a possibility .
Anyway , command - wire bombs are n’t the only IED threat over here .
“ Pressure plate ” weapons , triggered by the smallest stress , are also in vogue here .
Some are even shoved into brown ration packets , and left by the side of the road .
Insurgents continue to use passive infrared sensors – like those used in burglar alarms – to sense changes in heat , and trigger a bomb accordingly .
Many
Humvees here are equipped with a flash - type device that can prematurely set the trigger off .
But there will surely be a counter to our countermeasure .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures rose more than $ 6 an ounce Thursday , to close at their highest level in five weeks , as the dollar touched new lows against the euro and the British pound and as oil prices remained high .
These factors combined to underpin investment demand for the precious metal .
Gold for August delivery gained $ 6.20 , or 0.9 % , to close at $ 668.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract tapped $ 671 earlier , a level not seen since June 7 , after falling $ 2.30 an ounce on Wednesday , thus ending a three - session winning streak .

" The breakdown of the dollar is bringing investors into the market , " said Julian Phillips , an analyst at GoldForecaster.com .
" Both the gold price and the dollar breaking down through long - term support is bringing professionals to adjust their positions as well as short - term traders to take advantage of the break through $ 665 , " he said in e-mailed comments .
Overall , the " change in the market mood after such a long consolidation is more than noticeable .
We expect a lively market going forward , " he said .
On the currency market , the dollar fell to a new record low against the euro and a 26 - year trough against sterling on Thursday , continuing its recent slide on fears over the U.S. subprime - mortgage market and potential economic weakness .
The euro was last up 0.3 % at $ 1.378 , after touching an intraday high at $ 1.3797 .
The British pound rose to $ 2.0365 , before easing slightly to trade at $ 2.0295 .

" Investors remained concerned at the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar here , " said Peter Spina , an analyst at GoldSeek.com .
" From a technical perspective , the Dollar Index is teetering at massive support , " he said .
" Should there be a failure of support , the selling is likely to accelerate and investors will flock to precious metals . "
Besides the weakness in the greenback , high crude prices helped boost sentiment on the gold market .
Crude oil for August delivery climbed as high as $ 73.80 a barrel Thursday , then retreated to touch a low of $ 72 as traders weighed developments linked to supplies .
See Futures Movers .
Economic data released in the U.S. did little to move the gold market .
" It was a yawn on that one , " said Jon Nadler , analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers .
The nation 's trade deficit reached $ 60 billion in May , on record trade flows across U.S. borders to meet rising demand at home and abroad , the Commerce Department reported .
The widening of the trade gap was exactly as expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .

" The trade gap came in about as expected , " said Nadler in e-mailed comments .
" The employment data look decent too . "
Nadler also cited the latest rally in Wall Street stocks : " It seems the equity sector sees great things down the road into next year . "
See Market Snapshot .
Other metals prices also gained , although September copper lost 4.05 cents , or 1.1 % , to finish at $ 3.581 a pound , giving back Wednesday 's gain of more than a penny .
September silver rose by 20.5 cents to end at $ 13.18 an ounce , September palladium added $ 1.30 to close at $ 372.75 an ounce and October platinum gained $ 14.60 to close at $ 1,330.70 an ounce .
Inventories and indexes
Gold warehouse inventories fell by 32,056 troy ounces to stand at 7.13 million troy ounces as of late Wednesday , according to Nymex data .
Silver supplies rose to 135.2 million troy ounces , up 1.2 million troy ounces , while copper supplies dropped 112 short tons to 21,877 short tons .
In the big metals - sector news Thursday , Rio Tinto RTP ( RIO ) reached agreement to buy Canadian aluminum producer Alcan AL , - 1.94 % ( AL ) for $ 38.1 billion in cash , topping a hostile offer from Alcoa AA , - 4.65 % by roughly a third .

Meanwhile , indexes tracking stocks in the metals sector reflected the strength in the broader stock market , sending the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index XAU , +1.17 % to a peak of 150.90 , its highest level since September of last year .
The index closed at 150.79 , up 3.3 % .
The CBOE Gold Index GOX rose 3.3 % to close at 155.58 points , while the Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , closed up 1.1 % at 357.06 points .
As for sector exchange - traded funds , the StreetTracks Gold Trust ETF GLD , +0.84 % rose 0.9 % to end at $ 66.05 .
The iShares Silver Trust ETF SLV , +2.18 % gained 1.2 % to close at $ 130.03 and the Market Vectors - Gold Miners ETF GDX , +1.28 % reached $ 41.29 , closing up 1.6 % .
" Fund inflows have been very strong as demonstrated by the gold ETF , " Spina .
But " it remains to be seen if the current pressures on gold will subside from here and keep gold in a summer trading range or if we see a breakout right now , " he said .
" One way or another , gold is looking quite attractive once again from an investment perspective and should keep a strong floor underneath the current price . "
Mesa assembly bug on Respberry Pi / VC4 with fix
After a few days of banging my head against this and chasing a red herring in gdb and with some help from HdkR I found the problem .
Mesa ’s VC4 code that uploads ( and downloads ) texture tiles has incorrect ARM assembly in it .
It forgot that some of the input parameters to be held in registers are actually modified by the ASM and declared them as " r " instead of " +r " .
It seemed a simple enough fix , but unfortunately there were a series of issues that made it more complex .
So first some " r " arguments had to become " +r " , but this is n't allowed to just be done with small changes because the compiler requires " +r " arguments to be moved into the OUTPUT section ( the top line of arguments starting with : that was empty before ) which means positional arguments all change around ( The “ +r ” means the register argument is modified in the assembly , as opposed to " r " meaning it is input only and not modified ) .
Of course manually renaming a bunch of numbers to match a new order is just asking for trouble going and converting %0 to % 2 and % 2 to % 1 and so on , so it 's a pretty unsafe way to do it .
The better way is to now NAME the arguments .
This is done by adding a [ name_here ] in front of each argument in the output / input lists at the end .
This means instead of referring to the argument positionally like %0 and % 2 etc. you can now refer to it by name like % [ name_here ] .
This was the first thing I did .
so as to not make mistakes later .
Even if this is all I did , I ’d still have a crashing , not working set of code that ca n’t be tested .
This unfortunately leads to another problem .
One of the original input arguments was a value of cpu +
8 . The compiler does not allow this when you name arguments .
It has to be a plain variable and not an expression once you use names .
So I quickly tried using a temporary variable in C above the assembly block like : unsigned char * cpu2 = cpu + 8 ; ( A side mention :
The cpu pointer coming in is a void * pointer and doing any math like the original code did is not a great idea as size is not clearly defined ) .
This just temporary C variable led to the compiler somehow filling cpu2 with junk when it was inside the assembly and not the address of cpu +
8 . Chalk this one up to some compiler bug or desire to just do whatever it wanted if you were doing void pointer math .
So there was no way to have a working patch in this form because it'd just crash as the 2nd address ( cpu2 ) is wrong .
Thus I also had to roll in an add by hand in the assembly block with a temporary register of r0 or w0 on aarch64 to ensure it was correct and actually worked ( in theory ) , but in this case if I had n't changed the " r " to " +r " it ’d still crash for the same original reasons at the top .
So this really necessitates a single patch for both safety / sanity of the change and having it actually compile and run as a unit .
If I did just the name change first stand - alone , it can't compile thanks to the cpu + 8 and thus it can't pass test suites or be useful .
If I just put in a line of C outside and convert cpu + 8 to cpu2 as above , then it generates incorrect code ( the values I saw in gdb for that register were total junk and nothing like the cpu address ) .
This also would be a bit more change in 1 patch but would n't run or pass any test suites .
I could add the inline assembly to do the add as I did and make this a single patch , But at least for me this would still crash and would not be testable as thing would still fail and crash , so it 's be an untested patch , thus it really needed to also merge in the changes to " r " to become " +r " in some cases to actually be a compile - able and testable unit on its own .
Sometimes life gives you lemons , so you have to make lemonade .
What to learn ?
What can we learn from this ?
Firstly , when doing your inline assembly , first it 's always easier to read , maintain and modify if you use named , rather than positional arguments .
If you have to move arguments around ( they go from input to output or something ) you do n't have to do a risky re-do of all the positional arguments .
It 'll make your days saner reading the code anyway .
Secondly , be careful about how to tag your arguments .
Are they modified in the assembly block ?
Read the manuals carefully for your instructions to be sure .
The bug may appear years later , long after you or someone else wrote that code , and a more aggressively optimizing compiler might just now break it .
Read your docs on inline assembly and these notations and get them right .
Also do n't forget to put any registers you use by hand inside in the clobbered list ( last set of values at the end .
This was correct already but any new registers you use , add them to this , or if you stop using them remove them from here ) .
Also just as a note - do n't do math on pointers that are not clearly sized , so do n't do void * ptr1 = x ; void * ptr2 = ptr1 + 8 ; .
Use a char * at least if you 're doing your address math byte by byte .
The patch
If anyone is having problems with a fairly freshly compiled mesa with a fresh compiler then you might want to try the below patch to fix it .
I 've sent this off to Eric Anholt so it 'll hopefully go into Mesa some time soon .
From fa297372cec1f964f7946d7de55c28920052ab8 b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From : Carsten Haitzler Date : Wed , 2 Jan 2019 18:56:23 +0000 Subject : [ PATCH 10/10 ] vc4 : Fix NEON and aarch64 ASM for up / download of textures
The neon ASM did n't properly declare variables that go into registers that are being modified in the ASM thus confusing the compiler and generating bad code and segfaults on texture upload at least .
This fixes that and properly declares registers with a " + " for input and output .
It also has to move these to another section ( they must be in the output section , rather than input ) .
It also uses a more readable naming of the variables that go into registers so the code is easier to follow and maintain ( had to do this just as part of fixing it to make it sane to debug and modify / fix ) .
This seems to have happened as a result of a new compiler ( gcc 8.2 ) at least and generates the bad code because the inline functions are being inlined in a way where registers that contain pointers are being re-used since they were not declared to have changed .
I noticed that compiling mesa with - O0 made the problem go away ( turned off inlining thus the above issue ) .
- O1 and above and it happened .
I only tested this on 32 bit ARM .
The same problem existed in theory for aarch64 but I did n't see the issue there .
I fixed the aarch64 ASM too .

Worried by the steep correction in silver ?
Do n’t worry , just reduce your leverage .
Silver has always corrected by roughly a third after its sharp ascents in the past 5 years .
This is due to the extreme tightness of this market where a billion of whatever fiat currency still can do a lot of damage .
At one point the short sellers will be run over by the very real freight train of exploding physical demand that has led to what looks like a worldwide shortage in bullion .
GRAPH : Silver always corrected by a third in the runups of the past 5 years .
I would not rule out a similar development this time before silver will attack the $ 30 mark on its way to the old high at $ 50 .
Chart courtesy of Kitco.com
The US Mint has been out of the gold sale business for almost half a year now , filling orders on very few days since September .
Currently only the new 2008 gold proof Eagles are on offer .
All uncirculated bullion coins are not available .
Platinum coins have not been available in a while too .
Now the physical delivery problems spread to silver as well .
The US Mint says it will ship silver eagles again after April 9 .
But taking it from past experience , this schedule may be delayed again .
Jason Hommel , probably the most outspoken silver bull for a lot of reasons - but not all – I agree with , has compiled a story of real life experiences when trying to buy silver bullion .
From his report :
Three more major silver dealers are reported to be out of silver today : The U.S. Mint , Kitco , and Monex .
This , on top of the major dealers yesterday , Amark , Perth Mint , CNI Numismatics , and APMEX , all reported sold out .
Further , nearly all of Canada is reported to be out of silver , from Vancouver to Toronto .
Hommel concludes that the latest correction is a matter of price fixing .
This is unprecedented , and is a perfect case of market manipulation in the paper market at COMEX and other futures exchanges to see silver prices continue to drop down to below $ 17 / oz .
today .
Paper promises can be created endlessly , but real silver cannot .
This is NOT a case of the dealers getting spooked , and selling out to the refiners just in time , at peak prices .
This is a case of the public buying up the stock at coin shops across the world ever since gold hit $ 1000 / oz ..
That event finally sparked a little of the public ’s buying of silver and gold .
Thus , the typical coin shop flow of silver to the refiners just stopped in the last few weeks , and especially the last two days .
This is NOT a case of the public creating a top with ‘ everyone ’ in silver , because nobody ’s in silver yet .
In 2006 , only $ 1 billion was spent on investment silver , which is 0.007 % of the $ 13.5 trillion of money in the banks .
As I have long reported , the silver market is so small , there is no room for new investor demand , not even 0.1 % of money could be spent on silver , because that would be $ 13 billion , which would push silver prices to $ 200 / oz. , and we are seeing only the tiniest beginnings of that .
$ 13 billion would be almost enough to buy all the silver produced by the mines in one year , which would leave nothing for industry .
It would essentially double demand , but supply would remain the same .
Furthermore , this is not a top because the public continues to get to the coin shops , and is now getting on waiting lists for silver .
The public is not yet in , so how can the price drop ?
This is a case of price fixing and manipulation , like communism .
Sausage is reported to cost 1 ruble per link ( editor : corrected ) , but there is no sausage .
Silver price is quoted , but there is little to no silver .
Shortages are evidence of price fixing .
Price fixing results in shortages .
They are price fixing silver at a below market price over on the paper exchanges in New York and around the world .
Also check out the highly interesting comments on his story .
This blog reported last September that silver and gold bullion trade 10 % to 15 % higher in China .
To add my 2 cents on silver shortages I can fill in a little from the German speaking parts of Europe .
ebay has offered the most liquid market for silver here , whose investment appeal is greatly diminished by 19 % ( Germany ) and 20 % ( Austria ) VAT and high mark ups of 16 % for kilo bars from professional dealers .
1 kilo , worth € 354 at a " global " spot price of $ 17 , would sell for €481 including all punitive taxes , not considering shipping .
Nevertheless the 3 highest bids on ebay are € 516 , €491 and €490 for a 1 kilo bar at the time of writing .
I also note that all multi-kilo offers from professional sellers have entirely disappeared for several weeks / months and that there are many new offering hands in this market which I consider the true silver market as these are actual exchanges of fiat money against bullion .
At the same time the new 1 oz silver Philharmonic has seen huge demand in Austria , despite even higher markups .
I also remember very well that prices on ebay stayed up when silver traded to $ 15 in early 2006 and then crashed to $ 10 in a similarly brutal move as we have experienced it this week .
This correction was not entirely reflected in ebay prices then .
And here some more facts about delays in silver shipments :
Kitco states on its website ,
IMPORTANT : Due to the volatility of the market , we are experiencing a significant increase in the volume of shipments going out .
Although Kitco and our depositories are working hard to stay on top of this , you may experience a delay in your order being processed by our vault , and sent out to you .
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause , and appreciate your patience and understanding .
If you are impatient for more silver bullion , Apmex cannot help you either , reports Boom2Bust.com :
Due to the OVERWHELMING demand for precious metals , our online ordering system has been unable to keep up with our customers ’ needs .
We have had to disable the APMEX ordering system to allow us ample time to upgrade our site to accommodate the increased demand .
We apologize for this temporary problem .
In the mean time , we will be accepting telephone orders for the following items only as we have them available :
• 1 ounce Gold American Eagles
• 1 ounce Gold Canadian Maple Leafs
• 1 Ounce Gold Krugerrands
• 100 oz Silver Bars
• Misc Generic .999 Fine Silver
• 90 % Coin Silver
During this time , we will have a minimum order of $ 5,000 .
We regret we have had to make this drastic change to our ordering process and rest assured , we are working expeditiously to correct the problem .
I conclude to buy more silver .
Having to overcome a premium of 36 % in Austria , I am anyway in for the very long term .
The inflation - adjusted record high for silver now stands at more than $ 135 per ounce .

Turds found in Capitol , but no ' blossoms ' in sight RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 15 , 2007 Print This Email This According to a Capitol Hill newspaper , police are unable to solve the mystery of the " caca caper . "
" Usually , if a turd gets into the Senate , its because he or she was elected , " Emily Heil reports for Roll Call .
" But on Wednesday , several large piles of actual , nonmetaphorical ' No. 2 ' found their way into the Capitol , and the source is nt yet clear . "
Heil continues , " On Wednesday afternoon , Capitol Police cordoned off a section of the hallway on the third floor of the Senate side of the Capitol , where at least three piles of the stuff were causing a stench  and a stir .
At first , the word circulating among the staff was that a visiting child had fallen ill while in the gallery .
But then the prevailing theory was that the foul stuff had come from an adult or group of adults making a yet - to - be - determined political statement . "
According to the paper , " Reports also circulated that the yucky stuff had been smeared on seats in the gallery overlooking the chamber floor , and the gallery remained closed hours after the incident was first noted . "
Excerpts from article : # Sources familiar with Capitol maintenance speculated it was an unfortunate incident involving a child ,  although they have no culprit and very little detail about how it transpired .
The section of hallway was still closed as of late Wednesday and officials will engage in an intense cleaning of the section following Senate business Wednesday night , the sources said .
Witnesses said they couldnt believe that a single culprit could have produced the volume of poo present or that a person could have , well , deposited it the normal way without attracting attention .
Several witnesses speculated it had been brought in from elsewhere .
 There was so much of it , there was just no way it came from a little kid or even that one person had done it ,  said one staffer who witnessed the stinky scene .

Guest Op - Ed by David Wagner :
“ It seems to me that political polarization in Congress prevents action on common sense measures that are needed , regardless of how fast this war winds down .
The consensus for getting back to 130 K troops , even by next summer is a significant load on our existing withdrawal capacity .
Nothing in this world runs at 100 % .
The strategy I would explore is for the Senate to mandate ( and the House to fund ) full demobilization planning .
Prepare the southern roads and port facilities for large scale withdrawal , and future oil development .
We need the development and enhancement of infrastructure , including contingency planning for partial use of alternate routes , say through Kurdistan / Turkey or Jordan .
We ca n’t use what we aint got , and we do n’t want to leave war - fighting gear behind .
While we have troops in Iraq , we should be paying Iraqis for the detection and demolition of remaining explosives , and demining operations from the Iran and Kuwait wars .
This should be a priority , since our participation can slow the xfer of explosives to militias .
We need to leave the Iraqis with the best demining and UXB capability , as rapidly as they can absorb it .
Likewise , the massive deficit in Iraqi medicine and education needs to be addressed , as a legacy our role in three decades of Mesopotamian war .
Building medical rehab and education infrastructure would be the best way to employ primary laborers and jump - start their economy , while colleges are repopulated .
US Democratic leadership needs to building consensus for meeting our very real responsibilities in Iraq , even as we debate how to stop combat ops in the midst of a civil war , with both sides pursuing a murderous sectarian cleansing strategy .
We need to force this admin to fund those humanitarian measures that we can all agree on .
I grant you that these proposals are hugely optimistic , but talking about them emphasizes to all parties that we need to spend big money on solutions , not in growing the war to the next level .
By keeping the full cost of the war in center focus , including our own growing TBI cohort , we stand witness to the need to begin shrinking this madness now .
. .
The end - state in Iraq is unknowable , an exercise in futurism and theory .
The important thing is to get started , achieve some accommodation here in Congress , uncover the bottlenecks and jobs in Iraq that need to be shared and handed off .
There is no reason why the Iraqi ’s should n’t get a dredged waterway , port upgrade and payroll out of our withdrawal , as opposed to the Kuwaiti consortia pocketing all the marbles .
If I remember the way in , it went past Um Qasr ( ? ) , which is probably a secure coalition / MNFI operation now , more securable than sprawling Basra .
If we do draw down from today ’s 170 K to 130 K in the next 10 months , that will be 4 K / mo , with a big balloon at the back end .
I think Cordesman , Korb etc. are calling our current capacity for careful withdrawal at 5 K / mo , given a shooting war .
A lot depends on the gear load - out , as opposed to the last four years of 10 K / mo rotations using in - country vehicles and heavy weapons .
There are also some 50,000 blackwater type gunmen , and another 150 K unarmed KBR types that will need a ride out , once Big Army security starts to fold in toward the large airbases .
I hate to sound like such a war weenie , but in the best scenario it ’ll be a huge , complicated , multi-player game of SIM City .

PARIS
I HAD a chance to think about the American health - care debate recently , while I was undergoing a procedure that ’s mostly paid for by the French state : re-education .
This has nothing to do with adult learning , or with those work camps organized by the Khmer Rouge .
It ’s a girl thing .
After a woman has a baby , perineal re-education shapes up her stretched - out birth canal .
It also strengthens her pelvic floor for the next child , and helps keep her from leaking a little bit every time she sneezes .
My doctor prescribed 10 sessions of it after my daughter was born .
( American doctors typically suggest just doing some Kegel exercises , if anything . )
Where do America ’s presidential hopefuls stand on re-education ?
I think it ’s safe to assume that no Republicans would think the government should meddle with my pelvic floor .
But if a Democrat wins the White House next year , the United States may be on the road to having a national health system à la française .
Could re-education be far behind ?
In France , making mothers good as new is a matter of national interest .
The state health system pays 60 percent to 100 percent of the cost of re-education for all women after they give birth , and private insurance plans typically cover the rest .
I finally solved the mystery of how Frenchwomen fit back into their skinny jeans six weeks postpartum : the state pays for abdominal re-education too .
One of the most challenging aspects of blogging is thinking up what to write about .
It is something that impacts all of us at one time or another .
While it is true the more you write the better you get at it , you can still sit at the computer one day absolutely blank .
When that happens it is good to have some strategies for generating new blog topic ideas and fast .
In this post I will cover some of the quick - fix inspiration triggers for when you are in a fix here and now .
In future posts I will go into detail with some longer term strategies for generating ideas to store and use over time .
Before I share some tips , I do have to remind you that unless you are under contract to write today , it could be best to miss a day rather than turn out something less than you are capable of .
Just saying !
Quick Fix Blog Topic Triggers
I call these triggers because rather than handing a fully formed idea they are meant as inspiration - starting sparks .
Think of them as launch buttons for your imagination .
You still have to come up with the topic , but you can be brought closer to forming the topic by making the appropriate connections between the trigger and your blog theme .
Explore blog post types –
There are many lists of types of blog posts around , here is my “ 10 Killer Post Ideas ” Performancing article from 2005 .
Since I wrote it quite a few people have expanded the list but I maintain the core list is those 10 types and most new post types are simply variations of those themes .
Look to the magazine rack – Take a magazine or TV headline and make it work for your blog niche as Brian recommends .
For example yesterday I saw an advertisement for an upcoming TV show detailing the best and worst of 2007 and used it as the inspiration for a blog post at Invesp .
Add to blog conversations –
One of the great things about blogging is you can use other blogs as inspiration for article ideas .
While not all blogs are well suited to doing this too often , readers can and do respond well to a good blog conversation .
A good indication that you have something that could be made into a post is if you find your blog comment going into multiple points and paragraphs .
Go through your feeds and see what sparks your interest .
Converse with yourself –
Once you have a good archive you can dig through your older posts to find inspiration .
In many cases you will have skimmed over a subject , alluded to something you can cover more deeply , or even perhaps changed your mind .
The end of the year is a good time to refer back , perhaps with a best - of for the year .
As time goes on this becomes an ever more rich source of material .
Joys and frustrations –
What in your niche is making you happy ?
sad ?
angry ?
frustrated ?
laugh ?
Emotions are a good starting point , if something makes you feel then there is a good chance your readers will too and that can create a good connection .
Your readers questions – Some of my best articles have come from reader questions .
They work well because if one reader wants to know a particular answer you can guess many more do too .
If you ca n’t find anything useful in your own comment area or inbox , go look at another bloggers comments or a forum .
Picture a person – I mentioned this technique before when I wrote about how to think up ideas for guest posts .
Say you write a photography blog , if you bumped into a friend who also likes photography , what would you talk about ?
For each blog I write on I have created an imaginary conversation partner or recalled a real person who would be interested in the blogs subject matter .
You might imagine giving this person advice , discuss the latest news , or laugh about that funny thing someone did .
When I sit down to write I pick up the imagined conversation where I last left it .
It works because you rarely run out of things to talk about with your good friends .
Phone a friend –
You do n’t have to always imagine a character to converse with .
If you have had the foresight to make friends in your niche you could always just call and talk to one of them .
Create a new category –
At first this advice might seem bizarre , if you are having trouble thinking of topics for your existing categories how will a new one not just add to your workload ?
In fact coming up with a new category gets you thinking about related subject areas within your niche which in turn could reveal article topics you have not covered previously .
Begin again –
If you started over in your niche today , what would you need to know ?
What would you do differently ?
Where would you look for information and guidance ?
Write advice or an explanation for an absolute beginner to your niche or a facet of your blogs theme .
It can be amazing how popular even the most basic advice can be .
It still takes me by surprise how popular Darren ’s article on how to hold a camera was .
The great thing about this tactic is , your final article does not have to turn out as only useful to beginners , it could lead you to more advanced topics .
Hopefully if you refer back to this list something will get you moving towards a fresh article .
Unfreezing the gray cells is half the battle , once you get some traction you can build momentum and have the finished piece written in no time .
In future posts I will outline some strategies I use for preventing getting to this “ no ideas ” point in the first place !
Got any other instant - inspiration - starters ?
Please do share your tips and links in the comments …
A team of FBI agents is headed to Baghdad to oversee a murder investigation involving Blackwater security .
While they ’re there , the agents will be protected by … Blackwater security .
When a team of FBI agents lands in Baghdad this week to probe Blackwater security contractors for murder , it will be protected by bodyguards from the very same firm , the Daily News has learned .
Half a dozen FBI criminal investigators based in Washington are scheduled to travel to Iraq to gather evidence and interview witnesses about a Sept. 16 shooting spree that left at least 11 Iraqi civilians dead .
The agents plan to interview witnesses within the relative safety of the fortified Green Zone , but they will be transported outside the compound by Blackwater armored convoys , a source briefed on the FBI mission said .
" What happens when the FBI team decides to go visit the crime scene ?
Blackwater is going to have to take them there , " the senior U.S. official told The News .
Sure , who has n't wished for superpowers ?
Super - speed , super - flight , super - strength - these are the cool powers , the ones with which all comic book superheroes seem to do so well for themselves .
But there are a few lesser - known powers found in the funny pages that nobody wants to be saddled with .
Any practical use they have would be countered by the sheer embarrassment and / or inconvenience of having them .

9 Telepathy " Oh , come on , " you 're probably thinking .
" What 's wrong with telepathy ? "
And sure , it sounds like it'd be a useful power .
You can keep tabs on what that back - stabbing co-worker of yours is up to , instantly know what your boss thinks about you and actually figure out what your girlfriend means when you ask " What 's wrong ? " and you get one of those meaning - laden " Oh ... nothing ... " replies .

Then again , like most people , you 're probably sort of a prick .
Do you really want to know what other people think of you ?
Sometimes the only way you can get through the day dealing with other people is being able to convince yourself they 're not five seconds from gut - punching your dumb ass .
Telepathy means you 'll never have that comforting illusion ever again .
Try hearing , " He really put on some weight , " " Nice hair , douchebag , did Supercuts have a coupon day ? " and " Has this guy ever heard of deodorant ? " before breakfast , and the phrase " Ignorance is bliss " will start making a lot of sense all of a sudden .

8 Super - intelligence Life is rough for smart kids in school .
There 's nothing super - heroic about getting your underwear yanked up your ass by meatheads because you can read without moving your lips .
Having said that , in any high school , there 's always that one smug , self - satisfied smart kid who likes rubbing their big brain in the other kids ' faces .
Remember how much everyone hated that kid ?
Okay , now add " super- intelligence " to your list of powers , where suddenly you can argue foreign policy with Nobel Laureates while doing long division in your head and scribbling a cure for leukemia on a notepad .
You 're gonna turn into an insufferable jerk faster than you can say , " Well , I suppose that 's a simplified way of looking at it . "

In the summer of 1954 , twenty - two fifth - grade boys were taken out to a campground at Robbers Cave State Park , Oklahoma .
Admittance had been quite selective .
None of the boys knew each other .
They were taken to the park in two separate groups of eleven .
Ostensibly it was an unremarkable summer camp .
In fact , what the boys were heading to was n’t that at all .
They did have a very normal camp experience , certainly , but what they had really done for two and a half weeks was unwittingly take part in an elaborate and fascinating psychological experiment .
Their parents had okayed it : the twenty - two boys of Robbers Cave were actually the basis of social psychologist Muzafer Sherif ’s landmark study of group conflict .
There were two parts to Sherif ’s hypothesis :
(1) When individuals having no established relationships are brought together to interact in group activities with common goals , they produce a group structure with hierarchical statuses and roles within it .
( 2 ) If two in - groups thus formed are brought into a functional relationship under conditions of competition and group frustration , attitudes and appropriate hostile actions in relation to the out - group and its members will arise and will be standardized and shared in varying degrees by group members .
After conceiving of the experiment and working out the logistics of its program and setting⁠— a Boy Scouts ’ campground ⁠ —
Sherif and his colleagues had chosen their campers carefully .
To decrease the potential impact of variables ( other factors that could prompt hostility ) , Sherif and his colleagues had looked for boys of similar age and intelligence , all Caucasian and Protestant , all middle - class , none from insecure homes and none known to be troublemakers .
They had aimed for a balance of different kinds of mental and physical strengths .
It was also very deliberate that the boys had never met before ; this was in accordance with the first part of Sherif ’s hypothesis .
Any preformed alliances would throw off the study .
The aim was to establish immediately a sense of group unity within each group of eleven boys .
Taking the two groups to Robbers Cave separately was a major part of this ; it also kept the other side wholly unknown .
None of the boys were even aware yet that there was a second group .
That would only be revealed once a strong sense of group identity had been forged .
Once at the park , the activities continued to encourage the groups to work together .
These were typical aspects of camp : preparing food , putting up the tents , etc .
They also played sports , went swimming , and performed for each other .
This was all very successful – in fact , as the boys bonded each of the two groups chose to give itself a name , which was not an intentional part of the experiment .
One became the Eagles , the other the Rattlers .
Precisely as Sherif had hypothesized , there came to be a social order very quickly in each group .
Clear leaders emerged from both .
And , as the boys became vaguely aware that theirs was not the only group , they actually asked to be put into competition with them .
This , of course , was exactly what the psychologists had planned to happen .
The two groups were brought together .
They would be pitted against each other in a lengthy tournament of sports and other challenges ; the winner would be awarded a medal and a pocketknife .
The psychologists ’ aim was to prompt each team to see the other as an ‘ enemy ’ of sorts , and test the second part of the hypothesis .
Again , the predictions were confirmed ; this is exactly what happened .
The boys began calling the other team names almost immediately , while glorifying the members of their own ‘ side ’ .
They threatened to fight members of the opposing team .
The Eagles snuck into the Rattlers ’ camp , stole their flag , and burned it .
The Rattlers returned the gesture .
As this happened , the more aggressive boys became the more popular within their groups .
After the Eagles won the competition , the Rattlers invaded their tents and took whatever knives and medals they could find .
Although the park had been named for the suspicion that Wild West outlaws Jesse James and Belle Star had once hidden there , “ Robbers Cave ” was beginning to seem an apt name for the camp .
Then came the most interesting twist : the noncompetitive activities .
Both groups were again brought together , just for meals and other such basic settings .
The hostility did not die down ; the groups remained locked in animosity .
So the psychologists tried something a bit more assertive : forcing the boys to all work together in a cooperative effort , to achieve what are called superordinate goals .
They did this in several stages .
First , the water supply to the camp was cut off ( thereby necessitating as much help to check the pipes as necessary ) .
Then , they were offered a movie that they were told the camp was n’t quite able to pay for ( and each team paid equally ) .
Finally , a broken - down truck was deliberately left on the premises of the camp ; nearby one of the organizers had left a tug - of - war rope to see whether any of the boys would suggest using it .
Sure enough , one of them did – and all the boys , Eagle and Rattler alike , pulled on the rope together to help get the truck started again .
The changes after this point were striking indeed .
The exchange of insults abruptly ended , for the most part .
Neither side seemed to bear much of a grudge for the earlier thefts and enmity .
Several pairs of boys from opposite teams made friends .
But it did n’t stop there ; at the end of the two and a half weeks , the campers insisted that the camp leaders allow them all to travel home on the same bus , instead of the divided way in which they had arrived .
On this bus , they did not sit according to their earlier groups .
Furthermore , at one point the bus stopped at a café .
The Rattlers , who had won money in a contest during the ‘ competitive ’ stage , spent their money not only on themselves but on the Eagles as well .
Overall , the experiment was seen as a success .
Not only had both aspects of Sherif ’s hypothesis been verified , but several further conclusions had been reached .
One was the observation that removing the boys from the competitive settings was not enough to reverse intergroup hostility .
Another was that major differences in background are not necessary for conflict to emerge .
The Robbers Cave experiment has been somewhat criticized more recently .
Some psychologists point out that such conflicts between groups depends on a high degree of group identity and loyalty .
Others argue that if the two groups had failed to achieve the superordinate goals , the groups would have blamed each other , thus exacerbating the conflict instead of relieving it .
Still more say that the experiment has little real - world applicability due to there being so many more variables involved in real conflicts – on the worldwide scale , for example .
However , through their intricate planning , Sherif and his colleagues had laid the groundwork for what would come to be known as the realistic group conflict theory , which has come to be invaluable in psychology , sociology , and economics .
Also , as a nice side - effect , they had given twenty - two boys from Oklahoma City quite a few new friends .
" Assessment Jars a Foreign Policy Debate About Iran . "
Assessment ?
Jars ?
Debate ?
Excuse me ?
Here 's Gramma Pelosi this morning : " The NIE illustrates the effectiveness of international monitoring and targeted sanctions to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . "
Effectiveness ?
Targeted ?
Proliferation ?
Excuse me ?
There were many other - oh I do n't know what 's a judicious word - deranged ?
duplicitous ?
drugged ?
- reactions this morning to yesterday 's devastating NIE - even to my chagrin in these august columns - spinning as no big deal a watershed moment in the so far wretched history of the 21st century America .
Not one of them seemed willing to grasp a very large nettle : the axis of evil that has this great nation in its paws , has been lying about Iran at least since August and probably far longer .
Has been lying to us , to our allies , to the world .
Again .
And not just lying but striving with all their might to nuke - or allow an ally to nuke - innocent people who posed no threat to us .
Here are the salient points from the NIE :
We judge with high confidence that the halt ( in trying to develop nuclear weapons , not producing them ) has lasted at least several years .
( Four to be exact , a lifetime in war and politics ) .
We continue to assess with moderate - to - high confidence that Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapon .
( Or has ever had one ) .
We judge with high confidence that Iran will not be capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about 2015 .
( Which Bush - and for that matter Gates - flatly lied about this morning implying that the NIE said they could re-up anytime ) .
Let 's be quite clear how far the men in the White House were willing to go .
In the lethal linguistic fog these warmongers and the rightwing quislings who enable them , have plunged us , reasonable people seem to have lost sight of what we 're talking about .
Nuclear weapons are n't a bigger better version of Daisy Cutters .
Nuclear weapons are n't just more bang for the buck .
Nuclear weapons are the most cowardly killing devices ever devised by our benighted species .
Nuclear weapons are instant genocide .
Nuclear weapons are designed to murder as many unarmed noncombatants as possible , by the hundreds of thousands if not millions .
Using nuclear weapons - even throwing around the threat to use them - was is and always should be unthinkable .
Yet the monsters , yes monsters in the White House were willing to lie through their teeth - again - to get the chance to use them .
On innocent people who posed no threat to us .
You say they did n't lie because they did n't have the current NIE ?
Bullshit .
They said they knew that Iran had nuclear weapons , that Iran was about to start World War III .
At the barest minimum they knew that was a lie .
At the barest minimum they had no evidence to back that up - just as they had no evidence to back up their assertion that Saddam had nukes - yet they said that they did .
They said they knew .
That 's called lying .
And they were willing to murder on a monumental scale - again - based on those lies .
In reality - not the barest minimum - it 's inconceivable that this intelligence has not been available to them since August , that some of it has not been known far longer .
It 's inconceivable that Israel which has the most reliable intelligence services in the Mid-East did not develop some intelligence in four long years , that Iran had no nuclear weapons and was no longer even trying to acquire them .
It 's inconceivable - surely - that if Israel had such intelligence , it would not pass it along .
At some point in four long years .
To someone in the US power structure .
Waking in New York this morning and reading the responses to this Force Nine news story , I felt as if I should try again to wake myself up .
I do n't mean that as a figure of speech : it was one of those experiences where you wake up in a dream and then try to really wake yourself up .
Reading the New York Times was truly like being a character in a Kafka short story .
For a while the world was making no sense .
The acceptance of this shattering exposure of duplicity , appeared totally impossible for even well - informed , responsible journalists .
It 's plausible that we 've reached the point where we just cannot face that Americans , elected Americans , who talk in familiar accents , who grew up in familiar places , who wear familiar clothes and look not terribly unlike us , could be as evil as it increasingly appears George Bush and Richard Cheney really are .
Americans simply are n't that evil , are they ?
They can't be .
There must be some good intentions somewhere .
But there are n't and there never have been .
And we cannot face the fact that the threat to our security and integrity as a people , is not in Tehran despite the blatherings of its ludicrous ( and largely powerless )
President , anymore than it was in Baghdad .
Nor is it in the gullies , caves , hilltops and villages of the North - West Frontier .
Threats from there - hot air and light weaponry - are nugatory compared to one we must now confront .
The threat to America is right here at home , sitting in two chairs in Washington right now , not faces on a screen , not characters in the tawdry television drama we call politics , but two actual human beings , their buttocks warming the leather of their seats , plotting how to cover up their crimes - the ones we do n't know about yet - plotting how to avoid accountability for the crimes they can no longer conceal , plotting even now in the fading twilight of their reign of lies , theft and murder , how by any means necessary , they can get still their hands on most of the world 's oil and pass the proceeds along to their cronies .
If you wo n't impeach now Gramma , you 're on your way to being as guilty as they .
Those who enable high crimes and misdemeanors - including never let us forget , treason - become as culpable as the perpetrators .
If you do n't impeach now , you will be an accomplice as will be all the others who stand with you - those who voted to declare the nuclear - free armed forces of a sovereign nation ' terrorists ' for example , or one of your leading candidates for President who refused to take ' off the table ' the ' option ' of nuking innocent people who posed no threat to us , just so that she could look as tough as war - criminals .
Enough .
This is the moment of enough .
This is the moment where we lose or win back what was once and still can be again a great nation .
Use the Constitution or lose the Constitution .

A new species of pig - like mammal called a peccary has been discovered in the southeastern Amazon region of Brazil , a scientist announced today .
It is the largest peccary in the world , about the size of a large dog .
The newly named beast ( Pecari maximus ) was found in the basin of the Rio Aripuanã and confirmed to be a distinct species via a genetic analysis conducted by the Leiden Centre for Environmental Sciences in the Netherlands .
Though new to science , locals already knew about the creature .
Tupi Indians called it Caitetu Munde , which means " great peccary which lives in pairs . "
Dutch biologist Marc van Roosmalen of the University of Leiden recently was doing some field surveys in the area and saw the unusual mammal .
" One day I was looking at some monkeys , and I saw three peccaries pass in front of me totally silent , " van Roosmalen told LiveScience .
" They appeared and then disappeared without making any noise . "
" Later , I asked the locals what I had seen , " he said .
" It shows that you really have to see things and then ask people what you 've seen .
They are not going to tell you otherwise .
It 's normal to them .
It turns out to be their most hunted animal . "
The new finding was published in the Oct. 29 issue of the journal Bonner zoologische Beitrage .
Peccaries are hoofed animals closely related to swine and hippopotami .
Until now , only three species were known to science — the collared peccary , the white - lipped peccary and the Chaccoan peccary .
Measurements of the new peccary 's body and skull confirm that the new species is larger than the other peccary species .
The giant peccary has longer legs and its fur markings are completely different , van Roosmalen said .
The new species also behaves differently from its family members , the white - lipped and collared peccaries .
These species are very social and found in large to very large groups ( even up to hundreds of individual animals in the case of the white - lipped peccary ) , while the giant peccary is only found in pairs or in small family groups with one or two offspring .
Also , the other peccary types root in the ground for seeds and roots .
The giant peccary eats mainly fruit and exhibits little or no rooting behavior .
The giant peccary has a gland that is active in other peccary species and used to mark territories as well as each other .
However , the new peccary is scentless , van Roosmalen said .
" I think it 's another adaptation to predation pressure from big cats , " he said .
" Through evolution , they cannot afford to be so stinky as the other ones . "
The habitat of the giant peccary is limited to dry wooded areas in a small region of the basin of the Rio Aripuanã .
The researchers therefore expect the giant peccary population to be small and recommend that this new species should be placed on the Red List of threatened species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) .

Greatest Mysteries : How Many Species Exist On Earth
World 's Biggest Beasts
It seems almost incredible after the catastrophe of the Iraq war , but the signs are growing that the Bush administration wants to do it all over again - this time to Iran .
Just as in the runup to the invasion of Iraq , the Washington air is thick with unsubstantiated claims about weapons of mass destruction ; demonisation of the country 's president has reached bizarre proportions ; intelligence leaks about links with al - Qaida and attacks on US and British targets are now routine ; demands for war from the administration 's neoconservative outriders are becoming increasingly strident ; the pronouncements of George Bush and his vice - president , Dick Cheney , are turning ever more belligerent - and administration sources claim that the British government is privately ready to play ball .
You might imagine after invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq at such huge human and strategic cost , an attack on another Muslim country would be the last thing on the US president 's mind .
But the drumbeat of war has been unmistakable since the summer , when Bush declared he had " authorised our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran 's murderous activities " , and the administration let it be known that it was preparing to brand Iran 's Revolutionary Guards a " terrorist organisation " .
Last month Bernard Kouchner , the hawkish new French foreign minister , insisted that " we must expect the worst " and " the worst is war " - while Mohamed ElBaradei , the UN 's chief weapons inspector in charge of overseeing Iran 's nuclear programme , warned against the " neo- crazies " pushing for an attack after 700,000 had died in Iraq on " suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons " .
Meanwhile , Israel 's recent air raid on Iran 's ally Syria has been widely interpreted as , at least in part , a power play aimed at Tehran .
This week John Bolton , the former US ambassador to the UN , used the Tory conference to call for an attack on Iran , as leaks to the US press about war preparations continued .
Newsweek reported that Cheney had been discussing the possibility of encouraging Israel to launch missile strikes at an Iranian nuclear site in order to provoke Iran into " lashing out " , and open the way to a wider US assault .
And in the New Yorker magazine , the investigative writer Seymour Hersh reported that in a videoconference this summer Bush told the US ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , that he was thinking of attacking targets in Iran , and the British " were on board " .
A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday that the " prime minister and president have never had a discussion about an attack on Iran in Iran " and that the government was pursuing a diplomatic solution .
" Of course , it 's the job of a lot of people to see that contingency planning is done , " he added , but denied that any go - ahead had been given .
The echoes of similar denials in the runup to the Iraq war , however , can not be missed .
Nor should the reference to an attack on Iran " in Iran " .
Both the US and British military now regard themselves as already involved in a proxy war with Iran in Iraq , as General Petraeus recently told the US congress .
What is becoming clearer is that the likely pretext for aggression against Iran has shifted from the possibility that Tehran might develop nuclear weapons to its role in supporting and allegedly arming the resistance in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan .
The administration is increasingly convinced that it will be far easier to convince the American public of the case for war on Iran if it 's seen as being about the protection of US troops rather than nuclear scaremongering from the people who brought you Saddam Hussein 's WMD .
So the focus of the military plans has changed accordingly : from a wide - ranging bombing assault on Iran 's known and suspected nuclear sites to " surgical " strikes on the Revolutionary Guards , who the US claims are backing armed attacks on its occupation forces .
In reality , the growing confrontation between Washington and Iran has less to do with nuclear weapons or Iraqi resistance and more with the fact that Iran has emerged as the main strategic beneficiary of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Iran and its allies now offer the only effective challenge to US domination of the Middle East and its resources .
It 's hardly surprising that the US is alarmed by the increased influence of an avowedly anti-imperialist state sitting astride a sea of oil , now making common cause with other radical , independent regimes in Latin America .
But it is of course the direct result of Bush 's own policies , which have also provided an object demonstration of the advantages of possessing nuclear weapons - even if there is as yet no evidence that Iran actually intends to acquire them .
Of the three states Bush originally damned as the axis of evil , one - Iraq - had no nuclear weapons and was duly destroyed .
The second , North Korea , managed to acquire some nuclear capability and is this week reaping the benefits in aid and negotiation .
The third is Iran , a country surrounded by US troops and caught between two nuclear - armed US allies : Pakistan and Israel .
And despite the populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's ugly remarks about the Holocaust , it is the nuclear states America and Israel that now threaten and have the capacity to attack Iran , not the other way round .
What should not be in doubt is that the consequences of an attack on Iran would be devastating , both in the region and beyond .
Iran has the reach to deliver an unconventional armed response in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Israel , Saudi Arabia and the Gulf - as well as on the streets of London .
The economic impact could be even greater , given Iran 's grip on the 20 % of global oil supplies that are shipped through the Strait of Hormuz .
It would also certainly set back the cause of progressive change in Iran .
Iranian leaders have dismissed the threat of attack as " psychological warfare " , and no doubt the US would prefer to bring Iran to heel through political upheaval in Tehran rather than by force .
But current destabilisation efforts seem unlikely to succeed , and so , short of a sudden US embrace of genuine negotiation , the chances of war before Bush leaves office look high .
The likelihood of a Brown government directly participating in an attack must be small after the debacle of Iraq .
But the possibility that logistical or political support might be offered is more serious .
The need to step up public pressure to make sure that does not happen could not be clearer .

 Harold Schooler died in 2003 , but his political activism lives on .
The former piano salesman and musician is among more than 160 dead people who have given more than $ 540,000 to political committees and candidates for the White House and Congress over the past eight years , an analysis of political donations shows .
LIST : Top donations from deceased donors
The estate of Schooler , who lived in Palm Springs , Calif. , has donated $ 28,500 this year to the Democratic National Committee .
Federal rules allow such donations as long as contributions do n't exceed legal limits and the intentions of the deceased were known , said Federal Election Commission spokesman Bob Biersack .
Such gifts are fairly rare , he said .
Kent Cooper , a campaign - finance expert and former Federal Election Commission official , admits these contributions are " a little strange and unusual . "
" People hear now and then of accusations of dead people voting , " he said , " but these are examples of dead people continuing to give and give and give . "
The Democratic committee received the most campaign money from deceased donors , nearly $ 225,000 , according to USA TODAY 's tally of federal campaign - finance data compiled by CQ MoneyLine , a non-partisan group .
The Republican National Committee was the second - largest recipient , with about $ 93,000 .
The donors ranged from Schooler , who has contributed nearly $ 82,000 since his death , to Richard Lee of Nome , Alaska , whose estate gave $ 3,207 to the Republican National Committee in 2003 .
Attempts to reach Lee 's survivors were unsuccessful .
Schooler 's brother said he did n't know the reason behind his sibling 's largess .
" We never talked about politics , " said Wayne Schooler , 87 .
" He did n't leave any to me … and I'm a Democrat . "
The money from the deceased is a tiny fraction of political contributions .
Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 , people listed as deceased gave nearly $ 96,000 in federal donations , according to CQ MoneyLine 's data .
By comparison , the four congressional campaign committees have collected nearly $ 170 million so far this year , MoneyLine 's tally shows .
White House hopefuls have raised even more : about $ 420 million .
Officials with the Democratic and Republican parties said they do n't make any special efforts to seek bequests from contributors ' estates .
" Occasionally , the committee receives donations from estates and does so in accordance with federal regulations and limits , " said RNC spokesman Danny Diaz .
DNC spokeswoman Stacie Paxton said the money likely reflects donors ' commitment to Democratic causes .
" By donating to the party , they know that the issues that they care about will continue . "
Martha Hughes , a Dallas secretary who died in 1999 , was among the Democratic givers .
She left all but $ 10,000 of her $ 1.7 million estate to Democrats at the state and federal level , according to her executor David Carlock .
The analysis shows she gave $ 25,000 to the DNC in 2003 .
Carlock said ballroom dancing and Democratic politics were among Hughes ' passions .
She had no children .
" She lived through the Depression and was a great admirer of President Roosevelt 's , " he said .
What about the $ 10,000 that did n't go to Democrats ?
Hughes left it to her plumber , Carlock said .

It 's hard to overestimate just how big Halo 3 is .
It has tie - in beverages , long lines at stores , and people taking the rest of the week off to finish the fight ; this is one of the few games that 's almost a cultural event when it ships .
But how well is it actually selling ?
According to Bungie 's own server stats , there have already been 1,216,715 unique players in the last 24 hours .
Keep in mind this number does n't include people who have yet to play the game online , so it 's safe to say this is a conservative estimate on sales .
The vast majority of games will never sell even 500,000 copies in their entire lifespan , and Halo 3 did it in a matter of hours .
Bungie 's numbers also show that 4,669,304 online matches have been played in the last 24 hours , with 402,988,939 kills in the campaign .
Many , many people are playing Halo 3 , killing many , many bad guys in the campaign .
It should be fun to watch the number increase as more and more gamers pick up their copies going into the weekend .
So far , Rudy Giuliani ’s scandalous personal life has been largely ignored by major media outlets .
One of these days , that ’s going to change , and today may be the day .
Giuliani is the first thrice - married serial adulterer to ever even run for president , a fact that most reporters have ignored entirely .
When the Village Voice reported a few months ago that Giuliani kept his emergency command center in 7 World Trade Center , in part so he could maintain a convenient love nest for his extra-marital affairs , the media , once again , yawned .
OK , but how about this one ?
As New York mayor , Rudy Giuliani billed obscure city agencies for tens of thousands of dollars in security expenses amassed during the time when he was beginning an extramarital relationship with future wife Judith Nathan in the Hamptons , according to previously undisclosed government records .
The documents , obtained by Politico under New York ’s Freedom of Information Law , show that the mayoral costs had nothing to do with the functions of the little - known city offices that defrayed his tabs , including agencies responsible for regulating loft apartments , aiding the disabled and providing lawyers for indigent defendants .
I realize the common - sense rules and norms do n’t apply to Republican presidential candidates , but a story like this one could , and very well may , end Giuliani ’s presidential campaign .
Even if one is inclined to ignore the character questions surrounding Giuliani ’s shameless and repeated adultery , the scandal here goes much further , including financial irregularities , misuse of official city resources , and an attempt to conceal the mayor ’s conduct .
A Giuliani campaign spokesperson declined to comment on any aspect of the story , including the travel documents or the billing arrangements .
It ’s just as well .
Some things are just un -spinnable .
If you ’re human , you ’ve done something embarrassing in a public place .
And if you ’re like most people , you probably felt like everybody was staring at you and judging you harshly .
But were they ?
Picture it :
You and your significant other decide to go out for a rare evening together .
You book a table at the best restaurant in town .
The babysitter is hired .
You both spend hours grooming and dressing for the big event .
At the restaurant , the maitre d’ greets you and escorts you past the other diners to a secluded corner .
The décor and elegance overwhelm you .
You think of the babysitter trying to minimize the damage from the flying macaroni and spilled milk .
You feel yourself relaxing for the first time in a long time .
You and your mate discuss the wine list with the sommelier .
You agree on a wine — a charming Pinot — staring into each others ’ eyes all the while .
You lean forward to say something intimate and bump your water glass .
It flies off the table and lands in front of a passing waiter .
You bend for the glass , but the waiter — in a friendly but firm voice — says , “ No monsieur , allow me . ”
You right yourself and pull the menu close to your face .
Your mate slowly sinks under the table …
You feel so embarrassed .
You ’re sure that dozens of people saw what happened .
“ They probably think I ’m a buffoon , ” you tell yourself .
Relax .
It ’s not nearly as bad as you think .
No one is staring ( much ) .
How do I know this ?
Easy : Science says so .
When I do something embarrassing in public , I feel like there is a huge spotlight shining on me .
I feel like everybody is staring at me and thinking the worst .
Not so , though .
That ’s what the research of Tom Gilovich and his colleagues show .
Sometimes , their research subjects wore embarrassing t- shirts in front of observers .
Other times , subjects were introduced to observers as bed -wetters .
Subjects felt like there was a spotlight on them .
Subjects believed they were judged harshly .
In truth , they were n’t noticed by many observers and , when observers did notice them , the observers were n’t all that hard on them .
So , why do you feel like there ’s a spotlight on you ?
Why do you think your social standing is suffering ?
It ’s Not Them , It ’s You
What we do , think , and feel overwhelms our experience of the world .
We are the main characters in our own dramas .
Now , we ’re not all egomaniacs .
We know that we are n’t at the center of everybody else ’s experiences , but our experience of ourselves exerts such a strong pull — like an anchor holds a boat firm in a fast current — that it ’s hard for us to completely adjust away from it .
Gilovich and colleagues showed that the “ spotlight effect ” can be eliminated simply by having people focus on things other than their own experience .
This scientific insight leads to some good advice :
Next time you do something embarrassing and feel like everybody ’s staring , focus on all of the other goings - on around you .
You ’ll be reminded that you are but a bit player in a much larger social drama .
Your significant other should relax as well .
My research shows that your mate thinks that your actions have brought shame to the both of you .
Not so .
If anything , the few people who did notice your water glass hit the floor feel a bit sorry for your lover .
And they do n’t think you ’re that bad either .
So , relax : Nobody ’s staring ( much ) .
Enjoy the soup .
I hear it ’s good .

WASHINGTON , Dec 13 ( Reuters ) - Federal health experts will begin testing for formaldehyde in trailers provided to people displaced by Hurricane Katrina after complaints of health problems , U.S. officials said on Thursday .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct indoor air - quality tests for formaldehyde starting Dec. 21 on 500 of the roughly 46,000 government - provided trailers and mobile homes in Mississippi and Louisiana , officials said .
Tens of thousands of people lost homes in the hurricane 's onslaught in 2005 .
Some trailer residents have attributed health problems to exposure to formaldehyde .
The CDC is doing the job at the request of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency , whose response to the disaster has been criticized as slow and ineffective .
Tests had been due to begin last month , but officials postponed them .
Jim Stark , director of FEMA 's office in New Orleans coordinating recovery efforts , said about 3,700 people already have asked to move from the trailers due to formaldehyde fears , and have been offered housing alternatives .
" In most cases , this will mean a trip to a motel or a hotel until appropriate rental units can be found , " Stark said .
FEMA will provide immediate alternative housing to any trailer residents with such health concerns , Stark said .
Formaldehyde is a chemical used widely in the manufacture of building materials .
It also is used in embalming fluid .
It can irritate the skin , eyes , nose and throat , and high levels of exposure may cause some types of cancers , the CDC said .
FEMA bought the trailers to provide temporary housing for displaced Gulf Coast residents .
Stark estimated about 90,000 people are living in the trailers , mostly in Louisiana and Mississippi with smaller numbers in Alabama and Texas .
The CDC said the testing will take about five weeks .
Dr. Henry Falk , head of the CDC's Coordinating Center for Environmental Health and Injury Prevention , said officials hope disclose the results by mid-February .
During the testing , officials also will look for other " obvious problems such as heavy mold , " Falk said .
" It is important not to be in an environment with high formaldehyde exposure for a very long term .
We really want to try to head off the concern about those long - term effects , " Falk said at a news conference in New Orleans , which was carried on a telephone link .
" The tests may all be high , they may all be low , they may vary by particular type of trailer , " Falk added .
" I think depending on the findings , that will help us in anticipating what we might need to do in the future . "
There are no federal guidelines or scientific standards on formaldehyde levels in such trailers , officials said .

While several studies find homosexuality in humans and other animals is biological rather than learned , a question remains over whether it's a hard - wired phenomenon or one that can be altered .
A new study finds drugs or genetic manipulation can turn the homosexual behavior of fruit flies on and off within a matter of hours .
While the genetic finding supports the thinking that homosexuality is hard - wired , the drug finding surprisingly suggests it 's not that simple .
In fact , homosexuality in the fruit flies seems to be regulated by how they interpret the scent of another .
Dramatic result
Homosexuality is widespread in the animal world .
But scientists have long debated whether , in humans a " gay gene " exists .
Previous research in humans has suggested that how we interpret scents given off by another might impact our sexuality .
In the new work , University of Illinois at Chicago researcher David Featherstone and coworkers discovered a gene in fruit flies they call " genderblind , " or GB .
A mutation in GB turns flies bisexual .
GB transports the neurotransmitter glutamate to brain cells .
Altering levels of glutamate change the strength of nerve cell junctions , called synapses , which play a key role in human and animal behavior .
Post - doctoral researcher Yael Grosjean found that all male fruit flies with a mutation in their GB gene courted other males .
" It was very dramatic , " Featherstone said .
" The GB mutant males treated other males exactly the same way normal male flies would treat a female .
They even attempted copulation . "
Overreaction
Other genes are known to alter sexual orientation , but most just control whether the brain develops as genetically male or female .
It 's not known why a male brain does male things and a female brain acts in female ways , Featherstone and his colleagues say .
" Based on our previous work , we reasoned that GB mutants might show homosexual behavior because their glutamatergic synapses were altered in some way , " Featherstone said .
" Homosexual courtship might be sort of an ' overreaction ' to sexual stimuli . "
To test this , the researchers genetically altered synapse strength , independent of GB .
They also gave flies drugs to alter synapse strength .
As predicted , they were able to turn fly homosexuality on and off , within hours .
" It was amazing .
I never thought we'd be able to do that sort of thing , because sexual orientation is supposed to be hard - wired , " Featherstone said .
" This fundamentally changes how we think about this behavior . "
Sense of smell
The team figured fly brains maintain two sensory circuits : one to trigger heterosexual behavior and one for homosexual .
When GB suppresses glutamatergic synapses , the homosexual circuit is blocked , the thinking goes .
So they did more tests .
As expected , without GB to suppress synapse strength , the flies no longer interpreted smells the same way .
The smells in question come in the form of pheromones , chemicals that affect sexual behavior in much of the animal kingdom .
It is not known , however , to what extent human attraction is affected by pheromones .
A study in 2005 found that when smelling a chemical from testosterone , portions of the human brains active in sexual activity were turned on in gay men and straight women , but not in straight men .
But at least among fruit flies , " pheromones are powerful sexual stimuli , " Featherstone said .
" As it turns out , the GB mutant flies were perceiving pheromones differently .
Specifically , the GB mutant males were no longer recognizing male pheromones as a repulsive stimulus . "
The research was published online today by the journal Nature Neuroscience .
Imagine a program used by 120 million people , of whom about 119 m hate it .
Sound unlikely ?
Yet that 's the perception one garners in trying to discover whether Lotus Notes , IBM's " groupware " application , is - as readers of Technology blog suggested - the " world 's worst application " .
The discussions ( at http://tinyurl.com/e4a56 and http://tinyurl.com/d9gdk) suggest that those who have used it are united : to the average person , Notes displays all the user - friendliness of a cornered rat .
Take a few examples from the Lotus Notes Sucks website ( http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com), devoted to listing flaws in the user interface .
When new mail arrives , you get a message saying " You have new mail " .
But the mailbox display does n't update ; you have to press a key or menu item to refresh it .
So the program is smart enough to know email has arrived , but not to show it - something the clunkiest free email program does routinely .
( That 's mistake No 38 on the Sucks site . )
Or the user dialogue boxes - such as the one that reads : " You must change your password .
It expired on 11/20/2005 .
Do you want to change your password now ?
Yes / No " .
Why offer users the chance to say " No " ?
What if they choose it ?
A typical process
The panoply of interface errors raises two questions .
Why do users hate Notes so much ?
And why , then , do they use it ?
The answers illuminate a typical process when companies buy " enterprise " software : the people who choose a product tend not to be the ones who use it .
Notes was intended to be the first properly collaborative product .
Developed by Ray Ozzie at Lotus ( which in the early 1980s made its name with 1 - 2 - 3 , a combination spreadsheet , database and graphing package ) , Notes was devised when the internet was virtually unknown , and even local area networks were slow and unreliable .
Documents would be stored on a central server , and made accessible to anyone , rather than hidden on personal PCs .
It would be able to work on Windows PCs and Macs .
Yet even IBM 's official history of the product ( http://tinyurl.com/ 9 mzly ) , reveals the early quirks that would drive later users mad : " Around this time Apple Computer released the Macintosh with a new easy - to - use graphical user interface .
This influenced the developers of Lotus Notes , and they gave their new product a character - oriented graphical user interface . "
So was it character - oriented , or graphical ?
You can't be both .
The result , which appeared in 1989 , is a product split in two : the Notes " client " side , which users experience , and the back - end Domino server , which administers the processes such as storing documents , passing email , hosting messaging discussions and organising shared calendars .
IBM acquired Lotus , principally to get Notes , in July 1995 , and has driven a series of upgrades .
Fast - forward to today , and Notes has gained widespread takeup : users in the UK include British Airways , Toyota , Volkswagen , Standard Life Assurance and most major newspaper groups ( including Guardian Media Group ) .
But further investigation shows that its proponents tend to be administrators , and its detractors the end users .
The Lotus Notes Sucks site insists its mission is not to put Lotus people out of work .
" It 's to embarrass them into fixing the egregious problems .
Specifically , the front end .
Also , to influence people into not buying Lotus Notes until it works for users . "
The main focus for frustration is Notes 's odd way with email , and its unintuitive interface .
But to complain about that is to miss the point , says Ben Rose , founder and leader of the UK Notes User Group ( www.lnug.org.uk).
He 's a Notes administrator , for " a large automotive group " .
" It 's regarded by many as an email program , but it 's actually groupware , " Rose explains .
" It does do email , and calendaring , but can host discussion forums , and the collaboration can extend to long - distance reporting .
It will integrate at the back end with huge systems .
It 's extremely powerful . "
So why are so many people down on it ?
" Too many companies rely on email too much , " Rose suggests .
" Email is quite inefficient .
People like to ' Reply To All ' and send copies of attachments to each other , instead of doing what Notes does , which is to have a single copy on the server that everyone sees . "
Dave Delay , who worked on Notes from 1996 to 2002 , points out that it is one of the few products Microsoft has tried - and failed - to wipe out .
" People dislike Notes because their expectations do n't jive with the intent of the product .
At its core , Notes is a runtime environment for collaborative applications , but when people complain about Notes , they are usually not talking about core Notes .
They are talking about the Notes Mail and Calendar applications ( http://tinyurl.com/9v94z " ) .
Where Notes does win praise is from those who administer it , who say it is secure , stable and flexible .
Databases can be tied together , and there is even a " bridge " to Microsoft 's Outlook .
However , most people are n't administrators , and while Notes ' back - end functions have advanced , its user interface has continued in a parallel universe where Windows never happened ( though arguably it introduced tabbed browsing years before Mozilla ) .
For Notes users , email and calendaring - the same functions that Microsoft offers through its Outlook and Exchange products - are what they do a lot of the day .
Delay 's remarks brought one sharp user retort , who observed that " Notes 's backend functionality has no bearing on us 100 m or so end - users .
As far as we are concerned the GUI is the system .
And boyo ... is the GUI client a heap of ill - conceived , non-intuitive rubbish . "
Missing the point
Stowe Boyd , president and chief operating officer of the collaborative software company Corante , who has a long history of reviewing software , says : " The problem is ... most people do n't have Notes , and you need to collaborate with them , too .
So , naturally , Notes the platform is judged by comparison with alternative solutions that allow you to communicate and coordinate with anyone , anywhere ... not just with other users of the same collaboration product you are using .
" The point that is missed by advocates is that people want to be able to communicate ... with anyone , not just those who are using the same programs .
That 's why email was the killer app of Web 1.0 .
And Notes has fallen by the wayside .
That 's one of the reasons that something as uncollaborative as Outlook kicked Lotus 's ass . "
That 's a red rag to Rose .
" Microsoft has been trying to catch up with Notes for years , " he says .
" It 's trying to put collaboration into the next version of Office , something Notes has had for years . "
IBM wants to know what you think and says that results of a survey , at http://tinyurl.com/djlxz and intended for those using version 6 and above , will inform the next version .
None of the options includes " rip up the interface and start again " .
You could suggest it , though .

As the baby boomers cruise into their golden years , I have good news for them — and for everyone else in danger of being run over by these aging drivers .
The boomers will not be driving like Mr. Magoo .
An electronic chauffeur will conduct them on expressways , drop them at the mall entrance and then go park their cars .
If you doubt this prediction , I do n’t blame you .
The self - driving car ranks right up there with the personal hovercraft as the futurist vision that never comes true .
In 1969 , Disney unveiled Herbie the Love Bug ; in 1940 , Popular Mechanics promised a car that would chauffeur you across America in a single day to visit Aunt Lillian .
At the 1939 World ’s Fair , the crowds at the General Motors Futurama exhibit saw traffic speeding 100 miles per hour thanks to electronic help .
“ Safe distance between cars is maintained by automatic radio control , ” a voice explained as visitors looked down on the vast diorama of the World of Tomorrow , complete with hangars for dirigibles and landing decks for autogyros .
“ Does it seem strange ?
Unbelievable ? ” the announcer intoned .
“ Remember , this is the world of 1960 ! ”
O.K. , so they were a little off on the date .
But today , finally , those electronically spaced cars are on the highway .
You can buy cars with “ adaptive cruise - control ” that automatically slow down if the radar or laser detects you tailgating .
Your car can warn you when you stray across lane markings , and these kinds of sensors are already being used experimentally in cars that drive themselves .
Status of Experimental C++0x Support in GCC 4.3
GCC provides experimental support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard , C++0 x .
This support can be enabled with the - std=c++0 x or - std=gnu ++0 x compiler options ; the former disables GNU extensions .
GCC 's C++0 x mode tracks the C++0 x working paper drafts produced by the ISO C++ committee , available on the ISO C++ committee 's web site at http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/.
Since this standard is still being extended and modified , the feature set provided by the experimental C++0 x mode may vary greatly from one GCC version to another .
No attempts will be made to preserve backward compatibility with C++0 x features whose semantics have changed during the course of C++0 x standardization .
The following table lists which C++0 x features are supported in this release of GCC .

The book , which sold for £ 5,400 , labels Father Henry Garnet as a traitor
The macabre lot , deemed " a bit spooky " by the auctioneer , has the mysterious image of a face on the cover , said to be that of Father Henry Garnet .
Auctioneer Sid Wilkinson of Doncaster said the face shows the haunting presence of a man falsely accused .
The book went to an unnamed buyer during a " lively " sale on Sunday .
Wilkinson 's Auctioneers sale room specialist Jessica
Wall said : " It was a very exciting sale .
It was very lively in the room which was full . "
The book , thought to date from 1606 , went to a private collector .
Mr Wilkinson said the book - entitled 'A True and Perfect Relation of The Whole Proceedings against the Late most barbarous Traitors , Garnet a Jesuit and his Confederats ' - has not been subjected to DNA testing .
Henry Garnet was accused of treason as part of the 5 November 1605 Gunpowder Plot , although evidence suggests that while he knew of the plans , he urged the Catholic conspirators not to resort to violence .
Mr Wilkinson said there were tales of the priest 's image appearing elsewhere , including in the straw collected from the basket where the priest 's head was placed after his execution in May 1606 .

UPDATE : President Bush signs HR 3648 , The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 .
It took them close to two and half months , but the U.S. Senate finally got around to passing H.R. 3648 , The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 .
Initially sent to the Senate on October 4th , the Senate passed this legislation on Friday , December 14th , allowing Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus to crow a bit about helping the U.S. homeowner dealing with foreclosure or a short sale .
Sen .
Baucus released the following press release on Friday :
Washington , DC – Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) won passage today of legislation offering tax relief to American families caught in the subprime mortgage crisis .
When debt is forgiven on a home loan , the homeowner must normally count that debt forgiveness as income and pay taxes on it .
The bill approved today as an amendment to H.R. 3648 creates a three - year exception for debt forgiveness on home loans – helping families already unable to meet their mortgages to avoid incurring large tax bills as well .
The bill also extends a provision allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage insurance payments from their taxable income .
“ Homeowners who are already in trouble on the mortgage certainly can’t afford a big hit from the tax man too , ” said Baucus .
“ Upheaval in the housing market has turned the world upside down for far too many families , and Congress needs to help these folks climb out of a financial hole .
This mortgage tax bill will help to ease the burdens of homeowners who are hurting today . ”
In addition to tax relief for debt forgiveness and mortgage insurance payments , the bill includes : - Tax relief for volunteer firefighters and emergency medical technicians
- Help to expand housing options for college students with children
- Protection of tax relief for homeowners after the death of a spouse
- Flexibility to help co-op tenant / owners deduct real estate taxes and mortgage insurance
The bill is fully offset by increased penalties for failure to file S corporation returns or partnership returns , and new requirements for the payment of corporate estimated taxes .
It is now necessary for the House to pass the updated legislation and send it to the President for signature into law .
While I 'm thrilled they have finally got this close to a done deal , waiting for 10 weeks to act hurt many homeowners .
" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) won passage today of legislation offering tax relief to American families caught in the subprime mortgage crisis . "
Baucus and Finance Committee member Chuck Schumer could have " won " this months ago .
Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow introduced similar legislation , S. 1394 , back in May .
While this topic did n't gain momentum until August when the mortgage crisis took over the the front pages of the NY Times and Wall Street Journal , they could have passed this in October when they returned from their break .
Since then , thousands of distressed homeowners , forced to choose between the lesser of two evils , made the decision to give the property back to the bank to avoid the phantom income tax potential of a short sale .
Do n't you just love politics ?

Pope Benedict is considering whether to allow Catholics to wear a condom to protect themselves from AIDS , Vatican experts said yesterday .
At the request of the Pope , Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragan , head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has submitted a 200 - page study on Pastoral Aspects of the Treatment of Infectious Diseases .
" In keeping with the Holy Father 's wish , we have carried out a careful study on the use of condoms , both from the scientific as well as the moral point of view , and we have submitted it to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , " the cardinal told a press conference .
THE NEUROLOGY OF SELF - AWARENESS
What is the self ?
How does the activity of neurons give rise to the sense of being a conscious human being ?
Even this most ancient of philosophical problems , I believe , will yield to the methods of empirical science .
It now seems increasingly likely that the self is not a holistic property of the entire brain ; it arises from the activity of specific sets of interlinked brain circuits .
But we need to know which circuits are critically involved and what their functions might be .
It is the " turning inward " aspect of the self — its recursiveness — that gives it its peculiar paradoxical quality .
It has been suggested by Horace Barlow , Nick Humphrey , David Premack and Marvin Minsky ( among others ) that consciousness may have evolved primarily in a social context .
Minsky speaks of a second parallel mechanism that has evolved in humans to create representations of earlier representations and Humphrey has argued that our ability to introspect may have evolved specifically to construct meaningful models of other peoples minds in order to predict their behavior .
" I feel jealous in order to understand what jealousy feels like in someone else " — a short cut to predicting that persons behavior .
Here I develop these arguments further .
If I succeed in seeing any further it is by " standing on the shoulders of these giants " .
Specifically , I suggest that " other awareness " may have evolved first and then counterintutively , as often happens in evolution , the same ability was exploited to model ones own mind — what one calls self awareness .
I will also suggest that a specific system of neurons called mirror neurons are involved in this ability .
Finally I discuss some clinical examples to illustrate these ideas and make some testable predictions .
There are many aspects of self .
It has a sense of unity despite the multitude of sense impressions and beliefs .
In addition it has a sense of continuity in time , of being in control of its actions ( " free will " ) , of being anchored in a body , a sense of its worth , dignity and mortality ( or immortality ) .
Each of these aspects of self may be mediated by different centers in different parts of the brain and its only for convenience that we lump them together in a single word .
As noted earlier there is one aspect of self that seems stranger than all the others — the fact that it is aware of itself .
I would like to suggest that groups of neurons called mirror neurons are critically involved in this ability .
The discovery of mirror neurons was made G. Rizzolati , V Gallase and I Iaccoboni while recording from the brains of monkeys performed certain goal - directed voluntary actions .
For instance when the monkey reached for a peanut a certain neuron in its pre motor cortex ( in the frontal lobes ) would fire .
Another neuron would fire when the monkey pushed a button , a third neuron when he pulled a lever .
The existence of such Command neurons that control voluntary movements has been known for decades .
Amazingly , a subset of these neurons had an additional peculiar property .
The neuron fired not only ( say ) when the monkey reached for a peanut but also when it watched another monkey reach for a peanut !
These were dubbed " mirror neurons " or " monkey - see - monkey - do " neurons .
This was an extraordinary observation because it implies that the neuron ( or more accurately , the network which it is part of ) was not only generating a highly specific command ( " reach for the nut " ) but was capable of adopting another monkey 's point of view .
It was doing a sort of internal virtual reality simulation of the other monkeys action in order to figure out what he was " up to " .
It was , in short , a " mind- reading " neuron .
Neurons in the anterior cingulate will respond to the patient being poked with a needle ; they are often referred to as sensory pain neurons .
Remarkably , researchers at the University of Toronto have found that some of them will fire equally strongly when the patient watches someone else is poked .
I call these " empathy neurons " or " Dalai Lama neurons " for they are , dissolving the barrier between self and others .
Notice that in saying this one is n't being metaphorical ; the neuron in question simply does n't know the difference between it and others .
Primates ( including humans ) are highly social creatures and knowing what someone is " up to " — creating an internal simulation of his / her mind — is crucial for survival , earning us the title " the Machiavellian primate " .
In an essay for Edge ( 2001 ) entitled " Mirror Neurons and the Great Leap Forward " I suggested that in addition to providing a neural substrate for figuring out another persons intentions ( as noted by Rizzolati 's group ) the emergence and subsequent sophistication of mirror neurons in hominids may have played a crucial role in many quintessentially human abilities such as empathy , learning through imitation ( rather than trial and error ) , and the rapid transmission of what we call " culture " .
( And the " great leap forward " — the rapid Lamarckian transmission of " accidental " ) one - of - a kind inventions .
I turn now to the main concern of this essay — the nature of self .
When you think of your own self , what comes into mind ?
You have sense of " introspecting " on your own thoughts and feelings and of " watching " yourself going about your business — as if you were looking at yourself from another persons vantage point .
How does this happen ?
Evolution often takes advantage of pre-existing structures to evolve completely novel abilities .
I suggest that once the ability to engage in cross modal abstraction emerged — e.g. between visual " vertical " on the retina and photoreceptive " vertical " signaled by muscles ( for grasping trees ) it set the stage for the emergence of mirror neurons in hominids .
Mirror neurons are also abundant in the inferior parietal lobule — a structure that underwent an accelerated expansion in the great apes and , later , in humans ..
As the brain evolved further the lobule split into two gyri — the supramarginal gyrus that allowed you to " reflect " on your own anticipated actions and the angular gyrus that allowed you to " reflect " on your body ( on the right ) and perhaps on other more social and linguistic aspects of your self ( left hemisphere ) I have argued elsewhere that mirror neurons are fundamentally performing a kind of abstraction across activity in visual maps and motor maps .
This in turn may have paved the way for more conceptual types of abstraction ; such as metaphor ( " get a grip on yourself " ) .
How does all this lead to self awareness ?
I suggest that self awareness is simply using mirror neurons for " looking at myself as if someone else is look at me " ( the word " me " encompassing some of my brain processes , as well ) .
The mirror neuron mechanism — the same algorithm — that originally evolved to help you adopt another 's point of view was turned inward to look at your own self .
This , in essence , is the basis of things like " introspection " .
It may not be coincidental that we use phrases like " self conscious " when you really mean that you are conscious of others being conscious of you .
Or say " I am reflecting " when you mean you are aware of yourself thinking .
In other words the ability to turn inward to introspect or reflect may be a sort of metaphorical extension of the mirror neurons ability to read others minds .
It is often tacitly assumed that the uniquely human ability to construct a " theory of other minds " or " TOM " ( seeing the world from the others point of view ; " mind reading " , figuring out what someone is up to , etc. ) must come after an already pre- existing sense of self .
I am arguing that the exact opposite is true ; the TOM evolved first in response to social needs and then later , as an unexpected bonus , came the ability to introspect on your own thoughts and intentions .
I claim no great originality for these ideas ; they are part of the current zeitgeist .
Any novelty derives from the manner in which I shall marshall the evidence from physiology and from our own work in neurology .
Note that I am not arguing that mirror neurons are sufficient for the emergence of self ; only that they must have played a pivotal role .
( Otherwise monkeys would have self awareness and they do n't ) .
They may have to reach a certain critical level of sophistication that allowed them to build on earlier functions ( TOM ) and become linked to certain other brain circuits , especially the Wernickes ( " language comprehension " ) area and parts of the frontal lobes .
Does the mirror neuron theory of self make other predictions ?
Given our discovery that autistic children have deficient mirror neurons and correspondingly deficient TOM , we would predict that they would have a deficient sense of self ( TMM ) and difficulty with introspection .
The same might be true for other neurological disorders ; damage to the inferior parietal lobule / TPO junction ( which are known to contain mirror neurons ) and parts of the frontal lobes should also lead to a deficiency of certain aspects self awareness .
( Incidentally , Gallup 's mirror test — removing a paint splotch from your face while looking at a mirror — is not an adequate test of self awareness , even though it is touted as such .
We have seen patients who vehemently claim that their reflection in the mirror is " someone else " yet they pass the Gallup test ! )
It has recently been shown that if a conscious awake human patient has his parietal lobe stimulated during neurosurgery , he will sometimes have an " out of body " experience — as if he was a detached entity watching his own body from up near the ceiling .
I suggest that this arises because of a dysfunction in the mirror neuron system in the parieto - occipital junction caused by the stimulating electrode .
These neurons are ordinarily activated when we temporarily " adopt " another 's view of our body and mind ( as outlined earlier in this essay ) .
But we are always aware we are doing this partly because of other signals ( both sensory and reafference / command signals ) telling you you are not literally moving out of yourself .
( There may also be frontal inhibitory mechanisms that stop you from involuntarily mimicking another person looking at you ) .
If these mirror neuron - related mechanisms are deranged by the stimulating electrode the net result would be an out - of - body experience .
Some years ago we examined a patient with a syndrome called anosognosia who had a lesion in his right parietal lobe and vehemently denied the paralysis .
Remarkably the patient also denied the paralysis of another patient sitting in an adjacent wheelchair !
( who failed to move the arm on command from the physician . )
Here again was , evidence that two seemingly contradictory aspects of self — its the individuation and intense privacy vs. its social reciprocity — may complement each other and arise from the same neural mechanism , mirror neurons .
Like the two sides of a Mobius strip , they are really the same , even they appear — on local inspection — to be fundamentally different .
Have we solved the problem of self ?
Obviously not — we have barely scratched the surface .
But hopefully we have paved the way for future models and empirical studies on the nature of self , a problem that philosophers have made essentially no headway in solving .
( And not for want of effort — they have been at it for three thousand years ) .
Hence our grounds for optimism about the future of brain research — especially for solving what is arguably Science 's greatest riddle .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez .
Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort .
On Friday , Sanchez , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the Iraq war " a nightmare with no end in sight . "
He said the Bush administration , the State Department and Congress all share blame .
Speaking with military reporters in Virginia , Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable .
" I 'm astounded , really , " South Carolina Republican Sen.
Lindsey Graham on CNN's " Late Edition " with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday .
Graham , who recently returned from Baghdad , said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 .
" Every time we talked to Gen . Sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; Guard and reserves are n't being strained , " Graham said .
He added that Sanchez 's own record in Iraq is blemished : Abu Ghraib " got out of control under his watch .
The war in general got out of control under his watch . "
But Graham said that " finally , " with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January , " We are getting it right . "
Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their " lust for power . "
Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired .
" While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , " he said .
That brought a tart response from McCain , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , " McCain told CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but " unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . "
One of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki , McCain said .
Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq .
Sen . Mitch McConnell , a Republican from Kentucky , told ABC's " This Week " that Sanchez is simply wrong .
" My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , " he said .
" I think we 're making significant progress toward that end . "
But , he added , " I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment .
They 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for . "
Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki will " step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year . "
If that does not happen , he said , " it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq . "
That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski , national security adviser under President Carter .
" What is this ?
This is a colony , " he said .
" That 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . "
Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence , Brzezinski said .
Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States , " No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq , " he said .
In his Friday speech , Sanchez added that the " surge " of U.S. troops into Iraq represents " a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . "
National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment .
Instead , she said , " We appreciate his service to the country .
As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq .
And that 's what we 're focused on now . "
Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq .
Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq .

The Bush administration said Monday the constitutionality of its warrantless electronic eavesdropping program cannot be challenged .
The government is taking that position in seeking the dismissal of federal court lawsuits against the government and AT&T over its alleged involvement in the once - secret surveillance program adopted after the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
The strategy was first recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a McCarthy - era lawsuit .
It has been increasingly invoked in a bid to shield the government from legal scrutiny .
Two senior Justice Department officials , speaking on condition of anonymity in a teleconference with reporters , reiterated the administration 's position that it was invoking the so - called " state secrets privilege " in arguing that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must dismiss the cases because they threaten to expose information authorities say is essential to the nation 's security .
" The case can not be litigated in light of the national security interest involved , " one official said .
The officials spoke on the condition that their names would not be published because , they said , it was the government 's protocol not to comment on pending litigation .
The Bush administration has invoked the state secrets defense often , from spy cases and patent disputes to employment discrimination litigation .
Still , two judges have ruled recently that the defense does not apply in two lawsuits challenging Bush 's surveillance program .
President Bush acknowledged in 2005 that the government was eavesdropping without warrants on communications in the United States as long as one of the parties to the communication was suspected of terrorism and outside the United States .
On Wednesday , the government will urge the San Francisco - based appeals court to dismiss the case on grounds that the case could expose state secrets , the justice department officials said .
" In our view , those claims should always be dismissed , " a senior administration official said .
" A year from now , a director of national intelligence , looking at all of the same information , may not make the same determination . "
The official added : " These are legal principals not simply being made up by the executive . "
The officials also said that the lawsuits should also be tossed because the plaintiffs have no direct proof they were spied on .
" We can not confirm or deny whether or not that 's true , " one of the officials said .
Earlier this month , Congress sanctioned warrantless eavesdropping with new legislation , which is also under attack on allegations such electronic surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment 's warrant requirements .
The new law requires that at least one of the parties to the communication be outside of the United States and associated with terrorism .
Christian Voice wants to bring a case against Mark Thompson , the director general of the BBC , and Jonathan Thoday , producer of the award - winning musical , for blasphemous libel , but was refused permission by City of Westminster magistrates court .
The group is hoping to launch what would be only the third prosecution in more than 80 years for an offence which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
The last successful prosecution was brought by Mary Whitehouse in 1977 against Gay News for publishing a poem , The Love that Dares to Speak its Name , about a Roman soldier 's homosexual love for Christ .
The human rights group Liberty , which has been allowed to intervene in the high court judicial review , says the law is outdated and argues that free speech rights must protect sacred , profane and secular language alike .
Blasphemy , originally part of canon law , became a common law offence in the 17th century .
Paul Stevens of Olswang , the law firm representing Thoday , said the producer 's legal team would argue that allowing a prosecution for blasphemy would contravene article 10 of the European convention on human rights , which guarantees the right to free speech .
Stephen Green , national director of Christian Voice , said in 2005 that the show portrayed Jesus as a " coprophiliac sexual deviant " .
A coprophiliac is someone who is sexually aroused by faeces .
The British musical , based on the US television programme , was performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 2002 .
It moved to the National Theatre in 2003 , and then to the West End .
It toured the UK for 22 weeks in 2006 , and is now showing in New York .
The BBC televised the opera in 2005 .

Now there is a kind of cerebral clearinghouse , accessible without ever setting foot inside MIT 's hallowed halls , for those so inclined .
On Wednesday , the school celebrated the completion of a six - year initiative to put its entire curriculum online , with all 1,800 undergraduate and graduate courses - lectures , readings , labs , even problem sets and exams - available with just a few clicks and a spirit of scientific curiosity .
The initiative , the first of its kind , has been enormously successful , so far attracting some 31 million visitors from nearly every country who are drawn to such classes as Electricity and Magnetism , Classical Mechanics , and Introduction to Algorithms .
Lectures and readings from MIT 's literature and history courses are also online , but the 20 most popular courses all involve science , economics , or math .
High school students and teachers are among the most avid participants , with 15,000 accessing the site each month .
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has launched a website , called Highlights for High School , that is tailored to their interests .

Does America need a vice president ?
Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This While Democratic Members of Congress prepared to cut the budget of Vice President Dick Cheney for claiming that his office was not part of the executive branch , some critics of the Bush administration have contemplated a more radical response : permanently abolishing the Office of the Vice President within the American system of government .
One law professor advanced the idea at a popular blog written by scholars of the US Constitution .
The vagueness in America 's founding documents about the role of the Vice Presidency was called a " deficiency in our Constitution , for which the most obvious remedy is abolishing an office that for much of our history has been useless ( assuming that the office was filled at all , as it has not been for a total of approximately 45 years ) and now has emerged as a true menace to the republic , both literally and figuratively , " wrote Sandy Levinson , a law professor at the University of Texas - Austin at who blogs at Balkinization .
Another blogger anonymously spoke more stridently about the idea of scrapping the Office of the Vice President .
" In any case after these two are gone the problem will still remain : there is no effective legal restraint against a Vice President who abuses his power the way Cheney has .... there is nothing in the Constitution that I can find which explicitly prohibits the VP from taking over the fucking government , " wrote ' Xan , ' who blogs at CorrenteWire .
" Why not go all the way and just abolish the fucking office ?
The VP has no assigned duties , we already established that .
Idle hands are the Devils playground ... "
To further consider these proposals , RAW STORY talked with one of the country 's rare scholars of the vice presidency as an institution in American government .
Joel K. Goldstein is a law professor at Saint Louis University and the author of The Modern American Vice Presidency : The Transformation of a Political Institution .
The notion of abolishing the Vice Presidency is not entirely new .
In 1803 , the Vice Presidency survived an 18 - 12 vote in the US Senate that moved to eviscerate the institution from the government .
But the current motivations for closing up the nation 's number two elected office differ greatly from earlier eras .
" If you had told any Vice President before Walter Mondale [ Vice President in Jimmy Carter 's administration ] that in the year 2007 , one of the burning issues people would be talking about is whether the Vice President is too powerful , or is the Vice President really running the country , they would say that would never happen , " explained Professor Goldstein .
He went on , " In a historical context , the notion that the Vice President has gotten too powerful is totally bizarre .
The office was the butt of jokes to the predecessors of the Jay Lenos and Jon Stewarts for generations . "
Goldstein 's suggestion was confirmed by one earlier advocate of abolishing the vice presidency who focused on how the institution did a disservice to politicians who might otherwise play a more useful role in society .
" The office not only can put undeserving and ill qualified persons in line for the presidency , but wastes the abilities of good politicians for four to eight years , years during which he or she might serve effectively in some other office , " wrote Eugene McCarthy , who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 , in a 1997 edition of the magazine Progressive Populist .
" Service in the office may seriously impair the person 's chances of being elected , if nominated , either because of failures on the part of his principal , or because of things that he or she did in service of a president . "
Some truth to Cheney 's claim ... in the 19th century Goldstein went on to explain that the position of Vice President had fundamentally changed in the post - World War Two era .
He noted that in the 19th century , there was some credence to the idea that the Vice President did not truly serve as an agent of the executive branch .
" In the 19th century , the office really became entirely legislative , where essentially all they did was preside over the Senate , and they continued to do that in first half of the 20th century , " he explained .
" Even until Hubert Humphrey [ Vice President to Lyndon Johnson ] , if he wanted to come to the White House , someone had to clear him in .
His staff could n't get in the building . "
Such experiences appear to have been routine among Vice Presidents , with John ' Cactus Jack ' Garner , Vice President during part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's tenure , once stating that the office was not worth " a warm bucket of spit . "
But the Vice Presidency underwent a major change during the era of Dwight Eisenhower , when a considerably younger Richard Milhous Nixon became the most prominent Vice President America had ever known .
" Nixon was much more active than any of his predecessors , " Goldstein explained .
" He traveled to 50 foreign countries , he was an active spokesman for the Administration .
He did a lot of partisan party work , he chaired commissions , took on additional ceremonial functions , met with the Cabinet and the National Security Council .
He was so much more active and visible than his predecessors that at the point that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified , there was this notion that the Vice President had become part of the executive branch . "
But the Vice Presidency now seen under Cheney finds its predicate under Mondale 's tenure .
" Mondale said being in the Executive Office Building across the street was like being in Baltimore , " Goldstein joked .
" He had a White House office , access to the paper flow and the president 's schedule , and a weekly private meeting with the President .
When there are three major offices in the West Wing , that 's saying to the world that you 're somebody .
If you 're one of only 2 or 3 people with a weekly private lunch with the president , that tells the rest of the world that you 're got an opportunity to be influential , and if you can walk into meetings whenever you want , it gives a signal that you do n't send if you 're Hubert Humphrey and President Johnson is making a point of cutting you out of important meetings . "
Legal scholar calls sacking VP ' mistaken '
Taking up the question posed earlier about whether the Vice Presidency should be abolished , Goldstein said the idea was ' mistaken . '
" First , the Vice President serves a purpose in having a successor ready , willing , and able to step in .
Second , the world has gotten so complicated that there 's a virtue in having a second high level person who can shoulder important responsibilities .
And third , it 's useful to have somebody who is an experienced public figure who can serve as an across the board adviser to the president , " he argued .
" And so while at least the second or third role is entirely different from what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind ... the office has grown in a way where it really does serve a useful role in our system of government . "
And , he concluded , abolishing the position might not even be necessary once the Bush - Cheney administration ends .
" To the extent that there are aspects of this vice presidency that people are uncomfortable with right now , one question to add is whether this is a function of a particular president 's approach to the office , and his or her leadership style ?
Is that a function of particular Vice President 's approach ? " he asked .
" And , is it a combination of those two things together ? "
( CNN ) -- The U.S. State Department is unable to account for most of $ 1.2 billion in funding that it gave to DynCorp International to train Iraqi police , a government report said Tuesday .
An International Police Liaison Officer hired by DynCorp stands near new Iraqi police recruits in Falluja , Iraq .
" The bottom line is that State can't account for where it went , " said Glenn D. Furbish , who was involved in putting together the 20 - page report for the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction ( SIGIR ) .
The Department of State 's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs ( INL ) " did not have the information needed to identify what DynCorp provided under the contract or how funds were spent , " the report said .
As a result , the audit agency announced it has suspended its oversight of the agency 's project until INL gathers the information .
" Their records are just not detailed , " Furbish said Monday in a telephone interview .
" From an audit perspective , we 've identified the problem ; they 're working to rectify the problem . "
Though Iraqi police have indeed been trained and equipment has been provided under the contract , invoices and supporting paperwork submitted by DynCorp " were in disarray , " the report said .
In addition , INL " had not validated the accuracy " of invoices received prior to last October , and " INL does not know specifically what it received for most of the $ 1.2 billion in expenditures under its DynCorp contract for the Iraqi Police Training Program . "
The lack of controls " created an environment vulnerable to waste and fraud , " the report said .
Do n't Miss Full interim review of DynCorp spending
Full interim review of DynCorp spending Bush wants $ 142 million more for war
Furbish , an accountant by training who spent two years in Iraq , added , " It 's like so much else that happened in Baghdad ... there was just a massive quantity of work and too few people in place to do it .
They just essentially did not have the staff to monitor what was going on .
" Bills came in ; they paid the bills , but they do n't know what they paid for and they do n't know what they 've gotten . "
Furbish , who has carried out audits for the Government Accountability Office for three decades , said the projected time line of three to five years to rectify the problem " is not atypical " for U.S. projects carried out in Iraq since the ouster of President Saddam Hussein .
" Baghdad is its own arena , " he said .
" Contract control has been a major shortcoming across the board . "
In addition to having too few properly trained people , problems arose from the difficulties inherent in traveling within Iraq and from " the rush to get reconstruction activities under way before we actually had a full structure in place to manage them , " he said .
Asked whether the full structure is currently in place more than four years after the U.S. - led invasion , he said .
" It continues to be a problem . "
In a letter to SIGIR , INL Acting Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Verville said her agency has made " significant progress in correcting past contract management problems " and " is dedicated to addressing our past contracting problems and systematically strengthening contract management and oversight . "
She said invoice processing delays will be reduced as staffing is beefed up in Baghdad .
State Department spokeswoman Susan Pittman said a number of reforms have been made since January .
" We are committed to continuous improvement , " she said .
The Washington - based staff of four will soon be increased to 11 , and the Baghdad - based staff of five will be augmented to seven " as soon as they all have their clearances , " she said .
Still , she acknowledged , it will take years to get the paperwork current .
" It is n't an easy process , " she said .
" There is a huge need , a huge , urgent need and there were not enough people to be able to fill that void , " she said .
" That is something that we are in the process of doing . "
Gregory Lagana , a spokesman for DynCorp , said the company 's work in Iraq is a " really complex program .
...
We buy weapons , body armor , vehicles , communications equipment -- that all belongs to the State Department . "
Sometimes , he said , " it 's coded wrong or double - billed .
We actually find a lot of that ourselves in the normal auditing process . "
Tuesday 's report is the second in a series of financial reviews ordered by Congress and carried out by SIGIR looking into large Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund projects .
The first report , issued three months ago , criticized officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development for lack of oversight of their contract with Bechtel .
Bechtel is a privately held , U.S. conglomerate of engineering , construction , and project management companies .
The series of at least 10 reports will be finalized by spring , he said .

尊敬する人 特に無 し

CSL でのお仕 事
-- まず最初に、現在のお仕事について、簡単にお伺いしたいんですが。
仕事は、ソニー CSL ( ソニーコンピュータサイエンス研究所。以下 、CSL ) というところにいて、 アシスタントリサーチャーという 肩書きで、研究職をやっているということになっています。 社員は ソニー本社からの出向を除くと、大体 20 人位ですね。 ビルの 2 F と 3 F を借りていて、僕は 3 F にいるんですけど、 3 F は基盤研究室といって物理や脳科学などのさまざまな基礎的な研究が行われていて、
2 F の方はインタラクションラボといって、 様々な新しいものをコンピュータと結びつけるインタラクションの研究が行われています。
CSL では本社からテーマを与えられるということはなく、 個人でテーマを設定して、それに沿った研究を行っています。
-- 製品を作り出すというよりも、基礎研究的な位置付けなんですか？
そうですね。直接製品に繋げるというよりも、もう少し実験的なことをやろうっていうのが目的ですね。
-- その研究成果は、親会社のソニーさんに対して発表する機会は定期的にあるんですか？
オープンハウスといって、研究成果を会社向けと一般向けに公開する日があって、それが大きな発表の場ですね。
-- CSL では、ユーザインタフェースなども結構研究されているのでしょうか？
そうですね。僕は 増井俊之さん という方といつも仕事してるんですけれども、 ユーザインタフェースの実験的なソフトウェアを研究開発したりしています。
-- その辺りの成果はどこかにあるんですか？
増井さんの POBox は ソニーの携帯の入力システムなどに製品化されていますね。
社会人学 生
-- もともと、会社に入られる前からこのような事をやって来られたんですか？
僕、実はまだ学生なんですよ。CSL に入社したのと同時に、 奈良先端科学技術大学院大学の博士課程に入学したんです。
-- ほおぉ。どのような経緯でそのような素晴らしいことを。
いや、全然素晴らしくないんですけど。偶然なんです。
僕は、修士のときに、博士課程に行くつもりはなくて、就職しようかなと思っていたので、
博士課程の入学試験も受けていなかったんです。
情報系なら就職先に困ることはないだろうと。
更に大学の推薦などを使うと、大手の企業に入れるんだろうと。
でも、それは止めようと考えてたんですけど、特に何も決めずにふらふらしてたんですね。 皆夏頃までには決まるんですけど、僕は冬になっても何も決まってなくて、友達のいる会社などを見学して、
その辺りに行こうかなとも考えてたんですけど、結局決めてなかったんです。
だから、元々 CSL に就職するつもりも全くなくて、なんとなく、こうどさくさに紛れたような感じで入ってしまったんですね(笑)。
きっかけは 、Migemo という僕が作ったソフトについて、 一度 CSL の増井俊之さんにメール出したことがあって、 その関係で、ソニー CSL のオープンハウスにお誘いを頂いたので、見に行って、話をしてたら、
「 うちに就職しないか？」ということになり、しばらくして、12 月位に 「 トークをやるから、来い。」と言われて、面接があって、プレゼンをして、就職が決まったんですね。
-- ここまでの話を聞いた限り、一般的な研究者の方が、論文を発表されて、
「どうだ！」という雰囲気とはまたちょっと違うような雰囲気を感じますね。
そうですね。自分が研究者と思ったことも、研究したって思った事も、考えた事がないですね。
-- 論文等を発表されたりしてるのは、CSL
に入社以降という形になるんですか？
一応、修士の時も、1 回位は対外発表してると思うんですけど 、CSL に就職決まってから 、 「 もう就職も決まったから、もういっかな。」と思っていたんですけど、 会社から「博士号を取ってもらわないと。」と言われたんですね。
「就職して博士課程に行けるんだったらいいな。そう言うからには、
ま、会社が学費も出してくれるだろう。 」 と思っていたら、実は出してくれないんですよ(笑 ) 。
世の中にはいい論文が存在するんですけど、僕は論文を書くのが嫌い、と言うか苦手な事もあり、
なかなかいい論文を書けそうにないので、それだったらソフトウェアを書いていようかな、と思ったんですね。
それで、さっき話にも出たんですけど、僕、Migemo というソフトを作ったんです。 僕は最初に、何かソフトを作ろうと思ったら、周りの人にどう思うか聞くんですね。
この時はあんまり関心は持たれなくて「ふーん。」とか言われて、でも自分は欲しいので作るんですね。
で、作って見せると「おっ！」と反応を貰ったので、「じゃあ公開するか！」と公開して、
それを皆に見せて回っていたら、「これは論文になるかもしれないね。」と言われたんですね。
「じゃあ論文に何とかしてみよう。」ということで、書いてみたら、論文になったんですよ。
-- 高林さんは、日常自分で使って役立つソフトウェアを公開されている印象があるので、
そのような動機で作られているんだろうと思っていたんですよ。 それで、Migemo は論文が出ていたので、論文から作られたのかなぁと思っていたら、
ソフトの方が先だったんですね。
いや、論文は嫌々書いたんですよ。もう作ってから 2 , 3 年は経ってましたね。
-- 既に実証済みの論文ですもんね。
ユーザに使ってもらって、実験も手伝って貰ったので、その点は書きやすい部分もありましたけど、
元々、論文を書こうと思って作った訳では全くなかったですね。
こういうのを自分で作ってみたら面白いだろうなぁと思ったので。
面白いだろうなぁと思わないと、僕はなかなかやらないので。
-- まぁ、全ての動機は結局そこからなんで、ある意味、一番純粋でちょっと羨ましい気がしますね。
そうなんですけど、前に Kernighan ( カーニハン ) のインタビュー を読んだら 、Kernighan が、後輩エンジニアに対してアドバイスを。とかって聞かれてたんですね。
Kernighan の答えは単純 で 「 面白いと思うことをやりなさいと。そうじゃないとどうせやる気にならないし、 どうせうまくやれないから。面白いと思ったことなら、うまくやれるかもしれない」ということを言っていたんです。
-- 確かにその通りですね ( 笑 ) 。
Namazu とオープンソー ス
-- それで 、Namazu の話に入りますけれども、あれはいつ発表されたんですか？
-- 学生の時に 、Namazu を作って発表しようと思われた動機は何だったんですか？
Namazu を作ったきっかけは、当時、音楽の情報 を
Web で色々調べていたんですけど、 ある日、自分の好きな音楽の検索エンジンでも作ってみるかと思ったんですね。 で、しばらく作ってみたら出来たんですけど、最初に作ったのは、むちゃくちゃしょうもなくて、 一回検索すると 、30 秒くらい待たされたので、それはよくないということで、作り直したんですね。 確か、ヘビーメタル専門の検索エンジンを作ろうという試みだったんですけど、 今度は割と、うまくいって速くなったので、 「 人に見せなきゃあかん。」と思ったんですね。
結局、人に自慢をしようという形だったんですけど。で、Linux の ML で 「 こういうの作ったよ。 」という案内を
URL などを流したら、反応してくれた人がいて、「おぉ、これは面白い。もっと作ろう」という感じだったんです。
-- フリーソフトウェア、オープンソースコミュニティーという意識は強くあったんですか？
そういう意識は全然なくて、元々、フリーソフトウェアは素晴らしい、それに貢献しようという気持ちも全然なくて、
ただ、自分の作ったものを人に見せる手段として、オープンソースというか、フリーソフトウェアのやり方が気に入ったからなんですけど。
僕は大学生の頃に UNIX を触って 、Linux を触って、その頃に一緒に居た人が、 変わったタイプで、ものすごく学ぶべき所があったんですね。 その人は GNU の考え方に共感していて、信念みたいなものがあったんです。 その影響で、大学 3 年の頃 に
Think GNU という、 GNU について書いた本を読んで、当時
「これだよ！」と、共感するものがあったんです。今それを読んで感動するかはちょっとわからないですけど。
-- 元々オープンソースというわけではなくて、一番純粋に自分でこういうのが欲しい、
作ったから、公開したいという気持ちから、オープンソースに提供したって形なんですね。
自分が生み出したものに対して、一抹の悲しさというか、子供を手放すような気持ちがあったりしないですか？
いや、ないですね。元々、自分が使いたいものを作るというのが一番最初にあって、
公開するというのは二の次ですね。 というのも、他の人にとって何のプラスにもならないものを公開してもしかたがないと思うので。
自分の為に作ってみて面白くて、これは人にも見せたいな、他の人にも便利かな。
と、ふと思ったときに公開しようと思っています。
-- 奉仕の精神ですか？
いや、奉仕では全然ないですね。僕、首藤さんのインタビューを読んだんですけど、
首藤さんも自慢したいだけとおっしゃってましたよね。多分僕もその気持ちの方がが強くて、
奉仕しようなんてことは全く考えてないですね。
むしろ、迷惑を与えてるかもしれないですよね。自分の作ったソフトのせいで酷い目に遭っているかもしれないので。
-- 弊社でも社内のポータルなどに使わせて貰っていますよ。
はっきり言ってここまでメジャーになるという認識はあったんですか？
いや、メジャーになっているかどうかって認識はよくわかんないですけど、
ただ作ったから人に見せてみようと思っただけですね。
-- 「 先に公開したもの勝ちだ」とホームページに書かれていましたよね。
「 公開しないのは、ないのと同じだ」とも。 あれは、確かにそうだなーと。それは一般的にオープンソースでなくても、
場合によっては、一企業内でもそれは言えるのかもしれないなぁと思いました。
あれは、多分 1 年位前にまとめたんですけど昔からそう考えてたってわけでもないです。
-- ホームページを色々拝見させて貰いました。 非常に 、Tips 、主義主張がまとめられてて、参考になるなと思ったんですけど、
失礼ですけど今おいくつなんですか？
26 です。
-- あ、お若いんですね。 結構、高林さんのホームページを一通り見るだけで、「あぁ」と。思ってしまうんですよ。
だから、もうちょっと年配の方だと思っていました。
なぜか昔からそう思われることはよくありますね ( 笑 ) 。
-- 書く事は好きなんですか？
いや、好きじゃないです ( 笑 ) 。
-- それで、あの量を公開するって言うのは、手間よりも、発表したい、
見てもらいたい欲求があるんでしょうか。
どうなんでしょうね。僕が表に出しているのは、
割と安全で無難そうなことで、普段喋ってるようなことはあまり書かないですね ( 笑 ) 。
たまに、他の事をやりたくなくて逃避のつもりで、ああいった事を書くというのはあります。
新世代・旧世代、古き良き文化・古き悪き文化
-- 旧世代・新世代について書かれているページを拝見したんですが、
（ UNIX に見る世代間の断絶 ) どちらかというと、高林さんは新世代系ですか？
いや、自分の事はどちらかよくわからないですけど。
古い気質と、そうでもない気質があるとすると、自分の世代はどっちがどっちかよくわからない。
ここで分かれ目があるかな、という気がしますね。
-- 丁度、ジェネレーションギャップみたいなものがある時代なんですかね？
そうみたいですね｡ちょうど僕が大学に入ったのが
95 年、Web がちょうど盛り上がってぐーっと来てる時で、 一方で NetNews * 1や、fj のようなものがまだある時代でしたから。
その古き良きというか、そのような UNIX 文化の中でもあるけでども 、Web も盛り上がってる時代だったので 。
* 1NetNews
NNTP ( Network News Transport Protocol ) を使って、サーバに メッセージを投げると、サーバにそれが記録される。それを 専用ソフトを使って、閲覧することが出来る 。
-- そうですか。古き良き UNIX のコミュニティーって、独自の文化がある、どこか敷居が高いイメージがありますけど 確かに、ぱっと見た感じで言うと今の
Linux などのコミュニティーって、昔と雰囲気的に違う気がしますよね。
そうですね。 あまり、こういうことを言うと怒られるんですけど、つい一昨日くらいに、 日経の ITPro で、 日経バイトの副編集長 が FreeBSD と Linux のコミュニティーの違い について語ってたんですね、 それはなかなか面白くて、どういう内容かと言うと、極端な見方ではあるんだろうけど、
FreeBSD ユーザが集まる集会があって、それを見てたら、その編集者は愕然としたと。
「 印象的だったのが、昔ながらの環境に固執する
FreeBSD ユーザのかたくなさだ。 特に GUI に対する嫌悪感たるものはすさまじいものがあった。 こうしたコミュニティーの中から初心者に使いやすいインターフェイスなど出てくるわけがない」と断言してて。 むちゃくちゃ笑えたんですけ ど ( 笑)、これが全部ではないんですけど、こういう面もあるのかなぁと。
特にその、発言が多くて声の大きかったりする人にそういった面が強いかなぁと感じなくもないですけど。面白いですよね。
-- 武士道みたいなものですかね。
どうなんでしょう、わからないですね。 僕はそれで、fj や、古き良き UNIX 文化的なものを長い間読んでいて、 そこから沢山のことを学んで、すごくいい事だったんですけれども、 一方で、よくよく考えてみると 、 「 なんだこれは」という所もあって、 それが古き悪き文化でもあるなと、思うところも有って。
-- 具体的にはどんなところですか？言いづらい部分もあるかもしれませんが。
例えば、相対的に、昔と今を比べると、昔は、大学とか、企業の研究所ぐらいにしか
UNIX のネットワークはなくて、 一般の人は 、PC でフロッピーディスクしかないような環境でしたよね。 この差はすごく大きいですよね。その当時、こうした計算機環境に携われる人は限られていますから、 ネットワークでサーバを動かしたりすることが高度なことをやっているぞという感覚なんですよ。 ところが、皆 ADSL とか光ファイバーを引けるようになって、 自宅サーバなどが当たり前になってくると、 「 別に UNIX のサーバなんて誰でも立てられるじゃん。」と変わってきますよね。 昔はサーバの設定といえば付属のわかりづらい文書を真剣に読む必要があったのに、 今や google してコピペするだけですし。 昔は凄かった事でも、今になっては当たり前な事って沢山ありますよね。 つまり、昔は研究者の方が、圧倒的に優れた計算機環境を持ってたんですけど、 今は誰もが全く同じ計算機を使ってるし、ソフトウェアに関していうと、 研究者の人 が
TeX と Emacs でプレゼン資料作るのと、普通の人が PowerPoint で作ったプレゼン資料だと、 後者の方が断然生産性が高いですよね。普通の人が、インスタントメッセンジャーでビデオチャットをしたり、
P2P でファイル交換をしたりして、自宅の光ファイバーを活用してるのに、 その一方、頑なな研究者は相変わらず
Emacs 、TeX とか言っていたりすると、 なんだか研究者のコンピューティングの方が全然遅れてるなと感じることがあります。
UNIX の定番ツールでも、こんなもの使われるべきではないと思うのに、 長く使い続けられているものが沢山有ると思うんです。 例えば procmail は、とにかく設定ファイルがややこしかったので、 まいりました 。
-- procmail って、設定ファイルに謎の記号を書きますからね ( 笑 ) 。
僕はそれについて 、UNIX MAGAZINE の連載でも、 メッセージとして 書きました けれども、そういった使いにくいソフトや、 古いものが定番として残ってるのだけれども、 専門的な技術者や技能を持っている人達って、 使いにくいものを使いこなすのが好きなんですよ。 使いにくいものを見ると、それを使いこなそうとする。 ただ単に使いにくいだけなのに、それを使いこなせると「これは奥が深い。」と喜んでいるのは
ちょっと変ではないかと思いますね。 あと、そのソフトや言語に変な仕様があるのだけれども、
それは歴史的に残さざるを得ないというような時に、ドキュメンテーションでカバーしようとするんですね。 だから、procmail はドキュメンテーションがやたら充実してるんです。
Web 上の情報も設定ツールもすぐ出てくるし、付属のマニュアルも充実しているし・・・。 でも、そもそもこの仕様が腐ってるじゃないかっていう ( 笑 ) 。 あと、僕が怒って 、 「 なんだこれ！」と思った別のツールがあるんですけど、 それを Web で検索するとむちゃくちゃ情報が充実してるんですよ。 使いにくいソフトを使いこなす事に対して、奥が深いといって喜びを見出す人達が 情報をまとめてくれ て
Web にあって、その情報があるから助かるん ですけど、 よく読んでると 、 「 なんて奥が深くて素晴らしいツールなんだろう！ 」 って書いてあるんですよ。でもそりゃないだろうと
( 笑) 、ただ単に使いにくいので、 みんな使うのに困ってるだけなんだから。
-- 情報源の多さってその製品の良さとか人気を表している訳ではないですかね？
それも表してはいると思うんですけど、 例えば、使いにくくて、定番になってしまっていても、情報が充実するってことですね。
-- 例えば、vi とか。
僕は UNIX を喜んで覚えたから、全然、言えた立場ではないんですけど、 使いにくいものを使いこなす事を喜ぶのが割と弊害となる部分が多くて、 使いにくいものを使いこなすと、それが嬉しいっていう心理があって、 それがために、本来使いにくいものがありがたがられるっていう、
「 奥が深い！」って勘違いされるという・・・。
-- なるほど、古き良き UNIX 文化に固執するのは、その辺りが元凶なのかもしれませんね。
Emacs と TeX から離れられないというのは、ちょっとよくない面ではないかと思うんですね。 面白いのは、流通的に言うと、古くからある技術と、新しく生まれてきているソフトウェアなどが 色々あると思うんですけど、例えば、昔だったら何か面白い発明や、ソフトは、
UNIX 的・研究者的なコミュニティから生まれてきたんじゃないかなぁと気がするんですけど、 ネットワークを使った面白いソフトは、今は別に
Windows のアプリでも別に出来るし、 匿名の人が急 に
Winny とか出したりしてきますよね。 だから面白いアプリケーション自体が UNIX 側からはもう出ないという時代になってるなという印象がありますね。
あと、文化的な摩擦も、結構観察してると面白くて、僕は入ってないんですけど、
いろんな ML をチェックしてる人がいて、面白いことがあると教えてくれるんですけど、 古き文化を守 る 「
古き良き」な人が居る訳ですよね。 で、そういう人たちが割と大きな顔をしていて大きな発言をしているんですね。
で、そこに、そんなバックグラウンドがない人たちが大群で押し寄せてくるわけですよ。
そうすると、文化的な摩擦がむちゃくちゃになるわけです。
匿名投稿で変なメールが投稿されると、「私が昔どこそこに居た頃は・・・。」と言って、
突然説教が始まったりして、滑稽といったら悪いですけど、
そういうのがなんだか面白くて、気になってるんですよね ( 笑 ) 。
--そうですよね。ML って怖いですもんね。変な事言えないですから。
そう、さっきみたいな初心者が出てきて、つまらない質問をすると、
突然古株が出てきて、わーって怒ったりとか、で、怒ってるかと思えば、
薀蓄を披露したいだけの人も出てきて、自分の薀蓄を語って、それに続いてつまらない昔話的な雑談が沸き起こって、
それでこう、お決まりのパターンになってて、「あぁ、また始まってるよ」って友達が教えてくれるんですけど、
でも、文化的な摩擦ってもう時間の問題と言うかもう見れなくなると思いますよ。
-- どうなんですかね、時代の変わり目なのかもしれませんね。
でも、新しいと言われている高林さん達の世代でも、
古き良き世代って言われる時が来るんですかね？
どんなんでしょう、わからないですけど、重要なことが
1 つあって、 僕はそういった 「 UNIX には新旧世代の温度差があるよねぇ。」といったことを友達としてたんですね。 で、 「 古いのはこうで、新しいのはこんなんだ。」と僕が力説をしていたら、
その友達がすごくいい事を言ったんですよ。
「でも、ちょっと遠くから見れば、どっちも一緒に見えるよ。」と。
それでがーんときてしまって、「そっか、大した差ではないんだな。」と。
-- 深いですね。 そういった事でも、潔く、そうだって認めてしまった方がより客観的に見えるということですね。
それが別に悪いことではない訳ですしね。
1 つエピソードがあるんですけど、学会などに行くと、「古き良き」ものが好きな人が割といるんですね。
ある学会の帰りに、皆で食事に行って、Emacs について話していたんですけれども、 誰かが確か、 「
Emacs に色をつけるなんて嫌だなぁ。」という話をしていたんですね。
僕は 「 色がつかない Emacs なんて信じられない。 」と言ったんですね。 そしたら、何と、同じテーブルに座っていた人達が「
Emacs に色をつけるなんて邪道だーーー！」って ( 笑 ) 。 僕はたった 1 人の少数派になってしまって、ピンチだったんですけど、 古き慣習を頑なに守ろうって人達が居る所には居るんですが、その頑なさは何なんだろうと思いますね。 でも、やっぱりこれも些細なことじゃないか、とも思うんです。 例えば 「 csh がいい 」 と言っている人に、 「 いやいや zsh の方がいい 」 って言ってるのも大差ない同じ事かな、と。 だから確かに、古い人と新しい人が使ってるツールは違うかもしれないけど、まぁちょっと遠くから見れば一緒かなぁと。 それよりも、もう少し大きな見方があるかなあ、と。
オブジェクト指向との関わり
-- 高林さんと、オブジェクト指向との関わりについて、教えていただけますか。
僕はオブジェクト指向について、専門的に詳しいというわけではなく、素人も同然なんですけど、
オブジェクト指向は、すごく難しいものだと思い込んでいたので、長い間食わず嫌いだったんですよ。
なぜかというと、すごく単純な理由だったんですけど、用語がたくさんあって難しそうだなって印象があったからで、
オブジェクトとかクラスとか、メソッドとか継承とかカプセル化などの用語を一気に覚えるのは難しくて。
しかも概念としてすごく抽象的で、どこか掴み所がないような感じがして、
で、さらに何とかパターンとかってどんどん言葉が増えるじゃないですか。
「こんな難しいこと知らなくてもいっか」と思ってたんですよ。 でも、「噛み砕いて言えば、クラスとはデータ構造と手続きをひとまとめにしたものだ」と
どこかに書かれていて、「なんだ、それだけだったのか。」ということで、じゃ、やってみるかという気になったんですね。
いきなりオブジェクト指向でプログラムを書き始めれば、それは当たり前になるんでしょうけども、
オブジェクト指向以前的な書き方をしてる人にとって、オブジェクト指向と言われると、
「 なんだか難しそうだな」とか「この言葉って何だろう」とか。
そのような言葉の難しさは結構あると思いますね。
最近 Ruby でプログラムを書くことが多くて、C 言語でプログラムを書くときも、 オブジェクト指向的に書く感じになってるんですけど。
Ruby の前は 、Lisp の一種の 、Scheme という言語をやっていたんですけど 関数をデータのように扱えるとか、クロージャがつくれて環境を閉じ込めた無名関数を作れたり、
S 式っていうリスト構造を作れたりするのがかっこよくて、信者になってしまったんですけど。 でも僕が一所懸 命 「
Scheme はいい！ 」って言っても周りの人は全然で・・・、 一人でプログラミングしてても寂しいのと、実際にプログラムを書こうとすると、 最初は guile という処理系を使っていたんですけど、全然ライブラリがなかったりで
「 だめだこりゃ。」って気になってきて・・・。
それで、しばらくしてから Ruby を使ってみると、 なんと Ruby でも、lambda { |x | ... } のように クロージャが作れて、しかも、配列を作ると、map メソッドなんかもあって、 すごく Lisp っぽくて 、Scheme と同じようにプログラミングが出来る。 クロージャっていうと、難しそうなムードが漂ってくるんだけれども、
Ruby ではブロックと呼んで、イテレータでもブロックを渡して、初心者でもとっつきやすく、
Scheme のような処理を出来るっていうのですんなり入っていって、 これは、初心者な人にも、マニアな人にも、どっちにもいいな。と。
-- 言語で言うと、今は Ruby が多いですか？ Ruby と Scheme を比べると、ほとんど Ruby 信者の方に変わりつつあるんですか ？
ほとんど実用のプログラムは Ruby で書くことが多いですね、 クラスライブラリが使いやすいのと、スレッドが簡単に作れるので、 ネットワークのプログラミングとかだと、スレッドがあると、 プログラムが簡単に書けることが多いので、その辺で
Ruby をよく使いますね。 あと、最近だ と
Scheme も、昔は guile を使ってたんですけど、 最近は Gauche という、ライブラリがよくて、 実装としての完成度も高いものを使っているので、 また Scheme でプログラムをちょっと書いたりしてます 。
-- Scheme っていうのは、今どのくらいコミュニティーや、 認知がされてて、どういうところで使われているんですか？
あんまり使われてないですね、コミュニティーも小さいし。
でも、教育用言語としては素晴らしくて、大学の授業で使われていたりします。
-- Ruby は技術書も大分出ていますし、新しい物好きでなくても知っていますし、 そのように右肩上がりに浸透している理由というのは、今おっしゃった辺りになるんでしょうかね？
書き易いですしね。マニアックな人は lambda { |x| ... } とか、 怪しげなプログラムも書けるし、そうじゃない人も、普通にすんなり書けるし。
高林さんは現代エンジニア
-- ところで、凄く好き嫌いがあるとは思うのですが、Java ってどう思いますか？
僕 、Java でプログラムを書いたことが一度有るんですけど、あんまり嬉しくなくて(笑 ) 。
なぜかというと、なんだかコードを沢山書かなければいけないのが面倒くさくて。 それで、最近 、Visual Studio .NET で C# がどんなもんかっていうのを試してみたら、 実はこれが気に入ってしまって 。Ruby でプログラムを書いていると、 ダイナミックタイピングという言語の仕様で、変数名が間違っていると、実行時にエラーが起きるんですね。 型はあるんですけど、例えば nil ってオブジェクトに対して何かメソッドを呼んだりすると、 エラーが起こって、実行時のエラーが多くて、困ったなぁという時があるんですけど、
C# とかだとそういうのが少なくて、いいなあと。 あと 、C# がよかったっていうのは 、Visual Studio .NET
がよくできているっていうのがあって、 こればかりやっていると 、UNIX とか Emacs とか使ってるのバカらしくなりますよね 。
-- やっぱり高林さんって新しい人なんですね。 ずっと UNIX 文化でやられて来てる方って、ああいったリッチな IDE って、 毛嫌いする人が多いように感じるので 。
僕は 、Emacs と make と gcc と gdb などを使うのに、 今はだいぶ慣れましたけど、すごく修練に時間が必要だったんですよ。 でも、 僕Visual Studio .NET を初めて使った時は、 30 分で 「 これいいじゃん！こっちの方がいいじゃん！」ってことになって ( 笑 ) 。
習得に掛ける時間もそんなに必要ないし、やってみるとこっちの方がいいし。
-- いわゆる UNIX 系のを使い込んでる人って、一旦使い込んだら、手足のように動いて
「 これほど素晴らしいものは他にはない！ IDE なんて遅くてやってられない」って言われる方も居ますよね。
前にちょっと面白いことがあって 、Visual Studio か何かを買ってきた人がいて、 IDE を見て 「 あぁ、こんなの使いたくないな」と思ったらしいんですけど、
そこに、nmake とかが入ってて、それで 「 おぉ、make が動く！」とすごく喜んだそうなんです。 その人にとっては、IDE よりも、make の方が嬉しいという話なんですけど(笑 ) 。 僕も Visual Studio .NET
の IDE はちょっとかじっただけなんで、 色々使い込むと嫌な面も見えてくるんでしょうけど
、Visual Studio .NET と C# でプログラムを書くのは結構良いですね。
-- Visual Studio .NET ( IDE ) を除いて 、Java に対して C# が嬉しい理由ってなんですか ？
そうですね。get〜、set 〜 っていうメソッドは、書くの嫌じゃないですか。
だから、それがないだけでもばーっと気分が晴れますね。
あと 、Emacs で Java のプログラム書くと、これをするためにはどのクラスを使えばいいんだろうとか、 クラスライブラリを探すのが、かなりしんどいんですけど、これは
IDE があるお陰なんですけど、 API を探すのも楽ですし、サンプルコードも入ってるので、クラスライブラリ自体も、
Java のクラスライブラリより、使いやすいんじゃないの？という気がしました。
-- 変な偏見かもしれないですけど、UNIX 系の人が Microsoft 関係を誉めるのは、 何だか信じられないなぁと(笑) 。やっぱり、現代っ子、現代エンジニアなんですね。
どうなんですかね、別に僕は PowerPoint とかも好きですよ。
類は友を呼 ぶ
-- では、プライベートについての質問なんですけど、趣味や、現在興味のあることについて教えて頂けますか？
「 読書と音楽鑑賞」と言うと、うさんくさいですね ( 笑 ) 。
音楽については、いくつかエピソードがあって、さっき、Namazu を作り始めたきっかけが、 ロックだったって言いましたけど、その仲間の、プログレッシブロックという
音楽を聴くのも好きですね。そういう割とマニアックな趣味っていうのは、
何も得しなくて、色々社会的な弊害もあるんですけど、たまにはいいこともあるんですよ。
まったくの初対面の人が、MAGMA
っていう、フランスのバンドで、ほとんど輸入版でしか買えないようなのがあるんですけど、その
MAGMA の腕時計をしてる人が居たんですね。 「 なんでそんな腕時計してるの？」って聞いたら、「フランスから輸入したんだよ。」って。
そういう、類友現象っていうのがあって、そういったきっかけで突然仲良くなるとか。
他にも、ある時、僕が初台にある NTT の ICC の美術展に行ったら、突然知らない人から 「 MAGMA を聞く高林さんですよね？ 」って話し掛けられて ( 笑 ) 、
「 えっと、あなたは誰なんですか？」とお聞きしたら、
それは NTT で goo を開発をされている方だったんですけど、 僕の事を知っていて 、MAGMA が好きだって事も知っていて ( 笑 ) 、
わざとショッキングな話し掛け方をしたらしいんですけど ( 笑 ) 。
-- なるほど。 「 類は友を呼ぶ」ですか。
類友現象って、他にも有って、僕、8 年間位、TV 持ってないんですよ。 最初の頃は周りの人に結構驚かれたんですけど、最近は当たり前になってしまって、 全然驚かれなくなってしまったんですけど。で、この前、友達とカレーのパーティをしたんですけど、
13 人位集まって、なんとなく TV の話題になって、調べてみたら、 13 人のうち 、8 人は TV を持っていなかったんですよね。これも類友現象ですよね。
-- 確率論からすれば、持ってない人が8人集まるなんて・・・難しいですよね。
あと、おもちゃ集めですね。( おもちゃ登場。いもいも、モビー君、ぷーちき、BONGA 、エッシャーのトカゲ ) これ、ドイツで買ってきたんですけど。ドイツは木のおもちゃがすごく有名なんですよね。
-- ホームページもそうですけど、これもアートに近い世界ですね。いんちき芸術って、
なんちゃってアートじゃなくって、もはや芸術だと思いますよ。
んなことはないです(笑 ) 。
[ てくてく歩くゼンマイのおもちゃ ( BONGA ) ： 写真左下 の実演 ]
これのパッケージには『バッテリーフリー』とでっかく書いてありました ( 笑 ) 。
これにもいくつかエピソードがあって、類友の話の続きなんですけど、
この緑のイモムシのおもちゃを 最近知り合いになったメディアアーティストの江渡さん
という方に、「これいいでしょ、ドイツで買ってきたスイスのおもちゃだよ。」って、見せたんですよ。
そうしたら、 「 これ、naef ( ネフ ) のでしょ。」って知ってるんですよ。
-- naef って有名ですよね。私も、木のおもちゃとか結構好きで、最近買い始めたんですけど。これも類友現象ですね(笑 ) 。
[ プーチキ ： 写真上・左から 2 番目 の説明 ]
これは友達からもらったんですけど、会社に持っていったら、
増井さんが出てきて、「なんでお前こんなので遊んでるんだ。」ってばかにされてしまって。
でも、その直後に、たまたま江渡さんがやってきて、「これ 佐藤雅彦 のでしょ。 」 って、また知ってるんですよ。それで、僕がこれ
( BONGA ) を NY に行ったときにお土産で買ってきたんですね。 それで 「 こういうの買ってきたんですよ。」って、おもちゃを見せたら「僕もこれ見たこと有るよ。」って何でも知ってるんですよ。
僕は 「 僕らと遊ぼう 」 というチェコの人形アニメの DVD を持っていて、 「 最近はチェコのアニメが好きなんですよ〜。」と言ったら、 また江渡さんに 「 それ僕全部持ってるよ。」って言われて ( 笑) 。なぜか類友なんですよね。 新しいものを買ってきて「どうだ！」って言っても、
全部知ってて、かなわないんですけど。こんなん買って来て、全部持ってるって人が居るっていうのが、
何か、こう、類友なんだなぁ。と。
-- あと、好きな言葉 が
Better late than never .
( 遅くともしないよりはまし ) と伺ったんですが、何か理由はあるんですか？
本や音楽の趣味で 「 もっと早くこれを知っていればよかったのに！」ということは多いと思うんですが、
プログラミングでも何でも同じですよね。気付いたり知るのが遅かったとしても、
ずーっと知らないよりはましだし、むしろ、「ついに巡り合うことができた！ 」
と感謝すべきかな。今さらこんなことしてももう遅い、とか、無駄だろう、といった「今さら感」のせいで、
ついつい新しいことを始めたり覚えたりするのがためらってしまいがちですが、
この言葉を思い出して、躊躇せずに新しいことをやっていければいいな、というのがありますね。なかなか実践は難しいんですが。
あと、自分で も 「 いやな法則」という名前で
思いついた言葉をまとめているんですけど、その他に、色んな格言を集めるのが好きなんですよね。
UNIX MAGAZINE
の連載でも、毎号、記事のはじめにプログラミング関連の引用句を載せていました。
そうですね、例えば、計算機関連の言葉だと、最終回で紹介した
細かいことばかりにこだわっていないで人間的になろう。 -- Jamie Zawinski が好きですね。技術の重箱のすみにこだわったり、議論したりするのは大切なこともありますけど、
そればっかりでは不毛ですし。技術ばかりではなくて人間的な面をよくみていくことが大切かな、と。
若手エンジニアへのアドバイス
-- 最後に、高林さんがこれまでにおっしゃたことは若手エンジニアに対してへ
のアドバイスに当てはまる気がしますが、敢えて言うなら何かありますか？
そうですね、自分もまだ若いのでこちらがアドバイスを貰いたいです。
もしかしたらもうプログラミングなんてやってる時代じゃないかもしれないですし。
と言いつつ、3 つ考えてきました。思想的な部分も入ってるんですけど・・・。
若年寄症候 群
最近 、Web で何でも調べられるので、色々調べていると、
「 なんだこの人は。自分より若いのに何でこんなにすごいんだろう。」とびっくりすることが多いんです。 よく読んでみると、Web 日記が公開されている事が多いので、読むんですけど、結構がっかりするんですよ。
なんだかいわゆる「業界人」っぽい文体、内容、主義、主張なんですよね。考え方が妙に爺くさくて、
似通っていることががあって、なんだか皆均一化されちゃってるなと感じることがままありますね。
これはどういうことかというと、高校生が書いてる日記と、 40 歳近い人の日記も区別つかないんですよね。あまりにも似通ってて。
自分も人の事はぜんぜん言えないんですけど。
それは、誰もが同じようなニュースサイトや日記などを読むので、
入ってくる情報が均一化してそうなるんだろうなぁっていうのもあるんですけど、
せっかく、もっと、若いんだったらもっとやんちゃな事、変な事をやってほしいなあ、と思うことがありますね。 一般的に、 「インターネットはいろんな情報が沢山入るから趣味が多角化して、個性を多角化して、
色んな方向に伸びる。」という説があるんですけれども、
「 実は均一化する方向に向かってるよね。」というのは、最近よく聞く話だと思います。
-- そこで言う業界って言うのは、いわゆるここの業界ですか？
例えばなんとかというOS を使ってるならその世界だとか、なんとかという言語を使ってるなら、 そこを使ってる世界といったように、 コミュニティーごとにちょっと変だなというくらいに似通ってしまっているような・・・。 これは別にアドバイスって言う感じではないですけど、なんとなく、雑感として。
謎めき症候 群
次、2つ目ですね。大学院にいると特にそう思う事があるんですが、すごく優秀な人なのに、
成果をあまり公開しなかったり、自分自身も表に出るのを控えたりする人がいて、
もったいないなあと思うことが、昔からありますね。それは多分日本人的なメンタリティがあって、
謙譲の美、隠匿の美学だとか、奥ゆかしさ、っていうのがみたいなのがあると思うんですが、
「目立たないで、知る人ぞ知る存在になりたい。」というようなことを言っていて、
その人が埋もれてしまうのはなんだかもったいないな、と思うことがある。と。
例えば、たまにあるのが、調べものをしていて、日記サイトを見つけて、
この日記はいい事が書いてあるなと思って、ひとつ上の階層へ上ってみたら 「 not found 」だったりすると、自分が他に何をやっているかを隠して、 日記だけ公開していると、 なんだかこの人謎めいているなぁと思うことがあります。 それはその人のポリシーで、自分のイメージを どうやって見せるかっていう話なんですけど、そう言った延長で ソフトウェアやノウハウなどの成果が埋もれてしまうのはもったいないな。という印象がありますね。
論文のための論文症候群
で、もうひとつあって、これも大学院に居て思うんですけど、
論文を書くだけではなくて、使えるソフトを作って、公開して社会に還元するということを盛んにやって欲しいなと。
首藤さんも、同じような事を言っていたのではと思うんですけど、
「論文のための論文を書く」という風潮がどうしても強いですね。
論文を書くことが大学院生にとって大切なことなので、それはいいんですけど。
僕のいる研究室は、自然言語処理講座といって、
情報検索もその中に入ると思うんですけど。この分野の研究って、例えば人の書いた論文を読みますよね、
それと、自分がやっている研究がありますよね。
で、自分の実験と、先にある実験の結果と比較して、自分の方がいいって言わなければいけない時に、
自分はこういうメソッドで、こういう結果が出た。じゃあ君のでやったときにどういう結果が出るんですか？という
評価、実験をし直す必要があるんですよ。でも、ソフトが公開されていないと、
その研究成果が使えないんですよね。 で、論文を書くために、他人のメソッドを再実装をして実験している人が結構居るんですけど、それって不毛ですよね。
本当に理論的な、基礎的な研究なら論文だけでもすごい価値があると思うんですが、
応用寄りの論文になってくると、ソフトを出してくれないとどうしようもないなぁということもありますね。
面白いことが書いてあっても、 ソフトが公開されていればなぁと思うことが多いですね。
奈良先端大の松本研究室の同級生の 工藤君は理論寄りの研究で 論文を書いて、実験に使ったソフトウェアも、ものすごく完成度の高い形で公開しているんですね。 ですからそういうのすごく尊敬してますね。 松本研究室では、茶筌 っていう、形態素解析システムを作ったんですけど、 工藤君 はMeCab という、茶筌よりも 、4 倍くらい早くて、完成度が高いものを公開しているんです。 工藤君はスーパーマンみたいな人なので、普通の人にはなかなか真似できないんだけれども、 そういった感じで、研究成果を論文だけではなくて、ソフトとしても公開する。 特に、応用寄りの研究だったらそうして欲しいなと。
-- ソフトウェアの世界ってアイディアですから定量的な評価ってなかなか出来ないですよね、
だから、それは、大学とかの教育機関だけでなくて、民間の教育機関でもそうかもしれないですね。

Having a moon like ours makes us very special , cosmically speaking .
This is according to proper scientists at the Universities of Arizona and Florida ( as opposed to Mystic Meg ) , who 've been searching the universe with the Spitzer space telescope for other planetary systems like ours .
The Earth - Moon system is a rarity in the universe .
Credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech
The team has concluded that satellites created by an enormous collision ( as the moon was ) probably only turn up in between five to ten per cent of planetary systems .
" When a moon forms from a violent collision , dust should be blasted everywhere , " said Nadya Gorlova of the University of Florida , lead author of a study published in the November 20 edition of the Astrophysical Journal .
" If there were lots of moons forming , we would have seen dust around lots of stars - but we did n't . "
The team went hunting among stars that are of a similar age to our own sun when the moon formed .
After scanning 400 of these , they found only one system was immersed in dust .
They then factored in the probable span of any " moon forming " period , and calculated that the best chance of a given solar system forming a moon like ours was between five and ten per cent .
Making planets produces large quantities of dust , since worlds are built up from huge collisions , like the one that formed our moon .
For only one system in 400 to have any observable dust suggests that by the age of 30 million years , most systems have finished making their planets .
Younger star systems swirling in dust are likely in the process of forming their planets , Gorlova said .
But the rarity of a system being dusty at 30 million years old actually reinforces the idea that something unusual has occurred .
If all the other systems have made their planets and settled down , something else might be going on in the anomalous system .
The team also concedes that the dust they have observed does n't indicate that a moon is actually forming .
" We do n't know that the collision we witnessed around the one star is definitely going to produce a moon , so moon - forming events could be much less frequent than our calculation suggests , " said George Rieke of the University of Arizona , a co-author of the study .
Our moon is given credit for a lot : some suggest that the tides is caused have helped us ( well , not us , but life more generally ) emerge from the sea .
Others have argued that the coincidence of its relative size matching that of the sun is vital to the development of science .
they suggest that solar eclipses helped direct humanities attention to the skies , and kick - started our process of understanding the physical world we inhabit . ®

One Species ' Genome Discovered Inside Another Species ' Genome
Bacterial to animal gene transfers shown to be widespread , with implications for evolution and control of diseases and pests
Wolbachia DNA is integrated into the host cells ' DNA .
August 30 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .

A team of researchers has discovered that a bacterial parasite ( called Wolbachia ) can insert almost its entire genome into the genomes of members of one host species ( a fly called Drosophila ananassae ) , and can insert parts of its genome into the genomes of members of several other host species .
" We 've found at least one species where the parasite 's entire or nearly entire genome has been absorbed and integrated into the host 's , " says Jack Werren of the University of Rochester , principle investigator of the study and a world - leading authority on the Wolbachia parasite .
" The host 's genes actually hold the coding information for a completely separate species . "
This research , which has important implications for evolution , is reported in the August 30 issue of Science .
It was funded by the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Frontiers in Integrative Biological Research program , which supports large , integrative projects addressing major questions in biology .
In addition to finding virtually the entire Wolbachia 's genome integrated into the fly genome , the research team also found stretches of Wolbachia DNA of various sizes integrated into the genomes of four other insect species and four nematode species .
The research team corroborated their laboratory analyses by computational analyses that identified stretches of Wolbachia DNA in nine of 27 published insect genomes , suggesting that as many as one - third of invertebrate species have Wolbachia DNA in their genomes .
Werren says that several types of evidence indicate that gene transfers from Wolbachia to invertebrates occur frequently , including : 1 ) the team 's discovery of Wolbachia DNA in so many randomly selected organisms ; 2 ) the agreement between the team 's laboratory analyses and computational analyses ; and 3 ) the infection of approximately 70 percent of the world 's terrestrial invertebrates by Wolbachia , which means that this parasite has had a virtually limitless number of opportunities to transfer its genes to its hosts .
It is not yet definitely known whether any transferred Wolbachia genes are functional .
But Werren says that the frequent nature of Wolbachia lateral gene transfers indicates that this parasite has probably produced new functions in some animals .
Moreover , the transfer of even a fragment of a Wolbachia genome would be significant if it contained even one functional gene .
NSF Program Director Matthew Kane says that the discovery of lateral gene transfer between Wolbachia and one of its insect hosts is not a fluke or a rare occurrence .
" Insects are the most diverse of all groups of animals , and have established symbiosis with many different microbes , " he says .
" This study portends that horizontal gene transfer from microbe to host is probably a major force in evolution . "
How does Wolbachia transfer its genes to other species ?
When the Wolbachia invades an organism , usually an insect , it eventually reaches the host 's eggs or sperm .
Once there , Wolbachia DNA is ensured passage to its host 's offspring .
But if the host cells accidentally pick up Wolbachia DNA as they routinely repair their damaged DNA , resulting genetic changes in the host cells may also be passed on to the host 's offspring .
It was the Wolbachia 's known ability to infect its hosts ' reproductive organs together with an earlier discovery by other researchers of a Wolbachia genome incorporated into a beetle genome that initially inspired the research team to screen the genomes of invertebrates for Wolbachia genes .
Early in the screening , they found evidence that some Wolbachia genes were fused to the genes of the fly , as if they were part of the same genome .
In an attempt to isolate the fly genes from the Wolbachia genes , the researchers killed all of the Wolbachia in a colony of fruit flies by feeding antibiotics to the flies .
Follow - up testing of the fly DNA for Wolbachia DNA revealed , to their dismay , that it still tested positive for Wolbachia DNA .
The researchers eventually discovered that they were detecting copies of the parasite 's genome that remained in the fly genome , not the bacteria itself .
The researchers also verified that the Wolbachia genes were inherited like " normal " insect genes in the chromosomes .
In addition , they confirmed that some of the genes were " transcribed " in uninfected flies , meaning that they contain copies of the gene sequence that could be used to make Wolbachia proteins .
The discovery of frequent lateral gene transfer has important implications for genome - sequencing projects in which bacterial DNA has typically been discarded as contamination .
This study indicates that such discarded bacterial DNA may very well be part of the organism 's genome , and may even carry functioning traits .
The discovery of frequent lateral gene transfer also has important implications for pest and disease control .
If , for example , laterally transferred genes become vital to a disease - causing or transmitting host species , the transferred genes could serve as new disease - fighting targets .
In the future , the researchers hope to investigate whether other bacteria besides Wolbachia are engaging in frequent lateral gene transfer .
Although Wolbachia is not known to infect any vertebrates , such as humans , lateral gene transfers " have happened before in the distant past " notes Werren .
" In our very own cells and those of nearly all plants and animals are mitochondria , special structures responsible for generating most of our cells ' supply of chemical energy .
These were once bacteria that lived inside cells , much like Wolbachia does today .
Like Wolbachia , mitochondria have passively exchanged DNA with their host cells .
Wolbachia could follow in the path of mitochondria , eventually becoming a necessary cell component .
" In a way , Wolbachia could be the next mitochondria , " says Werren .
" A hundred million years from now , everyone may have a Wolbachia organelle . "
" Well , not us , " he laughs .
" We 'll be long gone , but Wolbachia will still be around . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A very common gene can help explain why breast - fed babies tend to grow up to be more intelligent than those raised exclusively on bottled milk .
Mothers breastfeed their newborn babies at a government hospital in Manila June 21 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Joseph Agcaoili
Breast - fed babies who shared the genetic variant outscored bottle - fed peers in intelligence tests , researchers said .
The variant to the FADS2 gene , involved in processing fatty acids , is found in about 90 percent of people , they added .
“ For 100 years , the intelligence quotient has been at the heart of scientific and public debates about nature versus nurture , ” Terrie Moffitt of Kings College London and colleagues wrote in their report , published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ Evidence that nature and nurture work together drives a nail in the coffin of the nature - versus - nurture debate . ”
The study looked at 3,200 children in Britain and New Zealand .
Breast - feeding has many advantages for children including reducing infections , respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea , earlier research has shown .
A study presented at an American Heart Association meeting on Monday added healthier blood cholesterol levels to that list .
Although scientists have been looking at potential links between breast - feeding and intelligence for decades , the direct relationship has not always been clear .
The researchers studied the FADS2 gene involved in processing omega 3 fatty acids found in foods such as salmon , nuts and avocados and turning them into nutrients for the brain .
In both countries , breast - fed children had a higher IQ by about 6 to 7 points , but only if they had a variant that made the gene more efficiently process fatty acids .
For those with the less common -- and less efficient -- variant , breast - feeding made no difference when it came to intelligence , the researchers said .
The researchers ruled out alternate explanations , saying the effect of FADS2 applied equally to babies with normal and low birth weight .
The effect was also the same no matter the mother ’s social class or IQ .
The team also tested the mothers ’ DNA and concluded that the FADS2 gene did not somehow alter the quality of breast milk .
“ We took cells from the children and then analyzed DNA and then we compared how they scored on IQ tests and looked up if they were breast - fed as babies , ” Moffitt said in a telephone interview .
“ It was very straightforward . ”
While the researchers have found at least one gene linking intelligence and breast - feeding , they said they still need to better understand how FADS2 processes nutrients in breast milk .
They also acknowledge that many other genes also likely have a role in intelligence but say their study offers a different approach to unraveling the human genome , Moffitt added .
PARIS–Former prime minister Dominique de Villepin was placed under formal investigation yesterday for his role in an alleged plot to smear Nicolas Sarkozy and damage his chances of winning the presidency .
In addition to " complicity in slanderous accusations , " other serious charges being considered include : receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use forged documents .
If he is indicted and convicted , he could face up to five years in prison .
" I wo n't hide the fact that these accusations are hurtful for me and my family , but I will fight so that the truth finally comes out , " Villepin said yesterday .
Sarkozy was the target of a smear campaign in 2004 when he was finance minister and jockeying to succeed Jacques Chirac as president .
At the time , an anonymous message was sent to a judge that listed Sarkozy and other officials as holders of secret accounts at Clearstream , a financial clearing house in Luxembourg , in which they supposedly benefited from $ 1.9 billion ( Cdn. ) given to French officials as kickbacks for the sale of French navy frigates to Taiwan in 1991 .
Villepin's Paris apartment and his office were searched by the police this month as the investigation moved forward .
The raids were prompted by files found on the computer of a retired spy , Gen. Philippe Rondot , who had been asked by Villepin in 2004 to investigate the list outside official channels .
The recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll looking into the views of the military community , both service members and families on the war in Iraq , seems to have been big news to some , but to many military families it was just a statement of fact .
From the Military.com site an article from the Cincinnati Post entitled “ Poll Questions Family Support of War ” ( December 10 , 2007 ) gives a pretty clear explanation for why military family support for Iraq is on the decline : “ Today 's all - volunteer force is older and more married than any before it .
… At the same time , deployments have grown longer and more frequent as Soldiers rotate in and out of the war zone , sometimes three and four times , with no end date in sight , a wearing existence that has contributed to opposition to Bush and his war strategy . ”
As one of those military family members , the bottom line is that we are so weary from the sustained level of stress from repeated combat tours , not just in one war effort , but two .
And how do you suppose it feels to hear our leaders talking about the possibility of a third ?
My husband retired last year with 30 years of combined service with the USMC and the National Guard .
Three out of our six children enlisted in the military , two of whom made a career in the military .
I often say I was born in the military , I married the military and I gave birth to the military .
So I get that the ultimate cost / risk being in the military is the potential for combat , injury and / or loss of life .
I accepted that voluntarily when I married into the military .
I am not a pacifist ; I understand that wars are sometimes necessary .
However , I expect that war should always be our last option as a nation and a people .
As a long time military family member , I have endured and supported my loved ones and friends fighting in both Iraq and Vietnam .
It makes me crazy when people are so full of opinions about Iraq , but would never consider going there themselves .
They have a multitude of reasons for not joining ; just ask our Vice President why he sought five deferments during Vietnam .
It was reported in an article on 5/1/2004 in the New York Times by Katharine Q. Seelye “ Away from the hearing room , he [ Cheney ] told the Washington Post that he had sought his deferments because ‘ I had other priorities in the 60's than military service . ’"
Increasingly over the last five years , both in the media and among average Americans , the rhetoric around this war has become so mean - spirited and attacking that dialogue has become impossible .
Sometime statements are made with little understanding of what life in the military is like for both veterans and their families .
Does anyone consider how the bipartisan bickering feels to us ?
As recently reported on 12/6/2007 in the Grayson County News - Gazette , regarding the service members who have died in Iraq , Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was quoted as saying , “ … Nobody is happy about losing lives but remember these are not draftees , these are full - time professional soldiers . ”
To that I ask “ and that means what exactly ? ”
That volunteering for your country is relinquishing one ’s right to speak out when you disagree ?
Or because our military are “ full - time professional soldiers ” rather than draftees , they and their families are supposed to hold their tongues and follow orders without a thought ?
I expect statements like that made by Sen. McConnell , from people with a limited understanding or personal experience our current military .
But as the mom of a daughter , who is a single parent , set to deploy to Iraq before the end of this year , I was deeply offended .
I am offended when any politician attempts to use the lives of our loved ones as a political battering ram .
We are not Democrats or Republicans fighting and sacrificing for our nation ; we are Americans .
I just wish more Americans who believe Iraq is worth us losing our loved ones over , would head for the recruiting stations and actually walk the walk and not simply talk the talk .
Do you really want to support our Troops in a tangible way ?
Give our brave men and women a break from repeated tours , enlist .
Our military desperately needs enlisted personnel and officers ; the maximum age of first - time enlistment has been raised to the ripe old age of 42 .
Personally , I love and support our military and I speak out against the war , with my family ’s full support .
Both can exist in our nation and if that stops being the case , then we have lost who we are as a nation .
What happened to “ I may not always agree with what you have to say , but I will fight for your right to say it ” ?
I long for the day when we can get back to having respectful , fact - based dialogues and disagreements .
Another point of contention I have regards something implicit in Sen.
McConnell ’s above statement , which is about our so - called “ all voluntary ” military .
In the beginning when I began to make my feelings known , inevitably someone would try to throw that in my face , like it was supposed to silence me by pointing that fact out .
After hearing it one too many times I had enough and I came up with what I think is a well thought out response .
Our police , local , state , and federal , is also voluntary .
The biggest current difference between our current military and our many law enforcement personnel is the simple fact that the latter , can quit any time they choose .
Their contracts cannot be involuntarily suspended .
( i.e. Stop Loss Policy )
Our voluntary , though financially compensated , police force know exactly what they are getting into , do they not ?
They know each and every day that they are putting their lives on the line .
They know that too often , they are out - gunned by the criminal element from which they attempt to protect us .
How many times have you ever heard the public or our government respond to the concerns of our police or their families by saying , “ did n’t you know what you were getting in to …no one forced you to choose law enforcement as a career ? ”

The US dollar fell to a new - time low of $ 1.3486 against the euro earlier amid new concerns about the strength of the US economy .
The greenback has weakened continuously since September due to concerns over trade , low levels of consumer spending , an increasingly mammoth budget deficit , and the prospect of more federal cash being pumped into Iraq .
This is also of prime concern in Euroland where strong euro is hurting their exports .
French finance minister said there could be world “ economic catastrophe ” unless measures are taken to stem the rising euro .
However , European Central Bank President , controller of the 12 - nation currency will not yet take action and intervene in the currency market to halt the dollar ’s slide .
The dollar has lost 63 percent against the euro since October 2000 , when it was just 82 cents .
Analysts believe the Euro will continue to grow stronger .
Adrian Hughes of HSBC said , “ I can see it finishing the year around $ 1.35 and we can see that it 's going to be a steady track upward for the euro / dollar in 2005 , finishing the year around $ 1.40 . ”

Many people would like to be self - employed but fear the risk -- with good reason .
Within five years , half of new businesses are out of business .
Ironically , you 're particularly likely to fail if you follow such standard business school exhortations as " Innovate ! "
While such advice makes for interesting class discussions and may be appropriate for " intrapreneurs " inside deep - pocketed corporations , it puts the average entrepreneur at grave risk of going bust .

The key to maximizing your chances of success is to do the opposite of what is taught in business school :
1 . Do n't innovate ; replicate .
Being a guinea pig is so risky :
Your idea or its execution could easily be flawed , or it can be so new that the public is n't ready for it .
Tivo , an unquestionable improvement over the VCR , lost hundreds of millions of dollars in its first five years as it tried to educate the public .
You probably do n't have hundreds of millions of dollars and five years to wait for profitability .
Instead , clone a simple , small - investment business that , in multiple locations , is successful .
How can you tell ?

The Bay Area is very anti-establishment yet needs fast food -- burrito joints are perfect .
The pound has gained on the perception that US interest rates will be cut this week , while UK interest rates will be left unchanged next week .
When UK rates are higher than US rates , investors are encouraged to exchange dollars for pounds to benefit from better rates of return .
At one point the pound touched $ 2.070 , before paring gains to $ 2.067 , while the dollar sank to a new euro low .
The last time the pound was at these sorts of levels was 5 November , 1980 , when it reached $ 2.446 .
Many analysts expect the Federal Reserve , the US central bank , to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday , in an attempt to limit the impact of a housing market slowdown .
The Fed cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point to 4.75 % from 5.25 % last month , after problems in the housing market were seen to be spreading to the wider economy .
The move sent the greenback in a downward spiral against the euro , sliding to a new record low on Tuesday at $ 1.4444 , its third record low in as many days .
Recession risks
House prices in the US have been falling and the number of foreclosures has surged in recent months after the Fed spent almost two years between 2004 and 2006 raising rates in an attempt to slow inflation .
While inflation fears have been simmering in previous months , mainly stoked by the surging oil price , many analysts now say that the biggest worry is consumers reining in their spending .
Should that happen , they argue , the US economy could splutter into a recession .
The next decision from the Bank of England 's interest rate setters is due on 8 November , when they are expected to leave rates unchanged at 5.75 % .
The perception that there will be no change has been strengthened by comments from one of the Bank 's policy makers , Kate Barker .
In an interview with the Guernsey Press and Star , Ms Barker was reported to have said : " We are asking ourselves if things are so different from August and do we actually have to cut rates ? "
The pound is still some way off the $ 2.446 mark it reached in November 1980 , but some analysts believe it could threaten those levels if economic conditions in the UK and US continue to diverge .
James Hughes , a currency strategist from CMC Markets , said he believed the market had not yet factored in the likelihood of a further cut in US rates .

While the weak dollar is good news for British travellers planning trips to the US in the run-up to Christmas , it makes the reverse trip for Americans much more expensive .
The number of visitors from North America fell in the first six months of 2007 .
The strong pound is also inconvenient for British firms exporting goods across the Atlantic .
The EEF manufacturers ' organisation said the current exchange rate was making life " more difficult " for some British companies .
But it added : " A strong world economy , a shift away from price - sensitive activities and the fact that their costs are spread across the globe have cushioned UK manufacturers from its worst effect . "
Whether you prefer Rush Limbaugh or Keith Olbermann has to do with your genes and your psychology , according to a new study .
People who are more conscientious and prefer order , structure and closure in their lives tend to be more conservative , whereas creative people who are open to new experiences tend to be more politically liberal , says John Jost , a psychologist at New York University who conducted an overview of previous studies involving a total of more than 22,000 participants from 12 countries .
But that psychological profile only pulls half the weight when it comes to determining people 's politics , his review showed .
The other half is genetic , as is revealed in studies of twins and their political bent , Jost says .
Politics in America
A number of sociologists have argued that political ideology died in America after World War II because both the left and the right wing were heavily discredited at the time .
Jost says the latest research shows the opposite , that politics in America today are very much alive .
His previous research has suggested , for example , that more than 90 percent of college students can identify where their political beliefs fit on a scale running from the “ left ” ( liberal ) to the “ right ” ( conservative ) , and that their affiliations strongly influence how they vote in elections .
Americans also appear to enjoy being involved in politics .
For instance , 44 percent of respondents to the 2004 National Election Study reported that they regularly listen to political talk radio .
Recipe for beliefs Given our current political appetite , Jost next wanted to know whether liberals have different psychological traits than conservatives .
His “ meta - analysis ” of previous studies , including his own , showed that liberals seem to be drawn to chaos and novelty — for instance , they tend to support social change — whereas conservatives prefer reassurance and structure , and thus like to maintain the status quo .
Jost ’s findings , detailed in American Psychologist , suggest that environmental factors , or the types of situations people encounter in their lives , determine approximately half of their political preferences .
For example , when people fear death or terrorism , or are in a state of uncertainty , they tend to become more conservative , he said .
A study of World Trade Center survivors after 9/11 reported that 38 percent grew more conservative in the 18 months following the attacks , as compared with only 13 percent who became more liberal .
The other factor that determines a person ’s political beliefs is biology .
Research by John Hibbing , a University of Nebraska political scientist , showed that identical twins share more political beliefs than fraternal twins .
They also , of course , share more genes .
“ Forty , perhaps 50 percent of our political beliefs seem to have a basis in genetics , ” said Hibbing , whose studies were included in Jost ’s analysis .
While genetics are unlikely to “ hardwire ” people into being liberal or conservative , Hibbing said that genes could make people more or less likely to have certain values or react to situations in a particular way .
This knowledge could pave the way to a more tolerant society , Hibbing said .
“ If you think your opponents are not just being willfully bullheaded but rather have a kind of biological predisposition toward a set of beliefs , you might not spend as much time beating your head against the wall trying to get them to change , ” he said .
A few months back we wrote about the comedic possibilities of super heroes confronting real life .
In the last few years there has been a flood of super hero comics , movies , and TV shows and many of them place people with extraordinary abilities in ordinary situations .
Witness the blockbuster Spider - Man movies , or heroes like Hiro from Heroes .
But beyond the world of fiction , what kind of super powers can we find in real life ?
Sure , it ’s fun to come up with speculative pseudoscience explanations for Superman ’s heat vision , but that ’s not likely to produce any results .
Even non-powered heroes like Batman rely too much on poor comic book physics and unrealistic survivability to produce real - life counterparts .
We ’ll find our real - life super powers in less obvious places .
In the 1980s Marvel had a character named Cypher , or more properly Doug Ramsey .
Doug was n’t known by his super hero name because his power was n’t flashy or very useful in battle - Doug was genetically gifted with the ability to understand languages .
This amazing ability to learn languages ( along with numbers , dates , etc. ) is something you can find in real life , often linked with disabling autism .
Often , but not always .
Watch the video to see the life of Daniel Tammet , the boy with the incredible brain .
In the BBC documentary Tammet explains that he see numbers as distinct shapes , colors , and textures .
It helps him recite Pi to tens of thousands of digits – not memorizing , but walking through the landscape of Pi .
He ’s able to learn Icelandic in a week .
For the second super power , we turn to a more popular hero , Daredevil .
Daredevil ’s origin is just as unlikely as most of the characters created in the early 1960s – we was hit a by a truck carrying radioactive waste .
The waste blinded him but ( of course ) heightened his other senses to an amazing degree .
Daredevil could read by feeling the ink of the type on a newspaper , hear his foe ’s heartbeat , and most importantly he could use his hearing as a sonar sense .
Ben Underwood was never splashed with anything radioactive , but he did learn to overcome his blindness through the use of echolocation .
You just have to see it .
Watch this CBS video :
( I just have to point out that his mother ’s name is Aquanetta ) .
So there we have it .
No one is faster than a speeding bullet or more powerful than a locomotive , but some super powers are real , though rare .
Did I miss any ?
Please let me know about other real - life super powers in the comments below .

If you plunked down six figures and expected to be motoring around in your emissions - free Tesla Roadster by now , chances are there might be a few ants in your pants .
The all - EV Tesla Roadster has hit a few speed bumps on its road to production , and in order to address these concerns , the fledgling automaker held a town hall meeting in San Carlos yesterday that was available to anyone who made a deposit for a car via conference call .
The skinny is that Tesla is having a difficult time developing a transmission strong enough to " survive the process of shifting gears while the motor remains at full torque " , according to our own Sam Abuelsamid who has been following the Roadster 's development from Day 1 and has actually rode shotgun in it .
Two suppliers are currently working simultaneously to find a solution .
Meanwhile , the company has gone ahead and built the first production model at the Lotus factory in Hethel , England .
The first car belongs to Elon Musk , Chairman of the company and one of its initial investors .
His car is fitted , however , with a transmission that he knows will fail in a few thousand miles .
Tesla also revealed that it is considering shipping some preordered Roadsters to customers early with similar transmissions that will be temporary and later replaced with the stronger transmission once it 's developed .
For those really eager to own a Tesla Roadster , this might be an option , but would you want to drive around a car with a gearbox that was guaranteed to fail after a few thousand miles ?
Also of note is that the Tesla Roadster 's range estimate has fallen a bit again from a previously reported range of 245 miles to something in the 220 - to 230 - mile range .
Still impressive , but let 's hope it does n't fall any further .

Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey ’s confirmation hearings got underway this morning , and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy ( D - Vt. ) explored Mukasey ’s position on administration torture policies .
His response was surprising .
Not only did Michael Mukasey repudiate the so - called 2002 “ torture memo ” signed by Office of Legal Counsel chief Jay Bybee — which appears to have survived in spirit , if not in letter — but he compared U.S. torture to the Holocaust . [...]
The Bybee memo is “ worse than a sin , it ’s a mistake , ” Mukasey said .
He referenced the photographs taken by U.S. troops who liberated the Nazi concentration camps in 1945 to document the “ barbarism ” the U.S. opposed .
“ They did n’t do that so that we could then duplicate it ourselves . ”
Beyond legal restrictions barring torture clearly , torture is “ antithetical to everything this country stands for . ”
Greg Sargent had the same reaction I did — were n’t Republicans apoplectic when Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said something similar two years ago ?
One suspects the ensuing firestorm to Mukasey ’s remarks will be a little less intense ( which is to say , non-existent ) .

The number of dementia sufferers is predicted to soar
The Alzheimer 's Society said the plan could empower patients by allowing them to wander , but called for a debate on the ethics of gaining consent .
Many people with dementia feel compelled to walk about outside - the society says 60 % may wander , and 40 % have got lost at some point .
The government has said tagging could allow people to lead " fuller lives " .
' Careful balance '
Science Minister Malcolm
Wicks first proposed the measure in April .
He said people with dementia would gain the freedom to " roam around their communities " without their families suffering the anxiety that such wandering can currently cause .
The chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Society , Neil Hunt , agrees that the technology " could offer benefits to people with dementia and their carers " .
The problem with this is that you could see second - class care using it as a way of making life easier for carers
Dr Richard Nicholson
Bulletin of Medical Ethics
Husband 's safety ' paramount '
But he stressed : " There is a careful balance to strike between empowering people and restricting their movement and this technology can certainly never be used as an alternative for high quality dementia care . "
Dr Richard Nicholson , editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics , said the scheme had potential pitfalls .
He told BBC Radio 5 Live : " The problem with this is that you could see second - class care - using it as a way of making life easier for carers rather than as a way of making life safer or more pleasant for the person with Alzheimer 's . "
He said the scheme was " not something that ought to go ahead without parliamentary debate and possibly even legislation " .
Peace of mind
Kate Ghosh , director of the British Institute of Human Rights , said the use of a tracking system should never be " a substitute for proper resources " .
" Some people are rightly questioning this and are wanting to be very sure that it's not going to be something that would just be used for convenience when there could be other measures that could be taken , " she said .
Such measures could include those to help " protect people for their own safety but also , perhaps more fundamentally , to enable them to carry on being as free as they possibly can " , she added .
Tagging could potentially allow people with dementia the chance to retain their freedom and help to keep them safe at the same time
Elizabeth McLennan , Help the Aged
Elizabeth McLennan , policy officer for Help the Aged , said electronic tagging was a good idea in principle .
" But it must always be determined by choice - it cannot be the case that a diagnosis automatically goes hand in hand with a tag , " she said .
" If older people get confused and wander off it can put them in danger and cause a huge amount of distress and worry for their family .
Tagging could potentially allow people with dementia the chance to retain their freedom and help to keep them safe at the same time . "
The British Geriatrics Society ( BGS ) , an association for doctors practising geriatric medicine , said tagging could be of benefit to patients , carers and families but warned against rushing into it .
BGS chief executive Alex Mair said : " It is a laudable objective but would have to be extremely carefully worked out in advance as it could be open to abuse . "
The Alzheimer 's Society said decisions about whether to use a tracking device should be made in conjunction with the person with the disease in the earlier stages of dementia .
Chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , Rebecca Wood , said she would want health workers to talk to people at an early stage to get informed consent .
Global Positioning System
Marilyn Loveday , who cares for her husband , Christopher - who has Alzheimer 's - said she thought tagging could prove invaluable for carers .
She told BBC News : " In the earlier stages , I would have welcomed it because he just used to leave the house and we did n't have a clue where he was and quite often he'd be gone for hours . "
Tracking devices use the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) to locate the wearer .
There is currently a growing market for devices which allow parents to monitor their children 's whereabouts , but even here the issue has proved controversial .
There are currently 700,000 people living in the UK with some form of dementia .
This is predicted to reach 1.7 m by 2051 .
Your comments
I am 78 years of age and enjoy a very full and active life .
I am in a position to say that I would welcome the use of a tag on me should it ever be needed .
I accept there may be some negative aspects but the plusses outweigh any negatives .
Ask us oldies about these issues while we are still in a position to make our own valued judgments .
And forget the advice of the " Do Gooders " of this world
Neal Martin , Gladstone , Australia
This is not the right solution in every case , but it must be a relief to some families and their loved ones who get disorientated and into dangerous situations - and it is preferable to committing such unfortunate folk to care homes who are not designed for dementia and force anyone showing strong signs of it to leave .
I sometimes wonder if their attitudes do not aggravate the problem - is tagging " worse " ?

When Mum lived with us I had to keep doors and windows locked and the keys hidden as we lived in a busy city .
As a country woman she loved to walk and this put her in real danger .
Imagine trying to also bring up two little girls ( aged 2 & 5 ) in these surroundings .
A tagging device would certainly have helped - and maybe Mum would n't have been so frustrated by her restrictions .
Ann Payne , York
As a retired trained nurse I privately nursed a patient in her own home ( on a farm ) and daily , as I left the room to make her morning coffee she , ( the lovely lady ) would go at quite a speed down the farm 's lane with me running after her .
So , yes I think the idea of a ' tracking ' device would be very helpful .
Please leave the word ' tagging ' for prisoners .

My Gran suffered from dementia and in the period when we just could n't get anyone to listen or help she used to wander off and not have a clue where she was .
It was a nightmare .
Tagging , if policed properly , is a wonderful idea and will heighten the safety of this so very vulnerable group .
Abigail Conway , Truro
My Grandmother who is 85 , suffers with dementia and wanders off if she gets the opportunity .
It does get very frightening for family members when she goes missing .
Although she does have day care , she will still wander as she can't be supervised 24 hours a day .
Electronic tagging in this circumstance would be incredibly helpful .
I appreciate that this could be seen as an infringement of her human rights , but her safety at the end of the day is the most important thing .

My Father had Alzheimer 's and passed away 5 years ago .
He went " wandering " several times .
My parents live in north London and my dad was once found in Kent .
To this day we do n't know how he managed that .
I think tagging is a fantastic idea , I remember how panicked , fearful and worried my family were when he disappeared , having to call the police etc .
Paula Higgins
A tagging system would certainly reassure the families and carers of an Alzheimer 's sufferer .
How well it would work in practical terms for the person concerned will be variable .
My Mum , who has Alzheimer 's , is now in a home but her reaction to anything new ( such as a plaster cast when she broke her arm ) was to try to rip it off , as she could n't understand it 's purpose .
It might work for some , but not for all .
Sue Sandy , Rainham , Kent
My Father had Alzheimer 's and it runs in the family so there is a chance I will get it .
I would certainly be in favour of having one on my person if I did eventually contract the disease .
I am 53 years old at present .
Geoff Tucker , Pilley , Hants
My father who sadly passed away in 2004 had Alzheimer 's and would sometimes go out by himself , which was very worrying for all of us .
Tagging him would n't have solved the problem however , it would have given us reassurance that we could find him if he did get out .
I think it is a good idea .
Marie , Acton , London
My late Mother in Law had Alzheimer 's and wandered , electronic tagging would have saved family members a great deal of worry as she regularly disappeared and was brought home by the police on a number of occasion and once by Blackpool Corporation as she had got on a bus .

A powerful group of conservative Christian leaders decided Saturday at a private meeting in Salt Lake City to consider supporting a third - party candidate for president if a pro-choice nominee like Rudy Giuliani
wins the Republican nomination .
The meeting of about 50 leaders , including Focus on the Family 's James Dobson , the Family Research Council 's Tony Perkins and former presidential candidate Gary Bauer , who called in by phone , took place at the Grand America Hotel during a gathering of the Council for National Policy , a powerful shadow group of mostly religious conservatives .
James Clymer , the chairman of the U.S. Constitution Party , was also present at the meeting , according to a person familiar with the proceedings .
Tom Schaller gets it so very right inwhen he makes the points that a ) - the GOP is rapidly declining into a regional , racist , backward southern party which will be unable to compete in national elections , and b ) - that the Democrats can win the presidency without wasting a dime on the Old Confederacy .
You may have noticed that yesterday Giuliani was wimpering how even though he's out of step with the traditional reactionary southern values that have come to dominate the contemporary GOP , " The reality is we need a candidate who can run in all 50 states .
I can . "
He may sound like Howard Dean there but he has a very good reason for pointing that up to Republicans who hate him .
He says it 's because he 's the only one of the pathetic pygmies ™ who can beat Hillary .
But it goes beyond just that .
You see , there was another little meeting yesterday , a very closed door one among the power - brokers who control the Hatred and Bigotry part of the Republican coalition that has paired Hatred and Bigotry with Greed and Selfishness .
( Giuliani already competes well for the Greed , Selfishness and Fear - mongering contingents . )
The secretive -- even paranoid -- group of neo - fascist politicians agreed that if Giuliani wins the nomination , they 'll bolt and take the South with them , dooming any already far - fetched hopes Giuliani has to win the presidency .
Dobson , one of the big dogs in the group has already announced that nothing would permit him to support McCain , Giuliani or Frederick of Hollywood .
He was the moving force behind the Gingrich trial baloon , which crashed to earth yesterday when Gingrich admitted that he can't run .
Both Romney and Cheney addressed the group earlier in the day .
The religionist right does n't trust Flip Flop Mitt , not just because he changes his positions the way normal people change their socks , but because they view his Mormon religion as a dangerous -- and competitive -- cult .
Some left the meeting muttering about finding someone else to run , either another Republican -- Sam Brownback and that Arkansas fella who lost all the weight must feel like shooting themselves about now -- or a third party spoiler .
Looking at the Progressive Punch lists of the most reactionary senators and House members , may I suggest John Barrasso or Mike Enzi of Wyoming or , if that 's digging a little too deep in the shitpile , how about Miss McConnell or John Cornyn , each facing huge disapproval ratings and possible defeat in his home state ?
OK , from the House we could go with any of a dozen congressmembers with perfect zeros : Patrick McHenry ( if he manages to not get indicted and / or outed before the primaries , Steve King ( the Ann Coulter of Congress ) , Virginia Foxx , Michelle Bachmann ( fun at parties ) , Tim Wallberg .
I think any of these would be the perfect representative of what is left of the Republican Party .
Go for it , boys !
Oh , and one more thing .
You know all that stuff up top about Rudy whining how the GOP has to be inclusive and bring everyone into the party , not just white southern bigots ?
He was just kidding .
As this new video clip shows , he avoided Tavis Smiley 's GOP debate that addressed issues important to the minority communities while he kissed up to California Hispanic 's most distrusted ex-governor , Pete Wilson ... and some former actress who now serves as a beard for Republican closet queens like David Dreier and Mark Foley .

Last week , when a federal grand jury indicted baseball star Barry Bonds for perjury , it confirmed an ugly truth : America 's got a big drug problem .
I 'm not talking about steroids , Mr. Bonds ' alleged performance - enhancer of choice .
Instead , I 'm talking about athletics themselves .
Americans are addicted to competitive sports in ways that are profoundly unhealthy to our schools , our bodies , and ourselves .
And until we confront that problem , head - on , steroids will continue to plague us .
Consider this simple fact :
Although every shred of evidence shows that adolescents do not learn well before 9 a.m. , US high schools start the day at around 7:30 a.m.
Why ?
To make room for afternoon sports practice , of course .
And consider that the time allotted to athletic practice – often two or three hours – is much longer than any academic class period .
Most high schools allot between two - thirds and three - quarters of their extracurricular budgets to sports .
In his bestselling book , " Friday Night Lights , " since adapted into a movie and television series , H.G. Bissinger reported that a Texas high school spent more on football game film than it did on teaching materials for the English department .
The team 's coach earned 50 percent more than a regular classroom teacher with 20 years experience .
In the great college - admissions sweepstakes , recruited high school athletes get twice the advantage that racial minorities receive .
But while many Americans squeal about affirmative action for blacks or Hispanics , nobody blinks an eye at special passes for the quarterback or power forward .
Ah , you might say , but these athletes are overwhelmingly minorities themselves .
False .
As every single study has shown , the vast majority of recruited athletes are white teens from well - to - do families .
And these families use their privilege to buy services – coaches , trainers , and summer camps – to ensure that they get a leg up .
So much for the level playing field .
But sports help our kids stay fit and healthy , right ?
Sure .
But competitive athletics can harm young bodies , too .
Think of girls ' gymnastics , which has witnessed a spate of eating disorders .
In 1976 , America 's Olympic gymnasts averaged 106 pounds each ; by 1992 , their average weight was down to 83 pounds .
And if you think that 's all because of healthy dieting , well , I 've got an amphetamine pill to sell you .
The most dangerous sport is football , of course .
During the past decade , at least 50 high school or junior - high - school players have been killed or have sustained serious head injuries on the field .
Some of these deaths could have been prevented if we took the risk more seriously .
But we do n't .
Although athletic trainers report that 5 percent of high school football players have a concussion each season , anonymous player questionnaires bring the number up to 15 percent .
And when the word " concussion " is omitted and a list of symptoms is provided instead , nearly half of all players report that they have sustained a concussion .
So why do n't they tell their coaches ?
We all know the answer :
They want to play .
And they want to win .
That 's the same reason they take steroids , even in the face of drug tests .
A new two - year study of 11 Oregon high schools – based , again , on questionnaires of the players – showed that random drug testing did nothing to deter steroid use .
And yet we continue to ratchet up the drug tests , instead of ratcheting down our addiction to sports .
The governor of Texas , Rick Perry ( R ) , recently signed a bill allowing the testing of all high school athletes , setting aside $ 3 million per year for the tests .
But every single dollar will go to waste as long as we teach our kids that we value athletics – and victory – above everything else .
Full disclosure : I play sports .
I watch sports .
I love sports .
Like most things , however , sports are harmful in excess .
And that 's exactly the case at every level of athletics in America .
A century ago , all high school athletics were organized and managed by the students themselves .
Then the adults took over .
Schools hired coaches , provided uniforms , built new gymnasiums , and so on .
And they made the athletes – especially the boys – into the unofficial kings of the institution .
That brings us back to Barry Bonds , the nation 's flawed home run champion .
It 's easy to condemn him for possibly cheating his way into the record books .
But part of that condemnation ought to directed at ourselves , too , because many of us would have done the same thing – if we knew we could get away with it .
When the whole culture tells you that sports rule , nobody will follow the rules around sports .

RSF has been very critical of China 's attitude to the web
For the first time , Egypt has been added to the list while Nepal , Libya and the Maldives have all been removed .
The list consists of countries that RSF believes are suppressing freedom of expression on the internet .
The civil liberties pressure group has organised a 24 - hour protest , inviting web users to vote for the worst offending countries .
Visitors to the RSF website are also invited to leave a voice message for Yahoo's co-founder Jerry Yang , expressing their views on the firm 's involvement in China .
RSF has been outspoken in its condemnation of Yahoo .
The search engine has been criticised along with other companies for helping the Chinese authorities block access to some online material .
Improvements
THE 13 COUNTRIES BLACKLISTED Belarus Burma China Cuba Egypt Iran North Korea Saudi Arabia Syria Tunisia Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Vietnam
The blacklist is published annually but it is the first time RSF has organised an online protest to accompany the list .
" We wanted to mobilise net users so that when we lobby certain countries we can say that the concerns are not just ours but those of thousands of internet users around the world , " said a spokesman for RSF .
Many of those on the internet blacklist are countries that are regularly criticised by human rights groups , such as China and Burma .
Egypt is a new entrant and has been shortlisted for its attitude to bloggers rather than specific web censorship , said RSF .
" Three bloggers have been arrested and detained this year for speaking out in favour of democratic reform .
This is an appeal to the Egyptian government to change its position , " said the RSF spokesman .
" The fact that this year we have removed three countries from the list is encouraging .
It shows that the situation can change for the better , " he added .
On a visit to Libya , Reporters Without Borders found that the Libyan internet was no longer censored although it still considers President Maummar Gaddafi to be a " predator of press freedom " .
Does cyberspace provide enough companionship ?
Some say yes
For some , online exploits replace significant others
No person is an island , or so it 's been said .
But a recent survey suggests that , in this networked age , nearly 1 in 4 Americans would n't mind being left all by their lonesomes , as long as they were able to access the Internet .
" This has as much to do with making new friends and social networking as it has to do with the traditional porn stuff , " said Tom Galvin , a partner with 463 Communications , the Washington public relations agency that commissioned the survey .
Although the survey questions were light and quirky - respondents were asked , for instance , to compare the allure of Apple 's iPhone with the sex appeal of various Hollywood stars - the method was not .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Conducted by Zogby International , a polling firm in Utica , N.Y. , the survey questions were e-mailed to a scientifically selected sample of nearly 9,800 U.S. adults , who offered precise feedback to not - so - burning questions like , " Can the Internet serve as a substitute for a significant other ? "
To that question , 24 percent answered " Yes . "
Apparently , a good broadband connection and all the possibilities it opens up would compensate for not having a companion who might , after all , leave the cap off the toothpaste , fail to put the seat down on the toilet or hog the TV remote .
Singles , as expected , are more likely ( 31 percent ) to consider the Internet sufficient companionship .
That men and women responded that way in equal numbers either supports Galvin 's " it 's not just smut " thesis or suggests that the wild side of the Web is an equal - opportunity lure .
The survey found a big split politically , however , as 31 percent of self - described progressives felt the Web could substitute for a significant other , while only 18 percent of those who said they are very conservative felt that virtual companionship could replace the tax - paying kind .
The reasons for that split could surely lead to debate , and that , said Galvin , is the point .
" The objective was to ask questions that are quick and to the point and will stir up some discussion . "
In addition to asking about the Internet and companionship , the survey queried Americans about their social - networking habits and the extent to which their Internet persona became their overall identity .
Here , it appears that 1 in 4 grown - ups belongs to a social network , a figure that shoots to 78 percent for adults under 24 , and that Democrats far outnumber Republicans in social networking ( 32 to 22 percent ) .
But whatever their degree of engagement with the Internet , only 14 percent said cyberspace was an important part of their identity , while 68 percent said their primary identity was in what might be called the bricks - and - mortar world .
Other findings :
-- Asked whether they would want a brain implant with Web access , only 11 percent responded affirmatively , and men ( 17 percent ) were more than twice as likely as women ( 7 percent ) to desire a direct link to the Web .
--
And in a question likely to make the dearly departed roll over in their graves , 1 in 5 survey respondents - and 34 percent of the 18 - to 24 - year - olds - said they would gladly sell their name for $ 100,000 .
-- Three out of 10 respondents thought it so silly to compare the sex appeal of the iPhone to celebrity guys and dolls that they skipped the question .
Of those who played along , however , 27 percent said Halle Berry made their hearts go ring - a- ding - ding ; Scarlett Johansson ranked second in overall sex appeal with 17 percent - but garnered 30 percent of the hearts and minds of the under - 24 crowd ; hunky Patrick Dempsey was third with 14 percent ; and the iPhone tied for last place with New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter , with a 6 percent sex appeal rating .

Lots of people say that they have a high standard of software quality .
What exactly they mean is only rarely defined , though .
To me , and probably to most professional engineers , a " high standard of software quality " usually makes me think that the program has the following aspects about its code :* Easily readable .*
Consistent .*
Well - organized .
And that 's really it .
If it has all those things , in my mind it 's quality software .
And if it does n't , it is n't .
I know , that sounds ridiculous , because obviously what should be more important is the interface or something , right ?
Well , let me tell you , given enough time , the interface of poor - quality software will degrade into un-usability , or the program itself will have so many bugs as to be unreliable .
That 's just the nature of unreadable , inconsistent , poorly - organized code .
The effort to modify each little piece is like a linear function as time goes on , meaning that the amount of time required to add a new feature or fix a bug could be graphed as an exponential ( or really , parabolic , I suppose ) function , probably .
I have spent too much of my life fixing the software of people who can't think of a future beyond the next few seconds .
HELLO EVERYBODY .
PROGRAMMING -TYPE -PEOPLE :
Have you ever thought about the fact that " saving time " now with poor design is going to eventually cost you so much time that your program will become unmanageable and you 'll want to start over from scratch ?

A recent analysis of the latest P2P trends wordwide shows that BitTorrent is still the most popular filesharing protocol .
BitTorrent traffic is still on the rise and responsible for 50 - 75 % of all P2P traffic and roughly 40 % of all Internet traffic .
P2P traffic stats always cause quite a bit of controversy .
In 2004 several respectable sources were reporting that BitTorrent was responsible for 35 % of all internet traffic .
This was probably a huge overestimation at the time , today this figure sounds more realistic .
Ipoque reports in a preview of their 2007 P2P survey that BitTorrent is generating between 50 - 75 % of all P2P traffic .
P2P traffic is responsible for 50% - 90 % of all Internet traffic which means that BitTorrent traffic is generating somewhere between 25 % and 65 % of all Internet traffic .
However , there is quite a bit of regional variance in the use of P2P applications according to Ipoque : “ eDonkey exhibits a regionally varying popularity with shares between 5 - 50 % of all P2P .
In certain regions , other protocols have gained a significant importance .
In the Baltic States , for instance , DirectConnect has a proportion of about 30 % of all P2P traffic ”
Ipoque reports that all P2P traffic is still growing .
Joost is not yet posing a threat to ISPs , but media streaming services and VoIP applications show significant growth .
For example , Ipoque reports that Skype generates up to 2 % of the overall traffic in certain networks .
It is probably good to know that this Internet traffic research is often conducted by companies that offer broadband management and optimization solutions .
It is in their best interest to overestimate these figures because they design the traffic shaping applications that help ISPs to manage their precious bandwidth .
The 2007 P2P survey will be presented at Technology Review ’s Emerging Technologies Conference at MIT , more details later .

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - A Chilean prostitute has auctioned 27 hours of sex to raise money for the country ’s largest charity during an annual fund - raising campaign .
Maria Carolina became an overnight celebrity in the conservative Roman Catholic country , making news headlines and appearing on talk shows since she made her unusual donation to the televised charity event , which runs for 27 hours starting on Friday evening .
“ I ’ve already auctioned off the 27 hours of love , ” Maria Carolina told Reuters on Wednesday , saying she had raised about $ 4,000 .
“ One of my clients already paid .
It seemed like a good deed to him . ”
Adult prostitution is legal in Chile .
Chile ’s two - day Teleton fundraiser is endorsed by television stars and aims to raise funds for poor , disabled children .
Speaking about Maria Carolina ’s unusual donation , campaign organizer Mario Kreutzberger said he would not encourage “ immoral ” activities , but said he would accept her pledge .
“ Everyone can do what they want , but if someone tells me that they ’ll do something immoral ...
I ’m not going to encourage it , ” Kreutzberger , who as “ Don Francisco ” hosts the long - running “ Sabado Gigante ” program on the U.S. Spanish - language Univision network , told local media .
But Maria Carolina , who advertises her services on the Internet , defended her money - raising scheme .
“ There are people who are going to be donating money that ’s a lot more questionable than mine , ” she said .
“ The only thing I did was publicize it . ”

It is surprising so little has been made of last week ’s sacking of Admiral William Fallon , the US commander responsible for the region that includes Iraq , Iran and the Gulf – for it suggests George Bush and Dick Cheney still nurture ambitions to attack Iran .
They know this has to be done in the next month or so .
They are backed by the more pragmatic Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
Last week he announced the “ enforced resignation ” of Fallon for speaking out of turn against Bush policy on Iran and Iraq .
In an interview in Esquire , the admiral warned against the obsession with Iran ’s nuclear programme .
“ Where five or six pots are boiling over , our nation cannot afford to be mesmerised by one problem , ” he said , adding that he favoured more engagement with Iran .
Gates denied Fallon ’s departure means the US is about to attack Iran .
However , this should not be taken at face value , no more than the weasel words about “ enforced resignation ” : Fallon was sacked , pure and simple .
A recently retired US general , still close to the Pentagon , tells me : “ There is a lot of activity – they are up to something . ”
The administration was stunned by December ’s National Intelligence Estimate which claimed Iran had abandoned its nuclear warhead programme .
“ It was the Intelligence world deliberately getting at Bush , ” said the general .
But since then the International Atomic Energy Authority has reported that the scale of activity in Iran ’s nuclear plants and labs suggests a weapons programme is under way .
The electoral timetable points to an attack soon .
The Majlis vote in Iran has just reinforced the hardliners , and Bush knows he must strike before the presidential election gets underway in the US .
The neocon advisers have never missed a beat in their warning : “ Bush and Cheney wo n’t allow Iran to go nuclear on their watch . ”

LOS ANGELES 
A dozen striking screenwriters gathered in the bar at the Hotel Bel Air not long ago to decompress after another day on the picket line .
Less than 10 feet away sat another strike - weary pair : Peter Chernin , president of the News Corporation , and Barry Meyer , chief executive of Warner Brothers .
Neither group acknowledged the other , although a couple of writers quipped under their breath that the moguls should pick up everyone ’s bar tab .
Others fretted about being seen hanging out at a five - star hotel , an awfully gilded setting for a bunch of guild members complaining about unfair compensation .
“ My stomach did a flip - flop , ” said one writer who was in the room .
“ Part of me wanted to go yell at these guys for treating us so poorly , and part of me wanted to go hide . ”
( The moguls did not notice the gathering of writers , according to their respective spokeswomen ) .
Similar scenes play out daily in the giant high school cafeteria that is Hollywood , contributing awkwardness to a labor strike unlike any other .
The captains of most industries do not mix socially with the rank and file , but the people on opposite sides of this bargaining table often send their children to the same elite schools , dine at the same fashionable restaurants and attend the same holiday parties .
Firefighters asked to report people who express discontent with the government David Edwards and Muriel Kane

It was revealed last week that firefighters are being trained to not only keep an eye out for illegal materials in the course of their duties , but even to report back any expression of discontent with the government .
A year ago , Homeland Security gave security clearances to nine New York City fire chiefs and began sharing intelligence with them .
Even before that , fire department personnel were being taught " to identify material or behavior that may indicate terrorist activities " and were also " told to be alert for a person who is hostile , uncooperative or expressing hate or discontent with the United States . "
Unlike law enforcement officials , firemen can go onto private property without a warrant , not only while fighting fires but also for inspections .
" It 's the evolution of the fire service , " said a Phoenix , AZ fire chief of his information - sharing arrangement with law enforcement .
Keith Olbermann raised the alarm about the program on his show Wednesday , noting that " if the information - sharing program works in New York , the department says it will extend it to other major metropolitan areas , unless we stop them . "
He then asked Mike German , a former FBI agent who is now with the ACLU , " This program seems to be turning [ firefighters ] , essentially , into legally protected domestic spies , does it not ? "
" That 's the entire intent , " German replied , noting the serious legal issues involved .
" There is actually still a fourth amendment , " he pointed out , " and what makes a firefighter 's search reasonable is that it 's done to prevent a fire .
If now firefighters are going in with this secondary purpose , that end run around the fourth amendment wo n't work , and it 's likely that they will find themselves in legal trouble . "
Olbermann , however , was most strongly concerned about the implications for civil liberties .
" Is what disturbs you and the ACLU the same thing that just jumped off the page for me ? " he asked .
" That one phrase , ' look for people who are expressing hatred of or discontent with the United States ? '
Discontent ? "
German agreed that there are serious first amendment issues raised by the focus of the program on constitutionally - protected literature , such as books that might be considered " terrorist propaganda . "
Olbermann asked in conclusion whether firefighters could be used under this program to plant evidence .
German agreed that the way it is defined " really plays to people 's prejudices and gives them the opportunity to do damage to someone . "

Outspoken Republican Senator breaks Air Force One ' rules ' , criticizes Bush
Outspoken Republican Senator Arlen Specter is said to have pulled out the stops on a recent Air Force One trip with President Bush , reports the New York times in its Friday , July 27 edition .
Bucking certain expectations about refraining from criticism of Bush and his cohorts , Specter talked not only to press on board , but directly to Bush , expressing his disdain for Attorney General Gonzales , citing " personal loyalty " as Mr. Gonzales ' " job security . "
The Senator also brought up the touchy subject of unmet demands from Congress for testimony from former house counsel Harriet Miers and presidential adviser Karl Rove .
This came shortly after Gonzales ' appearance at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , which Sen .
Specter says was " devastating ; " Gonzales stands accused of misleading Congress with conflicting testimony .
#
Excerpts follow :
A spokesman for Mr. Specter had no further comment .
White House officials seemed none too pleased with Mr. Specters remarks , but had no comment , either .
Mr. Specter is something of a serial breaker of the unspoken rules aboard Air Force One .
In 2004 , in chatting with reporters on the plane , he went so far as to share election strategy as told to him by Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove .

There were angry protests as people rushed to buy petrol
Windows were smashed and stones thrown at the stations , and there was traffic chaos as motorists queued to buy fuel .
Iranians were given only two hours ' notice of the move that limits private drivers to 100 litres of fuel a month .
Despite its huge energy reserves , Iran lacks refining capacity and it imports about 40 % of its petrol .
The country has a large budget deficit largely caused by fuel subsidies and the inflation rate is estimated at 20 - 30 % .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent , Frances Harrison , says Iran is trying to rein in fuel consumption over fears of possible UN sanctions over its nuclear programme .
Iran fears the West could impose sanctions on its petrol imports and cripple its economy .
' Dangerous move '
The restrictions began at midnight local time on Wednesday ( 2030 GMT Tuesday ) and are set to continue for four months - with a possible extension to six months - the government said .
There is anger that the government did not give people more notice .
Some MPs have called for an end to the rationing and parliament may postpone its summer recess to deal with the crisis .
During the night , cars were set alight and petrol stations vandalised while , in the capital , a supermarket and a bank were also attacked .
" Guns , fireworks , tanks , [ President ]
Ahmadinejad should be killed , " chanted angry youths , throwing stones at police .
The protests are the first large - scale outpouring of anger against the Iranian government since Mr Ahmadinejad took office in 2005 .
Iran 's petrol is heavily subsidised , sold at about a fifth of its real cost .
The price of 1,000 rials ( $ 0.11 ) per litre makes Iran one of the cheapest countries in the world for motorists .
So far there has been no announcement about whether Iranians can buy more petrol at the real market cost .
Licensed taxi drivers will be able to buy 800 litres a month at the subsidised price .
US pressure
Our correspondent says rationing fuel is only likely to add to high inflation .
It is a dangerous move for any elected government , especially in an oil - rich country like Iran , where people think cheap fuel is their birthright and public transport is very limited , she says .
The US , which is leading efforts to pressure Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , has said Iran 's fuel imports are a point of " leverage " .
Washington and other Western nations accuse the Islamic Republic of seeking to build nuclear weapons .
Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and is solely aimed at producing civilian nuclear power .
Eric Kleefeld at Election Central has this response from the Romney campaign to explain his posing with the Obama / Osama picture :
Election Central contacted Romney spokesman Kevin Madden for comment , asking if it was appropriate for the candidate to hold the sign up with the woman .
" The governor stopped briefly for a picture with a supporter who just happened to be holding their own sign with an alliterative play on words , " Madden said , via e-mail .
" I do n’t think it was equating or comparing anyone . "
Just a little alliterative play on words .
Kind of like " macaca " was just some funny - sounding made - up word George Allen heard somewhere .
For one , Gore 's favorabilities are up an astounding ten points overall since early August , and even more importantly , his approval rating among Democrats rests at an impressive 79 % .
Just for comparisons sake , that is nine points higher than Obama 's favorabilities and fifteen points higher than Edwards ' ;
Hillary only bests
Gore by five points in the category .
I 'm also willing to speculate that many Democrats do n't remember than Gore was the first of the bunch to oppose the war - if and when such information were to ever be learned by the Democratic masses , I imagine his ratings would exceed those of Clinton's .
Even more importantly than favorabilities though is the fact that a plurality of Democrats would like to see Gore jump into the race for the White House .
By a 48 - 43 % margin , respondents would like to see the former vice president throw his hat into the ring .
No , it 's not a majority , but when you would potentially have four top - tier contenders for the nomination , 48 % is an awfully high number .
Does 48 % wanting him to run equal 48 % of the primary votes ?
Probably not , but its still a very good reflection of Gore 's appeal as a candidate .
It 's also likely a reflection of the electorate 's weariness of a year - long race for the nomination - it has long been said that Gore , believe it or not , would provide voters with a fresh face with a late October entry .
Now , the same poll also finds a slight uptick in support when Gore 's name is thrown in with the rest of the Democratic field - he's up four points since earlier in the month and in third place .
That being the case , I 've long said that these polls are not a reflection of Gore 's actual support should he run ( as evidenced by the previous paragraph ) .
For an accurate picture of how many people might vote for Gore in the primaries , the question must be asked as such : " If Gore were to run and the Democratic primaries were held today , who would you vote for ? "
These polls instead have not included the clause that I highlighted and thus , many , many Democrats do not choose Gore based on the fact he 's not currently running .
See an earlier diary that I wrote for a further analysis of Gore 's viability .
Also , as NeuvoLiberal points out in the comments , check out Pollster.com 's " Gore Roundup " for a relatively accurate take on his polling over the past year .
Lucky for us , a little birdie has told me that the AlGore.org people have commissioned a Zogby Poll that will ask the question correctly - stay tuned for a poll that may very well shock the pundits and mainstream media later this week .
Also , in case you missed it , Barcelona wrote a diary about the new Current TV website and how Al himself uploaded three clips online where he advocates for single - payer health care , a safe and immediate withdrawal from Iraq , and a less overreaching executive branch .
After well over a year of nothing but climate change - The Assault on Reason being the exception - and little else , the timing of these clips is very , very interesting .
Finally , if you are in the Chicago area tomorrow , consider stopping by the big event that Draft Gore-ers are assembling outside the Hyatt Hotel where Gore will be addressing the Chicago Economic Club .
From what I understand , there will be people across the street holding up huge letters that spell the phrase " AL GORE 2008 . "
They also ponied up and hired a bike to ride around the building the whole time is there with two huge billboards that read " Run Al , Run ! "
It 's the last public event , that we know of at least , this month , so we want this to be as big and visible as possible !
A new study from the American Naturalist finds that honeybee workers ’ sons are reared 100 times less in species with a queen mated to multiple males .
Credit : Courtesy F. Ratnieks
Worker bees , wasps , and ants are often considered neuter .
But in many species they are females with ovaries , who although unable to mate , can lay unfertilized eggs which turn into males if reared .
For some species , such as bumble bees , this is the source of many of the males in the species .
But in others , like the honeybee , workers " police " each other – killing eggs laid by workers or confronting egg - laying workers .
In 1964 the English biologist William Hamilton put forward his " relatedness hypothesis " , a major landmark in kin selection theory .
His hypothesis was that worker bees , wasps and ants do not reproduce because most workers are half sisters .
Instead the workers favor the queen 's male progeny , since she has mated with multiple males , ensuring variation in the species .
According to this theory , a species where the mother queen mates with multiple males would have more worker policing .
This theory is widespread and in animal behavior textbooks .
However , Hamilton 's relatedness hypothesis was challenged in 2004 by researchers from the University of Lausanne , Switzerland .
They compared 50 species and found no evidence that multiple mating by the queen correlated with reduced rearing of workers ' sons or greater worker reproductive policing .
Were the textbooks wrong "
A new study appearing in the current issue of The American Naturalist strongly supports Hamilton 's original theory .
Tom Wenseleers and Francis Ratnieks ( University of Sheffield ) compared 90 species and found that workers ' sons are reared 100 times less in species with a queen mated to multiple males .
They also found worker policing by the queen , with the queen eating working - laid eggs , in all species with multiple - mated queens , but in only 20 percent with single - mated queens .
" It seems that the textbooks do not need rewriting , " write the authors .
" Kin selection theory is important when studying relatedness in social behavior .
Social insects , with their great variation in kinship , have been a key test bed of the theory , and the theory has revolutionized our understanding of insect societies . "

“ Where the difference is , we provide both sides of the story , ” Mr. Morris said .
On its Web site , the institute declares , “ All things in the universe were created and made by God in the six literal days of the creation week ” and says it “ equips believers with evidences of the Bible ’s accuracy and authority through scientific research , educational programs , and media presentations , all conducted within a thoroughly biblical framework . ”
It also says “ the harmful consequences of evolutionary thinking on families and society ( abortion , promiscuity , drug abuse , homosexuality and many others ) are evident all around us . ”
Asked how the institute could educate students to teach science , Dr. Paredes , who holds a doctorate in American civilization from the University of Texas and served 10 years as vice chancellor for academic development at the University of California , said , “ I do n’t know .
I ’m not a scientist . ”
He said he had no ready explanation for the panel ’s recommendation .
“ I asked about the decision , ” Dr. Paredes said Monday in a phone interview from Austin .
“ I got a three - inch - thick folder an hour ago .
We ’re going to give it a full review . ”
But , he said , “ If it ’s approved , we ’ll make sure it ’s of high quality . ”
Approval would allow the institute , which moved to Dallas this year from near San Diego , to offer the online graduate program almost immediately while seeking accreditation from national academic authorities like the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges within two years .
AMD Spider Launched !
AMD officially launched their Phenom quad - core desktop processors on November 19 , 2007 , beating predictions that AMD will fail yet again to meet their deadline .
In fact , they are a little early , having promised that the Phenom will be out in December .
Things are finally looking up for the beleaguered AMD .
Not only were they able to launch the Phenom quad - core processors , they also launched two new ATI Radeon HD 3800 graphics cards and the new AMD 790 chipset , all part of their new desktop gaming platform called Spider .
So what is the AMD Spider all about ?
This chart explains it quite succinctly :
The AMD Spider platform consists of three new AMD high - end components - the AMD Phenom processor , the ATI Radeon HD 3800 series graphics card and a motherboard based on the AMD 790 chipset .
Do note that the AMD Spider platform revolves around these high - end components .
As an enthusiast gaming platform , it does not cover the lower - end AMD processor , the older Radeon HD 2000 series graphics cards or even the new AMD 770 - based motherboards .
So , what does the AMD Spider Platform offer ?
Let 's give AMD 's marketing folks an opportunity to summarize the key innovations of the AMD Spider .
In short , the AMD Spider not only delivers the industry 's first " true " quad - core processor , it also gives gamers the first motherboard chipset built using the 65 nm process technology as well as the ability to run up to four graphics cards .
Very impressive , is n't it ?
Well , let 's take a look at each component separately .

Via : AdAge :
New Yorker Alison Wilson was walking down Prince Street in SoHo last week when she heard a woman ’s voice right in her ear asking , “ Who ’s there ?
Who ’s there ? ”
She looked around to find no one in her immediate surroundings .
Then the voice said , “ It ’s not your imagination . ”
Indeed it is n’t .
It ’s an ad for “ Paranormal State , ” a ghost - themed series premiering on A&E this week .
The billboard uses technology manufactured by Holosonic that transmits an “ audio spotlight ” from a rooftop speaker so that the sound is contained within your cranium .
The technology , ideal for museums and libraries or environments that require a quiet atmosphere for isolated audio slideshows , has rarely been used on such a scale before .
For random passersby and residents who have to walk unwittingly through the area where the voice will penetrate their inner peace , it ’s another story .
Ms. Wilson , a New York - based stylist , said she expected the voice inside her head to be some type of creative project but could see how others might perceive it differently , particularly on a late - night stroll home .
“ I might be a little freaked out , and I would n’t necessarily think it ’s coming from that billboard , ” she said .
Joe Pompei , president and founder of Holosonics , said the creepy approach is key to drawing attention to A&E ’s show .
But , he noted , the technology was designed to avoid adding to noise pollution .
“ If you really want to annoy a lot of people , a loudspeaker is the best way to do it , ” he said .
“ If you set up a loudspeaker on the top of a building , everybody ’s going to hear that noise .
But if you ’re only directing that sound to a specific viewer , you ’re never going to hear a neighbor complaint from street vendors or pedestrians .
The whole idea is to spare other people . ”
Holosonics has partnered with a cable network once before , when Court TV implemented the technology to promote its “ Mystery Whisperer ” in the mystery sections of select bookstores .
Mr. Pompei said the company also has tested retail deployments in grocery stores with Procter & Gamble and Kraft for customized audio messaging .
So a customer , for example , looking to buy laundry detergent could suddenly hear the sound of gurgling water and thus feel compelled to buy Tide as a result of the sonic experience .
Mr. Pompei contends that the technology will take time for consumers to get used to , much like the lights on digital signage and illuminated billboards did when they were first used .
The website Gawker posted an item about the billboard last week with the headline “ Schizophrenia is the new ad gimmick , ” and asked “ How soon will it be until in addition to the do - not - call list , we ’ll have a ‘ do not beam commercial messages into my head ’ list ? ”
“ There ’s going to be a certain population sensitive to it .
But once people see what it does and hear for themselves , they ’ll see it ’s effective for getting attention , ” Mr. Pompei said .

' Incestuous ' US attorneys downed Democratic governor : reporter Nick Langewis
Published : Monday December 10 , 2007

This RAW STORY investigative reporter Larisa Alexandrovna recently sat down with GoLeft 's Mike Papantonio on Air America 's Ring of Fire to discuss particulars about the case of imprisoned , White House - targeted former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
" So , " starts Papantonio , " Larisa , it seems like everywhere that Karl Rove goes he leaves his ugly , dirty little fingerprints .
Same story in Alabama , apparently , huh ? "
" That 's why he 's succeeded , " says Alexandrovna .
" That 's why he 's called a ' genius . ' "
" Apparently , " continues Alexandrovna , " a criminal with unlimited funds is a genius these days . "
" Filling in some blanks " on Scott Horton 's piece in Harpers Magazine , election fraud was a small , but significant , part of what appears to be a hit job on Siegelman by Republican operatives .
Siegelman , then the Democratic incumbent , was running against Republican Bob Riley in the 2002 election , and had by all appearances won the election against Riley , by a margin of roughly 3,000 votes .
However , overnight , more ballots for Riley were " found " and counted by an all - Republican panel and subsequently sealed by then - Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor .
A " cabal " of Republicans recounted the votes , determined Riley the winner , and the Attorney General then sealed the ballots .
In order for Democrats to even challenge the ballots , they would have to get a court order .
" To this day , " says Alexandrovna , " those ballots remain sealed . "
" Pryor ... " says Papantonio , " everybody understands -- that have followed his career at all - - he was the guy that gets the midnight appointment during the recess .
He 's a recess appointment by Bush , because everybody realized what a thug -- and he is a thug .
I 'm down here in the south and I 'm very familiar with Alabama - - the legal system up there .
He is absolutely a thug .
And he then gets appointed to the appellate court as a recess appointment . "
It is not known if Bill Canary , a long - time Republican operative dating back to the pre-Reagan presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush , and former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove asked Pryor to seal the ballots , but Alexandrovna and Papantonio freely speculate .
" I believe that 's exactly what happened , " says Papantonio .
Canary was a Riley campaign consultant who had also managed William Pryor 's Attorney General campaign with Karl Rove in 1998 .
Ballots were also sealed in that campaign , which is said to have been part of a drive to unseat Democratic judges to replace them with so - called " goose - stepping Republicans . "
" So , all of a sudden , " says Papantonio , " we have Siegelman - - is bumped out because Pryor allows that to happen ... Siegelman says , ' Well , I 'm going to run again .'... What happens when he says ' I 'm going to run again , I 'm going to run for Governor again against Riley ? ' "
" I think it 's important to mention that Billy Canary 's wife is the US Attorney for the middle district , " says Alexandrovna , calling the close personal relationship between an ally of Siegelman 's opposition , and the United States Attorney commissioned to investigate him , " fairly incestuous . "
Whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson , a GOP attorney doing opposition research for the Riley campaign , details in her affidavit and in Congressional testimony of a conference call , after Siegelman 's 2002 concession , between the son of Governor Riley and Canary in which they discuss ways to " take care of " Siegelman .
In the first such attempt , a case alleging attempts on Siegelman 's part to rig Medicare bids , U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon cited an assistant US Attorney and an assistant Attorney General for contempt of court in September of 2004 .
Most of the evidence against Siegelman was barred , and all charges were ultimately dropped .
" So then the next thing that happens , " says Papantonio , " is they shop for the judge .
The question is : Well ,
What judge has so little scruples ; what judge has so little concern about justice that we could actually get them to go after Siegelman in light of the fact that another judge looked at all the facts and said ' This is ridiculous .
This is made up junk ' ? "
" They had to appoint their own , obviously , " responds Alexandrovna .
Bush - appointed judge Mark Fuller was conveniently assigned to the 2005 case , in the district of Leura Canary , against Siegelman , which would have Siegelman ultimately convicted of seven out of 32 charges related to bribery and corruption .
Fuller , as Alabama 's District Attorney , was thought to have defrauded the State of Alabama by falsifying payroll records , as Siegelman 's successor alleges .
Former HealthSouth CEO
Richard Scrushy donated $ 500,000 to Siegelman 's campaign to fund the state lottery , to benefit education .
Siegelman did not benefit at all directly .
Siegelman , they say , in turn appointed Scrushy to the Alabama Hospital Regulatory Board .
" The irony is , " says Alexandrovna , " that Scrushy 's been on that board under three other governors . "
Continues Alexandrovna , " So that 's basically what they got him on . "
The trial was marred with suspicious activity .
Two jury members were exchanging e-mails during the trial .
The foreman , before he was chosen , had already shown himself to be biased by openly expressing his belief that Siegelman was guilty .
44 Attorneys General , in protest , penned a letter to Congress after Siegelman was sentenced to 7 years , 4 months in federal prison .
He was n't allowed out of prison on appeal .
Siegelman was given the " Diesel Tour , " as Papantonio calls it , meaning he was transported between prisons to hinder his ability to appeal the case .
Says Alexandrovna , Siegelman 's attorneys were being told he was in Texas when in fact he was " on tour . "
" More importantly , " Alexandrovna continues , " he 's been denied access to journalists .
The [ Department of Justice ] has not allowed him to have access to journalists while in prison , according to his daughter , whom I 've interviewed . "
In addition , Siegelman 's house has been twice broken into , in addition to a break - in at his lawyer 's office , possibly in search of the case files .
In addition , Dana Jill Simpson 's house was burned down , and she once was run off the road .
" That is basically the image of politics in Alabama , and Mississippi , and Louisiana , " says Papantonio .
An entire timeline of the Siegelman case is available HERE .
The exchange between Alexandrovna and Papantonio is available for viewing and listening below :
Nov 05/07 Mayor Rudy Giuliani avoids seriously ill resident Clayton Holton , who he has never met , nor been asked a question by .
Though Mayor Giuliani obviously recognized Clayton from his encounter with Romney , and shows his clear reluctance to answer any questions dealing with medical marijuana .
He can answer questions about abortion , nuclear war , arresting immigrants , gun control , and genocide in Dafur , but he 's afraid to say if he will arrest the sick who use medical marijuana .
It turns out that P2P is not only an enemy for the major record labels , it 's also an excellent marketing research tool .
In fact , MediaDefender is using piracy to help labels increase profitability .
Most people assume that record labels hate filesharing , but it seems that some companies actually use it as a research tool .
In this specific case Interscope asked MediaDefender to check whether one of “ Pussycat Doll ” Nicole Scherzinger ‘s leaked singles is getting some traction on P2P networks .
Her first single “ Whatever U Like ” is n’t selling well and they want to find out if pushing the track “ Baby Love ” is a good idea .
Valuable information for them apparently , and it shows that P2P is not all bad , it ’s a tool .
Here ’s a quote from an internal MediaDefender email that was leaked on BitTorrent :
Nicole from pussy cat dolls has a single called “ whatever u like ” .
It ’s not selling well on itunes or playing that great on radio .
A song called “ Baby Love ” just leaked ( I do n’t know how long ago ) .
Interscope wants to know if Baby Love is picking up steam on p2 p .
They need to make a decision by early next week on whether they should switch to this song as the single .
Please get me a score comparison on Monday for these two tracks .
Also , please put beyonces , fergie , gwen , and nelly furtado singles as comparisons .
So , while the RIAA is suing the heck out of downloaders claiming that they lose them money , their monitoring of P2P itself is providing a rich source of information that businesses love .
It enables the label to gauge the mood of the pay market in advance – a glimpse into the future – to ensure that they do n’t alienate their customer base by giving them stuff they do n’t want .
In a business , this type of market foresight can be invaluable .
Nearly always leading to more profits , customers feel happier and more satisfied with the products they are offered , leading to greater loyalty longer - term .
MediaDefender checks how popular the song is , produces some nice graphs , and Interscope releases the single if it ’s popular enough , saving the label money and pleasing their customers more as they do so .
Long live P2P !

An unrepentant old Nazi officer who served in some of the worst concentration camps gives the Hitler salute in Spain where he has hidden from justice for over 60 years .
Now Paul Maria
Hafner is the subject of a TV documentary called " Hafner 's Paradise " which chronicles his life in exile – and how he manages to draw pensions from three countries .
Operation Last Chance , the campaign to round up the last Nazis in Europe organised by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel , has him on their wanted list .
Scroll down for more ...
Yet although Hafner , 84 , continues to make outrageous statements that would put him behind bars in Germany or Austria , no government has sought to prosecute him .
He calls the death camp of Auschwitz , where 1.1 million Jews were murdered , " a ten star hotel " where " Jews were sent for their own protection .
All that stuff about murder is Allied propaganda crap . "
Of Hitler he says : " I regard him as the greatest man who ever lived , the most important person in the history of the world . "
He said he gets out of bed every day to give the raised arm salute to his Fuehrer .
He agreed to a documentary being made on him " because I want to set the record straight about our ideals and our cause during the Third Reich . "
He admits he dreams of seeing a " Fourth Reich " in Germany adding : " I am only sorry I will not be around to see it . "
After WWII , Hafner found asylum in Franco 's Spain , protected from allegations of war crimes and surrounded by old comrades .
This is why Spain is " paradise on earth " for him - a place that allows him to continue to nurture his fanaticism , and yet protects him from the scrutiny of international justice .
" No Jew was ever killed under Hitler for being a Jew , " he said , refusing to elaborate on what he did when posted to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau in Germany .
Hafner is not being pursued actively by governments although Nazi war crime sleuths in Israel believe him guilty of atrocities in the two concentrations camps where he worked and on the Eastern Front where he served as a fighting SS man .
He draws three pensions because he qualifies for a war pension from Germany , an old age pension in Spain where he worked for many years as a pig farmer and one from Italy because it is the land of his birth .
Being a former concentration camp guard is not a barrier to receiving a German pension .
In the documentary , Hafner is brought face - to - face with a survivor from Dachau .

" You survived quite well , " Hafner responds matter - of - factly after the Jewish victim recounts his painful memories .
According to Hafner there are hundreds like him in Spain .
Gunter Schwaiger , who filmed Hafner 's Paradise , said : " He is in close contact with people who are indeed wanted or have been convicted in other countries because of their anti-Semitic actions and declarations , or because they have denied the existence of the Holocaust .
" Paul María Hafner is neither a Martian nor a diabolical being , but an apparently respectable gentleman living in a smart Madrid neighbourhood who , aged 84 , might be taken for a congenial grandfather , filled with goodness and affection .
" The defeat of the Third Reich was an enormous trauma for Hafner , from which he has not yet recovered .
His convictions have simply become firmer .
He is not troubled by the accounts of the victims , or that National Socialism led the world to disaster .
His fanaticism remains just as intact today as 60 years ago . "
The film is due for release in the UK in the spring .
The race is on to detect ripples from the most massive events in the universe : spinning , orbiting , exploding or colliding ultra - dense objects like black holes and neutron stars .
In 1918 , Albert Einstein predicted these cosmic events would radiate a propagating distortion of space and time : gravitational waves .
After spending hundreds of millions of dollars to detect them , scientists have come up empty .
But do n't write off the hunt just yet .
Physicists worldwide have been fine - tuning enormous , multimillion - dollar machines to filter out background noise so they can observe the unique signatures of a gravitation wave .
Before the decade is out , they believe they 'll record the percussive crash of colliding black holes or the vibrant hum of a pulsar – a discovery that would be the proverbial shot heard around the scientific world .
" I tell students they 're lucky , " said Rana Adhikari , a principal investigator at the Caltech - MIT Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory .
" They 're getting in at the right time – it's right before we see something . "
The first concrete proof that gravitational waves exist will not only verify a key tenet of relativity theory , but provide unprecedented insight into the mysterious lives of black holes , neutron stars , quark stars ( if these controversial objects exist ) , cosmic strings ( also controversial ) and probably other as - yet unimagined treasures .
Scientists have spent more than a generation tinkering patiently , coming up empty again and again , but in the process creating increasingly powerful tools .
The DIY set has even gotten into the act .
A scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth has strung together eight Sony PlayStation 3s to form a supercomputer powering a search for gravitational waves .
Other groups on the hunt have let loose much bigger machines .
Stefano Foffa of the University of Geneva is a member of a leading gravitational - wave - detection team , which includes 33 other scientists from Switzerland and Italy .
They recently submitted a report to Classical and Quantum Gravity that details their so - far fruitless attempts at observing tiny gravitational tugs and distortions on Explorer , a supercooled , 3 - meter - long aluminum bar at the CERN particle physics lab in Switzerland .
Explorer is particularly well - tuned to sense spinning neutron stars , also known as pulsars , Foffa said .
He and his colleagues estimate that some 200,000 of these spinning , super - dense objects – so dense that a just sugar cube - sized amount weighs as much as the entire human race – are scattered throughout the Milky Way .
But the thermal noise of even supercooled atoms is greater than the momentary twang the bar 's atoms would experience when being plucked by a passing gravitational wave .
So the Explorer group must use sensitive superconducting circuits to coax out a signal .
It 's an art that 's still being perfected .
LIGO , the Caltech - MIT observatory , is an even bigger and more ambitious project than Explorer .
To someone flying overhead , LIGO looks like an unfinished oil pipeline , with two mile - and - a - half long tubes jutting in perpendicular directions from a central building .
The pipes ( one in Livingston , Louisiana , and the other in > Richmond , Washington ) , contain sensitive optics in which laser light bounces back and forth 100 times , then combines , allowing physicists to compare the two beams to monitor the space - time through which the light traveled .
The interference patterns from LIGO 's two perpendicular laser beams sometimes momentarily jostle .
If the same jostling happens at both LIGO 's Louisiana and Washington detectors , and no earthquakes can explain the anomaly , then the source may well be a gravitational wave .
It 's the million - dollar moment that has n't happened .
Then again , LIGO has produced mountains of data since it first began operating in 2002 .
One popular distributed computing project , Einstein@Home , sifts through these databases to check for signals that might have been missed .
Merging black holes , otherwise invisible to science , are primary targets for detectors like Explorer and LIGO , Adhikari said .
Before last year , however , the echoes of a black - hole collision were too shrouded in complicated mathematics for scientists to even begin hunting for .
But in 2006 three separate teams cracked the numerical code to calculate the gravitational crashing sound that merging black holes would make .
And now LIGO scientists have begun searching their data for this gravitational wave signature .
If scientists continue to detect nothing , however , Einstein 's theories may well need modifying .
" If we do n't see anything in four years , " Foffa said , " then it will be the time to start questioning . "
In case you were n't aware , my colleague Bill Mann called you stupid last week -- but it may not be your fault .
According to Jason Zweig 's new book Your Money & Your Brain :
In a cruel irony that has enormous implications for financial behavior , your investing brain comes equipped with a biological mechanism that is more aroused when you anticipate a profit than when you actually get one .
That 's right , we 're not stupid .
Rather , we 're so greedy that we actually do not enjoy making money .
That 's a revelatory finding and one that finally explains why too many investors trade far too frequently :
We enjoy the hunt more than the rewards .
Investing is rewards , right ?
That 's backwards , of course .
Investing , if you 're doing it right , should be all about turning thousands into millions .
That can be as easy as buying an index fund , or it can be done more quickly by picking individual stocks that beat the market .
The key to both of these strategies , however , is patience .
If you buy an index fund and earn the market 's historical 10 % annual rate of return , it will take almost 50 years for $ 10,000 to turn into $ 1 million .
If you do better than 10 % , you can turn $ 10,000 into $ 1 million much faster -- but your time will still be measured in decades .
That 's far too long for the brain .
Moreover , because our minds have evolved to get more joy out of anticipation of results than satisfaction from actual results , investors are always ready and willing to chase " the next big thing . "
Science explains observation
While Zweig has finally explained the brain science that backs up this conclusion ( and do check out his book ) , academics and investors alike have observed its effects forever .
For example , as money manager Ron Muhlenkamp noted , " For most people , ' The Game of the Stock Market ' is a distraction that prevents them from making money in ' The Business of Investing . ' "
Couple that observation with the rapid trading patterns Berkeley finance professor Terrance Odean found in his study of retail investors and you can see why my colleague Brian Richards and I recently advised that perhaps you should n't sell .
See , if we 're programmed to enjoy anticipating rewards more than actual rewards , then our favorite part of investing is the transacting ( hence that sense of excitement you get when you click " buy " for a new stock ) .
While that strategy will get you a big tax and trading bill , it wo n't get you big returns .
Ring a bell ?
If you 've thought about this and decided that your portfolio is chock full of stocks you bought in a fit of greed , perhaps it 's time to start over .
In recent weeks , for example , Suntech Power ( NYSE : STP ) , New Oriental Education ( NYSE : EDU ) , and WuXi PharmaTech ( NYSE : WX ) posted huge gains .
And while each of these three exciting Chinese companies has big opportunities ahead , each has also risen more than 25 % in less than a year .
If you bought them last week and do n't know exactly what they do or have an estimate of exactly what they 're worth , it may be a sign that your greedy brain is trying to get you to chase China 's hot returns .
Do n't fall for it
Instead , consider making a list of businesses you admire , understand , and would be confident owning for the next decade or more .
( Seriously , jot them down on paper or in an electronic file . )
Then , set about valuing those great companies .
It will take some time , but when you have a file full of fantastic companies with estimates of their value , you 'll have a firm handle on the stocks you want to buy and at what price .
Your brain is going to make this hard for you
Of course , while you set about making your list , you 're going to worry about all of the gains you 're missing out on in the market .
Then , as you wait for the stocks you want to buy to hit the price you 're willing to pay , you 're going to want to make a move sooner .
You may find yourself revising your valuations upward so you can justify buying a stock .
To combat this , consider parking the funds you 've earmarked for equities in a low - cost , liquid , broad - market exchange - traded fund such as Vanguard Total Stock Market ( AMEX : VTI ) , which has exposure to Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , Wal - Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , and any other company you 'll hear hyped in the media .
Then you can tell your greedy short - term brain that you 're fully invested , even as you wait for better opportunities to present themselves .
Find those better opportunities

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - FBI agents have raided a Las Vegas warehouse owned by magician David Copperfield -- for reasons they did not disclose -- and media reports said that they seized nearly $ 2 million and computer equipment .
The FBI on Friday declined to say why it raided the Las Vegas warehouse , confirming only that it related to an investigation out of Seattle .
“ We ’re just confirming that investigative activity took place at the warehouse , ” David Staretz , chief division counsel , for the FBI in Las Vegas , told Reuters .
He declined to give further details .
The warehouse is where Copperfield keeps his props and maintains an office .
Media reports said FBI agents seized nearly $ 2 million in cash from the building , along with a computer hard drive and a memory chip from a digital camera system during Wednesday ’s late - night operation .
“ We understand there is an investigation , are in touch with the investigators , and are respecting the confidentiality of the investigation , ” Copperfield ’s attorney David Chesnoff said in a statement cited by Las Vegas broadcasters .
Chesnoff and Copperfield ’s publicist could not be reached for further comment .
The local CBS affiliate KLAS - TV quoted a source as saying the cash was stashed in a safe and that agents took the cash .
Copperfield , 51 , whose real name is David Kotkin , is famed for stunts such as making the Statue of Liberty disappear and walking through the Great Wall of China .
He is a regular performer at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas .
The wreckage of failed video game legislation litters the US judicial landscape at the moment ; strangely , the states continue to push such laws ( and spend citizens ' cash ) .
Surely , at some point , legislators and governors and attorneys general will take a look around , note the unbelievably lopsided set of rulings against these laws , and pack it in .
That day is not today .
Oklahoma is now the newest member of the Unconstitutional Law Club as a federal judge in the state 's Western District has issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of a law designed to restrict access to certain video games .
Judge Robin Cauthron , the first female federal judge in the state of Oklahoma , said that the Oklahoma law " violates the United States Constitution 's First Amendment freedom of expression and is unconstitutionally vague under the Fourteenth Amendment . "
She also found no evidence that video games harm kids and rejected arguments that the " interactivity " of games meant that First Amendment provisions did not apply .
Judge Cauthron also noted that the law would have restricted minors ' access only to video games but not to material that was just as violent or sexual in books , films , and other media .
Violating the Equal Protection Clause in such a manner is a big no - no , and it 's no way to write broad legislation .
The Entertainment Software Association was predictably pleased with the ruling but pleaded with the states to take a different approach to dealing with the games industry .
" We now need to develop a public / private partnership that meets concerned parents ' needs , " said the ESA 's president , Michael Gallagher .
" State officials and policymakers should work together with our industry to educate parents about game ratings and the parental controls available on all new video game consoles . "

Open Letter to Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Read More Open Letters
Dear Ron :
Please excuse me ; I ca n’t help it .
As the Jewish Mother of the libertarian movement , I just have to give advice to all members of it , you included , in particular .
Here , then , is some advice .
You ’d better take it .
I have weapons of mass destruction for those of " mine kinder " who refuse : chicken soup to pour over your head , nagging , whining , etc .
I give you fair warning : I am a world - class nudge .
1 . You are asked , ad nauseam , if you lose the Republican nomination , will you back the winner ?
You reply , quite reasonably that you gladly will , but only if that person changes his views on foreign policy , free enterprise , etc .
I wonder what would happen if journalists asked Rudy , Mitt , Fred , Mike , John what would they do if you win it : would they back you ?
I expect they would all lie and say they would .
But , the truth is that they would support Hillary , Obama or Edwards instead of you .
After all , the views of the present Republican poll leaders are far closer to those of the present Democratic poll leaders than they are to yours .
2 . Here ’s an answer to those , libertarians amongst them , who say you are not " cool " enough to become president , you are too much of an " isolationist " ( I know , I know , they ca n’t tell the difference between an isolationist and a non-interventionist ) , you lack international experience , exposure , you ’ll be dismissed by the rest of the world as a redneck hick Texan .
To me , the most interesting part of this survey shows how the Israelis would vote for Republican candidates .
Hint : they vote for the same person who currently receives the most donations from members of the US military .
So , let us hear no more about how a Paul Presidency would be bad for Israel .
True , this is a rather small sample .
But bias in sampling never stops the MSM ; why should it deter us ?
3. Tom Tancredo ( when he was still running ) and Fred Thompson started “ money bombs ” of their own , based on your success .
To say the very least , they do not do anywhere as well as you ( understatement of the century ) .
This reminds me of the movie Mondo Cane , which depicted the “ cargo cult . ”
That refers to Stone Age people who saw planes landing on runways , and disgorging cargo .
So , they built runways in the middle of the jungle , and even seeded them with planes made out of wood they had whittled , so as to entice real planes to land and disgorge cargo .
I guess what I ’m trying to say is that Tancredo and Thompson are still living in the Stone Age in terms of their understanding of what ’s going on in terms of fund raising .
They have n’t got a clue that the secret of your success has nothing to do with " money bombs " or " charisma " or " expert fund raisers , " etc .
Rather , it concerns , solely , your brilliant message about freedom , liberty , less government , non-intervention , sound money , etc .
4. Ron Paul as Nazi .
When I first began to give public lectures on rent control ( the topic of my Ph.D. dissertation ) in the early 1970s I was ready for all sorts of technical , mathematical , statistical , theoretical questions .
Do you know what the media kept asking me about , instead ?
Am I a landlord ?
Am I in the pay of landlords ?
Do I know any landlords ?
Nothing much has changed in the intervening decades .
Instead of focusing on your message , they are trying to Nazi - bait you , of all things .
I do n’t really know what to do about this .
But , lack of knowledge never stopped me before , why should it now ?
So , let me speculate .
One tack is to equate Nazism and Communism .
One is national socialism , the other is international socialism .
You oppose both .
If anything , you incline toward the latter , since you are an internationalist ( that ought to confuse them , if nothing else ) .
They are equally bad .
No , wait , here you can incline on the Nazi side , since the Communists have murdered more people , far more people .
( Maybe not a good idea ; I ’m just thinking out loud , here ; give me a break . )
Another tack to take is to support the moral equivalence of the two .
The mainstream media sees dangers in only one direction , not both .
When Britain ’s Prince Harry wore a swastika , they went ape .
This is evil , this is an abomination .
Well , yes , of course , it is .
But , seemingly every fifth kid on college campuses wears a Che Guevara T - shirt , or one depicting a hammer and sickle , and no one in the MSM says word one about it .
Happily , this smear is so far from the truth that it has no chance to take hold .
As my friend Michael Edelstein says : " Ron Paul as a Nazi symp is akin to claiming Hitler was a closet pacifist . "
Indeed , I am surprised at the New York ( Walter Duranty ) Times ; can they not do any better than that ?
Perhaps the best response , Ron , is a good old ad hominem attack : any newspaper that still has not apologized for its journalist Walter Duranty ’s reports that things were fine in the Soviet Union during its terror famine cannot and should not be taken seriously .
5. Tim Russert .
You did brilliantly in this interview .
The problem you faced , of course , was that before " machine gun mouth " Russert allowed you to answer one question , he was asking a second ; and , while you were just beginning to wrestle with that one , a third was in the offing .
Your style in these contexts , if I may characterize it thusly , is one of politeness , supreme courtesy .
Indeed , good manners , respect and graciousness fairly exude out of you .
I think that is one good tack to take , and , maybe , you should stick to it , given that it comes so naturally to you .
But , there are others .
In order of increasing pushiness ( I do n’t like to brag , but I am nothing if not an expert in this particular field ) are the following responses : A. please allow me to answer your first question before breaking off and trying to answer a second , and then a third , all at the same time .
B. I am sure your audience will get more out of this interview if you allow me to answer a question .
C. Please do not continually interrupt me ; it is impolite .
D. Ignore his follow - up questions , and tell him you are going to keep doing this , until you answer the first few questions to your satisfaction .
As I say , your style may well be the best for you , but , in the interests of notifying others of us who will also be called upon to take up roles of this sort in behalf of libertarianism , I thought I would at least mention other possible responses .
6. Sean Hannity .
Again , you were magnificent in this harrowing experience .
I ’m sure the non-committed audience was with you , vis–vis this boor .
Whereas Russert would confine himself to questions , Hannity would " ask " you something , and , as soon as the first word was out of your mouth , would presume to lecture you and " educate " you about the issues of the day .
With him , again , you were unerringly polite .
I think you have a courtesy gene in you .
Well , I do n’t .
Here are some of the tacks I ’ve taken ( I confess , with far less success than you have had , but I mention them one , to get them off my chest , and two , in the hope that a discussion of them will help some of us ) .
A . Ask , who is the interviewer , and who is the interviewee ?
B. Keep talking no matter what .
Do n’t let him interrupt you .
Do NOT pause for breath ; heck , you ’re a world class athlete , you ought to be able to outlast that windbag in a contest of lung power .
Get used to the idea that the two of you will both be speaking for a minute or two .
Practice this with one of your staffers , a leather - lunged one .
The problem here is that you will both come off as jerks .
Probably , this will hurt you more than him .
Heck , dare I say it , I do n’t really care about his career , although the sooner he is off the air the better for rational discourse .
C. I once tried this ploy , and , miracle of all miracles , it worked .
I was confronted with a verbal bully , and when he paused for breath , after an interminable oration I asked , " Do you play chess . "
Surprised , since this was not at all involved in our " discussion " ( a one way lecture up to this point ) he said he did .
Whereupon , I asked if he played with a chess clock ?
At this point , he shut up , turned to his neighbor , and ignored me , much to my satisfaction .
Why ?
Well , he is a bright guy , even though a verbal bully like Hannity , and knew that my next question would have been , " Well , if we were conducting this argument with a chess clock , where I run your clock when you are speaking , and you run your clock while I am talking , how many minutes do you think each of us would have on his clock ?
I offer you these options in case you may ever choose to use them .
But , knowing you , I think you ’ll stick with your style , and , as I say , I am not at all sure yours is not the best way to go for you , and , maybe , for all the rest of us too .
6. Gold .
Strictly speaking , you do NOT favor the gold standard .
Rather , you favor free market money : any monetary medium chosen by market participants .
The only reason you mention gold at all is that whenever people were " free to choose " ( the title of a book written by an opponent of the gold standard , Milton Friedman ) , as a historical fact they chose gold ( and sometimes silver ) .
But , if in the future , under the sort of free enterprise system you will promote as President of the United States ( my , oh my , does that have a nice ring ) if the market settled on copper or platinum , or , indeed , anything else , you would have no quarrel with that outcome .
This is a complex issue to bring up in the 30 - second sound bites you are often accorded , but I thought you might find some time to emphasize this point .
7. Ron , Ron , Ron , PLEASE get more bodyguards .
I do n’t care how many you now have , get some MORE .
Now that your candidacy is taking off , the powers that be can no longer ignore you .
Other people who wanted to , and did , shake up the power structure were assassinated : Martin Luther King , Jr. , the Kennedy brothers , Malcolm X. Compared to yours , though , their programs advocated only marginal changes .
There are lots of weirdos and nuts running loose .
BE CAREFUL out there .
8. Ron , previously , I wrote a piece asking economists not to vote for you .
Here ’s another reason I " oppose " your candidacy : I just ca n’t get much writing done ( apart from writing about you , that is ) .
In the early days of your candidacy , I would google you , and reading all the stories about you would take , what , an hour or so a day ?
But then things gradually escalated .
Nowadays , if I read every day for 24 hours daily , I still could n’t read everything written about you .
My problem is that I ’m so enthralled with what you ’re doing that I can’t seem to keep away from doing just that .
Nor am I the only Austro - libertarian with a Ron Paul addiction .
You ’re not only ruining my productivity , but , if I can speak for the entire movement for a moment , you are doing this to all of us .
Ron , if Murray were still around , I have no doubt that he’d be doing the same thing .
Although I am a devout atheist , I just know Murray is now up there somewhere , cackling away at a thousand miles per hour with glee .
God bless you , you are doing the Lord ’s work , so to speak .
Best regards , Walter

Report : Rudy has business ties to 9/11 facilitator Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne

This GOP presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani , who has made tough talk about combating Islamic terror a staple of his campaign , has had extensive business dealings with a foreign ministry helmed by a man with ties to the 9/11 attacks , according to a new report .
Giuliani Partners , a consulting firm which the former New York mayor founded after leaving in office in 2002 , maintains a " cozy business relationship , " with the " terrorist - tolerant " nation of Qatar , writes the Village Voice 's Wayne Barrett .
Barrett reports that the firm 's business partners in Qatar have included that country 's former minister of Islamic affairs , Abdallah bin Khalid al - Thani ( above right ) , who has been accused of helping suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammad evade an an FBI arrest attempt in 1996 .
" In other words , " writes Barrett , " as incredible as it might seem , Rudy Giuliani -- whose presidential candidacy is steeped in 9/11 iconography -- has been doing business with a government agency run by the very man who made the attacks on 9/11 possible . "
Appearing on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann , Barrett said Giuliani should have known about Qatar 's ties to terrorism in 2005 , when he made the country one of his " principal clients . "
" He would have had to have been deaf , dumb and blind not to know it because he then in 2005 had running his security unit two of the FBI agents who had been pursuing the Qatar relationship [ to terrorism ] , " Barrett told Olbermann .
" By 2005 , the United States had a very complicated relationship with Qatar .
It was fully aware of its ties to international terrorism . "
Barrett went on to add that Giuliani Partners ' business with al - Thani and Qatar was strictly a money decision .
" I think the conundrum really for Rudy as a candidate is he parades around America as the black and white candidate who can't see any grey , " he said .
" And so here you have a relationship where he could see the grey because there was so much gold involved . "
Detailing al - Thani 's role in purportedly aiding and abetting Khalid Sheikh Muhammad , Barrett says in the Voice that al - Thani helped the suspected terrorist to flee Qatar .
Al - Thani also " remains a named defendant in the 9/11 lawsuits that are still proceeding in Manhattan federal court , " he adds .
Barrett writes that the reality of Giuliani 's association with Qatar is " inconsistent with the core message of Giuliani 's current presidential campaign , namely that his experience and toughness uniquely equip him to protect America from what he tauntingly calls ' Islamic terrorists ' -- an enemy that he always portrays himself as ready to confront , and the Democrats as ready to accommodate . "
Barrett 's report was published a day before a much - discussed story broken by Politico 's Ben Smith , which accused Giuliani of obscuring security expenses to disguise an extra-marital affair during his time as New York mayor .
Although that story has been picked up by an array of news outlets , the Barrett piece has received a tamer reception thus far in the mainstream press .
Nevertheless , Olbermann called Barrett 's story a " startling and potentially ruinous revelation , " and said of Giuliani , " The ' war on terror candidate ' -- looking tonight a lot more like the ' ties to terror ' candidate . "
Barrett is the co-author of Grand Illusion : The Untold Story of 9/11 , which takes a critical look at Giuliani 's role " before , during , and after " the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The following video is from MSNBCs COUNTDOWN with Keith Olbermann , broadcast on November 28 , 2007
The combined actions of the world ’s central banks on Wednesday smack of a real fear that the world ’s financial system is in trouble .
Injecting liquidity — that is lending money to banks — when short - term interest rates rise is perfectly normal in this age in which central banks target interest rates .
What is not normal is the Fed using auctions “ to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations . ”
That move , the Fed says , “ could help promote the efficient dissemination of liquidity when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress . ”
Or , as a senior Fed official — that ’s what the Fed wants him called — told reporters , “ This is not about particular financial institutions , with particular problems .
It is about market functioning . ”
The Fed will lend money to banks based on almost any asset they own , even ones that are not liquid at all .
That will include some of the more exotic loans and securities out there .
Investors , it appears , love it .
The stock market opened sharply higher , reducing the losses that came yesterday after the Fed cut interest rates , but not by enough to satisfy Wall Street .
This move is taken as evidence that central banks are determined to rescue the system , whatever it takes .
How much will the Fed lend against illiquid assets ?
It has a public list , already in use in discount window lending .
You will note that it allows the lending of up to 85 percent of the face value of AAA - rated collateralized mortgage obligations , if there is no observable market value .
There are some C.M.O. ’s out there that have not yet been downgraded but that might not bring that much in a sale .
I ’d love to see which assets are pledged , and how much the Fed lends against them .
But the Fed wo n’t disclose those facts .
Nor will it let us know which banks borrow using the new facility .

Claim : Hostess Twinkies have an indefinite shelf life .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2002 ]
I have heard that Hostess Company has not produced any new Twinkies in as many two decades or more .
Instead , the Twinkies that you buy in the store have been sitting in a Hostess warehouse for years .
The story goes that Twinkies are made entirely out of artificial ingredients , and contain no food products .
Therefore , Twinkies have a very long shelf life ( possibly decades ) .
At some point many years ago Hostess over produced Twinkies by the billions ( possibly due to an error in market research ) , and could not sell all their stock .
So Hostess stored the billions of excess Twinkies in a giant warehouse and waited for their distributors to place orders .
However , the distributors did not place as large of orders as expected , and Hostess was forced to continue storing the Twinkies .
Because of the lack of food products in Twinkies , they do not go bad for a very long time , and to this day the Twinkies that you by in the store are from the original stock .
Origins : Americans love their snacks , and few snacks are more popular than Hostess Twinkies .
Twinkies are cream - filled sponge cakes
shaped like ladyfingers which pack 160 calories per cake .
Yet for all their nutritional drawbacks Twinkies are a hugely popular treat in the USA , with 500 million of these confections baked each year .
Because these cellophane - wrapped snack cakes are always to be found on the shelves at supermarkets and corner stores and always appear to feel fresh and spongy to the touch , a long - lived myth has sprung up to account for the continual presence of seemingly always - fresh Twinkies .
According to lore , Twinkies have multi- year shelf lives and remain edible for decades ; this incredible longevity , rumor says , is due to Twinkies not actually being food but rather some strange type of artificial , manufactured item shaped and flavored to resemble a cake - like offering .
Through the years many of our readers have asked us about this baked product .
Each had heard a version of the basic Twinkies legend about unbelievable shelf life brought about through some form of artificial production , either in the ingredients or the manufacturing process used .
We ’ve seen claims that Twinkies :
Remain edible for anywhere between fifty and one hundred years .
Have a lengthy shelf life , variously expressed as five , seven , or forty years , or “ longer than the cellophane they ’re wrapped in . ”
Are n’t baked , the sponge cake instead being “ a pure chemical reaction ” involving something that “ foams up ” ; the deception is made complete by coloring the confections ’ bottoms brown to make it appear that they ’ve been baked .
Contain a chemical used in embalming fluid .
As always , the truth is far less exciting than the lore .
Twinkies were created in 1930 as ladyfinger - shaped spongecakes enrobing a banana filling at the Hostess bakery in Schiller Park , Illinois .
( Hostess is now owned by Kansas City - based Interstate Bakeries Corp . )
The product ’s name was inspired by a billboard in St. Louis advertising Twinkle Toe Shoes .
When the world ’s banana trade ground to a halt during World War II ( this was n’t the first time war disrupted the banana trade — the popular ditty “ Yes , We Have No Bananas ” came out of World War I because of similar circumstances ) , Hostess substituted a vanilla cream filling not dissimilar to cake
frosting .
Twinkies have a shelf life of twenty - five days , not seven years , and certainly not fifty years .
Even so , twenty - five days is an unusually long time for a baked product to stay fresh .
The secret to Twinkies ’ longevity is their lack of dairy ingredients : because dairy products are not part of the formula , Twinkies spoil much more slowly than other bakery items .
After the baking process of the sponge cake portion is completed , cream filling is injected into each Twinkie through three holes in its top ( brown ) side ; the product is then flipped before packaging , turning its bottom into its top .
Hostess estimates it uses eight million pounds of sugar , seven million pounds of flour , and one million eggs to produce the 500 million Twinkies baked every year .
Twinkies gained notoriety in American jurisprudence in 1979 when the media widely misreported the claim that Dan White , on trial for shooting San Francisco mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk , asserted that his consumption of junk foods such as Twinkies “ had left him with diminished capacity for reason . ”
According to Hostess , it takes forty - five seconds to explode a Twinkie in a microwave .

Gabriel had Kara call me to say he would n’t be in the office to do the strip , a tactic that showed wisdom on his part , because if he ’d talked to me himself I would have told him to put his big girl pants on .
We ’d written the strip already , so we were halfway there .
It was far , far , far outside his comfort level , but I asked Kiko to execute the strip visually .
He excelled - but , then again , he is Kiko .
We were surprised to learn that there are readers who enjoyed the annual We ’re Right Awards .
They were created to provide us with something akin to a vacation over the holidays , as they do n’t require the kind of writing we normally do .
They are essentially bulleted lists .
And since we had created them as a kind of scam , eventually we began to feel guilty about doing them .
But it ’s back : a limited engagement , for one night only .
Savor it ( to the extent that any flavor remains in the concept ) .
It ’s got to be disheartening to others doing work in the medium .
It ’s probably got to be disheartening to other people at Valve .
We ’re talking about a game that can be completed in only a couple hours , has no multiplayer , and no replayability for a person without OCD .
I ’d already played Half - Life 2 and Episode One , so they were just garnish - foliage designed to give the plate composition .
Team Fortress 2 never stuck for me on the console .
In Episode Two , all of the guns just shoot regular old bullets , which honestly I ’m kind of over .
That puts me at sixty dollars for Portal , which is a twenty dollar game .
I will happily call the rest a tip .
Game length is always a contentious issue .
I remember when Elite Force came out , and people determined that ten hours was too short .
As the new round of consoles emerged , eight hours became the norm .
For " next generation " titles , starting with Halo 3 , we ’re clocking around six hours for this level of fidelity .
I have no beef with short games that are also good .
Bad games which are also short lose points , insult in close proximity to injury , but in the case of Heavenly Sword its brevity is also a sweet mercy , like summer rain .
So , people like to talk about game length , but game length is no indicator of quality .
Portal knows how long it is , and it does n’t try to make itself some other game in order to succeed at retail .
As we know well , not every game has six or eight hours of unique ideas - they must be worked over , extrapolated , drawn out to the length a game must be to slot itself into the retail continuum .
They are like museum tyrannosaurs , where two or three bones represent prime T - Rex and the rest is wax and plaster of the appropriate shape .
Somewhere between what we demand for our money and what they are willing to sell us , gamers , publishers , and retailers have struck some Faustian bargain to the detriment of the medium .
I just got the final amount for Child ’s Play , which is … substantial : $ 1,135,000 in toys and cash .
I said it was the final amount , but what we ’ve seen in previous years is that this " final amount " climbs considerably after the event is finished .
Money comes in from local events or community sites .
For some people , the end of the event is an impetus to give .
The lists typically stay up , as does the PayPal , and we see people choosing items in July .
So as large as that sum is up there , it ’s not complete .
Recall that this million is heaped upon the other millions we have raised , year over year , creating from nothing an engine of perpetual comfort that has generated $ 3,324,000 to date .
We make Santa Claus a real person with Child ’s Play , that is our holy work , and each time we perform this charitable ritual he is real for a longer and longer duration .
That is not an exaggeration .
That is literally what we do .

In a spontaneous appearance on “ The Situation Room , ” Republican representative and presidential candidate Ron Paul ( R - Tex ) talked about the recent assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and shared foreign policy views that – once again – differed greatly from those held by other candidates .
“ Enough is enough , ” the doctor said of America ’s current foreign policy .
Paul told Wolf Blitzer that , if he were the current US president , he would not worry about Pakistan ’s internal affairs and would instead work to involve America even less .
The interview came on the heels of statements from many headline - making candidates who claimed that they would increase American involvement in Pakistan – either by taking charge of the situation via the UN Security Council or by orchestrating a Federal investigation into the assassination .
Giuliani , McCain and Clinton all began to immediately spout how their ' experience ' would help them in such a situation .
While Dr. Paul claimed that , as president , he would urge that Pakistan take a sensible approach to the tragedy , he added that he would commit no military aid and no intelligence cooperation to the effort .
Representative Paul also said that the United States should cease the flow of troops and money into the country – and the Middle East , in general .
He said that America has given money that has aided a dictator who overthrew an elected government .
Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf is nothing more than a US puppet .
This sort of U.S. puppet government , according to Paul , is simply angering Al Qaeda in the region .
When asked if he was concerned about Al Qaeda or an Islamic fundamentalist regime taking over a country with nuclear capabilities if America were to leave Pakistan to its own devices , Paul replied that he was .
He was also concerned , he added , with numerous Soviet nukes that are unaccounted for and are likely currently floating around central Asia .
Paul closed the interview by reviewing the global responsibilities that his country should have .
America should be friends with people , trade with people and sort things out democratically , he said .
It should not bribe other countries with donations and aid or threaten them with attack .
The US should exercise neutrality , talking and trading with other countries , and then leaving them alone .
People will , undoubtedly twist this interview and / or this article out of context , but it ’s great to finally see a candidate respond to a situation honestly .
While the other candidates are pandering to the media to avoid saying something wrong , Paul is sticking to his guns marvelously .
And while they attack each other over , essentially , the same foreign policies , Dr. Paul is once again standing alone – and arguably above the competition .
Not to mention , it was intriguing to see another honest interview on a major network .

India test fires ' Akash ' nuke missile for third day
IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency
New Delhi , Dec 15 , IRNA
India - Missile
India Saturday successfully test fired the indigenously developed surface - to - air nuclear capable ' Akash ' missile , for the third consecutive day , from Integrated Test Range at Chandipur - on - sea , about 15 km from Balasore in eastern province of Orissa .
The multi-target medium range missile with a strike range of 25 kms and capable of carrying a warhead of 50 kg was test fired at 1510 hours IST ( Indian Standard Time ) from a mobile launcher as part of an air defence exercise , PTI reported quoting Indian defense sources .
The missile targeted a flying " para barrel " target released from an aircraft , they said , adding three more trials were expected to be conducted in about a week to pave the way for induction of Akash into the Indian Air Force .
After successful trials of interceptor missiles , the test - fire was carried out to fine - tune the sophisticated Akash , which has undergone several tests earlier as part of the India 's Integrated Guided Missile Development Program .
The 700 kg and 5.6 - meter - long missile uses an integral " Ramjet " rocket propulsion system and has a low reaction time , defense sources said .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A young man carrying what turned out to be a hairbrush died Monday night in a hail of bullets fired by New York police .
Khiel Coppin 's brother Joel Coppin spoke briefly with reporters saying , " We want justice . "
Authorities were responding to a 9 - 1 - 1 call his mother made about a " family dispute with a gun , " police said .
In the background of the call , played at a news conference Tuesday , 18 - year - old Khiel Coppin can be heard saying , " I 've got a gun , I 've got a gun , " New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN .
The teen put an object under his shirt and told his mother around the time she phoned 9 - 1 - 1 that he was going to say he had a gun , said New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly .
The teen told her , " ' I 'm prepared to die , ' " Kelly told reporters .
When authorities arrived at the Bedford - Stuyvesant apartment , the teenager had something stuffed under his shirt and several times showed a knife to police .
" Shoot me , kill me , " he shouted , according to Kelly .
" Come get me .
I have a gun .
Let 's do this . "
Coppin ignored repeated commands to stop and get on the ground .
Witnesses said the teen appeared to be holding an object underneath his shirt and pointed it at the officers .
Coppin continued to approach officers , as they ordered him to stop , said Kelly .

Twenty shots were fired ; Coppin was struck eight times , Kelly said .
" This was a terrible tragedy for Khiel 's family , no doubt about it , " said Kelly .
But the commissioner stressed that officers reasonably believed they were about to receive fire .
Kelly said the teen 's mother reported he had not taken his anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication .
Police have not recovered a gun and do not believe that Coppin was armed , Kelly said .
A reporter asked Kelly if it 's possible the young man was goading police to shoot him , a phenomenon known commonly in law enforcement circles as suicide - by - cop .
" That 's certainly a possibility , " said Kelly .
" The boy did n't have no gun , he had a brush on him , " said Andre Wildman , a neighbor who told CNN that he saw the shooting .
Listen to mother 's 911 call »
Another neighbor , Wayne Holder , said police should be required to see a weapon before opening fire on a suspect .
" At least see a gun before you start to discharge it , " Holder said .
Police " do n't even have to see it , [ if ] they think you got one , you 're going to get shot . "
Coppin was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead .
An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday , the medical examiner 's office said .
The Rev. Al Sharpton 's National Action Network is expected to hold a news conference on Tuesday about the shooting .
Police said they were investigating whether Coppin had a history of mental illness and whether his mother had tried to have him hospitalized earlier Monday .
The shooting came a year after unarmed groom Sean Bell , 23 , was killed hours before his wedding in a shooting involving New York police .
In 1999 , unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo , 22 , died when police in the Bronx shot him 19 times .
Bystander Dyshawn Gibson described Monday 's shooting to CNN affiliate WABC - TV .
" He dropped the brush , " Gibson said .
" He put his hands up .
Police just started firing . "
Coppin was seen pacing around the apartment prior to the shooting , according to an initial police statement issued Monday night .
" He began screaming from the window at his mother and the police , " the police statement said .
" At some point , the male climbed out of the window and began crossing the sidewalk toward the police . "
That 's when police began firing , a police spokesman said .

All About New York City Police Department
WASHINGTON
TWO years ago , when Gen. Pervez Musharraf still seemed secure in his rule over Pakistan , he was asked a question that is now urgently coursing through Washington :
Are his country ’s nuclear weapons safe from Islamic radicals ?
Pakistan ’s nuclear protections “ are already the best in the world , ” he said then , in an interview .
He launched into a detailed description of the controls he had put in place .
Chief among them was that only a small group of top officials — General Musharraf and men he trusts — hold the keys to moving or using a weapon .
He also talked about new physical controls over Pakistan ’s many nuclear facilities , including the laboratories that were once the playground of Abdul Qadeer Khan , the national hero who established Pakistan as the hub of the biggest proliferation network in nuclear history .
The leaking of much of the technology to Iran , North Korea and Libya , starting in the late 1980s , often coincided with times of political turmoil when Pakistan ’s leadership was weak and its attention elsewhere .
That precedent was driving much of the fear in Washington last week as General Musharraf clung to power by declaring a state of emergency and trying to quell political demonstrations and near - rioting in the streets — the fear that leaks would resume and that Pakistan might even lose control over a nuclear arsenal of uncertain size — estimated at from 55 to 115 weapons .
Since the State Department announced it would send US diplomats to serve in Iraq against their will , Foreign Service Officers have been volunteering to go – but the order has sparked a fresh controversy hearkening back to the Vietnam War .
Some Foreign Service Officers ( FSOs ) believe they should go where they ’re told to go , no questions asked .
Typical is the view of one 35 - year - plus veteran .
“ To me the choice when tapped for service there is simple : go or quit , ” Richard Undeland , who was ordered to Vietnam , where he served for two years .
The retired FSO says , “ When I was pulled out of Alexandria , Egypt , in 1960 , where I was director of our cultural center , and sent to Vietnam for a field operations posting , I did n't bat an eyelash , but went .
It was what those in the Foreign Service did . ”
The American Foreign Service Association ( AFSA ) , which represents America ’s 11,500 diplomats , takes a decidedly contrary view .
AFSA President John Naland says , “ I marvel at people who point with pride to the experience 40 years ago with directed assignments of diplomats to South Vietnam .
Do they not remember how that turned out ? ”
Facing growing scrutiny of the State Department 's shortage of experienced diplomats in Iraq - and the Department 's announced intention to force Foreign Service Officers to serve in Baghdad against their will -- the leader of America 's diplomatic service is charging that critics , " including people who urged the 2003 invasion , " are seeking to blame the State Department for their own failures .
" No country 's diplomatic corps has people with many of the skills now needed in Iraq : oil and gas engineers , electrical grid managers , urban planners , city managers and transportation planners .
If any US defense planner in 2003 thought that the State Department and other civilian federal agencies had such people on staff in large numbers ( Arabic - speaking or not ) ready to rebuild Iraq , they were wrong , " says AFSA ’s Naland .
Naland claims the State Department now has volunteers to fill around 90 percent of the summer 2008 openings in Iraq .
“ That fill rate is above the approximately 80 percent mark at this time in last year 's assignment process for summer 2007 openings .
With seven months to go in the summer 2008 assignments cycle , State most likely could find volunteers for the remaining two dozen or so openings if they would allow the assignments cycle to proceed as it did last year . ”
However , he added , “ If State does decide next week to rush to directed assignments , I personally believe that those so directed will , in the end , accept the assignment . ”
While Undeland and Naland disagree on the responsibility of diplomats to serve wherever they are sent , they agree on a host of other issues .
Undeland says he “ Greatly questions the need for so many from State being in Iraq and wonder what the hell they can all do that is of use . ”
Many active and former diplomats have pointed out that it is unusual for a US Embassy to remain open in the midst of armed conflict .
Undeland believes , “ It was unbelievably stupid to go into Iraq in the first place , and I remain almost wholly convinced that we are going to leave behind something that is less to our liking than Saddam .
We have gotten ourselves into an incredible disaster that is more than likely to have evil consequences for us as a nation and people for many years to come . ”
Undeland also agrees with Naland on the way the State Department disclosed its decision to “ direct ” diplomats to Iraq – most FSOs learned of the new policy through the news media .
Later , AFSA members held a fractious “ town hall ” meeting in the State Department auditorium , during which they strongly criticized both the new policy and Ambassador Harry K. Thomas , the Assistant Secretary of State who made the announcement .
Undeland says Thomas , who presided at the meeting , “ handled the complaints in that now widely known session at the Department in a very inept way . ”
Naland has pointed out that , unlike the US military , diplomats serving in Iraq are unarmed and protected by private security contractors like Blackwater .
During Undeland ’s Vietnam service , he says , “ It was dangerous enough that I armed myself with guns and grenades and drove around in a Jeep with armor plating and sandbags on the floor .
It was not heroism or bravado , but only the way the vast majority of us looked on our Foreign Service commitment .
I do n't mean to draw odious comparisons between us then and those now , but I do not see why the same kind of attitude should not prevail today . ”
Naland points out that between the US invasion in 2003 through 2007 , all of the more than 2,000 career Foreign Service members who served at the US mission in Baghdad and the expanding Provincial Reconstruction Teams around the country " did so as a volunteer . "

Ever wanted to know what your teenage driver is doing with the car right now ?
Technology that gives parents the answer is poised to make the jump into the mainstream if some big car insurers can resolve worries about privacy .
You might already be aware that a small number of auto insurance companies are starting to offer systems that can monitor how a car is being driven , either by capturing and transmitting digital data about speed or location or capturing video of the driver .
They are promoting these systems to consumers as a way to keep tabs on a newly licensed teenage driver .
Some of these systems use GPS devices to gather and transmit information about the vehicle 's location and speed .
Other systems offer speed , location , braking and other data , plus video of the driver and passengers .
All of them speak directly to parents ' fears about their kids ' shaky judgment behind the wheel .
These fears are well founded based on the statistics about teen drivers and accidents .
" The highest crash risk is when they first begin to drive without the parent in the vehicle , " says Anne McCartt , senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
" We do believe these devices have potential in helping teens to learn safe driving behaviors , and correct unsafe driving behavior faster than they would otherwise . "
In - vehicle monitoring systems have been in use for some time among truck fleets and some company car fleets .
The emergence of these virtual back - seat driver systems to keep watch over teens is relatively recent , but there are signs the concept is gaining momentum .
So I saw this on Digg : Animal Crossing Is Tragic ( mirror ) ( mirror 2 )
I would n’t exactly call it a tragedy , but it was really touching and sad .
I typically do n’t find YTMND sites to be that interesting , but this one truly has been nicely done and the soundtrack they added is a true tear jerker along with the story told by comic strip panels .
Anyway , as with most things , I get obsessed with finding the source .
The story itself is already touching , but if it was indeed true , it would make it feel that much more real .
I noticed the comic strip text was replaced with English and and the original text was whited out .
On one of the panels , there was some Korean text and that gave me an idea of where to start searching .
I found the source story : 동물의 숲과 한 북미 유저의 이야기 .
It is indeed a Korean site and story , but English translation was provided :
About two years ago , I bought the game Animal Crossing .
It was fun for awhile , me and my brother played it for about a month , then got tired of it .
I ’m always trying to convert my parents to videogames , however , and thought that Animal Crossing would be simple enough for them to get into .
I let my mom set up a house , and she soon got into the game in a big way .
( As a kid , she had polio , and now she had multiple sclerosis .
She was largely homebound , except for the once our twice when she ’d either leave to go shopping or to church . )
Spending all day at home in a wheel chair bored her , so the relief Animal Crossing provided her was kind of amazing .
She ’d spend so much time playing it , that it became something of an obsession .
She played it so much that she was constantly getting kidded by the family .
She payed off her house in the game , she collected all the fossils , etc .
Whenever I saw her playing , I thought that the game must have long since stopped being interesting to her , yet she kept playing - even after me and my brother had long since stopped .
Her condition got progressively worse , and she eventually stopped playing .
About a year ago , she passed away .
I had forgotten about Animal Crossing , I had n’t played it in over a year and a half .
Today , however , I decided to visit the village again and see what was up .
Weeds had grown everywhere , the villagers wondered where my mom and I had gone .
Then I came to my mailbox , it was full of letters with presents - all from my mom .
Every letter was pretty much the same .
“ Thinking of you .
Thought you ’d like this present .
Love , Mom ”
Even though I ’d stopped playing , she continued to send me presents .
I look back now at how I made fun of her for playing even after she ’d done everything , and I realize now that she was probably spending her time getting presents for me .
Anyway , I know it ’s probably cheesy , but I was just amazed at how much this affected me and I thought I ’d share .
Show your parents as much love as you can , while you still can guys .
Going through the trackbacks in the comment area , I found the original comic : 한 북미유저와 동물의 숲.
Different music was used with this page , but it was equally sad .
The original comic is located on thisisgame.com , but I have a backup copy here :
It appears this is from a comic called This Is Game .
This particular strip is # 18 and titled : 동물의 숲.
According to Babelfish , that translates to : Forest of animal , probably something related to Animal Crossing .
This story turns out to be quite old .
Given that the original story was posted on December 14 , 2005 and the comic strip was posted on January 2 , 2006 , I guess someone just happened to have come by this recently and made it into a YTMND page .
If anyone can tell me what the music is , I ’d really like to know .
UPDATE : Thanks to DefaultName , Vudhai , Jake , and Mike for pointing out that the music is the opening sequence from Final Fantasy X . It ’s titled To Zanarkand .
You can listen to the music performed by an orchestra in this video : 03 – To Zanarkand .
This was apparently taken from the Tour de Japon DVD .
UPDATE # 2 : According to Dan , the Japanese version of Animal Crossing was called Animal Forest , and the Korean version might ’ve been named the same way .
According to Wikipedia , Animal Crossing in Japan is called どうぶつの森 ( Doubutsu no Mori ) , which does indeed translate to “ Animal Forest ” .
どうぶつ is the hiragana form of 動物 .

ケノンの使い方や特徴について教えて！家でできる脱毛はどこまで効果があるのか？
ケノンは、エステと同じキセノンフラッシュランプを採用した家庭用の脱毛器です。レーザータイプに比べると痛みが少なく、1回で広範囲にアプローチできるという特徴があります。
簡単にケノンの特徴を詳しく紹介しておきましょう。
1.ケノンは充電不要！数十年先もずっと使える！
家庭用脱毛器の中には携帯できる充電式のものもありますが、ケノンは充電不要タイプ。施術途中で電源が切れ、充電できるまで待つ…なんてことはありません。
“ 数十年先まで使え る ” ポイントは、光を照射する部分（＝カートリッジ）の取り外しができるから。取り換えることにより出力の維持が可能なので、効果を落とすことなくずっと使い続けることができます。
ちなみに、1つのカートリッジで長期間使い続けられるのもケノンの魅力の1つ。例えばスーパープレミアムカートリッジなら、レベル1で最大300万回、レベル10でも50万回照射することが可能なので、1人なら約30年間使用し続けることができるといわれています。
2.全身脱毛＆美肌作りもOK！男性利用率はなんと4割！？
ケノンで脱毛できる部位はほぼ全身。顔の産毛から、眉毛や鼻毛、手足はもちろんVIOの剛毛にも使用できます。
また、ケノンは男性でも満足いく脱毛ができます。昨今、ムダ毛やヒゲをキレイにする男性が増え、ケノン利用者の4割が男性だとか…。
ケノンがここまで幅広い肌質・毛質に対応できるのは、性能と安全性が高いから。医療機器開発トップメーカーのHOYAと共同開発した照射口のフィルターが、有害物質（紫外線など）をカットし肌への負担を最小限に抑えてくれます。
安全性が高いことから、お子さんの毛の悩み解消に1台家庭に置いておく人も増えているようですね。
3.交換カートリッジは6種類と豊富！
ケノンで付け替えられるカートリッジは6種類。脱毛部位や目的によって取り換えて使用します。
ケノン購入時に付属でついてくるのは、「スーパープレミアムカートリッジ」。
レビュー投稿でストロングカートリッジも手に入るなど、付属品が付くキャンペーンも要チェックです。
・スーパープレミア ム 最大300万回照射可能！全身の毛に使える
・プレミアム 最 大100 万 回照射可能！全身の毛に使える
・エクストララージ 照射面積が広い ！
・胴回りや太ももなど、大きな部位も早く終わる
・ストロング 出力が最大！照射範囲が狭いから狙いやすく、ヒゲや脇、Vラインなどの剛毛に最適
・ラー ジ 最大20万回照射可能！標準タイプで全身の毛に使える
・美顔スキンケア 脱毛後の美肌磨きにピッタ リ
ちなみに、照射回数は液晶で表示されるので、突然使えなくなる心配はありません。
4.敏感肌でも安心！連射機能＆10段階の出力調整ができる
ケノンには出力が最も大きくなるワンショットのほか、刺激を抑えられる3連射、6連射ショット機能が備わっています。連射数が多くなるほどエネルギーが分散されるので、敏感肌の人でも安心して脱毛ケアが行えます。
また、照射レベルを変えられる機能も備わっています。肌が弱い方やお子さんは低いレベルで、肌が強いタイプや男性の方は強いレベルで照射すると効果的な脱毛ケアができるでしょう。
5.保証体制万全！期間延長も可能
高額な買い物をするときは保証もチェックしておきたいですよね。
ケノンの保証はというと、購入時に無償でメーカー1年保証が付いてきます。もっと長い保証があれば安心という方は、自然保証プランや事故補償プラン（両方とも有料）で3年間延長することも可能です。
ちなみに、通常カートリッジは消耗品なので保証が付かないところ、ケノンのスーパープレミアムカートリッジには2年保証が付いてきます。
ケノンの保証体制は万全！安心して購入できますよね。
ケノンならVIO脱毛ももちろん可能！自宅でデリケートゾーンケア
近年、男女共に需要が上がってきている脱毛部位が、「VIO」です。女性は肌の露出が増えてくると、もちろんデリケートゾーンのムダ毛が気になりますよね。最近では美容男子もかなり増えてきており、男性のVIO脱毛も以前ほど抵抗はなくなってきています。
サロンやクリニックに通わなくても、自宅で気軽にVIO脱毛が可能なケノンはやっぱり便利です！
家庭用脱毛器は多種多様！ほかの機器よりケノンがいいの？
家庭用脱毛器の中でも人気の高いケノンを紹介してきましたが、もちろんケノン以外にも家庭用脱毛器は多種多様なものが売られています。
人気の高い家庭用脱毛機器をピックアップし、簡単に比較してみましょう。

・照射レベルは10段階調節できる！
→肌の弱いお子さんでも敏感肌の方でも安心して使えます
・最大300万回照射可能！最大レベルでも50万回照射できる！
→ケノンの可能照射回数が最多！家族で使用しても長く使い続けることができる
といった点でしょう 。
ただ、ケノンには欲しい機能が備わってない…と感じる方もいるかもしれません。何を重視したいか、よく考えて選ぶとよいでしょう。
デメリットも要チェック！ケノンで脱毛を始める際の注意点とは？
自宅にいながら脱毛を始められるケノンですが、使用する前にチェックしておきたいデメリットも紹介しておきます。
1.手が届かないところは脱毛できない
襟足や背中など、見えにくく手が届かないところは脱毛できません。
→解決策：家族や友人に手伝ってもらうのがベスト！無理な場合、背中だけはサロンやクリニックで脱毛する、除毛クリームなどを使う方法があります。
2.剃毛から冷却まで自分で行う
ケノンで脱毛をするには 、“ 剃る→冷やす→照射→冷やす” の4ステップを自分で行わなくてはいけません。工程を繰り返すのが面倒なうえ、時間もかかってしまいます。
→解決策：手間がかかる点の解決策はないため、“
今日はここだけ”と苦にならないペースで始めるといいでしょう。
3.脱毛効果は自分次第
ケノンには肌質や毛質に応じて出力レベルを変えられる機能が備わっていますが、判断と調節を自分で行わなくてはいけません。
レベルが低すぎると効果薄…、強すぎると肌を痛めてしまうリスクがあります。
→解決策：平均的なレベル5に設定して使いはじめ、レベルを調節していくこと。ケアを欠かすことなく行うことなどに注意するとよいでしょう。
ケノンで大丈夫？サロンやクリニックと効果の差は？
ケノンがあれば家で脱毛が始められるわけですが、気になるのが“脱毛効果”。家庭用脱毛器でどこまでの効果が得られるのかをチェックしておきましょう。
ケノンの効果は？どのくらいで脱毛が完了するの？
まず、ケノンの脱毛効果に焦点を当てると、抑毛や減毛効果が得られると表現したほうがいいかもしれません。繰り返すことで毛の発育を抑制していき、ムダ毛を少なくしていきます。
ケノンを使用して変化を感じ始める回数は、平均5回以降。週に1回照射するペースで考えると、1～2カ月くらいで効果を感じ始めるといわれています。
顔なら約1カ月、VIOの濃い毛では3～4カ月くらいから“効果が出てきたかな”と感じられるでしょう。
ただ、これらの数字はあくまでも目安にしかなりません。個人差や部位によって効果の現れ方に差がありますし、ケノンの使い方によって思うように効果が現れないケースも考えられます。
とはいえ、効果の現れにくさの悩みはサロンやクリニックを利用したとしても同じこと。その点ケノン1台あれば、“脱毛効果が出てくるまで続けられる”という魅力がありますよね。
脱毛サロンの特徴、効果は？
サロンは家庭用脱毛器と同じく、フラッシュ型の脱毛器を使って脱毛を促します。家庭用脱毛器と同様に永久脱毛ではなく、毛の発育を抑制して毛をなくす効果を狙います。
ケノンと異なるの はIPLやSSC、SHRといった3種類の光を使うこと。肌質や毛質によって、適切な光の種類や照射レベルを選んでもらえる点も異なりますね。
効果を感じ始めるのは、早い部位では4回目くらいから。満足いく効果が得られるまでには12回～18回と約2～4年かかるといわれています。
契約したプランでは満足いかなかった場合、さらに脱毛プランを付け足す必要があります。
医療脱毛クリニックの特徴、効果は？
クリニックでは、レーザーによる脱毛施術が行われます。レーザーにはアレキサンドライト・ダイオード・ヤグレーザーの3種類があり、家庭用脱毛器やサロンとは違って永久脱毛が可能といわれています。
効果を感じ始めるのは3回目くらいから。5～8回と約1～2年で満足いく効果が得られる点が最大の魅力でしょう。
ケノンはどこで買うのがお得？大手通販サイトでも販売してるんだけど…
家庭用脱毛器の比較で 「 ヤーマン 」 と「パナソニック」の商品を取り上げましたが、各商品の公式ホームページをチェックしてみると、「ケノン」だけうまくたどり着けないんですよね。
検索してたどり着けるサイトを開くと、” 在庫わずか “ とか ” レビューの多さ “ を全面的にアピールしており、ここから購入手続きを取っていいものか不安になった方も多いと思います。
そこで、ケノンを製造・販売している株式会社エムロックをチェックしてみたところ、正規品が購入できる方法がわかりました。
購入方法1 . ケノンの公式サイトから買う
株式会社エムロックのホームページの中に、ケノンの公式サイトのURLが貼られていました。
ちなみに、ケノンを検索していくうち“

どちらで買うのがお得？なんて考えるかもしれませんが、たどり着くサイトは1つ。ケノンの公式ショップから購入しましょう。
購入方 法2 . 取引先のネットショップモールを経由して買う
株式会社エムロックは、ケノンを販売するために様々な大手通販サイトに専門店を出店しています。
例えば、

【脱毛器ケノンの口コミ検証】ケノンで本当に脱毛できるの？
公式サイトや大手通販サイトで紹介されている口コミを見ると、ケノンの評判は良さそうです。
ちょっと気になるのは、いいコメントばかり大々的に伝えられていること…。そこでケノンを使ったことがある人の口コミを他からピックアップしてみました。
やっぱりすごい！ケノンの良い口コミ
名無しさん 毛深くて恥ずかしい人におすすめ！家庭用脱毛器だけど、ちゃんと効果があります！安いし、気になるところを優先的にケアできるし、とっても簡単にできちゃいます。
おうち時間を使ってケノンでケアすれば、サロンに通わなくても済む人もいると思いますよ。
名無しさん 自分の好きなタイミングで脱毛できたらな…と思い、ネットの評判を参考にケノンを買いました。口コミ通り、本当に毛が減ってきたので大満足！自己処理で気になっていた埋没毛もなくなってきました。
今は家にいる時間も長いのでVIO脱毛にも挑戦中。人に会わないうちに美肌を目指します！
名無しさん サロンやクリニックに思うようなペースで通えない点が気になり、とりあえずケノンで脱毛を始めてみることにしました。6レベルの強さで始めましたが我慢するような痛みはなく、光を当てた部分の毛は触るとホロッと抜け落ちる感じです。
今は、自己処理の回数が減ってきました。継続すればもっとキレイになる気がします。
良 い口コミに関しては、公式サイトにも載っているような内容ばかり。ケノンで十分な効果を得られ、満足している様子がうかがえますね。
ここは注意！ケノンの悪い口コミ
名無しさん 購入前からわかっていたことですが、照射前後の冷やす工程が面倒です。購入してから1～2ヵ月は効果を楽しみに頑張っていましたが、最近はさぼり気味。
そのせいもあってか、ケノンを使い始めた時と毛の量は変わっていないような気がします。
名無しさん ケノンを使い始めて2カ月たちますが、相変わらず太くて濃い毛が生えてきます。
カートリッジの選び方が悪いのか、照射レベルが低いのか…。正解がわからないからただただ続けてみるしかない…。
名無しさん サロンに行く時間がなかったのでケノンを買ってみました。購入してから半年経ちますが、現状に全く満足していません。本当にみなさんに効果が現れているのか疑うほど…。
使い方が間違っていたのか、体質的（毛質）に合わなかったのか…。無駄な買い物だったと思っています。
悪い口コミに関しては 、“ 面倒くさい ” ・“ 効果がなかっ た ” という声が多いです 。
ケノンは自分で進めていく必要があるため、手間がかかる点や効果にムラが出てしまう点が課題となりますよね。
このような口コミが寄せられており、ケノンで十分な効果が得られるかの保証はありません…。が、今の家庭用脱毛器は高性能！
使えればメインに、使えなければムダ毛処理のサブアイテムとしても役に立つことは間違いないでしょう。
脱毛器【ケノン】はやっぱりすごかった！料金や使い方、最新の口コミまとめ
数ある脱毛器の中でも、レビュー多数！評判の高い「ケノン」脱毛器を紹介してきました。
ケノンの魅力を改めてまとめると、
・サロンやエステに通うより断然安い！

・全身脱毛＆美肌作りもOK！男性にもお子さんにもおすすめ！
・敏感肌でも大丈夫！連射機能＆10段階の出力調整機能付き
VIO のケアも恥ずかしくない点なんかも見逃せないポイントですよね。
おうち時間を有効に使いたい人必見！今の “ 時間 ” をつかって自分磨きに力を入れ、思いっきりおしゃれやレジャーを楽しむ準備を始めましょう。
CNN : Price of Iraq war 10 times pre-war predictions David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This When President Bush 's emergency supplemental funding request is granted by Congress in the coming weeks , the cost of the Iraq War will reach ten times its original projected cost of $ 50 - 60 billion , CNN reports .
At what will soon be a total tab of $ 576 billion , the Iraq war is second in cost only to World War II .
According to CNN 's report , every minute troops are deployed in Iraq , the American public pays $ 200,000 to keep them there .
Since the money is not allocated by Congress as part of the regular budget , there is little oversight of how it is spent and Billions of dollars remain unaccounted for in Iraq as the costs continue to mount .
" There 's even funding that the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office identify that they do n't have any idea where the funding went , " Says Travis Sharp of the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Center .
" They do n't know if it went for weapons systems , they do n't know if it was operating costs in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Additionally , the current conflict is the first in American history not to be paid for in real time .
President Roosevelt raised funds for the Second World War by selling war bonds and Americans paid higher taxes throughout the Vietnam era .
The Bush administration , however , is well known for its propensity to cut taxes and increase spending .
" Americans have not paid higher taxes to pay for this war , in fact we 've had a tax cut , nor have we seen a reduction in domestic spending " Says Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs , author of The Price of Liberty , a new book examining the history of American military funding .
" We 've in effected shifted the cost of this war to future generations . "
Though 65 % of the American public now opposes United States involvement in Iraq according to CNN 's poll , Congress still shows no signs of significantly reducing its military or domestic spending and President Bush has stated time and again his opposition to raising taxes .
The following video is from CNN's Your World Today , broadcast on November 2 , 2007 .

Virgin Atlantic is a key transatlantic carrier operating from main airports
In a letter to 4,800 cabin crew , the Virgin boss warned he would not be meeting pay demands .
Workers ' union Unite called the letter from Sir Richard " provocative " .
It comes after union members voted to strike in January in protest over pay levels they say are lower than at other airlines , including British Airways .
The 48 - hour strikes are scheduled for 9 and 10 January , and 16 and 17 January .
For some of you , more pay than Virgin Atlantic can afford may be critical to your lifestyle and if that is the case you should consider working elsewhere
Sir Richard Branson
The strikes are not the only industrial action scheduled by aviation workers for January .
Union members at airport operator BAA had called for strikes on 7 , 14 and 17 - 18 January .
However , the first of the three strikes - set for 7 January - was called off on Monday .
' Dangerous precedent ' ?
In his letter , Sir Richard said Virgin Atlantic had " drawn a line in the sand " over pay this year .
" To go further would result in unacceptable risks and would set a dangerous precedent to the company as a whole , " he added .
" It would be irresponsible of our management and they , rightly , are not going to take that risk . "
Sir Richard admitted that rival airlines often offered better basic wages but said that they did not offer the perks that came with working for a " smaller , more friendly " company .
And he added : " For some of you , more pay than Virgin Atlantic can afford may be critical to your lifestyle and if that is the case you should consider working elsewhere . "
' Unhelpful '
Virgin Atlantic has previously said that there would be no " eleventh hour change to our pay offer " .
The airline said its offer was worth 8.3 % on basic pay over two years , with a 4.8 % increase offered in the first year .
A Unite spokesperson said the letter was " unhelpful in resolving the dispute " and would " only make people more upset " .
A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said that since the letter was sent , a number of union members had contacted management offering to cross the picket line and work on the strike days .
Something I 've learned since I 've become a Smalltalker , is that to live in an image , one must learn to maintain the image .
I used to keep a fresh image handy and whenever things got out of whack , I 'd just start over in a new image .
I did this out of ignorance ; I was n't aware of how to keep one image from collecting cruft .
I 'd end up with a ton of obsolete classes that I did n't have a clue how to get rid of , or even understand how they came to be .
This happened a lot when I 'd load or unload Monticello packages I 'd created , usually due to hidden dependencies between packages .
Eventually I learned to package my code better , and found a patch for Monticello that made dependencies actually work the way I expected them to .
I also learned about a great little tool called the PointerFinder from someone on Squeak - Dev , with which I could find all references to an object allowing me to hunt down and clean up bad refs , ridding myself of all those obsolete classes that would accumulate over time .
This also taught me how those references came to be , and why they could n't be cleaned up automatically .
This one tool finally allowed me to live in one image and just keep it clean , I rarely if ever need to start from a fresh image any more .
Ultimately , I developed my own version of # garbageCollect that I tossed into a utility class to help me maintain my image .
Whenever I find some new maintenance tip to help keep my image clean and organized , I just toss it in here .
The last few lines are the most interesting , either everything goes well and the image is saved , or obsolete classes are found and a PointerFinder is launched on each one forcing me to clean up those bad references right away .
Here 's what I 've collected so far ...
garbageCollect | tasks | tasks := OrderedCollection new add : [ MCFileBasedRepository flushAllCaches ] ; add : [ WARegistry clearAllHandlers ] ; add : [ SMSqueakMap default clearCaches ] ; add : [ Smalltalk removeEmptyMessageCategories ] ; add : [ Workspace allSubInstances

SystemNavigation default obsoleteClasses isEmpty ifTrue : [ SmalltalkImage current saveSession ] if False : [ SystemNavigation default obsoleteClasses do : [ : each | [ PointerFinder on : each ] on : Error do : [ : error | Transcript show : error ; cr ] ] ]
Hopefully the code speaks for itself , and you can remove anything that does n't apply to your image .
If you have any new tips that I 'm unaware of , I 'd love to hear about them .
I 'm always looking for a new trick !
I have this wired up to a hot key via KeyBinder , and simply run it once in a while to ensure everything stays nice and clean , and the image organized and small .
DIRECTORY OF U.S. POLITICAL PARTIES
THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES :
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ( DNC ) - The Democrats won the White House in 2008 and 2012 , won some key governorships ( PA , NY , MO , MN , and CA ) -- but then lost control of the US House in 2010 , lost the US Senate in 2014 , and lost the White House in 2016 ( while still carrying a plurality of the national popular vote by a margin of over 2.5 million votes ) .
2018 proved a good " blue wave " Democratic year , recapturing the House and several key governorships ( MI , WI , IL , others ) .
Democrats run the wide gamut from the near Euro - style democratic - socialist left ( Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez and Bernie Sanders , an independent who caucuses with the Dems ) and traditional liberals ( Elizabeth Warren , Sherrod Brown , Nancy Pelosi ) , to the pragmatic " centrist " moderate - to - liberal style ( Andrew Cuomo , Mark Warner ) , to the Dem center - right ( John Hickenlooper and the New Democratic Coalition ) , to the dwindling GOP - style " Blue Dog " center - conservative right ( Joe Manchin and the Blue Dog Democrats ) .
The 2016 presidential nomination contest saw a competitive race between the traditional Democratic establishment ( Clinton ) and the progressive wing ( Sanders ) , in which the establishment prevailed .
That fight will continue in 2020 , but through a much wider field of contenders .
Official affiliated national Democratic sites include :
REPUBLICAN PARTY ( RNC ) - Republicans recaptured the Presidency in 2016 , following strong off - year elections in 2010 ( recapturing majority status in the US House ) and 2014 ( recapturing US Senate control ) -- but then lost the US House in the 2018 wave election .
The GOP also holds several key Governorships ( including TX , OH , FL , GA , MO , MA and MD ) , but again suffered some setbacks in 2018 .
Pre -Trump , the Republicans could generally be classified into several different sub-sets : traditional establishment conservatives ( Mitch McConnell , Kevin McCarthy and the Club for Growth ) , the " Religious Right " ( Mike Pence and the Family Research Council ) , libertarians ( Rand Paul and the Campaign for Liberty ) , the " paleo- conservative " wing that backs strict anti-immigration controls ( Steve King ) , the dwindling " centrist " or " moderate " wing ( Larry Hogan and Charlie Baker ) , and the firebrand Tea Party movement conservatives ( Ted Cruz , Jim Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus ) .
President Donald Trump , however , is a political nationalist and economic populist who does not fit neatly into any of these traditional GOP factions , and in fact handily vanquished 2016 nomination rivals from each of the various other wings of the party .
Official , affiliated national GOP sites include :
THE THIRD PARTIES :
THE " BIG THREE " THIRD PARTIES :
( Based upon vote performance over past two election cycles and ballot access )
CONSTITUTION PARTY -
The Constitution Party is strongly pro-life , anti-gun control , anti-tax , anti-immigration , trade protectionist , " anti-New World Order , " anti-United Nations , anti-gay rights , anti-welfare , and pro-school prayer .
Former Nixon Administration official and one - time Conservative Coalition chair Howard Phillips founded the party , originally named the US Taxpayers Party ( USTP ) , in 1992 .
The USTP renamed itself the Constitution Party in 1999 .
The party has fielded presidential tickets since 1992 and congressional and state candidates since 1994 ( but only in a small number of states ) .
The party received a brief boost in the media when conservative US Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire -- an announced GOP Presidential hopeful -- bolted from the Republican Party to seek the Constitution Party nomination in 2000 ( but the erratic Smith quit the Constitution Party race a few weeks later and rejoined the GOP ) .
At the 1999 national convention , the party narrowly adopted a controversial change to the platform 's preamble which declared " that the foundation of our political position and moving principle of our political activity is our full submission and unshakable faith in our Savior and Redeemer , our Lord Jesus Christ " -- although the party officially invites " all citizens of all faiths " to become active in the party .
Any national candidate seeking the party 's nomination is explicitly required to tell the convention of any areas of disagreement with the party 's platform .
In 2012 , former GOP Congressman Virgil Goode was the party 's Presidential nominee ( 5th place - 0.09 % - 122,000 votes ) .
Longtime party activist and attorney Darrell Castle was the CP's 2016 Presidential nominee ( 6th place - 0.15 % - 203,000 votes ) .
Controversial coal mining magnate Don Blankenship - a former GOP US Senate candidate in West Virginia - is the party 's 2020 presidential nominee .
GREEN PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES - The Green Party -- the informal US - affiliate of the leftist , environmentalist European Greens movement -- is one of the two largest third parties in the nation .
The Greens support strict environmental protection laws , stronger labor rights , expanded social programs , and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations .
The party regularly fields candidates for local , state and federal offices in many states , and has established active state affiliate parties in nearly all states .
The Greens scored a major political points when it convinced prominent consumer advocate Ralph Nader to run as their first Presidential nominee in 1996 .
Spending just over $ 5,000 , Nader was on the ballot in 22 states and carried over 700,000 votes ( 4th place - 0.8 % ) .
In 2000 , Nader raised millions of dollars , mobilized leftist activists and grabbed national headlines with his anti-corporate campaign message .
Nader ignored pleas from liberal Democrats that he abandon the race because he was siphoning essential votes away from Al Gore 's campaign .
In the end , Nader was on the ballot in 44 states and finished third with 2,878,000 votes ( 2.7 % ) .
Until 2001 , the Greens were largely a collection of fairly autonomous state / local based political entities with only a weak ( and sometimes splintered ) national leadership structure that largely served to coordinate electoral activities .
In 2001 , the party officially converted into a formal , unified national party organization .
Physician and progressive activist Jill Stein was the Green presidential nominee in 2012 ( 4th place - 0.4 % - 470,000 votes ) and 2016 ( 4th place - 1.1 % - 1,456,500 votes ) .
Official Green Party links include : Global Green Network , GPUS Black Caucus , Lavender Green Caucus , Latinx Caucus , and Young Ecosocialists .
LIBERTARIAN PARTY -
The LP , founded in 1971 , bills itself as " America 's largest third party " ( and , along with the Greens , are definitely among the two largest third parties in the nation ) .
The Libertarians are neither left nor right : they believe in total individual liberty ( pro-drug legalization , pro-gay marriage , pro-home schooling , pro-gun rights , generally pro-choice , etc. ) and total economic freedom ( anti- welfare , anti-government regulation of business , anti-minimum wage , anti-income tax , pro-free trade ) .
The LP espouses a classical laissez faire ideology which , they argue , means " more freedom , less government and lower taxes . "
Over 400 LP members currently hold various -- though fairly low level -- government offices ( including lots of minor appointed officials like " School District Facilities Task Force Member " and " Town Recycling Committee Member " ) .
In 2020 , outgoing GOP Congressman Justin Amash ( MI ) changed his registration to Libertarian , making him the LP 's first member to officially sit in the US House .
The LP 's biggest problem : former Congressmen Ron Paul and Paul Broun , humorist / journalist PJ O'Rourke , the Republican Liberty Caucus and others in the GOP who attract ideological libertarians into the political arena by arguing they can bring about libertarian change more easily under the Republican label .
In 2012 , former GOP New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson was the LP Presidential nominee , had ballot status in 48 states ( 3rd place - 1 % - 1,276,000 votes ) .
The party 's 2016 ticket featured again Gary Johnson , joined this time by former GOP Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld as his VP runningmate .
Johnson - Weld produce the best finish in the history of the party ( 3rd place - 3.3 % - 4,487,700 votes ) .
Johnson , however , proved to be an unfocused and undisciplined candidate , and he seemingly squandered an opportunity to perform significantly better .
The LP has active affiliate parties in every state .
The party has been divided for years between two fighting factions : a more purist / hardcore libertarian group and a more moderate " reform " faction .
The hardcore group are uncompromising anarchistic - libertarians in the Ayn Rand mold .
By contrast , the moderates ( like Gary Johnson ) are interested in focusing on only a handful of more popular issues ( drug decriminalization , gun rights , tax cuts , etc. ) in exchange for attracting a larger number of voters .
Allies of the hardcore faction firmly held control of the party from the late - 1980s until the moderates seized control at the 2006 national convention and somewhat softened the party 's platform .
Other related LP sites include the LP News , Campus Libertarians and LPedia .
SMALLER THIRD PARTIES :
ALLIANCE PARTY - The Alliance Party launched in 2018 , formed by fiscally conservative / socially moderate centrists who had been Democrats , Republicans , independents , and third party members ( the Modern Whig Party , American Moderates Party and the South Carolina American Party folded into it ) who were upset with the dysfucntion caused by status quo political gridlock and the toxic national political divide .
They explained : " Americans need not be adversaries or combatants .
In reality , we are all pursuing a personal American Dream , and we are allies in our collective pursuit of a more perfect Union . "
The party supports free trade , reducing the national debt , a strong military , affordable health care , initiatives to combat climate change , gay equality , immigration , gun rights ( with limited , constitutionally reasonable regulation ) , better care for veterans an emphasis on renewable energy , and term - limits .
While still very small , the party has active affiliates in many states and fielded candidates in 2020 .
Frequent candidate Rocky de la Fuente - who has run over the years under many different party banners - is Alliance 's 2020 presidential nominee .
AMERICAN FREEDOM PARTY - The American Freedom Party ( originally named American Third Position or A3P ) is a white supremacist political party - they prefer to call themselves " White Nationalists " - founded in 2010 .
In various policy statements , the AFP state its mission is " to represent White Americans before the political arena . "
This racist party espouses a non-interventionist foreign policy , calls for strict controls on non-white immigration to the US , and touts the slogan " Diversity is a Codeword for White Genocide . "
The party began fielding candidates on the ballot in 2011 .
The AFP nominated white supremacist activist Merlin Miller for President in 2012 , and he achieved ballot status in three states ( 19th place - 2,714 votes ) .
The party 's 2016 nominee , elderly white supremacist Bob Whitaker , failed to achieve any ballot status and captured too few write - in votes to even be tallied by states .
The party embraces the Neo - Nazi " Alt - Right " label .
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT
PARTY - Governor George Wallace ( D - AL ) founded the AIP and ran as the its first Presidential nominee in 1968 .
Running on a fiery populist , right - wing , anti-Washington , anti-racial integration , anti-communist platform , Wallace carried nearly 10 million votes ( 14 % ) and won five Southern states .
Although Wallace returned to the Democratic Party by 1970 , the AIP continued to live on -- but moved even further to the right .
The 1972 AIP nominee , John Birch Society leader and Congressman John G. Schmitz ( R - CA ) , carried nearly 1.1 million votes ( 1.4 % ) .
The 1976 AIP Presidential nominee was former Governor Lester Maddox ( D - GA ) , an unrepentant segregationist -- but he fell far below Schmitz 's vote total .
The AIP last fielded its own national Presidential candidate in 1980 : white supremacist former Congressman John Rarick ( D - LA ) , who carried 41,000 votes .
Since the mid-1980s , the AIP has only operated and fielded candidates in California .
From 1992 - 2007 , the AIP was a state affiliate party of the national Constitution Party , but it is entirely independent today of any national parties .
The party fielded a few write - in candidates in 2014 ; and endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 in lieu of fielding a candidate .
AMERICAN SOLIDARITY PARTY - The American Solidarity Party is founded upon Catholic social teaching .
The party is pro-life , anti-death penalty , pro-welfare , anti-gay marriage , pro-universal health care , pro-environmental protection , and anti-military Selective Service / draft .
The ASP also wants to cut income taxes on earned wages , while increasing taxes on investment income and corporations .
The ASP supports increased banking regulation , wants to end energy and agricultural subsidies , supports clean energy , backs tougher environmental protections , opposes military intervenionism , opposes US arms sales to foreign governments , is anti-pornography , supports a focus on rehabilitation versus arrests for narcotics , and is pro-labor unions .
The ASP 's 2016 presidential nominee , Mike Maturen , achieved ballot status in one state and write - in status in several others ( 16th place - 4,655 votes ) .
Retired teacher Brian Carroll is the ASP 's 2020 presidential nominee .
The ASP is now trying to establish a few state affiliates , and has a Facebook page .
AMERICA'S PARTY - Former Ambassador and frequent GOP Presidential candidate Alan Keyes created this party in 2008 , after he quit the Republican race for President and failed to win the Constitution Party 's nomination .
Originally named America 's Independent Party , they shortened their name to America 's Party in 2011 .
The party espouses a social Christian conservative platform : pro-life ( no exceptions ) , anti-gay rights , pro-gun rights , pro-strong military ( " peace through strength " ) , pro-Iraq War , anti-tax ( supports total repeal of federal income taxes ) , and opposes federal spending on any programs not explicitly authorized by the US Constitution .
In 2008 , Keyes was on the ballot in three states as the party 's Presidential nominee and captured a total of 47,768 votes ( 7th place - 0.04 % ) .
In a directly related coup , this party wrested control of the American Independent Party of California away from the Constitution Party , thus capturing ballot status in the state for the 2008 /2010 elections .
Interestingly , the party does not accept any financial donations .
Party national chair Tom Hoefling was the party 's 2016 Presidential nominee ( 17th place - 4,577 votes ) .
The party does not intend to field their own presidential nominee for 2020 .
CITIZENS PARTY -
Not to be confused with the progressive party by the same name in the 1980s , this new Citizens Party was launched in 2004 as the New American Independent Party .
In 2011 , the party changed its name to Citizens Party .
The CP vows to become a national entity .
The CP describe their ideology as a " pragmatic ... mixture of what might appear to be liberal , moderate and conservative views . "
The party supports fair trade ( reciprocity ) , and opposed free trade policies , NAFTA , CAFTA and the WTO ; supports gun ownership rights ; supports gay marriage and is pro-choice ; wants tougher animal cruelty laws ; supports legalizing medically assisted suicide ; wants to create tax incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and protect US family farms ; opposed the Wall Street bailout ; and opposes a " neo-conservative foreign policy . "
To date the party has only ballot qualified one candidate under its name : a Pennsylvania state legislative candidate in 2006 .
COMMUNIST PARTY USA - The CPUSA -- once the slavish propaganda tool and spy network for the Soviet Central Committee -- experienced a forced transformation in recent years .
Highly classified Soviet Politburo records , made public after the fall of Soviet communism in the 1990s , revealed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) illegally funneled millions of dollars to the CPUSA to finance its activities from the 1920s to the 1980s .
The flow of Soviet dollars to the CPUSA came to an abrupt halt when the Soviet communists were ousted from power in 1991 -- ultimately causing a total overhaul of CPUSA activities .
Founded in 1924 , the CPUSA reached its peak vote total in 1932 with nominee William Z. Foster ( 102,000 votes - 4th place ) .
The last national CPUSA ticket -- headed by Stalinist Gus Hall and 60s radical activist Angela Davis -- was fielded in 1984 ( 36,000 votes - 8th place ) .
While the party has not directly run any candidates since the late 1980s , the CPUSA sometimes backs some candidates in various local elections ( often in Northeastern industrial communities ) and engages in grassroots political and labor union organizing .
As for issues , the CPUSA calls for free universal health care , elimination of the federal income tax on people earning under $ 60,000 a year , free college education , drastic cuts in military spending , " massive " public works programs , the outlawing of " scabs and union busting , " abolition of corporate monopolies , public ownership of energy and basic industries , huge tax hikes for corporations and the wealthy , and various other programs designed to " beat the power of the capitalist class ... [ and promote ] anti-imperialist freedom struggles around the world . "
The CPUSA 's underlying Marxist ideology remains strong .
However , it has evolved now -- after the death of Hall in 2000 -- into a Gorbachev - style " democratic reform communist " movement headed by activist Sam Webb .
Under Webb 's leadership , the CPUSA now touts a platform of true democratic socialism and trade unionism , and frequently encourages votes for the Democratic presidential nominees as a pragmatic electoral tactic to defeat conservatives .
Official CPUSA websites include the People 's World party newspaper and Political Affairs monthly party magazine .
FREEDOM SOCIALIST
PARTY -
The FSP was formed in 1966 by a splinter group of dissident feminist Trotskyists who broke away from the Socialist Workers Party to create a new party in the " tradition of Marx , Engels , Lenin and Trotsky . "
The FSP has always emphasized " black liberation and social feminsm " -- thus the reason Radical Women is an official alternate name used by the FSP .
The FSP describe themselves as a " revolutionary , socialist feminist organization , dedicated to the replacement of capitalist rule by a genuine workers ' democracy that will guarantee full economic , social , political , and legal equality to women , people of color , gays , and all who are exploited , oppressed , and repelled by the profit system and its offshoot -- imperialism . "
The FSP has party organizations in the US , Canada and Australia , and today remains staunchly Trotskyist in ideology .
The FSP occasionally fields a handful of local candidates in Washington , California and New York ( often in non-partisan elections ) .
The FSP also fielded their first Presidential candidate in 2012 : socialist activist Stephen Durham , who ran as a write - in when he failed to achieve ballot status in any state .
No candidates in 2016 .
Official FSP links include the Freedom Socialist newspaper and Red Letter Press ( book publishers ) .
THE INDEPENDENT PARTY -
This small , centrist party was founded in 1976 , although they showed no political footprint before 2010 .
The TIP claim to be affinity descendents of the small Toleration Party of the early 1800s .
Their stances are largely platitudes .
Example : " We work and advocate for progress on political and social issues , have adopted policies and the platform that effect positive change , insist on free , open , and equal access to the ballot , media , and vote , equal representation by our elected officials , demand fiscal responsibility , and transparency by our SERVANTS of the people ! "
TIP 's party platform is short but rather incomprehensible .
The party fielded roughly a dozen federal and state candidates in six states in 2018 , and is running Terry Wheelock for President in 2020 .
INDEPENDENT AMERICAN PARTY -
The small Independent American Party has existed for years in several Western states , with an ideology grounded in conservative Mormon political beliefs .
In fact , the party 's name is derived from an 1844 Mormon prophesy by Mosiah Hancock .
Converting the unaffiliated IAP state party organizations -- united by a common Religious Right ideology ( similar to the Constitution Party ) -- into a national IAP organization was an effort started in 1998 by members of Utah IAP .
The Idaho IAP and Nevada IAP subsequently affiliated with the fledgling US - IAP in 1998 .
Since then , the party has established small chapters in some other states , but shows no real signs of any real growth .
The bulk of the IAP activities remain concentrated in Utah , Nevada and Oregon .
The various IAP state parties endorsed Constitution Party nominee Howard Phillips for President in 1996 and 2000 .
In December 2000 , the IAP 's national chairman issued a statement noting third parties in general registered a " dismal " performance in the Presidential election -- and questioned the IAP 's future participation in Presidential campaigns .
Instead , he suggested that the IAP limit itself to congressional , state and local races in the future .
The party routinely fields numerous candidates each election year in Utah and Nevada .
Army veteran and frequent candidate Kyle Koptike was the IAP presidential nominee in 2016 ( 24th place - 1,096 votes ) .
LIFE AND LIBERTY PARTY - Founded in 2019 by dissident leaders from the Constitution Party , the Life and Liberty Party is " a coalition of parties across the nation ... centered on the Constitution of the United States of America , and upholding the rule of law . "
The party is uncompromisingly pro-life and anti-euthanasia , supports environmental protection laws , and is otherwise somewhat libertarian - consevative on other issues .
Currently , the Alaska and South Dakota Constitution Parties disaffiliated from the national CP and now affiliate with the L&L Party .
The party also has an active affiliate in Arkansas .
Party co-founder J.R. Myers is the L&L presidential nominee in 2020 and has already secured ballot status in at least one state .
NATIONAL PROGRESSIVE PARTY - The Vermont Progressive Party - which has existed since 1982 and successfully elected candidates to statewide office - launched this national entity in 2020 right after the end of US Senator Bernie Sanders ' presidential campaign .
As in Vermont , the NPP is a democratic socialist party closely aligned with the politics of Sanders .
In fact , Sanders was first elected Burlington Mayor in the 1980s as a candidate of the Progressive Party .
" Not Bernie , us .
We 're planting the seeds of a winning new party , taking no corporate money , and championing economic , social , and environmental justice , " is how the party described themselves in 2020 after Sanders ' presidential run ended .
Not yet clear what their national strategy is or when then expect to expand into other states .
PARTY FOR SOCIALISM AND LIBERATION - The Party of Socialism & Liberation ( PSL ) is alternatately called " a revolutionary Marxist party " created " to be a vehicle for the multinational working class in the struggle for socialism ...
Only a multinational party can create the unity necessary to defeat the most powerful capitalist class the world has ever seen ...
We aim for revolution in the United States ...
We want a revolution ; and , we work hard to make it happen . "
Additionally , the PSL explains that " the most crucial requirement for [ PSL ] membership is the dedication to undertake this most important and most necessary of all tasks : building a new revolutionary workers party in the heart of world imperialism . "
The PSL was founded in 2006 by a breakaway faction of the communist revolutionary wing of the Workers World Party .
The PSL espouses a pro-Cuba / pro-China view , and the iconic Che Guevarra 's call for continual world revolution against capitalism .
The PSL fielded its first candidates in 2008 : a Presidential ticket and Congressional candidates .
Longtime Marxist revolutionary activist Gloria LaRiva was again the PSL presidential nominee in 2016 , marking her 7th time on a presidential ticket ( 18th place - 4,250 votes ) - and is again the PSL presidential nominee for 2020 .
The PSL also sponsors and / or directs numerous popular front groups including People 's Power Assemblies , International Action Center , Congress of Resistance , and many others .
The party 's offiical newspaper is Liberation and the PSL 's campaign website is VotePSL.org .
PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY - Founded in the 1960s as a left - wing party opposed to the Vietnam War , the party reached its peak of support in 1968 when it nominated Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver for President .
Although a convicted felon , Cleaver captured nearly 37,000 votes ( ironically , Cleaver ultimately became a Reagan Republican in the early 1980s , and was later a crack cocaine addict in the late 1980s , before emerging as an environmental activist in the late 1990s ) .
Famed " baby doctor " Benjamin Spock -- a socialist , pacifist and staunch opponent of the Vietnam War -- was the PFP Presidential nominee in 1972 .
Since then , the small party has largely been dominated by battling factions of Marxist - Leninists ( aligned with the communist Workers World Party ( WWP ) , which later split into the militant revolutionary Party of Socialism & Liberation ( PSL ) ) , Trotskyists , and true democratic socialists .
The PFP today is small is a self - described " feminist socialist party " with activities centered only in California .
In 1996 , the PFP successfully blocked an attempt by the WWP to capture the PFP's Presidential nomination for their party 's nominee .
In a sign of the party 's serious decline in support , the PFP 's poor showing in the 1998 statewide elections caused the party to lose its California ballot status .
The PFP finally regained California ballot status in 2003 -- and immediately fielded a sizable slate of candidates .
In 2008 , the party let consumer activist Ralph Nader use their California ballot line in support of his Independent run for President .
In 2009 , the party announced plans to try expanding into " a nationwide electoral party dedicated to socialism , feminism , democracy , environmentalism , and racial equality . "
The communist PSL 's candidates captured several key PFP statewide candidate nominations in California in 2010 , but then lost control again in 2012 when the PFP nominated comic actress Rosanne Barr for President .
Barr was on the ballot in 3 states ( 6th place - 67,500 votes - 0.05 % ) .
The PFP did not field their own ticket in 2016 , and instead endorsed the nominee of the PSL .
PIRATE PARTY - The US Pirate Party is the US affiliate of the European - based Pirate Parties International umbrella group , a global movement founded in 2006 with affiliates active in nearly 70 nations .
The USPP was founded the same year .
The various Pirate parties support reform of copyright laws to reflect open source and free culture values , government transparency , protection of privacy and civil liberties , rolling back corporate personhood and corporate welfare , evidence - based policy , and egalitarianism and meritocracy based on the hacker ethic .
" We support the legalization of sharing movies , music and other art online , so our opponents would call us the Pirate Party anyway .
We feel it ’s better to reclaim that name .
Historically , pirate ships had a tradition of egalitarian radical democracy , and provided a refuge for social outcasts and escaped slaves from a society unfriendly to them .
We ’re anti-establishment , so pirates declaring mutiny seems like a good metaphor for us .
We believe politics and activism can have a sense of humor while still being dead serious , " they playfully explain .
The USPP began fielding political candidates in 2012 .
The USPP has active chapters in a few states .
PROHIBITION PARTY - " If you are a reform - minded conservative and a non-drinker , the Prohibition Party wants you , " exclaimed an official party message in 2002 .
The Prohibition Party -- founded in 1869 and billing themselves as " America 's Oldest Third Party " -- espouses a generally ultra-conservative Christian social agenda mixed with anti-drug and international anti-communist views .
The party 's strongest showing was in 1892 , when former Congressman John Bidwell received nearly 273,000 votes ( 2.3 % - 4th place ) .
The late , long - time Prohibition Party 's leader Earl Dodge , the party 's six - time presidential nominee , scored the all - time low for the party ( 140 votes in 2004 ) .
Party newsletter editor Jim Hedges , a former Pennsylvania town tax assessor , was the party 's 2016 presidential nominee ( 15th place - 5,617 votes ) .
The party nominated neo-Confederate activist Bill Bayes of Mississippi - the party 's 2016 VP nominee - for President in 2020 .
Bayes 's Confederate belief there is no single , legitimate United States but rather that each US state is a separate sovereign nation proved too internally controversial .
Within a few months , Bayes 's nomination caused such an internal rift that he quit as the nominee , claiming he was being sabotaged .
The party then nominated one of their traditional religious right - style candidates - party activist C.L. " Connie " Gammon - as their 2020 replacement nominee .
The Prohibition Party also fields one or two local candidates from time to time .
Additional party - related web sites are the Partisan Prohibition Historical Society and Facebook : Prohibition Party .
REFORM PARTY -
Once a rapidly growing and populist third party , the Reform Party first shifted far to the right during 1999 - 2002 , before imploding into insignificance due to factional in - fighting .
After the shift , it quickly experienced massive waves of conservative defections away into the Constitution Party and the America First Party in 2002 , before withering into an insignificant shadow of its former glory years .
First , some history : after running as an Independent in 1992 , billionaire Texas businessman Ross Perot founded the Reform Party in 1995 as his vehicle for converting his independent movement into a permanent political party .
In 1996 , Perot ran as the Reform Party 's presidential nominee ( 8,085,000 votes - 8 % ) .
The party originally reflected Perot 's center - conservative fiscal policies and anti-GATT / NAFTA views -- while avoiding taking any official positions on social issues .
The RP was plagued by a lengthy period of nasty ideological battles in 1998 - 2000 involving three main rival groups : the " Old Guard " Perot faction , the more libertarian Jesse Ventura faction , and the social conservative Pat Buchanan faction .
After several nasty and public battles , the Ventura faction quit the RP in 2000 and the old Perot faction lost control of the party in court to the Buchanan faction later in 2000 .
That gave the Buchanan faction control of the party 's $ 12.6 million in federal matching funds .
Along with Buchanan 's rise to power in the party , the party made a hard ideological shift to the right -- an ideological realignment that continues to dominate the tiny RP today .
In the aftermath of the 2000 elections , it was clear that Buchanan failed in his efforts to establish a viable , conservative third party organization .
Buchanan was on the ballot in 49 states , captured 449,000 votes ( 4th place - 0.4 % ) , and later told reporters his foray into third party politics was likely a mistake .
In 2002 , the party splintered further , losing most of its conservative activists to other right - wing third parties .
The RP was just about bankrupt by late 2004 , having less than $ 50 remaining in its bank account .
Businessman Rocky de la Fuente , who also ran as an Independent candidate in some states , was the party 's 2016 nominee ( 8th place - 33,097 votes ) .
A few isolated state party affiliates remain active , fielding candidates from time to time .
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS , USA - The SD - USA has only fielded candidates for local office , and has been only nominally active since the 1980s .
The SD - USA is a small group more ideologically centrist , staunchly anti-communist leftists who were more directly aligned with the Democratic Party in the 1970s - 1980s than the more traditionally leftist Democratic Socialists of America ( DSA ) .
In fact , the views of the SPUSA in 1972 caused the DSA ( then named the DSOC ) to splinter away in a ideological rift .
The SD - USA refused to support George McGovern for President that year because of his opposition to the Vietnam War -- versus the DSOC , which supported McGovern and an immediate end to the war .
SD - USA also disputes the claims of DSA and SPUSA to be the true heirs to the legacy of Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas , claiming instead that the SD - USA " is the only legitimate successor " to the party of Debs and Thomas .
However , by 2010 , SD - USA eventually ceded all rights to the name " Socialist Party USA " to the SPUSA ( and , interestingly , retired SPUSA national chair and two - time Presidential nominee David McReynolds now writes columns for the SD - USA 's website ) .
The Socialist International stripped SD - USA of full member status in 2007 , deeming SD - USA to be a defunct organization .
The SD - USA remnant which still functioned was a mere shell of what it once was several decades ago .
SD - USA began a reorganizing process in 2009 , with a new leadership team .
SD - USA held a nation convention in 2012 and is currently focused on rebuilding the group .
SOCIALIST PARTY USA - The SPUSA are true democratic socialists -- advocating left - wing electoral change versus militant revolutionary change .
Many of the SP members could easily be members of the left - wing faction of the Democratic Party .
Unlike most of the other political parties on this page with " Socialist " in their names , the SP has always been staunchly anti-communist .
The original Socialist Party USA was founded by labor union leader , ex-Democratic elected official and pacifist Eugene V. Debs in 1900 , the SP was once a mighty national third party .
Debs himself was the SP nominee for president five times between 1900 and 1920 .
Debs received over 900,000 votes ( 6 % ) in 1912 -- the SP 's best showing ever .
Former minister and journalist Norman Thomas was the SP Presidential nominee 6 times between 1928 and 1948 -- his best showing being 883,000 votes ( 2.2 % ) in 1932 .
The SP also elected congressmen , mayors and other officials throughout the 20th Century ( largely during the 1910s through 1950s ) .
The party withered and splintered so much that , by the last 1972 , it barely existed .
The Democratic Socialists of American and the Social Democrats USA -- both linked above -- are the other splinter groups from the original Debs / Thomas SP entity .
Activists from the old SP reconstituted the party in 1976 and began to again field SPUSA national tickets for the first time in over two decades .
SPUSA activist Emidio " Mimi " Soltysik was the party 's presidential nominee in 2016 ( 22nd place - 2,683 votes ) .
The party 's youth wing -- the Young People 's Socialist League -- has been in existence since the early 1900s .
Other SPUSA sites : Socialist National Committee / VoteSocialist.org ( campaigns / candidates ) and The Socialist .
SOCIALIST ACTION - Socialist Action is a Trotskyist political party of " revolutionary socialists " originally founded in 1983 by expelled members of the Socialist Workers Party .
While the SA shares the SWP 's pro-Cuba views , the SA still tries to retain its Trotskyist ideological roots ( versus the SWP , which has drifted away from Trotskyism towards a Soviet authoritarian communist ideology ) .
The SA states that they " oppose the Democrats and Republicans , all capitalist political parties , and all capitalist governments and their representatives everywhere ... [ and ]
Stalinist and neo-Stalinist regimes from the ex-Soviet Union to China . "
This communist party has fielded some local political candidates in the San Francisco Bay area over the years , and ran its first congressional candidate in 2010 ( in Connecticut ) .
The party fielded SA National Secretary Jeff Mackler as the 2016 presidential nominee , but he was just a write - in hopeful as he failed to qualify for the ballot in any state .
Mackler is again the party 's presidential nominee for 2020 .
Other official sites : Youth for Socialist Action and VoteSocialistAction .
SOCIALIST ALTERNATIVE
PARTY - Socialist Alternative , founded in 1986 and originally named the Labor Militant , split from the Labor Party in the 1990s in order to pursue a more radical leftist and anti-globalization party .
The party is the US member of the Committee for a Workers ' International ( CWI ) , an international association of Trotskyist political paries from nearly 50 nations .
SocAlt is not as radical as some Marxist parties , as they espouse democratic socialism and have formed alliances of convenience with non-socialists for political advantage .
for example , the party backed Ralph Nader ( Green ) for President in each of his four runs because they thought his candidacy would help " accelerate the trend of disintigration of the two - party system . "
The party wants to build a socialist mass workers movement , and is critical of the Leninist - Stalinist historical dictatorships as a perversion of true Marxism .
The party supports a $ 15 national minimum wage , universal free health care , a guaranteed $ 500 / week minimum income for all , public ownership of major banks , forcing bankrupt companies into public ownership , free college education , and slashing the military budget .
In a major upset in 2013 , Kshama Sawant became the first party member to win an election when she won a seat on the Seattle City Council -- and another candidate nearly won a seat on the Minneapolis City Council on the same day .
The party currently has chapters in a dozen states .
SOCIALIST EQUALITY PARTY - The Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) was originally named the Workers League ( WL ) .
The WL was founded in 1966 as a Trotskyist communist group closely associated with the electoral campaigns of the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) .
The goal of these Trotskyist groups was a build a working - class labor party in the US affiliated with the International Committee of the Fourth International ( the global Trotskyist umbrella network ) .
They believe that " the egalitarian and internationalist legacy of the Russian Revolution " could have succeeded , but was " betrayed by Stalinism " and its progeny .
When the SWP drifted away from Trotskyism in the early 1980s , the WL broke with the SWP and began fielding its own candidates .
The WL fielded its first Presidential ticket in 1984 .
The WL later renamed itself as the Socialist Equality Party in 1994 .
The Michigan - based SEP regularly fields Congressional and local candidates , mainly in Michigan and Ohio .
The SEP is very realistic about its candidates , acknowledging a campaign is an opportunity to " present a socialist alternative to the demagogy and lies of the establishment parties and the mass media . "
Frequent SEP Presidential nominee Jerry
White was again the party 's nominee in 2016 ( 29th place - 475 votes ) .
The SEP 's news site -- the World Socialist Web Site ( WSWS ) -- is updated daily with articles , analysis , history , etc. , written with a hardcore internationalist , Trotskyist perspective .
SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY - Originally a pro-Trotsky faction within the Communist Party , the SWP was formed in 1938 after the Communist Party -- acting on orders from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin -- expelled the American Trotskyites .
The SWP was for many years the leading voice of Trotskyism in the USA .
Since the 1980s , the SWP rapidly shifted away from Trotskyism and embraced the brand of authoritarian communist politics espoused by the old Soviet Union and former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro ( the SWP site described communist Cuba " a shining example for all workers " ) .
During that ideological shift , the SWP expelled their Trotskyist faction in 1983 ( which lead to the founding of the rival Socialist Action party ) .
The SWP has run candidates for President in every election since 1948 -- plus many federal , state and local candidates nationwide .
The SWP 's best electoral showing was in 1976 , when presidential nominee Peter Camejo captured 90,000 votes ( note : Camejo was expelled from the the SWP in 1980 for embracing democratic socialism ) .
Communist political organizer Alyson Kennedy was the SWP 's candidate in 2016 ( 11th place - 12,465 votes ) .
An interesting quirk is that the SWP requires all members to be " proletarians " by having them take factory jobs in order to advocate for a worker - based communist class struggle .
The party 's weekly newspaper The Militant , which was launched in 1928 and pre-dates the SWP , is the party 's only online presence .
The SWP also owns a book publishing house : Pathfinder Press .
UNITED STATES PACIFIST PARTY -
This tiny political party fielded party founder Bradford Lyttle as a write - in candidate for President in 1996 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2012 ( and ran a US Senate candidate in Colorado in 1998 ) .
In 2008 , for the first time , Lyttle achieved ballot status in one state ( 110 votes ) , a feat he again matched in 2016 ( 382 votes ) .
The USPP opposes military actions in all circumstances and wants to transform the US military into " a non-violent defense and humanitarian service corps . "
The USPP platform advocates generally left - wing political stances and slashing the military budget to " zero . "
UNITY PARTY OF AMERICA - This small centrist political party was founded after the 2004 elections .
For the first decade the party was only active in Colorado , and began fielding candidates there starting in 2006 .
In 2016 , the party began expanding , launching small affiiates in some states and vowing to field a presidential ticket in 2020 .
The party supports a balanced budget constitutional amendment , federal term limits , replacing the federal income tax with other reveue sources , development of clean alternative energy sources , and ending gerrymandering by having all election districts drawn by nonpartisan panels of judges .
WORKERS WORLD PARTY - The WWP was formed in 1959 by a pro-Chinese communist faction that split from the Socialist Workers Party .
Although the WWP theoretically supports worker revolutions , the WWP supported the Soviet actions that crushed worker uprisings in Hungary in the 1950s , Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and Poland in the early 1980s .
The WWP was largely an issue - oriented revolutionary party until they fielded their first candidate for president in 1980 .
The militant WWP believes that " capitalist democracy produces nothing but hot air " and that " the power of the workers and the oppressed is in the streets , not in Washington . "
FBI Director Louis Freeh attacked the WWP in his May 2001 remarks before a US Senate committee : " Anarchists and extremist socialist groups -- many of which , such as the Workers World Party -- have an international presence and , at times , also represent a potential threat in the United States " of rioting and street violence .
The more revoltionary wing of the WWP broke away in 2006 to form the Party of Socialism & Liberation ( PSL ) .
After the WWP - PSL split , the WWP failed to field a Presidential ticket in 2008 and 2012 .
In 2016 , the party nominated longtime party activist Monica Moorhead for President ( 18th place - 4,250 votes ) .
Moorhead was previously the WWP presidential nominee in 1996 and 2000 .
Official news site : Workers World .
WORKING CLASS PARTY -
The WCP was founded in 2016 as a socialist , anti-capitalist , anti-racist party which asserts " working people need our own party , a party of our whole class , built around the conviction that the working class and the employing class have nothing in common . "
The party looks at the late socialist Eugene Debs as a hero of their movement .
The WCP wants to have both militant unions to fight " the bosses " and capitalism , and have the WCP act as the political entity to carry on the fight in the electoral venue .
The WCP has active chapters and fields candidates in Michigan and Maryland .
WORKING FAMILIES PARTY -
The WFP , founded in 1998 by a coalition of labor unions , was for many years a one - state party which operated only in New York .
During 2006 - 08 , the WFP expanded by launching new chapters in a few other states .
By 2008 , the WFP obtained ballot access and nominated congressional candidates in New York , Connecticut and Oregon .
The WFP essentially operates as a " fusion " party which co-nominates candidates of established parties .
This fusion move allows WFP candidates -- who are almost exclusively Democrats -- to appear on a second ballot line in the same election .
Fusion " gives voters a way to ' vote their values ' without spoiling an election , " explain the WFP 's website .
The WFP exists to advance a pro-labor union political agenda focused almost entirely on liberal economic and employment issues .
The WFP endorsed Bernie Sanders for President in 2016 , and endorsed Elizabeth Warren in 2020 .
OTHER PARTIES
( Parties that have yet to field any candidates for office )
AMERICAN PATRIOT PARTY OF THE INDEPENDENT AND UNITED STATES -
The APP , established in 2003 , was " founded on the basic principals set forth by our founding fathers , that the federal government should only have the powers set forth in the framework of the Constitution and all other power to be delegated back to the states .
Although everyone has thier own opinions on all issues , we believe it is up to the states to decide what should and should not be mandated , banned or regulated . "
The APP supports a crackdown on illegal immigration , making English fluency a requirement of US citizenship , abolishing the IRS and repealing the federal income tax , imposing steeper taxes and tariffs on imported goods ... oh , and they want every county in the US to become a separate state .
They endorsed Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) for President in 2008 , but did not nominate any candidates on their own to date .
CANARY PARTY - Founded in 2011 , this unusual party is entirely focused upon the issue of health care -- particularly as relates to autism .
According to the party 's official history , they were founded by " a group of parents of children who were suffering from neurological and autoimmune disorders , and who had been active for years in their efforts to get mainstream medicine to address the causes of , and find treatments for , their children 's poor health , faced the realization that while they had been earnest in their engagement of both the private medical industry and government public health officials , the medical establishment was not working in good faith with them . "
This party believes the pharmaceutical industry -- abetted by government and medical profession silence -- have " launched a massive and uncontrolled experiment on a generation of Americans .
In an unprecedented intervention in human immune development , this complex has succeeded in promoting an explosion in medical industry revenues and profits ; this explosion has been accompanied , however , by an epidemic of death , disability and chronic disease , much of which can be traced directly to these medical and chemical exposures . "
This single - issue party wants to address these concerns with federal government action .
CONSERVATIVE PARTY USA - Founded in 2009 , this conservative party has yet to field any candidates .
The party 's mission statement reads as follows : " To re-establish the limits and boundaries of Government as framed in the Constitution . "
They claim they were formed as a new party because the GOP cannot be trusted ( " The Republican Party has consistently failed to uphold conservative principles ...
Trying to change the GOP is like drilling holes in water because they donÂt stand for anything except getting elected " ) .
This is how the party describes their agenda : " The primary duty of the President is to protect America from its enemies , both foreign and domestic ; Veterans must be honored and supported for their sacrifices ; Marriage is between one man and one woman ;
Life begins at conception ; Budget Earmarks must be eliminated and fiscal discipline restored ; Illegal immigration must be stopped ; Healthcare must include meaningful Tort Reform . "
Note :
This party has no affiliation with the well - established Conservative Party of New York State .
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA -
The DSA is the official US full member party of the Socialist International ( which includes UK's Labour Party , the French Parti Socialiste and nearly 140 other political parties around the globe ) .
Unlike most other members of the Socialist International , the DSA never fields candidates for office .
The DSA explains their mission as follows : " building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly socialist presence in American communities and politics . "
Thus , the DSA is less like a traditional US political party and much more like a political education and grassroots activism organization .
Working within the Democratic Party primaries starting around 2010 in local races , and in congresional races since , the DSA fielded and endorsed several Democratic Socialists candidates against more mainstream Democratic incumbents .
In 2018 , Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ( D - NY ) and Rashida Tlaib ( D - MI ) became the first DSA members elected to congress .
DSA , Social Democrats USA and the Socialist Party USA each claim to be the one true heir to the ideological legacy of Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas ( and DSA disputes the Socialist Party - USA 's claim to the title arguing it is a modern - era creation that simply appropriated the older name of the defunct party of Debs / Thomasy ) .
The DSA -- then named the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee ( DSOC ) -- split from the SD - USA in 1972 in a rift over the Vietnam War ( SDUSA supported the war and opposed McGovern for President ; DSOC supported McGovern and opposed the war ) .
Official DSA affiliates include : Young Democratic Socialists , Democratic Left ( magazine ) and DSA Labor Network .
PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY -
The PLP is a New York - based , militant , Stalinist - style communist party dedicated to bringing about a world - wide , armed , communist revolution .
The party was formed in 1961 by members of the CPUSA who felt the Soviet Union had betrayed communism and become revisionist and state capitalist .
Founders also felt the CPUSA had adopted unforgivable reformist positions such as " peaceful coexistence " with the US , turning to electoral politics , and hiding communist views behind a veneer of reform - oriented front groups .
In the 1960s , the PLP heavily infiltrated the radical Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) group .
Today , the PLP still abhors democracy , elections , freedom of nearly any sort , capitalism and religion -- and praises dictator Joseph Stalin 's Soviet Union as their role model .
Because they denounce all elections as " frauds , " the PLP vows to never field any candidates for public office ( for these guys , its either armed victory or nothing at all ) .
Lots and lots of online ideological articles written in the typical dogmatic communist style ... with titles like " The Hoax of the 1932 - 33 Ukraine Fasmine , " " Fascism Grows In The Auto Industry , " " The Road to Revolution . "
Articles in English , Spanish , Russian , German , etc .
REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST PARTY USA - The RCP is based upon the teachings of the late Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong -- a form of rigid communism derivative of Leninist - Stalinist Marxism .
The party strongly denounces capitalism and advocates a " Marxist - Leninist - Maoist Programme " as " a battle plan for destroying the old and creating the new [ and ] is a kind of road map for how to win the revolution . "
Even the RCP 's logo is consistent with the proletarian revolutionary theme ( i.e. , note the red flag flying from a rifle bayonet ) .
The RCP clearly advocates change through revolution ( and various popular front groups ) , not elections -- so do n't look for any RCP candidates on the ballot .
The RCP 's most visible activity is running several branches of a store called Revolution Books .
RCP Chairman Bob Avakian and his writings also receive extensive coverage on the party 's official site , as he has been the party leader since 1979 .
Chapter 19 .
Here Documents
Here and now , boys .
-- Aldous Huxley , Island
A here document is a special - purpose code block .
It uses a form of I/O redirection to feed a command list to an interactive program or a command , such as ftp , cat , or the ex text editor .
COMMAND << InputComesFromHERE
... ... ... InputComesFromHERE
A limit string delineates ( frames ) the command list .
The special symbol << precedes the limit string .
This has the effect of redirecting the output of a command block into the stdin of the program or command .
It is similar to interactive - program < command - file , where command - file contains
command # 1 command # 2 ...
The here document equivalent looks like this :
interactive - program << LimitString command # 1 command # 2 ... LimitString
Choose a limit string sufficiently unusual that it will not occur anywhere in the command list and confuse matters .
Note that here documents may sometimes be used to good effect with non-interactive utilities and commands , such as , for example , wall .
Example 19 - 1. broadcast : Sends message to everyone logged in #!/bin/bash wall << zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23
E-mail your noontime orders for pizza to the system administrator .
( Add an extra dollar for anchovy or mushroom topping . )
# Additional message text goes here .
# Note : ' wall ' prints comment lines .
zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23 #
Could have been done more efficiently by # wall < message - file # However , embedding the message template in a script #+ is a quick - and - dirty one - off solution .
exit
Even such unlikely candidates as the vi text editor lend themselves to here documents .
Example 19 - 2. dummyfile : Creates a 2 - line dummy file #!/ bin/bash # Noninteractive use of ' vi ' to edit a file .
# Emulates ' sed '.
E_BADARGS=85 if [ - z " $ 1 " ] then echo " Usage : `basename $ 0` filename " exit $ E_BADARGS fi TARGETFILE=$ 1 # Insert 2 lines in file , then save .
#--------Begin here document -----------# vi $ TARGETFILE <<x23LimitStringx23 i
This is line 1 of the example file .
This is line 2 of the example file .
^ [ ZZ x23LimitStringx23
#----------
End here document -----------# #
Note that ^ [ above is a literal escape #+ typed by Control - V < Esc > . # Bram Moolenaar points out that this may not work with ' vim ' #+ because of possible problems with terminal interaction .
exit
The above script could just as effectively have been implemented with ex , rather than vi .
Here documents containing a list of ex commands are common enough to form their own category , known as ex scripts .
#!/bin/bash #
Replace all instances of " Smith " with " Jones " #+ in files with a " .txt " filename suffix .
ORIGINAL=Smith REPLACEMENT=Jones for word in $ ( fgrep -l $ ORIGINAL *.txt ) do #
------------------------------------- ex $ word << EOF :%s/$ ORIGINAL /$REPLACEMENT/g :wq EOF # :%s is the " ex " substitution command .
# :wq is write - and - quit .
# -------------------------------------
done
Analogous to " ex scripts " are cat scripts .
Example 19 - 3 . Multi- line message using cat #!/ bin/bash # ' echo ' is fine for printing single line messages , #+ but somewhat problematic for for message blocks .
# A ' cat ' here document overcomes this limitation .
cat << End-of - message
-------------------------------------
This is line 1 of the message .
This is line 2 of the message .
This is line 3 of the message .
This is line 4 of the message .
This is the last line of the message .
-------------------------------------
End-of - message # Replacing line 7 , above , with #+ cat >
$ Newfile << End-of - message #+ ^^^^^^^^^^ #+ writes the output to the file $ Newfile , rather than to stdout .
exit 0
#--------------------------------------------
#
Code below disabled , due to " exit 0 " above .
# S.C. points out that the following also works .
echo "-------------------------------------
This is line 1 of the message .
This is line 2 of the message .
This is line 3 of the message .
This is line 4 of the message .
This is the last line of the message .
-------------------------------------"
#
However , text may not include double quotes unless they are escaped .
The - option to mark a here document limit string ( <<- LimitString ) suppresses leading tabs ( but not spaces ) in the output .
This may be useful in making a script more readable .
Example 19 - 4 . Multi- line message , with tabs suppressed #!/bin/bash #
Same as previous example , but ... #
The - option to a here document <<- #+ suppresses leading tabs in the body of the document , #+ but * not* spaces .
cat <<-ENDOFMESSAGE
This is line 1 of the message .
This is line 2 of the message .
This is line 3 of the message .
This is line 4 of the message .
This is the last line of the message .
ENDOFMESSAGE #
The output of the script will be flush left .
# Leading tab in each line will not show .
# Above 5 lines of " message " prefaced by a tab , not spaces .
# Spaces not affected by <<- . #
Note that this option has no effect on * embedded * tabs .
exit 0
A here document supports parameter and command substitution .
It is therefore possible to pass different parameters to the body of the here document , changing its output accordingly .
Example 19 - 5 .
Here document with replaceable parameters #!/bin/bash # Another ' cat ' here document , using parameter substitution .
#
Try it with no command - line parameters , ./ scriptname #
Try it with one command - line parameter , ./ scriptname Mortimer #
Try it with one two - word quoted command - line parameter , # ./ scriptname " Mortimer Jones " CMDLINEPARAM=1 # Expect at least command - line parameter . if [ $ # - ge $ CMDLINEPARAM ] then NAME =$ 1 #
If more than one command - line param , #+ then just take the first .
else NAME = " John Doe " # Default , if no command - line parameter .
fi RESPONDENT =" the author of this fine script " cat << Endofmessage Hello , there , $ NAME .
Greetings to you , $ NAME , from $ RESPONDENT . #
This comment shows up in the output ( why ? ) .
Endofmessage #
Note that the blank lines show up in the output .
#
So does the comment .
exit
This is a useful script containing a here document with parameter substitution .
Example 19 - 6 .
Upload a file pair to Sunsite incoming directory #!/bin/bash # upload.sh # Upload file pair ( Filename.lsm , Filename.tar.gz ) #+ to incoming directory at Sunsite / UNC ( ibiblio.org ) .
# Filename.tar.gz is the tarball itself .
# Filename.lsm is the descriptor file .
# Sunsite requires " lsm " file , otherwise will bounce contributions .
E_ARGERROR=85 if [ - z " $ 1 " ] then echo " Usage : `basename $ 0` Filename - to - upload " exit $ E_ARGERROR fi Filename=`basename $ 1` # Strips pathname out of file name .
Server=" ibiblio.org " Directory= " / incoming / Linux " #
These need not be hard - coded into script , #+ but may instead be changed to command - line argument .
Password = " your.e-mail.address " # Change above to suit .
ftp -n $ Server << End-Of - Session # -n option disables auto - logon user anonymous " $ Password " #
If this does n't work , then try : # quote user anonymous " $ Password " binary bell # Ring ' bell ' after each file transfer .
cd $ Directory put " $ Filename.lsm " put " $ Filename.tar.gz " bye End - Of - Session exit 0
Quoting or escaping the " limit string " at the head of a here document disables parameter substitution within its body .
The reason for this is that quoting / escaping the limit string effectively escapes the $ , ` , and \ special characters , and causes them to be interpreted literally .
( Thank you , Allen Halsey , for pointing this out . )
Example 19 - 7 . Parameter substitution turned off #!/bin/bash # A ' cat ' here - document , but with parameter substitution disabled .
NAME =" John Doe " RESPONDENT =" the author of this fine script " cat <<' Endofmessage ' Hello , there , $ NAME .
Greetings to you , $ NAME , from $ RESPONDENT .
Endofmessage #
No parameter substitution when the " limit string " is quoted or escaped .
#
Either of the following at the head of the here document would have #+ the same effect .
# cat < < " Endofmessage " # cat << \Endofmessage # And , likewise : cat <<" SpecialCharTest " Directory listing would follow if limit string were not quoted .
`ls -l` Arithmetic expansion would take place if limit string were not quoted .
$ ( ( 5 + 3 ) ) A a single backslash would echo if limit string were not quoted .
\\ SpecialCharTest exit
Disabling parameter substitution permits outputting literal text .
Generating scripts or even program code is one use for this .
Example 19 - 8 . A script that generates another script #!/bin/bash # generate - script.sh # Based on an idea by Albert Reiner .
OUTFILE=generated.sh #
Name of the file to generate .
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
' Here document containing the body of the generated script . ( cat << ' EOF ' #!/ bin/bash echo
" This is a generated shell script . " #
Note that since we are inside a subshell , #+ we can't access variables in the " outside " script .
echo " Generated file will be named : $ OUTFILE " # Above line will not work as normally expected #+ because parameter expansion has been disabled .
# Instead , the result is literal output .
a =7 b=3 let " c = $ a * $ b " echo " c = $ c " exit 0 EOF ) > $ OUTFILE # -----------------------------------------------------------
# Quoting the ' limit string ' prevents variable expansion #+ within the body of the above ' here document . ' #
This permits outputting literal strings in the output file . if [ -f " $ OUTFILE " ] then chmod 755 $ OUTFILE #
Make the generated file executable .
else echo " Problem in creating file : \ " $ OUTFILE\ " " fi #
This method also works for generating #+ C programs , Perl programs , Python programs , Makefiles , #+ and the like .
exit 0
It is possible to set a variable from the output of a here document .
This is actually a devious form of command substitution .
variable =$ ( cat << SETVAR
This variable runs over multiple lines .
SETVAR ) echo " $variable "
A here document can supply input to a function in the same script .
Example 19 - 9 .
Here documents and functions #!/bin/bash # here - function.sh GetPersonalData ( ) { read firstname read lastname read address read city read state read zipcode } #
This certainly appears to be an interactive function , but . . . # Supply input to the above function .
GetPersonalData << RECORD001 Bozo Bozeman 2726 Nondescript Dr. Bozeman MT 21226 RECORD001 echo echo " $ firstname $ lastname " echo " $address " echo " $ city , $ state $ zipcode " echo exit 0
It is possible to use : as a dummy command accepting output from a here document .
This , in effect , creates an " anonymous " here document .
Example 19 - 10 . " Anonymous " Here Document #!/bin/bash : << TESTVARIABLES $ {HOSTNAME ?}$ {USER ?}$ {MAIL?} # Print error message if one of the variables not set .
TESTVARIABLES exit $ ?
A variation of the above technique permits " commenting out " blocks of code .
Example 19 - 11 .
Commenting out a block of code #!/bin/bash # commentblock.sh : << COMMENTBLOCK echo
" This line will not echo . "
This is a comment line missing the " # " prefix .
This is another comment line missing the " # " prefix .
&*@ !!++=
The above line will cause no error message , because the Bash interpreter will ignore it .
COMMENTBLOCK echo " Exit value of above \" COMMENTBLOCK \ " is $ ?. " # 0 # No error shown .
echo #
The above technique also comes in useful for commenting out #+ a block of working code for debugging purposes .
#
This saves having to put a " # " at the beginning of each line , #+ then having to go back and delete each " # " later .
#
Note that the use of of colon , above , is optional .
echo " Just before commented - out code block . " #
The lines of code between the double - dashed lines will not execute .
# =================================================================== : << DEBUGXXX for file in * do cat " $ file " done DEBUGXXX # ===================================================================
echo " Just after commented - out code block . " exit 0 ######################################################################
# Note , however , that if a bracketed variable is contained within #+ the commented - out code block , #+ then this could cause problems .
# for example : #/!/bin/bash : << COMMENTBLOCK echo
" This line will not echo . " &*@ !!++=
$ {foo_bar_bazz?} $ ( rm - rf /tmp/ foobar / ) $ ( touch my_build_directory/cups/Makefile ) COMMENTBLOCK $ sh commented - bad.sh commented - bad.sh : line 3 : foo_bar_bazz : parameter null or not set #
The remedy for this is to strong - quote the ' COMMENTBLOCK ' in line 49 , above .
: <<' COMMENTBLOCK ' #
Thank you , Kurt Pfeifle , for pointing this out .
Yet another twist of this nifty trick makes " self - documenting " scripts possible .
Example 19 - 12 .
A self - documenting script #!/bin/bash # self - document.sh : self - documenting script # Modification of " colm.sh " .
DOC_REQUEST=70 if [ " $ 1 " = " - h " -o " $ 1 " = " - - help " ] # Request help .
then echo ; echo " Usage : $ 0 [ directory - name ] " ; echo sed -- silent -e '/ DOCUMENTATIONXX $/,/^DOCUMENTATIONXX$ /p' " $ 0 " | sed -e '/ DOCUMENTATIONXX$/d ' ; exit $ DOC_REQUEST ; fi : << DOCUMENTATIONXX
List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format .
---------------------------------------------------------------
The command - line parameter gives the directory to be listed .
If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read , then list the current working directory .
DOCUMENTATIONXX if [ - z " $ 1 " -o ! -r " $ 1 " ] then directory =. else directory = " $ 1 " fi echo " Listing of " $ directory " : " ; echo ( printf " PERMISSIONS LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY HH :MM PROG - NAME
" \ ; ls -l " $ directory " | sed 1d ) | column -t exit 0
Using a cat script is an alternate way of accomplishing this .
DOC_REQUEST=70 if [ " $ 1 " = " - h " -o " $ 1 " = " - - help " ] # Request help .
then #
Use a " cat script " . . . cat << DOCUMENTATIONXX
List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format .
---------------------------------------------------------------
The command - line parameter gives the directory to be listed .
If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read , then list the current working directory .
DOCUMENTATIONXX exit $ DOC_REQUEST
fi
See also Example A - 28 , Example A - 40 , Example A - 41 , and Example A - 42 for more examples of self - documenting scripts .
Here documents create temporary files , but these files are deleted after opening and are not accessible to any other process .
bash $ bash - c ' lsof - a -p $ $ - d0 ' << EOF > EOF lsof 1213 bozo 0r REG 3,5 0 30386 /tmp/t1213-0-sh ( deleted )
Some utilities will not work inside a here document .
The closing limit string , on the final line of a here document , must start in the first character position .
There can be no leading whitespace .
Trailing whitespace after the limit string likewise causes unexpected behavior .
The whitespace prevents the limit string from being recognized .
#!/bin/bash echo
"----------------------------------------------------------------------" cat << LimitString echo
" This is line 1 of the message inside the here document . " echo " This is line 2 of the message inside the here document . " echo
" This is the final line of the message inside the here document . "
LimitString #^^^ ^Indented limit string .
Error !
This script will not behave as expected .
echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------"
#
These comments are outside the ' here document ' , #+ and should not echo .
echo " Outside the here document . " exit 0 echo
" This line had better not echo . " # Follows an ' exit ' command .
Some people very cleverly use a single !
as a limit string .
But , that 's not necessarily a good idea .
#
This works .
cat <<!
Hello ! !
Three more exclamations !!! ! # But . . . cat <<!
Hello !
Single exclamation point follows ! ! ! # Crashes with an error message .
#
However , the following will work .
cat << EOF Hello !
Single exclamation point follows !
!
EOF #
It 's safer to use a multi-character limit string .

Congress to say Christmas is important .
Sun and Moon declared good too
This is one straight from the headlines of the Onion .
Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) has introduced a resolution ( H.Res. 847 ) saying , and I am not making this up , that Christmas and Christians are important .
The House is scheduled to vote on this groundbreaking resolution on Tuesday .
As someone with a Christian background , I can safely say this may be the silliest resolution ever introduced by , or voted upon , by Congress , although I am a little curious to see if anyone will vote against it .
Do we really need Congress to say Christmas and the Christian faith are important ?
Is n't that pretty self evident by now ?
Do n't Christians already pretty much run everything in this country , except for the mainstream media , which is of course controlled by a Jewish - Illuminati - Bill Gates cabal ?
Do n't we already get Dec. 25 off ?
Was n't I forced to shell out $ 65 for a scrawny Christmas tree this weekend ?
Wo n't I have to go to Pentagon City or some other godforsaken place and spend more money in the next couple weeks as part of this strange ritual ?
What about the terrible songs that get endlessly recycled year after stinking year ?
And the useless catalogs that clog my mailbox , despite my efforts to get off mailing lists ?
Where will the horror end ?
So , in the war on Christmas , I must declare myself a warrior for the anti-Xmas side .
Bill O'Reilly , please take note .
You too , Mr. King .
Update - The House passed this bill today .
The vote , surprisingly , was 372 - 9 , with 10 members also voting " Present , " meaning they took no position on the legislation , and 40 not voting .
One of the " Present " votes was cast by Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) .
More Democrats - 195 - voted for the bill than Republicans , 177 .
The nine members who voted against the bill - God bless them !
- are Reps. Gary Ackerman ( D - N.Y. ) , Yvette Clarke ( D - N.Y. ) , Diana DeGette ( D - Colo . ) , Alcee Hastings ( D - Fla. ) , Barbara Lee ( D - Calif . ) , Jim McDermott ( D - Wash . ) , Bobby Scott ( D - Va. ) , Pete Stark ( D - Calif . ) and Lynn Woolsey ( D - Calif . ) .
Here 's the text of H. Res. 847 , just so you know how important Christianity and Xmas are :
" Recognizing the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith .
Whereas Christmas , a holiday of great significance to Americans and many other cultures and nationalities , is celebrated annually by Christians throughout the United States and the world ;
Whereas there are approximately 225,000,000 Christians in the United States , making Christianity the religion of over three - fourths of the American population ;
Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000,000 Christians throughout the world , making Christianity the largest religion in the world and the religion of about one - third of the world population ;
Whereas Christians identify themselves as those who believe in the salvation from sin offered to them through the sacrifice of their savior , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , and who , out of gratitude for the gift of salvation , commit themselves to living their lives in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Bible ;
Whereas Christians and Christianity have contributed greatly to the development of western civilization ;
Whereas the United States , being founded as a constitutional republic in the traditions of western civilization , finds much in its history that points observers back to its roots in Christianity ;
Whereas on December 25 of each calendar year , American Christians observe Christmas , the holiday celebrating the birth of their savior , Jesus Christ ;
Whereas for Christians , Christmas is celebrated as a recognition of God 's redemption , mercy , and Grace ; and
Whereas many Christians and non-Christians throughout the United States and the rest of the world , celebrate Christmas as a time to serve others :
Now , therefore be it
Resolved , That the House of Representatives --
( 1 ) recognizes the Christian faith as one of the great religions of the world ;
( 2 ) expresses continued support for Christians in the United States and worldwide ;
(3 ) acknowledges the international religious and historical importance of Christmas and the Christian faith ;
( 4 ) acknowledges and supports the role played by Christians and Christianity in the founding of the United States and in the formation of the western civilization ;
( 5 ) rejects bigotry and persecution directed against Christians , both in the United States and worldwide ; and
( 6 ) expresses its deepest respect to American Christians and Christians throughout the world . "

If you felt you were being unfairly treated at work , you might well throw a sulking fit or even go on strike .
And it turns out that monkeys share that militant tendency .
Scientists have found that capuchin monkeys down tools when they feel they have been treated unfairly .
Researchers trained the animals to exchange pieces of rock for a reward of a slice of cucumber or their favourite treat - a grape .
They then looked at how pairs of monkeys reacted if one was given a tastier morsel than the other .
When the first monkey was rewarded with a grape and the second was given less - appealing cucumber , the latter would start to sulk .
Upset by the apparent unfairness of being given an inferior reward for completing the same task , it would either slack off or refuse to participate any further in the experiment .
Making slight alterations to the experiment appeared to show that the animals were not acting out of greed or even frustration .
Instead , they were upset at not being rewarded or " paid " as well as others for their work .
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists , the U.S. researchers said the monkeys ' behaviour could point to the evolutionary origin of our own resentment at being treated unfairly .
The study , carried out at Emory University in Atlanta , is not the first to highlight human - like traits in capuchin monkeys .
Earlier this year , Italian researchers showed that they display a shrewd business sense .
Taught how to use " coins " , the crafty creatures did simple sums aimed at ensuring they got the most for their money .
They quickly grasped that a big pile of low - value " coins " did not necessarily translate into as many treats as a smaller stack of higher - value currency .
Captive capuchins have also been taught how to shop for bargains .
The monkeys were trained to use silver discs as coins to buy pieces of apple and cucumber from researchers at Yale University in the U.S .
When the apple slices were made " cheaper " than cucumber - meaning more apple was offered for the same amount of money - they opted for the better - value apple .
The monkeys even resorted to underhand tactics to hold on to their cash - by hiding the real coins and offering up " counterfeit " coins made of cucumber to the researchers .
This geeky chessboard was made from old CPUs , CDs , and a custom - built stand .
Unfortunately , it ’s not for sale .

Do you remember when Bush Jr. said , “ either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists ” ?
Well , he meant it .
Homeland Security ’s sub-committee on terrorism risk assessment convened a hearing on 11-06-2007 to discuss “ using the Web as a weapon – the Internet as a tool for violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism . ”
In a video of this meeting , which was last aired by C - Span on 11-12-2007 , members of the sub - committee clearly pointed to Internet sites that question the legitimacy of the official 9/11 story as tools for recruiting terrorists .
During the course of the hearing , Mark Weitzman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center displayed a Power Point Presentation illustrating what his organization considers terrorist recruitment sites .
Here is his testimony :
To illustrate the trends described above , we have put together a short PowerPoint demonstration .
Without going into deep detail in these written remarks , I would like to offer some brief descriptions of the material that will be shown .
The presentation begins with a look at how 9/11 is viewed in some eyes online , including those who applauded it as well as some conspiracies sites .
The presence of the conspiracy site is significant , since so much of what passes as fact online is actually based on some form of conspiracy ...
Next is a series of sites of media portals which show some of the varied methods that the Islamists use to get their message out , including some based on United States servers .
These are followed by some looks at charts and other manuals on how to use violence , along with a novel interpretation of jihad that calls for an “ electronic jihad . ”
One of these “ media portals ” displayed in the Power Point presentation is Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
This site is sandwiched between a Taliban training manual , and several Taliban recruitment sites showing how to make bombs , take captives , and blow buildings up .
Representative Jane Harmon posed the following question to Bruce Hoffman regarding extremist groups using the Internet to recruit potential terrorists : “ So this movement develops them into violent killers ? ” Bruce Hoffman , a Georgetown University security studies professor , and Chairman of the Rand Corporation in Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency , stated that “ falsehoods and conspiracy theorists have become so ubiquitous and believed that you almost have some sort of parallel truth , and it has become a very effective tool for recruiting people . ”
The “ people ” he is referring to are potential terrorists .
Mark Weitzman stated : “ These people are constructing their own version of reality , full of conspiracy theories , full of doctored videos , that will recruit or inflame the emotions . ” 9/11 “ conspiracy theorist ” groups are included in this generalization .
By portraying sites such as Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth as terrorist recruitment organizations , the Department of Homeland Security has taken a dangerous step towards punishing anyone who questions the government .
If you go to the A&E Website , you will see that it is a group of “ 212 architectural and engineering professionals and 518 other supporters including A/E students who have joined ... in demanding of Congress a truly independent investigation of the collapse of the WTC buildings . ”
Their mission statement is , “ To research and to disseminate the truth of the 9/11 “ collapses ” of all 3 WTC high - rise buildings to every architect and engineer . ”
I cannot find any indication that this site promotes terrorism , much less recruits terrorists for the Taliban , yet the Department of Homeland Security has taken the stance that the site is “ intended to recruit or inflame the emotions ” ( Weitzman , M. ) , and lumps it in with sites disseminating the Taliban Training Manual , and advocating suicide bombings .
Rita Katz , director of the SITE Institute - The Search for International Terrorist Entities went on to blame the Internet for Bush Jr. ’s failed “ war on terror , ” and Representative Charles Dent stated that one possible way to help fight purported Internet terrorism would be to “ turn the Internet into a less reliable source of information ” by putting up phony Websites to collect information on terrorists as well as disseminate false information .
Parry Aftab , Executive Director of Wiredsafety.org , also suggested that the government should collect IP addresses of suspected terrorist Websites to aid in the fight against terror on the Internet .
Websites such as Architects for 9/11 Truth for instance ?
If all Websites that disagree with the official government explanation of the collapse of the WTC towers is placed on a list of suspected terrorist Websites , what is next ?
Like Bush Jr. stated : “ either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . ”
Two novels about America ’s future : writers need a new perspective
By Sandy English
1 August 2007
The Road by Cormac McCarthy , New York : Random House , 2006 , 287 pp .
The Pesthouse by Jim Crace , New York : Doubleday , 2007 , 255 pp .
These two recent novels , different in quality , attitude and impact , both depict a bleak and miserable fictional future for the United States in which human relations have become thoroughly degraded .
The imagining of the future has been a critical component of modern fiction .
Generally speaking , nineteenth century novels looked to the future with hope and anticipation .
The explosive growth of the productive forces , including astonishing scientific and technical advances , fueled such sentiments .
The emergence of a mass socialist culture in Europe , and to some extent the US , played no small part in that .
In any event , society seemed to have a promising future , even if its social relations had to be drastically rearranged .
William Morris ’s News From Nowhere ( 1890 ) and Edward Bellamy ’s Looking Backward ( 1888 ) , for example , looked forward to a society free of exploitation in which human beings lived in solidarity with each other and shared the wealth they produced .
These were socially critical works .
They were intended to expose the iniquities of the capitalist system and posit something better , explicitly — through reform ( Looking Backward ) or revolution ( News from Nowhere ) — or implicitly — ( e.g. , William Dean Howells ’s searing 1894 critique of American society , A Traveler from Altruria ) [ 1 ] .
The twentieth century found these themes more problematic .
The first attempts to fashion an international socialist society encountered difficulties , suffered setbacks and ushered in an enormously confusing period .
Speculative fiction could not escape the impact of these difficulties , at the center of which was the degeneration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a dictatorial bureaucracy that claimed to represent ‘ communism . ’
Such work in the middle of the twentieth century and beyond often told readers that social change was futile and that social evolution ( or revolution ) would lead in a totalitarian direction .
One thinks of Aldous Huxley ’s Brave New World ( 1932 ) and George Orwell ’s 1984 ( 1949 ) , although the latter had many legitimate things to say about Stalinism .
After the experience of the war and the Holocaust , American authors in particular produced many bleak and uninspiring images of the future , in works ranging from Ray Bradbury ’s Fahrenheit 451 ( 1953 ) to Kurt Vonnegut ’s novels .
In the last 25 years or so , a new generation has anticipated the future .
The science fiction genre of cyberpunk , for example , has posited a United States ( or former United States ) openly controlled by all - powerful corporations and invested with a high degree of computer technology .
The Canadian writer Margaret Atwood has written two dystopias .
The first , The Handmaid ’s Tale ( 1985 ) , was artistically successful and to some extent socially subversive .
A later work , Oryx and Crake ( 2003 ) , had much less to say on both counts .
However , dystopian writing for many years did not completely abandon the socially critical element that was present in the earlier , positive views of the future .
It often served to warn of dangers ahead , and a thematic staple was often organized opposition to the conditions of existence .
Still , that is not saying all that much .
The hobbled future , with a passive population and the fruitless revolt of a few , reflected a narrow and impoverished view of social development .
The two recent works under review have taken matters a step further : they have almost completely dispensed with opposition to the horrors of the future , and , in different ways , wallow in hopelessness that seems at odds with life today .
Cormac McCarthy ’s
The Road won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize and has achieved a certain degree of popularity after television talk - show host Oprah Winfrey selected the work for her book club .
The Road takes place in the near future , probably in the southeastern United States .
A man and his young son ( they are never named ) travel across a lifeless world ten years after a nuclear holocaust .
Everything is covered in ash .
Forests are scorched , and there is no animal life aside from humans .
The man and boy scrounge for canned goods and drops of gasoline .
They hide from gangs of marauders to avoid being raped , killed and eaten .
The book is filled with scenes of hunger , filth , blood and sorrow .
Scarcely any interactions with other human beings are free from terror .
In the cellar of one house , humans are slowly being eaten limb by limb .
In a long scene , the father holds a gun on a man before he kills the latter in front of his son .
Even the flashbacks to the man ’s past are grim .
In one , his wife ( the boy ’s mother ) argues for suicide and against the cruelty of his asking her to live .
She kills herself .
There are no memories of the political crisis that must have led up to the nuclear war .
Nor is there a notion of what the man might have done for a living , what friends he had ( although he tells the boy he once had many friends ) , how he spent his time and if he enjoyed life .
The book is so heavy - handed in this respect as to be implausible .
As far as possible , McCarthy has expunged history and society from this future .
One does feel the father ’s strong survival instinct .
He stays alive because he loves his son .
McCarthy , in an interview with Oprah Winfrey , attributed this partly to his own recent entry into fatherhood .
Critics have focused on this aspect of the novel , but it really seems to miss the point .
What about the larger issues ?
Even under such horrific circumstances , would no echo of a planet of billions of people and a culture of thousands of years remain ?
McCarthy once notes that the boy and the man have books .
However , he says little about what they contain , or how they might have affected the two .
The Road lacks — in fact , it deliberately excises — the full and rich context of humanity , even in disaster .
This sort of family - oriented individualism is popular among right - wing survivalists : outside the emotional fortress of the family unit , society is a suspect and hostile entity .
The father tells the son that they are the ‘ good guys . ’
This is something one might reassure a child with , but McCarthy is also saying it to the readers , and it does nothing to elevate the moral stature of the novel ; it only helps create a contrived and uninteresting ending .
McCarthy has a low estimation of human culture in the present and in the past , as he has frequently shown in other works .
Much of his writing is bloody - minded and most of the time , he creates worlds where fear is pervasive .
Blood Meridian ( 1984 ) is widely considered by critics to be McCarthy ’s best work , and by many , a masterpiece of American literature .
It is the author ’s version of the history of the Glanton gang , which , in the years after the Mexican - American War , rode across northern Mexico hiring itself out as a mercenary band and committing atrocities , usually against the native peoples of the region .
McCarthy has recreated this genocide without any attention to the contradictory and inevitably human emotions of the Glanton mercenaries .
There are few fully fleshed - out human beings in the work , only victims , perpetrators and colorless bystanders .
The westward expansion of the United States , the tensions that would lead to a Civil War involving democratic principles a few years later — in other words , the complexities of history — do not figure into Blood Meridian .
There are times in this work when his descriptions have a kind of archaic beauty and his talent can affect us at tragic moments .
Sometimes the reader becomes angry at various inhumanities , but overall he or she grows inured to the loss of life amid the endless sadism .
In The Road , it seems that McCarthy has projected , rather pointlessly , this shadow of overwhelming evil , mystical and ahistorical , into the future .
Jim Crace is a British author , younger than McCarthy , and has written eight novels .
His best known , Being Dead ( 1998 ) , a somewhat morbid look at the lives of two murdered zoologists , won the US National Book Critics Circle Award in 2000 .
There is certainly a compassionate touch to this work , which describes the scientists ’ lives from their student days until their marriages , the oddities of their personalities , their secrets and their hopes .
Nevertheless , Crace adds a good deal of unnecessary baggage to the novel .
It returns regularly to the objective state of decay of the two bodies .
Why is this necessary ?
Although the novel is intelligently done , one wonders more than once why it was written .
One asks the same question about Crace ’s dystopia , The Pesthouse .
Several generations in the future , America is recovering from some sort of catastrophe .
Given the ruined highways and shells of machines and cities , it seems likely that a nuclear war has been fought .
Society has been pushed back to a medieval level .
People are illiterate farmers .
Life is hard , and there is an emigration to the East Coast where people hope to board boats bound for a promised land , presumably in Europe .
We encounter a sturdy young man , Franklin , who meets an attractive young woman , Margaret .
She has had a disease and been left by her family to recover or to die in a hut known as the pesthouse .
Early in the novel , her community is destroyed .
After Franklin has helped her back to health , the two of them set off east .
The journey is arduous .
The people they encounter are sometimes robbers and sometimes good companions .
There is a general sense of want and poverty .
People have few possessions and these are always in danger of being stolen .
There is constant loss .
Franklin is captured and enslaved .
Margaret finds safety in a religious commune run by descendents of the Baptists who eschew metal , considered the root of all evil .
The general atmosphere is one of superstition and ignorance .
Franklin escapes from his captors , reunites with Margaret , and the two of them continue on to the coast where men functioning at a slightly higher technological level offer passage by boat only to a few .
Franklin and Margaret return to the pesthouse and start a new life .
Franklin and Margaret are not contradictory or complex characters .
For no apparent reason , their love affair takes the entire novel to bloom .
At the end of the book the two tell themselves they can finally be free , but freedom had not been a goal of theirs nor did anyone else seem to be looking for it .
In fact , the reasons for the eastward migration in the book — aside from the fact that it is a reversal of the historical expansion of the United States — are unclear .
This lack of motivation co-exists with frequently awkward or stereotyped images : “ Flapping his arms like a girl , ” for example , does not tell us much .
Nor do Franklin and Margaret really seem to come from a society with a class structure , customs or a culture .
Crace does describe an “ old American ” custom of respecting one ’s elders (? ) , but it seems to come out of nowhere and it only highlights his general failure at creating a plausible world in which these two people have grown up .
In addition , what does this world have to do with the America that has been destroyed by war generations earlier ?
This hidden history that must be known to the author does not seem particularly worked out .
How would American society appear a century after a devastating catastrophe ?
This is a complex and rich problem for the novelist , but Crace does not attempt a plausible or serious answer in The Pesthouse .
Yet , that is not even the main question .
If Crace , like McCarthy , were more attentive as to the laws of social development , more attuned to the moods of the population , would he forecast so light - mindedly nuclear war , savagery and ignorance in the coming decade or century ?
The problems concerning the future in The Pesthouse and The Road stem from the difficulties many writers have in making sense of the contemporary world .
It is hardly a secret that the image of the future in fiction , utopian or dystopian , reflects the author ’s view of contemporary hopes and fears .
Whose fears are these ?
What section of the population is cowering in a corner expecting a return to the Middle Ages or worse ?
The two books seem at aesthetic loose ends .
Their characters ’ motivations are largely undeveloped or banal .
“ We ’re carrying the flame , ” the father tells the son in The Road , and , “ We go .
We carry on .
That ’s what we have to do , ” Margaret says at a moment of crisis in The Pesthouse .
There is something artistically lazy here .
In these works , we witness a cultural phenomenon : dystopia , the literary form born of discouragement in great social causes , has reached a nadir of unreality , a sort of aesthetic breakdown .
Crace and McCarthy have the right to be pessimistic , or to posture along those lines .
However , we have the right to call their works out - of - step , tiresome and empty , and draw the conclusion that writers need a new perspective .

WASHINGTON
It ’s a lost art , slinking away .
Now the fashion is slinking back .
Nobody wants to simply admit they made a mistake and disappear for awhile .
Nobody even wants to use the weasel words : “ Mistakes were made . ”
No , far better to pop right back up and get in the face of those who were savoring your absence .
We should think of a name for this appalling modern phenomenon .
Kissingering , perhaps .
In Las Vegas , there ’s the loathsome O.J. , a proper candidate for shunning and stun- gunning , barging back into the picture .
And on Capitol Hill , Larry Craig shocked mortified Republicans by bounding into their weekly lunch .
You ’d think the conservative 62 - year - old Idaho senator would have some shame , going from fervently opposing gay rights to provocatively tapping his toe in a Minneapolis airport toilet .
( The toilet stall , now known as the Larry Craig bathroom , has become a hot local tourist attraction . )
But no .
As though Republicans do n’t have enough problems , Mr. Craig said he is ready to go back to work while the legal hotshots he hired appeal his case .
He even cast a couple votes , one against D.C. voting rights .
( This creep gets to decide about my representation ? )

With the release last week of the feature list for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard , the security world is buzzing about some extremely important updates that should , if they work as expected , significantly improve Mac security and will make me less nervous about connecting to wireless networks in Internet cafes .
Time Machine —
Before we dig into Leopard ’s advanced anti-exploitation technologies , we need to start with the biggest security feature that ’s not listed with the rest : Time Machine .
Information security is based on the principles of CIA .
No , not the Central Intelligence Agency or the Culinary Institute of America .
In the security world , CIA stands for Confidentiality , Integrity , and Availability .
While we tend to focus on keeping people from seeing things we do n’t want them to see ( confidentiality ) and changing things we do n’t want changed ( integrity ) , having our data and systems available to us is just as important .
With Time Machine making it easier to back up for all users , especially individuals not already protected by some corporate backup system , Apple is doing more to improve security than any upgrades to firewalls or Safari ever could .
If you want to improve your security , I highly recommend you get an external hard drive with your copy of Leopard ( Adam tells me that “ Take Control of Customizing Leopard ” will offer basic help for Time Machine , and a future edition of “ Take Control of Mac OS X Backups ” will provide even more detail ) .
My backups have saved me three times already this year , and I ’m excited that I can finally make backups more accessible to my mother and sister .
Stopping Buffer Overflows —
The most significant security update in Leopard is one that you ’ll never notice , but that will cause the bad guys no end of frustration .
It ’s an anti-exploitation technology Apple calls Library Randomization ( also known generically as Memory Randomization and as Address Space Layout Randomization in Windows Vista ) .
To understand Library Randomization we need to take talk about vulnerabilities , exploits , and buffer overflows .
Buffer overflows are the class of vulnerability that are responsible for most of the successful attacks on computers today .
Most malicious programs ( worms and viruses ) rely on buffer overflows to take control of your system .
In security , we define a vulnerability as a flaw or defect that could allow someone to violate confidentiality , integrity , or availability .
Think of it as a weak lock or a broken window the bad guy can use to get in .
Buffer overflows are a vulnerability where an attack enters more data into an input than expected ; if the programmer who wrote the software forgot to limit that input field , the data can flow past the expected limit and overwrite other parts of memory .
Since memory on most of our computers is just a big stack of commands mixed with data , if you know exactly how much extra data to put in , you can trick the computer into running an arbitrary command by overwriting a spot where it expects a legitimate instruction with your new instruction .
You might be asking yourself why programmers do n’t just cap any program input to prevent buffer overflows .
Why not just limit all those fields so this ca n’t happen ?
I often ask myself the same question , but modern computing systems are so complex , with so much reused code , that it is n’t that simple .
For example , the iPhone 1.1.1 software was cracked because it used some common code ( the libtiff library ) for reading TIFF image files .
That code had a buffer overflow vulnerability in it , allowing hackers to create special TIFF files that let them take over the iPhone .
This is what we call an exploit – when you can take advantage of a vulnerability and actually do something with it .
As an aside , buffer overflows first appeared around 1988 and were used in the very first Internet worm – the Morris worm .
In 1996 an exceptional paper was published detailing how to exploit buffer overflows .
This is where Library Randomization comes in .
Pushing those bad commands onto the stack is more complex than saying , “ Open sesame ! ” .
The attacker is attempting to subvert the guts of the operating system and has to play around with memory directly and point to different instructions in different parts of memory to get the computer to fail in a useful way .
Until recently , most operating systems stored their own internal commands in known , static locations in memory .
Thus the attacker could just point to those commands with his malicious instructions , and use the tools of the operating system itself to take over .
Library Randomization randomly distributes those commands throughout memory every time the operating system loads .
Thus , even if an attacker finds a buffer overflow vulnerability and pushes his commands onto your system , it ’s extremely difficult for him to turn that into a working exploit .
That ’s why we call Library Randomization an anti-exploitation technology – even when the bad guys find vulnerabilities ( and they will ) it will be much harder for them to exploit your system .
This is a big move , since instead of relying on programmers to write perfect code , Apple – following the lead of Microsoft and some Unix / Linux variants – is hardening the operating system to make exploitation itself more difficult .
Apple actually started down this road with Mac OS X 10.4.7 when they enabled Data Execution Protection , a feature available on some processors to let programmers mark memory locations as data only , limiting the ability of an attacker to push a command in .
I ’m sure security researchers will eventually figure out a way around it , but early signs from other operating systems indicate that Library Randomization is a serious obstacle for an entire class of attacks .
I ’ve spent a lot of time on Library Randomization because , following Time Machine , it ’s probably the most significant security update in Leopard , but those two are far from the only improvements .
Identifying and Defanging Evil Apps —
As firewalls become more ubiquitous it ’s becoming harder for bad guys to attack computers directly over the network .
Many are switching over to what we call client - side exploits – getting malicious code onto your system via malicious email , Web pages , and file downloads .
While Apple can’t prevent people from downloading dangerous stuff , Leopard has a new feature to tag downloaded applications as coming off the Internet .
The first time you run a downloaded application , your Mac will ask you to approve it and tell you when it was downloaded , what application downloaded it , and where it came from .
This is another great feature that should help limit malicious software from downloading and executing programs without your knowledge .
The one potential weakness I see is this warning could be used to trick you into visiting a malicious Web site , and I hope Apple is taking that into account .
Apple has also added application signing .
Apple , and any developer that wants to participate , can affix a digital signature to their applications .
Digital signatures are valuable because they certify both where an application came from and , more importantly , that it has n’t been modified .
If a bad guy tries to subvert a signed application on your system , the modified application will no longer match its signature , and Mac OS X wo n’t allow it to launch .
Leopard ’s next important feature is “ sandboxing . ”
Sandboxing is a technique of restricting specific applications so they can’t perform certain kinds of actions , like limiting the files they can touch , the other applications with which they can communicate , or what they can do on the network .
Some applications will always be at a higher risk than others for compromise , and sandboxing helps prevent those applications from being used to take over other parts of your system .
The Leopard Web site lists Bonjour , Spotlight , and Quick Look as being sandboxed .
This is interesting because those are all services that look at arbitrary files or network packets , making them more vulnerable to a popular type of attack called fuzzing , where the attacker plays with input ( like files and network packets ) using automatic tools , looking for a data stream that will choke the recipient service .
The infamous Wi-Fi hack ( see the TidBITS series “ To the Maynor Born : Cache and Crash “ ) was discovered using fuzzing , as were most of the bugs in the Month of Apple Bugs ( see “ MoAB Is My Washpot , ” 2007 -02 -19 ) .
I ’ll be curious to see the entire list of sandboxed applications , and if Safari and QuickTime are included since they are also exposed to this type of attack .
Other Notable Improvements —
While perhaps not as significant as the updates we ’ve already talked about , Leopard also includes a bunch of other security improvements .
The Mac OS X firewall , based on the open source ipfw program , has been improved and now includes the capability to block network access to individual applications .
I ’ve heard rumors that Apple ’s default firewall rules are no longer user accessible , which would be a major step backwards , but letting the firewall control individual applications is a long - desired feature for us security geeks .
The Keychain has been enhanced to manage multiple user certificates for email encryption and digital signatures better , which will be welcome for those of us with multiple email accounts .
Encrypted disk images now use 256 - bit keys instead of 128 - bit keys ( much more than twice as strong ) , and although I do n’t know anyone who can break a 128 - bit key , thanks to the way AES functions , performance should be essentially unaffected .
A few changes help improve compatibility for those of us using Macs in corporate environments .
Native VPN support has been updated , and Windows SMB packet signing is now available , to provide compatibility with encrypting Windows file servers .
Apple also enhanced file sharing with more granular access control lists , enabling more control over who can access your shared files .
( Glenn Fleishman ’s “ Take Control of Sharing Files in Leopard ” has all the details there . )
While useful in any environment , I suspect some of these improvements were added to help with sharing in corporate environments and to complement the access controls in Windows environments .
Apple hid a few security features in other parts of the Leopard .
One I ’m really looking forward to is the guest account that purges itself entirely after the guest user logs out ( for details , check out Kirk McElhearn ’s “ Take Control of Users & Accounts in Leopard “ ) .
While I do n’t let many people touch my MacBook Pro , there are occasions when I want to allow temporary access so someone can copy a file from me , check email or look something up online .
A temporary guest account is a great way to enable this safely and without leaving even a trace on my Mac afterwards .
We ’ll also now get to see the encryption status of wireless networks right from the menu bar , so you can avoid even bothering to connect to protected networks .
Those of you with kids gain improved parental controls that include Web filters , activity monitoring , and even a built - in filter for Wikipedia .
Finally , with the inclusion of DTrace and a new instrumentation interface , we security geeks can really dig into the system internals and see what ’s going on .
I expect to see more than a few security tools that take advantage of this capability .
One open question I ’ll be checking the moment my copy of Leopard arrives is whether Input Managers are still part of Leopard .
Input Managers are a valuable feature to enhance applications , but they are also unfortunately a serious security risk ( see Matt Neuburg ’s discussion of this in “ Are Input Managers the Work of the Devil ? , ” 2006 -02-20 ) .
Apple has hinted that Input Managers might be restricted in Leopard , and despite the cries from some in the development community , I believe Input Managers need to be changed to improve our security or eliminated altogether .
Overall , Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard is perhaps the most significant update in the history of Mac OS X – perhaps in the history of Apple – from a security standpoint .
It marks a shift from basing Macintosh security on hard outside walls to building more resiliency and survivability into the core operating system .
We still need to see how these features hold up once security researchers get their hands on them , but the security future looks promising and I ’ll sleep better at night knowing my mother can still safely bank online .
